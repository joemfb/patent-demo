<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, in active-matrix flat-panel displays (FPD) such as liquid crystal displays or organic EL displays, thin-film semiconductor devices for display (hereafter simply referred to as a &#x201c;thin-film semiconductor device&#x201d;) also referred to as thin-film transistors (TFT) have been used for driving pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among the displays, the organic EL displays are current-driven devices unlike voltage-driven liquid crystal displays. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for developing a thin-film semiconductor device having excellent on-off characteristics as a driving circuit in an active matrix display device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, as a thin-film semiconductor device for the driving circuit in the liquid crystal display, a thin-film semiconductor device using a single-layer non-crystalline semiconductor layer (amorphous semiconductor layer) such as amorphous silicon as a channel layer has been used. This type of thin-film semiconductor device has a large band gap, and thus the off-state current is low. However, there is a problem that the on-state current is low as well due to low mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is another thin-film semiconductor device for the driving circuit in the liquid crystal display, in which a single-layer polycrystalline semiconductor layer has been used as the channel layer. This type of thin-film semiconductor device has high mobility of carriers and thus has a large on-state current, contrary to the thin-film semiconductor device using the single-layer non-crystalline semiconductor layer as the channel layer. However, there is a problem that the off-state current is also high due to the high carrier mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of these problems, in the driving circuit of the organic EL display, a thin-film semiconductor device in which a two-layered structure including a first channel layer made of polycrystalline semiconductor layer and a second channel layer made of a non-crystalline semiconductor layer has been developed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The patent literature 1 discloses a method for forming the polycrystalline semiconductor layer. The method for forming the polycrystalline semiconductor layer disclosed in the patent literature 1 features crystallizing an amorphous silicon film by annealing a substrate on which the amorphous silicon film is formed at a temperature in a range from 800&#xb0; C. to 1000&#xb0; C.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described above, in the conventional method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device using the single-layer non-crystalline semiconductor layer as the channel layer, there is no high-temperature process. Accordingly, the maximum processing temperature falls within approximately 350&#xb0; C. at a maximum.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In contrast, in the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device including the polycrystalline semiconductor layer as the channel layer, a process for crystallizing the amorphous silicon film by annealing is necessary. A high temperature treatment at a temperature in a range higher than or equal to 700&#xb0; C. is necessary for the annealing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to the results of the experiment conducted by the inventors, where the thin-film semiconductor device including the polysilicon layer as the channel layer was fabricated using molybdenum as the material for the gate electrode and annealing the non-crystalline silicon layer for crystallization at a temperature in a range from 700&#xb0; C. to 1400&#xb0; C. using a continuous wave laser, multiple circular flake-offs in various sizes were generated on the gate electrode, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> is a microscopic image of the flake-offs on the gate electrode captured by an optical microscope in a top view of the thin-film semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, multiple circular flake-offs <b>301</b> on the gate electrode <b>300</b> were observed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> is a cross-sectional SEM image capturing a flake-off around the gate electrode in a cross-sectional view of the thin-film semiconductor device in this case. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, a gap <b>302</b> was observed in the gate electrode <b>300</b> made of molybdenum tungsten on the undercoat layer <b>200</b> which is a silicon nitride film. With this, part of the gate insulating film <b>400</b> and the polycrystalline semiconductor layer <b>500</b> above the gate electrode <b>300</b> flakes off. As described above, in the bottom-gate thin-film semiconductor device, when a high-temperature annealing is present after the gate electrode is formed, there is a case in which circular flake-off appears on the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If the thin-film semiconductor device having the flake-off is used as a thin-film transistor, even if a predetermined voltage is applied to the gate electrode, the part with the flake-off does not function as the gate electrode. Consequently, the desired characteristics of the thin-film transistor cannot be achieved, and the function as the thin-film transistor is significantly degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described above, there is a problem in the thin-film semiconductor device including the polysilicon layer as the channel layer. The problem is that using molybdenum as the gate electrode causes flake-offs on the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one general aspect, the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device for display disclosed here feature a method for fabricating a thin-film semiconductor device for display, the method including: preparing a glass substrate; forming, above the glass substrate, an undercoat layer for inhibiting diffusion of an impurity in the glass substrate, the undercoat layer including a nitride film; forming a metal layer including molybdenum above the undercoat layer; forming a gate electrode from the metal layer by a predetermined etching process; forming a gate insulating film above the gate electrode; forming a non-crystalline silicon layer above the gate insulating film; forming a polysilicon layer by annealing the non-crystalline silicon layer at a temperature in a range from 700&#xb0; C. to 1400&#xb0; C., the non-crystalline silicon layer being crystallized by the annealing; forming a source electrode and a drain electrode above the polysilicon layer; and performing hydrogen plasma treatment at least once at a stage after the metal layer is formed and before the polysilicon layer is formed, the hydrogen plasma treatment being performed toward at least a region in the undercoat layer on which the gate electrode is formed, in which a radio frequency power when performing the hydrogen plasma treatment is in a range from 0.098 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 0.262 W/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With this, it is possible to reduce the concentration of oxygen present in the proximity of the interface between the undercoat layer and the gate electrode or in the proximity of the interface between the undercoat layer and the metal layer. Accordingly, even if molybdenum is included in the material composing the gate electrode, it is possible to inhibit the generation of molybdenum oxide. Therefore, even is annealing at a high temperature in a range from 700&#xb0; C. to 1400&#xb0; C. is performed, it is possible to inhibit the generation of the flake-offs on the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, the undercoat layer has a thickness of at least 100 nm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With this, the undercoat layer can effectively inhibit the diffusion of sodium.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, the undercoat layer has a thickness of at least 400 nm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With this, it is possible to form a highly reliable undercoat layer without cracks.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, a concentration of oxygen atoms in the undercoat layer is in a range from 1&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With this, oxygen atoms contained in the undercoat layer are diffused to a barrier layer, reducing the concentration of the oxygen atoms contained in the undercoat layer.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, when performing the hydrogen plasma treatment, a processing time using the radio frequency power is in a range from 15 seconds to 60 seconds, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed toward an interface between the undercoat layer and the gate electrode, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With this, it is possible to perform hydrogen plasma treatment on the interface between the undercoat layer and the gate electrode after patterning.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, the hydrogen plasma treatment is treatment for reducing a concentration of oxygen in proximity of the interface between the undercoat layer and the gate electrode, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With this, it is possible to reduce the concentration of oxygen in the proximity of the interface between the undercoat layer and the gate electrode, and thus it is possible to inhibit the generation of molybdenum oxide. Therefore, even if annealing at a high temperature is performed, it is possible to inhibit the generation of the flake-offs on the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, the impurity in the glass substrate is sodium or phosphorus, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With this, the undercoat layer inhibits impurity such as sodium or phosphorus contained in the glass substrate from entering the silicon layer.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, the glass substrate contains oxygen atoms as a major component, the undercoat layer has a force for bonding with oxygen atoms that is weaker than the glass substrate, and the molybdenum has a force for bonding with oxygen atoms that is weaker than the glass substrate and stronger than the undercoat layer, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Consequently, molybdenum is more likely to be oxidized than the undercoat layer; the hydrogen plasma treatment can inhibit the oxidation of molybdenum.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, forming a second non-crystalline silicon layer above the polysilicon layer between forming the polysilicon layer and forming the source electrode and drain electrode is included, in which the source electrode and the drain electrode are formed above the second non-crystalline silicon layer, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">With this, it is possible to form the non-crystalline silicon layer between (i) the polysilicon layer and (ii) the source electrode or the drain electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, the polysilicon layer includes a microcrystalline silicon layer having an average grain size in a range from 20 nm to 200 nm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Since the polysilicon layer is the microcrystalline silicon layer having the average grain size in a range from 20 nm to 200 nm, the carrier mobility is higher than an amorphous semiconductor. Accordingly, a thin-film semiconductor device having better on-characteristics can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed between forming the gate electrode and forming the gate insulating film, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">After the etching for forming the gate electrode, the concentration of oxygen at the interface of the gate electrode is high, and there is no process involving oxygen in a period after the gate electrode forming process and before the gate insulating film forming process since there is no cleaning process. Accordingly, by performing the hydrogen plasma treatment at this stage, the gate electrode is covered by the gate insulating film, at a low concentration of oxygen. Thus, the annealing at a high temperature in a range from 700&#xb0; C. to 1400&#xb0; C. can be performed in a state where there is the smallest amount of oxygen at the interface between the undercoat layer and the gate electrode. This aspect can reduce the oxygen concentration at the interface of the gate electrode most effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed between forming the gate insulating film and forming the non-crystalline silicon layer, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">With this, the gate electrode has already been covered with the gate insulating film at the time of hydrogen plasma treatment. Accordingly, it is possible to inhibit oxygen entering the interface between the gate electrode and the undercoat layer again after this stage.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed between forming the non-crystalline silicon layer and forming the polysilicon layer, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">With this, the gate electrode has already been covered with the gate insulating film and the non-crystalline silicon layer at the time of hydrogen plasma treatment. Accordingly, it is possible to inhibit oxygen from entering the interface between the gate electrode and the undercoat layer again after this stage. Furthermore, the hydrogen plasma treatment can be performed immediately before the annealing. Accordingly, it is possible to effectively reduce the concentration of oxygen at the interface of the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an aspect of the method for fabricating thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment, the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed between forming the metal layer and forming the gate electrode, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Even if the gate electrode is still in the form of the metal layer before patterning, the concentration of oxygen at the interface between the gate metal layer and the undercoat layer is reduced. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the concentration of oxygen at the interface between the undercoat layer and the gate electrode to be formed afterward.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, when forming the polysilicon layer, the non-crystalline silicon layer is annealed using a continuous wave laser, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Since the laser annealing using the continuous wave laser has longer heat input time than the pulse laser, the temperature at the interface between the gate electrode and the undercoat layer becomes higher, making the flake-offs more likely to be generated. Accordingly, the present disclosure is particularly effective when the non-crystalline silicon layer is crystallized using the continuous wave laser.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The following shall describe the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the present disclosure with reference to the embodiments.</p>

<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(Configuration of Thin-Film Semiconductor Device for Display)</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">First, a thin-film semiconductor device for display according to embodiments shall be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically illustrating a thin-film semiconductor device for display according to embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the thin-film semiconductor device for display <b>10</b> according to the embodiments is a bottom-gate thin-film transistor device, and includes a glass substrate <b>1</b>, and the following layers sequentially formed above the glass substrate <b>1</b>; an undercoat layer <b>2</b>, a gate electrode <b>3</b>, a gate insulating film <b>4</b>, a polycrystalline semiconductor layer <b>5</b>, a non-crystalline semiconductor layer <b>6</b>, a pair of contact layers <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, and a source electrode <b>8</b><i>a </i>and a drain electrode <b>8</b><i>b</i>, which constitutes a pair.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The glass substrate <b>1</b> is composed of a glass material such as quartz glass, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As the material for the undercoat layer <b>2</b>, a nitride film such as silicon nitride (SiN) may be used, for example.

In this embodiment, the polycrystalline semiconductor layer <b>5</b> is used as a channel layer. Accordingly, silicon dioxide is used as the gate insulating film <b>4</b>, for example. The reason for this is that it is preferable to have good interface state between the gate insulating film <b>4</b> and the channel layer for maintaining excellent threshold voltage characteristics of the TFT, and silicon dioxide is suitable for this purpose.

The polycrystalline semiconductor layer <b>5</b> is a crystallized silicon layer formed by crystallizing amorphous silicon, and has microcrystalline structure referred to as micro crystals.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The non-crystalline semiconductor layer <b>6</b> is a second channel layer formed on the polycrystalline semiconductor layer <b>5</b>, and is composed of a non-crystalline silicon layer such as an amorphous silicon layer, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Next, actions and effects in the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment 1 shall be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram for describing a cause of flake-off in the thin-film semiconductor device for display.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">As described above, in the conventional thin-film semiconductor device for display, the non-crystalline semiconductor layer is crystallized by annealing the non-crystalline semiconductor layer (non-crystalline silicon layer) using the CW laser for forming the polycrystalline semiconductor layer (polysilicon layer) at a temperature in a range from 700&#xb0; C. to 1400&#xb0; C. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, there is a problem that the annealing causes flake-offs in various sizes on the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">After diligent consideration on the mechanism of the problem, the inventors found out that the problem is caused for the following reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">First, there is a case in which molybdenum oxide (MoO<sub>3</sub>) is formed when molybdenum is used as the material for the gate electrode, and the inventors found out the problem is caused by molybdenum oxide. More specifically, if molybdenum oxide is formed in the gate electrode, molybdenum oxide sublimes by annealing at a temperature in a range from 700&#xb0; C. to 1400&#xb0; C. and turn into gas. This is because molybdenum oxide has a melting point of approximately 800&#xb0; C. and has a tendency to sublime. With this, gas is present inside and around the gate electrode, making the film formed on the gate electrode likely to fall off.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">After consideration on the cause of the formation of the molybdenum oxide, the inventors found out that the undercoat layer present under the gate electrode is the cause. The following shall specifically describe the cause.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The undercoat layer is formed for inhibiting the negative influence of the glass board, which is the substrate, on the thin-film semiconductor device. More specifically, impurities such as sodium or phosphorus are included in the forming process of the glass board itself. However, if the impurities such as sodium or phosphorus enter the semiconductor layer in the channel layer, the impurities function as electric charges, causing leakage current and a shift of threshold voltage to a negative side. The undercoat layer is formed to block the impurities in the glass board entering the semiconductor layer. As the undercoat layer, a nitride film such as silicon nitride is usually used for blocking the entering impurity more effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The inventors found out that, when a gate electrode containing molybdenum is directly formed on the silicon nitride film, a layer rich in oxygen having a high oxygen content rate is formed on the surface of the silicon nitride film in any process for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device. Stated differently, as illustrated in (a) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is assumed that the layer rich in oxygen containing more oxygen atoms <b>600</b> than another region exists in the proximity of the undercoat layer <b>200</b> which is the nitride film, that is, in an upper layer of the undercoat layer <b>200</b> or between the undercoat layer <b>200</b> and the gate electrode <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In terms of the force for bonding with the oxygen atoms, molybdenum has a bonding force for bonding with oxygen atoms greater than the nitride film. Accordingly, the oxygen atoms below the gate electrode <b>300</b> among the oxygen atoms <b>600</b> present in the proximity of the surface of the undercoat layer <b>200</b> which is a nitride film are diffused toward the gate electrode <b>300</b> containing molybdenum, as illustrated in (b) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">With this, as illustrated in (c) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the diffused oxygen atoms <b>600</b> are combined with molybdenum of the gate electrode <b>300</b>, forming molybdenum oxide <b>360</b>. Note that, the nitride film has a smaller force for bonding with the oxygen atoms than the glass substrate. In addition, although molybdenum has a weaker bonding force with the oxygen atoms than the glass substrate, molybdenum has a larger bonding force with the oxygen atoms than the nitride film.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">As described above, the bonding force with the oxygen atoms is higher in molybdenum than in the nitride film. Accordingly, molybdenum is more likely to be oxidized than the nitride film, and thus molybdenum oxide <b>360</b> is formed by the diffused oxygen atoms <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In this state, in order to crystallize the non-crystalline semiconductor layer, annealing at a temperature in a range from 700&#xb0; C. to 1400&#xb0; C. is performed. Here, as illustrated in (d) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the molybdenum oxide <b>360</b> sublimes and turns into gas. Accordingly, gas <b>361</b> is present inside and around the gate electrode <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Subsequently, as illustrated in (e) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the gas <b>361</b> is released from inside the gate electrode <b>300</b>, the gate insulating film <b>400</b> and the polycrystalline semiconductor layer <b>500</b> above the gate electrode <b>300</b> flake off.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">More specifically, since the CW laser has a longer heat input time than the pulse laser, when annealing the non-crystalline semiconductor layer for crystallization using the CW laser, the temperature at the interface between the undercoat layer <b>200</b> and the gate electrode <b>300</b> increases, causing the flake-offs to be more likely generated.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The present disclosure has been conceived in order to solve the problem, and according to the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device for display <b>10</b> according to the embodiment 1, the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed before annealing the non-crystalline semiconductor layer. With this, oxygen in the proximity of inside and outside of the oxidized gate electrode <b>3</b> and in the atmosphere can be removed. With this, it is possible to reduce the concentration of oxygen present in the proximity of the interface between the undercoat layer <b>2</b> and the gate electrode <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Accordingly, even when molybdenum having a greater bonding force with oxygen atoms than the undercoat layer <b>2</b> is used as the material for the gate electrode <b>3</b>, it is possible to make the oxidization of molybdenum caused by the oxygen layer present in the proximity of the interface between the undercoat layer <b>2</b> and the gate electrode <b>3</b> less likely to be occurred. Furthermore, in this state, even if the gate insulating film <b>4</b> and the non-crystalline semiconductor layer <b>5</b><i>a </i>are formed on the gate electrode <b>3</b>, and the non-crystalline semiconductor layer <b>5</b><i>a </i>is annealed for crystallization at a predetermined temperature for annealing, the number of oxygen atoms to be bonded with molybdenum inside and around the gate electrode <b>3</b> is small in the first place. Accordingly, oxidation of molybdenum is not promoted, and it is possible to significantly reduce the probability that molybdenum turns into molybdenum oxide which would sublime in the temperature for annealing and turn into gas. As a result, it is possible to inhibit the circular flake-offs on the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Furthermore, in the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device for display <b>10</b> according to the embodiment, the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed between the gate electrode forming process and the gate insulating film forming process. After patterning the gate electrode <b>3</b> by the wet etching, the concentration of oxygen at the interface of the gate electrode <b>3</b> is increased by the cleaning process in the etching. Accordingly, it is effective to perform the hydrogen plasma treatment immediately after the gate electrode <b>3</b> is formed. Furthermore, no process using moisture is necessary in a stage after forming the gate electrode <b>3</b> and before covering the gate electrode <b>3</b> with the gate insulating film <b>4</b>. Accordingly, by performing the hydrogen plasma treatment between the gate electrode forming process and the gate insulating film forming process, it is possible to inhibit the oxygen entering the interface between the undercoat layer <b>2</b> and the gate electrode <b>3</b> again. Therefore, the gate electrode <b>3</b> is covered with the gate insulating film <b>4</b> in a state where the concentration of oxygen in the gate electrode <b>3</b> is significantly low. With this, the non-crystalline semiconductor layer <b>5</b><i>a </i>can be annealed in a state in which there is the smallest amount of oxygen at the interface between the undercoat layer <b>2</b> and the gate electrode <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Furthermore, in a stage between the gate electrode forming process and the gate insulating film forming process, the gate insulating film <b>4</b>, the non-crystalline semiconductor layer <b>5</b><i>a </i>or another layer is not formed above the gate electrode <b>3</b>. With this, it is possible to perform the hydrogen plasma treatment on the interface between the gate electrode <b>3</b> and the undercoat layer <b>2</b> through only one layer, that is, the patterned gate electrode <b>3</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Furthermore, the annealing for crystallizing the non-crystalline semiconductor layer (non-crystalline silicon layer) is performed by the CW laser, and performed such that the temperature of the laser used for irradiating the non-crystalline semiconductor layer is higher than or equal to the melting temperature of non-crystalline silicon (1100&#xb0; C.), and that the laser irradiation time on the non-crystalline semiconductor layer is 0.1 &#x3bc;sec.</p>

<p id="p-0148" num="0147">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the non-crystalline silicon layer is irradiated with a CW laser that is a green laser having a Gaussian light intensity distribution and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 60 &#x3bc;m and a beam scanning speed (stage speed) of 480 mm/s.

<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Next, an experiment for testing the actions and effects of the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment was performed.

<p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates oxygen concentration in the thin-film semiconductor devices fabricated by the fabrication method according to the embodiment and the fabrication method according to a conventional example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph which includes the concentration of oxygen in a thickness (depth) direction from the polycrystalline semiconductor layer to the glass substrate in the thin-film semiconductor device measured by the secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and plotted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the concentration of oxygen illustrated in the solid line is a case in which the thin-film semiconductor device was fabricated using the hydrogen plasma treatment (the present disclosure). The concentration of oxygen illustrated in the dotted line is a case in which the thin-film semiconductor device was fabricated without performing the hydrogen plasma treatment (conventional example). Note that, the hydrogen plasma treatment was performed in a chamber in which the glass substrate above which the gate electrode was formed on the undercoat layer was placed. A radio frequency power for the hydrogen plasma treatment had a power density of 0.262 (W/cm<sup>2</sup>), and the processing time by the radio frequency power was 60 (s). As the materials for the components, the polycrystalline semiconductor layer was made of crystallized amorphous silicon, the gate insulating film was silicon dioxide, the gate electrode was molybdenum tungsten, and the undercoat layer was silicon nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">As illustrated in the area A surrounded by the broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the concentration of oxygen at the interface between the undercoat layer and the gate electrode was 2.7&#xd7;10<sup>21 </sup>(atom/cm<sup>3</sup>) in a conventional example without the hydrogen plasma treatment indicated by the dotted line. However, in the case of the present disclosure in which the hydrogen plasma treatment illustrated in the solid line was performed, the oxygen concentration was 2.1&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>(atom/cm<sup>3</sup>). More specifically, the result shows that, the amount of oxygen at the interface between the undercoat layer and the gate electrode is significantly reduced in the case of the present disclosure in which the hydrogen plasma treatment indicated by the solid line was performed, compared to the conventional example without the hydrogen plasma treatment illustrated in the dotted line.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a relationship between conditions for hydrogen plasma treatment and the number of flake-offs on the gate electrode. The processing conditions for the hydrogen plasma treatment include a case in which the power density of the radio frequency power was 0.098 (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) and a processing time was 15 (s), a case in which the power density was 0.170 (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) and the processing time was 15 (s), a case in which the power density was 0.098 (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) and the processing time was 60 (s), a case in which the power density was 0.170 (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) and the processing time was 60 (s), and the power density was 0.262 (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) and the processing time was 60 (s). Furthermore, in each processing condition, two samples were used. Note that, the case with the power density of 0 (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) and the processing time of 0 (s) is a case in which the hydrogen plasma treatment was not performed. Furthermore, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, &#x201c;ring&#x201d; indicates the number of ring-shaped flake-offs on the gate electrode, and &#x201c;small spot&#x201d;, &#x201c;medium spot&#x201d; and &#x201c;large spot&#x201d; indicate the numbers of small, medium, large spots on the gate electrode, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the hydrogen plasma treatment was performed, the flake-off was barely generated, regardless of the power density or the length of processing time. In contrast, when no hydrogen plasma treatment is performed, countless flake-offs were generated.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Accordingly, from the result of the experiment, by setting the power density of the radio frequency when performing the hydrogen plasma treatment in a range from 0.098 (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) to 0.262 (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) and the processing time by the radio frequency power in a range from 15 seconds to 60 seconds, the flake-off on the gate electrode is barely generated.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">As described above, by the experiment result illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, by performing the hydrogen plasma treatment, it is possible to reduce the concentration of oxygen present in the proximity of the interface between the undercoat layer and the gate electrode.

<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Furthermore, the thickness of the undercoat layer <b>2</b> is preferably greater than or equal to 100 nm for inhibiting diffusion of sodium as described above.

In contrast, when the thickness of the undercoat layer <b>2</b> was 300 nm, a crack was found in one of the five samples.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Accordingly, it is even more preferable to set the thickness of the undercoat layer <b>2</b> to be greater than or equal to 400 nm.

<p id="p-0177" num="0176">As described above, the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment 2 includes the process for performing the hydrogen plasma treatment before the annealing process for crystallizing the non-crystalline semiconductor layer, in the same manner as the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment 1. With this, it is possible to reduce the concentration of oxygen present in the proximity of the interface between the undercoat layer <b>2</b> and the gate electrode <b>3</b>, thereby inhibiting the generation of molybdenum oxide.

<p id="p-0194" num="0193">More specifically, after the hydrogen plasma treatment process, the annealing process, the second non-crystalline semiconductor layer forming process, the channel layer island forming process, the contact layer forming film forming process, the source/drain electrode forming process, and the contact layer forming process/channel etching process are performed in order, in the same manner as the fabrication method according to the embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">As described above, the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment 3 includes the process for performing the hydrogen plasma treatment before the annealing process for crystallizing the non-crystalline semiconductor layer, in the same manner as the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment 1. With this, it is possible to reduce the concentration of oxygen present in the proximity of the interface between the undercoat layer <b>2</b> and the gate electrode <b>3</b>, thereby inhibiting the generation of molybdenum oxide. Accordingly, the probability that molybdenum oxide sublimes and turns into gas at the annealing temperature in the temperature range described above can be significantly reduced. Therefore, it is possible to inhibit the generation of circular flake-offs on the gate electrode <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Furthermore, in the method for fabricating the thin-film semiconductor device for display according to the embodiment 3, the hydrogen plasma treatment process is provided between the first non-crystalline semiconductor layer forming process and the annealing process. When the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed at this stage, the gate electrode <b>3</b> has already been covered by the gate insulating film <b>4</b> and the non-crystalline semiconductor layer <b>5</b><i>a </i>at the time of hydrogen plasma treatment. Accordingly, it is possible to inhibit of oxygen entering the area in the proximity of the interface between the gate electrode <b>3</b> and the undercoat layer <b>2</b> again after this stage. Accordingly, the non-crystalline semiconductor layer is annealed while maintaining a state in which the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed on the area in the proximity of the interface between the gate electrode <b>3</b> and the undercoat layer <b>2</b>, that is, in a state in which the amount of oxygen near the interface between the gate electrode <b>3</b> and the undercoat layer <b>2</b> is small. Furthermore, the hydrogen plasma treatment can be performed immediately before the annealing. Accordingly, it is possible to effectively reduce the concentration of oxygen at an area in the proximity of the interface of the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Thus, the oxidation of molybdenum is not promoted, inhibiting the generation of molybdenum oxide. This decreases the probability that molybdenum oxide sublimes and turns into gas. As a result, it is possible to inhibit the flake-offs on the gate electrode <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Note that, when performing the hydrogen plasma treatment in the embodiment, the hydrogen plasma treatment toward the area in the proximity of the interface between the gate electrode and the undercoat layer is performed via two layers; the gate insulating film and the non-crystalline semiconductor layer. Since the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed through two layers of films, the effect of the hydrogen plasma treatment is reduced, compared to a case in which the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed only through one layer, the gate insulating film, as in the embodiment 2. However, in practical use, even the hydrogen plasma treatment at this stage can sufficiently reduce the amount of oxygen present in the area in the proximity of the undercoat layer and the gate electrode. Accordingly, it is possible to sufficiently inhibit the circular flake-offs on the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Furthermore, in this embodiment, when the power density of the radio frequency for performing the hydrogen plasma treatment is at least in a range from 0.098 (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) to 0.262 (W/cm<sup>2</sup>), and the processing time by the radio frequency power is at least in a range from 15 seconds to 60 seconds, the flake-off on the gate electrode is barely generated.</p>

The following description focuses on the difference from the fabrication method according to the embodiment 1 illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">First, in the same manner as the fabrication method according to the embodiment in (a) to (c) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the process (a) to (c) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> are sequentially performed.

Note that, the processes (a) to (c) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> are identical to the processes (a) to (c) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Next, the glass substrate <b>1</b> above which the molybdenum metal layer <b>3</b>M is formed on the undercoat layer <b>2</b> is placed in a chamber, and the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed on the undercoat layer <b>2</b> at least on a region where the gate electrode <b>3</b> is to be formed (gate electrode forming region), as illustrated in (d) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Stated differently, in the embodiment 4, the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed toward the interface between the undercoat layer <b>2</b> and the molybdenum metal layer <b>3</b>M.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The hydrogen plasma treatment is performed in the same manner as the embodiment 1. With this, it is possible to reduce the concentration of oxygen present in the proximity of the undercoat layer <b>2</b> and the molybdenum metal layer <b>3</b>M. Note that, in this embodiment, the molybdenum metal layer <b>3</b>M is formed on the entire surface of the undercoat layer <b>2</b>. However, the hydrogen radical reach to a depth of approximately 100 nm, and hydrogen ions even reach to a depth in an order of a few &#x3bc;m. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the concentration of oxygen in the inside of the molybdenum metal layer <b>3</b>M and an area in the proximity of the interface between the molybdenum metal layer <b>3</b>M and the undercoat layer <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Next, as illustrated in (e) to (g) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the gate electrode forming process is performed in the same manner as (d) to (f) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.
