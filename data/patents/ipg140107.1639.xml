<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems and networks that, more particularly, communicate in-casino emergency notifications.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wagering game machines, such as slot machines, video poker machines and the like, have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally, the popularity of such machines depends on the likelihood (or perceived likelihood) of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing wagering game machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same (or believed to be the same), players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines, features, and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore, there is a continuing need for wagering game machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, a method comprises determining emergency information that indicates a threat to the well being of one or more individuals within a casino; determining emergency content to present to the one or more individuals to notify the one or more individuals of the threat; presenting the emergency content on one or more wagering game machines within the casino; determining individual specific emergency information that relates specifically to the one or more individuals; and providing the individual specific emergency information to the one or more individuals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the method further comprises determining a degree of importance for the emergency information; and determining instructions to present the emergency content during a wagering game session with a degree of intrusiveness that correlates to the degree of importance for the emergency information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, determining the emergency information that indicates a threat to the well being of the one or more individuals within the casino comprises determining a biometric reading of the one or more individuals within the casino; and determining a disturbance in the biometric reading that indicates bodily distress.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, determining a biometric reading comprises monitoring the one or more individuals for one or more of physical symptoms of illness, indications of bodily injury, audible sounds of distress, dramatic change in pulse, dramatic change in blood pressure, change in body temperature, pained facial expressions, erratic body movements, belabored breathing, fainting, and vocal sounds of alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, presenting the emergency content on the one or more wagering game machines comprises displaying a map on the one or more wagering game machines showing an exit path in relation to representations of one or more casino boundaries.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, one or more machine-readable media having instructions stored thereon, which when executed by a set of one or more processors causes the set of one or more processors to perform operations comprises determining one or more indications of distress of one or more distressed individuals in a casino; determining identifying information for one or more distressed individuals that exhibit the one or more indications of distress; determining emergency care instructions for the one or more distressed individuals; determining a location of one or more nearby persons in the casino capable of assisting the one or more distressed individuals; and presenting notifications on casino devices that are close to the one or more nearby persons to notify the one or more nearby persons of the one or more distressed individuals.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the notifications include one or more of the identifying information for the one or more distressed individuals, the one or more indications of distress, and the emergency care instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the machine-readable media said operations further comprises determining emergency care qualifications for the one or more nearby persons, wherein the emergency care qualifications indicate that the one or more nearby persons are capable of assisting the one or more distressed individuals; and notifying the one or more nearby persons based on their emergency care qualifications.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, said operation of presenting notifications on the casino devices that are close to the one or more nearby persons further comprises presenting a map on a wagering game machine display showing a location of the one or more distressed individuals in relation to the location of the one or more nearby persons.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, said operation of determining a location of the one or more nearby persons capable of assisting the one or more distressed individuals further comprises determining the location of one or more individuals associated with the one or more distressed individuals.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">This description of the embodiments is divided into five sections. The first section provides an introduction to embodiments. The second section describes example operating environments while the third section describes example operations performed by some embodiments. The fourth section describes additional example operating environments while the fifth section presents some general comments.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This section provides an introduction to some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Casino operators have to be concerned with public health and safety. Large groups of people visit casinos on a regular basis, in all seasons. Sometimes emergencies, hazards, physical health related dangers, and important activities related to such dangers may arise during the course of business when casino patrons, staff, and other individuals are within the casino. Further, some casinos may, by regulation or choice, make the casino floor (i.e., the location where gambling and gaming devices are offered for use) secluded. Also, casino floors tend to have a lot of rows and walkways which may disorient a casino patron. Therefore, especially within the confines of a casino floor, the emergencies and hazards that may affect patrons become especially dangerous. Casinos are faced with the challenge of disseminating emergency notifications to casino patrons in a comprehensive and efficient manner. Embodiments of the inventive subject matter, however, present solutions to many of those challenges including determining and communicating in-casino emergency notifications via wagering game machines, determining and presenting specific information that can be useful to a patron during emergencies, determining casino patrons that may be in distress and assisting them, determining group biometrics that indicate emergencies and notifying emergency services of the potential emergencies, determining casino patron identities, preferences and history to assist in aiding the patron during emergencies, providing patron specific communication abilities during emergencies, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual diagram that illustrates an example of determining and communicating in-casino emergency notifications, according to some embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) <b>100</b>, can include various devices that can notify casino patrons, and other individuals, within the boundary of a casino <b>101</b>, and, especially, within a casino floor <b>108</b>. The system <b>100</b> can include an emergency coordination server <b>150</b> connected to a communications network <b>122</b>. The communications network <b>122</b> can be connected to a communications infrastructure for the casino <b>101</b> and the casino floor <b>108</b> such that any device within the casino <b>101</b> is networked, and can inter-communicate via the communications network <b>122</b>. Some devices include wireless transceivers <b>102</b>, casino emergency monitoring devices <b>120</b> (e.g., fire sensors and alarms, security sensors and alarms, etc.), and wagering game machines (e.g., mobile wagering game machines <b>160</b>, standing model wagering game machines <b>162</b>, etc.). The system <b>100</b> can utilize the emergency coordination server <b>150</b> to determine (e.g., receive, generate, etc.) emergency notifications and communicate them via the wagering game machines <b>160</b> and <b>162</b>. Though not shown, the wagering game machines <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> can be connected to various hardware devices (e.g., kiosks, docking stations, monitors, alarms, etc.) that can also be utilized to present emergency notifications. For example, the system <b>100</b> can receive notifications of emergencies, such as a fire alarm warning from one of the casino emergency monitoring devices <b>120</b>, a severe weather warning from an external emergency notification server <b>140</b>, or some other source, that can affect the health and safety of the patrons on the casino floor <b>108</b>. Consequently, the system <b>100</b> can determine a safe exit route for patrons to take and present notifications on the wagering game machines (e.g., an arrow graphic and directions <b>104</b> on wagering game machine displays, a candle signal atop wagering game machines, high quality verbal instructions from the wagering game machine's speakers, etc) that guide the patrons, and others on the casino floor, to safe and available exits.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments the wagering game machines <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are equipped with monitoring devices, such biometric devices, which can monitor the physical state of casino patrons, staff, and other individuals. The wagering game machines <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> can capture the biometric data and provide it to the emergency coordination server <b>150</b> to generate and disseminate emergency notifications on the wagering game machines <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>. The wagering game machines <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> can also be equipped with patron identification devices, which can detect identifying information about patrons and access the patron's wagering game account, or other accounts, to determine patron specific information (e.g., the patron's group members, emergency contact information, health history, communication preferences, etc.). The system <b>100</b> can utilize the patron specific information to notify the patron during an emergency and/or to notify others that may be able to assist the patron during an emergency. In one example, the system <b>100</b> generates and presents a floor map <b>110</b> on one or more of the mobile wagering game machines <b>160</b>. However, each mobile wagering game machine <b>160</b> can showing graphics that are specific to the location of the patron using the wagering game machine and the locations of other individuals associated with the patron. For example, the floor map <b>110</b> on the mobile wagering game machines <b>160</b> can show the location of the patron within the casino floor <b>108</b>, arrows showing the direction that the patron should move in relation to the casino floor layout, hazards (e.g., fire location), a spouse or other persons that are part of the patron's group, instructions <b>112</b> that are specific for the patron (e.g., directions to congregate at a specific meeting location <b>106</b>), etc. In some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> can track the location of the mobile wagering game machines <b>160</b> and update the image of the floor map <b>110</b> to take into consideration the patrons movements, position, line of sight, speed, etc. The system <b>100</b> can also present communication preferences associated with the patron (e.g., choice of language, preference for audio versus graphics, etc.), and communication abilities (e.g., two-way communications with other patrons, staff, emergency crew, etc.). The system <b>100</b> can utilize the wireless transceivers, internal location tracking equipment, global positioning services (GPS), mapping services (e.g., via the GPS/mapping server <b>180</b>), etc. to track the location of the patrons and present the floor map <b>110</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example Operations</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below, some flow diagrams are described with reference to block diagrams presented herein. However, in some embodiments, the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In certain embodiments, the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine-readable media (e.g., software), while in other embodiments, the operations can be performed by hardware and/or other logic (e.g., firmware). In some embodiments, the operations can be performed in series, while in other embodiments, one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Moreover, some embodiments can perform more or less than all the operations shown in any flow diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram (&#x201c;flow&#x201d;) <b>300</b> illustrating determining and communicating in-casino emergency notifications, according to some embodiments. This description will present <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in concert with some Figures, such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the flow <b>300</b> begins at processing block <b>302</b>, where a wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) receives a notification about an emergency that may affect patrons within a casino. In some embodiments, the system can link directly to various systems and/or departments of the casino (e.g., fire system, alarm systems, physical facility monitoring equipment, emergency services, security enforcement, emergency response groups, custodial services, engineering services, etc.) to obtain information that could pose an internal threat to the well-being (e.g., health, safety, etc.) of individuals within a casino. The system can also link directly to external emergency notification services (e.g., severe weather service, terrorist warning service, law enforcement services, amber alert, etc.) to obtain information that could pose an external threat to the well-being of individuals within a casino. In some embodiments, the system can receive player input that provides emergency notifications and/or enables the system to generate appropriate emergency content. For example, the wagering game machine may include a panic button, a locator button, an acknowledgement button, etc. that a player can activate. In some embodiments, the system can determine a group biometric (e.g., sound, movement, etc.) and determine disturbances in the group biometric. For example, the system can determine whether large amounts of people in an area have grown extremely agitated or uncharacteristically still, possibly evidencing a major catastrophic event or that the group is witnessing a distressing situation. In some embodiments, the system can detect voice recognition, potential injuries, facial expressions, erratic body movements, unnatural biometrics, unusual facial expressions, sounds of alarm or distress, or other indicators of unusual, and potentially emergency-related, incidences.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>304</b>, where the system determines emergency information to present. In some embodiments, the emergency information can include information about anything affecting the well-being of the patron (e.g., lost persons, security, weather, fire, structural damage, chemicals, health risks, etc.). In some embodiments, the system can determine an emergency's scale, degree of importance, degree of severity, etc., and provide emergency information accordingly. For example, the system can determine a degree of intrusiveness of emergency information content (&#x201c;emergency content&#x201d;) on a wagering game session based on the emergency's scale. The degree of intrusiveness can correlate to an amount of area, or space, used on a wagering game display (e.g., a high level emergency can take over all visible space on a wagering game display to make a notification whereas a lower level emergency can takes over less visible space, such as a notification in an auxiliary window on the wagering game display). In some embodiments the degree of intrusiveness can also determine the degree of repetitiveness of presenting the emergency content (e.g., a high level emergency can present information on a display in a repeating periodic pattern, or the candle on a wagering game machine can flash or spin faster, whereas a lower level emergency can present the information less frequently or the candle can flash or spin slowly). In yet other embodiments, the degree of intrusiveness can also determine the degree of effects, and/or volume of audio and visual information, used (e.g., a high level emergency can produce loud alarms, warnings, or instructions, bright or obvious colors to indicate instructions in large fonts, etc., whereas a lower level emergency can produce softer alarms, warnings or instructions, or more subdued, less vibrant, colors to indicate instructions in smaller fonts). In some embodiments, the system can use location tracking system (e.g., GPS, floor layout triangulation, repeater system, etc.) to determine emergency exit paths and generate maps showing the exit paths. The system can utilize player provided input and biometric readings to determine notifications. In some embodiments, the system can determine content for notifications, as well as preferences for the presentation of emergency notifications, from player accounts, personal online websites, etc. For example, a player account may include settings that describe a preference for audio communications versus graphical communications, notifications of spouse or other family member and/or friends locations on maps, indications and reminders of health related activities (e.g., a reminder to limit alcohol consumption to no more than 1 alcoholic drink per day, reminder to take medication every hour, indicators of emergency contact information, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>306</b>, where the system presents the emergency information on a wagering game machine. In some embodiments, the system can present information to a degree of intrusiveness based on the importance of the emergency. For example, the system can present the emergency information on the wagering game display where wagering games are played. The system can take over as much of the wagering game display area that is necessary to present information, depending on the severity of the emergency and/or the size or importance of the emergency notification. The system can also present emergency information by degree of repetition that correlates to the importance of the emergency (e.g., present a flashing message that doesn't take up the entire game display, but may flash very frequently to indicate its importance). In some embodiments, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system can display exit paths (e.g., using arrows) on the display of wagering game machines. In some embodiments, the system can use non-display lighting (e.g., overhead lights, candle, special purpose light, etc.) from wagering game machines to present emergency alarms or signals. The system can also shift a wagering game machine to a backup power source in the case of an emergency so that the emergency notifications are not interrupted by lack of power. The system can present audio via hi-definition, digital stereo speakers, or other such high end sound equipment attached to the wagering game machine.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>308</b>, where the system tracks the location of patrons. In some embodiments, the system can determine where patrons are within the casino, whether patrons have exited, their rate of movement, etc. The system can track specific people using radio frequency identification (RFID) cards or other devices. In some embodiments, an individual can carry a mobile wagering game machine around a casino floor, and also outside of the casino floor to other locations of the casino. Beyond the casino floor, the display on the wagering game machine can continue to function for purposes of presenting emergency notifications and location tracking, while wagering game functionality is disabled. The system can update information on the mobile wagering game machine's display based on an individual's movements and activities (e.g., it can show the player's location, show group members locations, can respond to requests by the individual, etc.). The system can also use other devices (e.g., bracelets, cell phones, etc.) to detect paths, groups, people, etc. For example, a player may wear a bracelet that when touched to a pad on a standing-model wagering game machine, the standing-model wagering game machine can display information about where to go, where group members are, etc. The system can use Blue-tooth technology, or other wireless communication technologies, online mapping programs, etc. to generate maps and to track locations of individuals on the maps. In some embodiments, the system can use a mesh network as a fail-safe system during times of emergencies. The wagering game machines may have logic that can shift to a mesh network communication mode.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>310</b>, where the system provides patron specific instructions. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system can provide specific escape routes for patron based on identity, preferences, assigned meeting places for a group, etc. The system can determine the location of associated individuals (e.g., associated patrons, family members, group members, friends, etc.) using tracking devices (e.g., the monitoring device <b>280</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). &#x201c;Associated individuals&#x201d; may include family members, friends, etc. For example, a family may register upon arriving at a casino and receiving tracking devices that indicate the identities of the family members. Each family member can wear a tracking device (e.g., a bracelet) or download a software program to their individual cell phones so that the system can uniquely identify their location within the casino's wireless network. The system can present a map on a display of the mobile wagering game machine and present the location of the patron and the associated individuals on the map. The system can determine a meeting location for the associated individuals. For example, the system can determine a meeting location based on an assigned meeting place set by the patron and/or associated individuals. The system can also automatically determine the location of the meeting location on such factors as (1) overall patron population in the casino (e.g., larger populations may require assigning multiple meeting locations at which patrons may congregate), (2) the distribution of the casino patron and the associated individuals (e.g., if a majority or plurality of the patrons in a group are closest to a specific meeting location then the system may determine that all group members meet at that meeting location), (3) physical abilities and/or age of patrons in a group (e.g., the system may select the meeting place so that handicapped, very young or very old patrons do not have to move long distances), (4) relationships between patrons (e.g., family members may all be assigned one location whereas other members of the group can be split up, if necessary, to other meeting locations), (5) detected health issues (e.g., the system may assign the meeting location based on the needs of someone who is hurt during the emergency), etc. As the patron and the associated individuals move within the casino's wireless network, the system can present on the map the positions of the patron and the associated individuals as they move to the meeting location. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a mobile wagering game machine <b>460</b> can provide a map button <b>406</b> that, when selected, shows a map of the casino. The mobile wagering game machine <b>460</b> can also include locator controls <b>404</b> that, when selected, can show specific items on the map that are of interest to the patron during an emergency, such as group/family members, available exits, meeting locations, emergency medical technician staff or stations, etc. Other types of patron specific instructions may relate to a player's own personal history or identity. For example, in some embodiments, the system can use the account information to determine the patron's medical or personal information related to a patron specific emergency. The system can use biometric monitors and sensors to determine whether the patron exhibits symptoms of an illness or health threatening accident. The system can present information that is specific to the patron, such as treatment for specific illness symptoms or accidents (e.g., first aid). The player can also set customizable settings based on what personal information they want to receive (e.g., receive health tips during wagering game play, set reminders to take medications, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>312</b>, where the system provides patron emergency communications. In some embodiments, the system can receive and provide communication between patrons on mobile wagering game machines or other portable casino-provided devices. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the mobile wagering game machine <b>460</b> can provide two-way radio communications. A patron can select frequency controls <b>401</b> that determine a specific frequency (e.g., a frequency specific for a group, an emergency assistance frequency, etc.). The mobile wagering game machine <b>460</b> can include one or more buttons or controls that control the transmission of the communications (e.g., a talk button <b>430</b>, a volume control, etc.). The mobile wagering game machine <b>460</b> can also include a wireless communication unit <b>412</b> that can detect information from a device possessed (e.g., worn, carried, etc.) by the casino patron, such as a radio frequency card, a radio frequency bracelet <b>471</b>, a cell phone, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>314</b>, where the system secures the wagering game machine. During some emergencies, the system can lock down wagering game machines from providing wagering game functionality and provide only modes that communicate emergency notifications. The system can disable cash out on the wagering game machine, roll back the wagering game machine for wagering game sessions, copy critical data to data storage, etc. For instance, the system can prevent fraud, rogue activity, or other tampering with the wagering game machine, account information, or other sensitive data on the wagering game machine during an emergency. The system can enable a secure emergency mode on mobile wagering game machines so that they can be carried beyond the casino floor and function to provide only emergency communications until returned to the casino floor, reinitialized, manually reconfigured, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram (&#x201c;flow&#x201d;) <b>500</b> illustrating determining and presenting patron specific emergency information, according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> are conceptual diagrams that helps illustrate the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, according to some embodiments. This description will present <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in concert with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flow <b>500</b> begins at processing block <b>502</b>, where a wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) determines signs of possible distress by a patron on a casino floor. The system can determine signs of distress using biometric scanning devices on a wagering game machine. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a wagering game machine <b>662</b> includes a monitoring device <b>664</b> (e.g., a high-end video camera, a retinal scanner, a device that determine erratic body movements, a device that measures unnatural biometrics, a device that determines unusual facial expressions, a device that determines group agitation or stillness, a device that detects sounds of alarm or distress, etc.). The monitoring device <b>664</b> determines some behavior or characteristic of the patron <b>605</b> that indicates bodily distress (e.g., a pained look, closed eyes, trembling, bleeding, convulsions, groans, screams, etc.). For instance, the monitoring device <b>664</b> can send or receive signals <b>669</b> directed at, or generated by, various parts of the body. The signals <b>669</b> capture biometric data that indicates the distress.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The flow <b>500</b> continues at processing block <b>504</b>, where the system determines the identity of the patron. In some embodiments, the system can determine the identity of the distressed patron by reading from a device associated with the patron. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the patron <b>605</b> wears an RFID player card (&#x201c;player card&#x201d;) <b>670</b> that identifies the patron. The player card <b>670</b> can include identifying information (e.g., name, emergency contact information, insurance information, etc.) that the wagering game machine <b>662</b> can read wirelessly. The wagering game machine <b>662</b> can also read from the patron's player account that stores identifying information, as well as other information related to health and safety issues and/or preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The flow <b>500</b> continues at processing block <b>506</b>, where the system verifies whether the patron is in distress. In some embodiments, the system can prompt the patron, or others nearby, to verify that the patron is in distress. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the wagering game machine <b>662</b> presents a question on a display <b>668</b> asking the patron whether the patron is distressed. The wagering game machine <b>662</b> can also present a button panel <b>666</b> whereby the patron can respond to the question affirmatively or negatively. In some embodiments, the wagering game machine <b>662</b> can also have microphones so that the patron can respond by voice. In some embodiments, the patron can carry a device with buttons and controls that can respond to the question (e.g., the player card <b>670</b> can have buttons that indicates an affirmative or negative response to the question, which the wagering game machine <b>662</b> can detect wirelessly). The wagering game machine <b>662</b> can also set a timer and determine that if the patron doesn't respond within a specific time period the wagering game machine <b>662</b> can assume a response of either negative or positive based on body language exhibited by the patron (e.g., if the wagering game machine <b>662</b> determines that the patron stops moving, nods, or performs other activities that appear to answer the question in the affirmative or that the patron is too distressed to respond, the wagering game machine <b>662</b> assumes a positive response for help, whereas if the patron keeps walking away, wags his/her head, etc., the wagering game machine <b>662</b> can assume a negative response). If the patron can respond and verify the question, at processing block <b>508</b>, the wagering game machine <b>662</b> can receive the input from the patron. In some embodiments, the patron can vocalize a problem into microphones on the wagering game machine <b>662</b>. The wagering game machine <b>662</b> can then present follow-up questions so that the player can indicate specifics about the problem. The wagering game machine <b>662</b> can also present dropdowns or selection items showing possible medical options, emergency communication options, two-way communication options to friends or family members, mapping options with directions to nearby medical staff, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The flow <b>500</b> continues at processing block <b>510</b>, where the system determines the location of the nearest other patrons or staff and notifies them of the patron in distress. In some embodiments, the system can determine identities of nearest patrons/staff. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a wagering game machine <b>660</b> detects a nearby patron <b>606</b> via an identification bracelet <b>671</b> and presents a message on a display <b>661</b> that the nearby patron <b>605</b> is in distress or may need assistance. The wagering game machine <b>660</b> can also present a map or controls <b>663</b> that present a map showing the location of the patron in distress. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in some embodiments, the system can determine emergency care qualifications of the nearest patrons or staff and notify only those patron who are qualified to care for the type of distress exhibited by the distressed patron. In some embodiments, the system can also notify family members, via wagering game machines, other devices in the casino, via family members' cell phones, etc., that the patron is in distress and needs assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The flow <b>500</b> continues at processing block <b>512</b>, where the system determines and presents emergency care instructions for the distressed patron. The system can present the emergency care instructions on a wagering game machine, or other devices, that the patron is using and/or that the nearby individuals are close to or using. The health care instructions can relate to the distressed patron's relevant medical condition(s) and/or health history. In some embodiments, the system can notify the nearby patrons or staff of the distressed patron's medical conditions and other health needs that may relate to the apparent situation.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The flow <b>500</b> continues at processing block <b>514</b>, where the system provides information to emergency response services. The system can contact the emergency response group for a casino. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, wagering game machines <b>760</b> detect a disturbance on a casino floor where several patrons <b>706</b> are vocally indicating an accident, illness, or other incident which has affected an injured patron <b>704</b>. The wagering game machines <b>760</b> are linked to an emergency coordination server <b>750</b> which sends a message <b>751</b> to an emergency medical response department.</p>
