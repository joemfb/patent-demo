<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">To improve the reliability of contact with an anisotropic conductive film in a semiconductor device such as a liquid crystal display panel, a terminal portion of a connecting wiring on an active matrix substrate is electrically connected to an FPC by an anisotropic conductive film. The connecting wiring is made of a lamination film of a metallic film and a transparent conductive film. In the connecting portion with the anisotropic conductive film, a side surface of the connecting wiring is covered with a protecting film made of an insulating material, thereby exposure to air of the metallic film can be avoided.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device comprising a circuit structured with a thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as TFT) formed on a substrate having an insulating surface, and also relates to a structure of a terminal for connecting the circuit structured with the TFT to a circuit on another substrate. More particularly, the present invention provides a technique suitable for use in a liquid crystal display device having a pixel portion and a driver circuit provided in the periphery of the pixel portion on the same substrate, an electro-luminescence display device, and electronic equipment mounted with an electro-optical device incorporating the above display devices. Note that in the present specification, the semiconductor device indicates general devices that may function by use of semiconductor characteristics, and that not only the above liquid crystal display device, but also the above electronic equipment incorporating the display device are categorized as the semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the electro-optical device, typically an active matrix type liquid crystal display device, a technique in which a TFT is utilized for the purpose of structuring a switching element and an active circuit has been developed. A TFT is formed with a semiconductor film as an active layer formed on a substrate such as a glass substrate by vapor phase growth. A material such as silicon or silicon germanium having silicon as its principal constituent is suitably utilized for the semiconductor film. In addition, an amorphous silicon film or a crystalline silicon film typically such as a polycrystalline silicon film can be obtained depending on the manufacturing method of the silicon semiconductor film.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The TFT using the amorphous silicon film as the active layer essentially cannot attain an electric field effect mobility of several cm<sup>2</sup>/Vsec or more because of electronic properties caused by the amorphous structure, or the like. Accordingly, despite being able to utilize the TFT as the switching element (pixel TFT) for driving the liquid crystals provided in each pixel in the pixel portion, it is impossible to form the TFT up to a point as a driver circuit for performing image display. In order to provide a driver circuit for performing image display, a technique in which a driver IC is mounted by the TAB (Tape Automated Bonding) method or the COG (Chip On Glass) method has been employed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, with the TFT using the crystalline silicon film as the active layer, it is possible to attain a high electric field effect mobility to form various functional circuits on the same glass substrate. Besides the pixel TFT, in the driver circuit, circuits basically formed of a CMOS circuit consisting of an n-channel TFT and a p-channel TFT, such as a shift resistor circuit, a level shifter circuit, a buffer circuit, and a sampling circuit, can be manufactured on the same substrate. An active matrix substrate having the pixel and the driver circuit for driving the pixel formed on the same substrate is utilized in the active matrix type liquid crystal display device for the purpose of reducing cost and improving quality.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the active matrix substrate such as the above, in order to supply electric power and an input signal to the driver circuit, a connecting wiring connected to the driver circuit is formed on the active matrix substrate. A structure mounted with the connecting wiring and an FPC (Flexible Print Circuit) is being adopted. An anisotropic conductive film is used for the connection of the connecting wiring and the FPC on the substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> shows a sectional structure of the connecting wiring connected to the FPC by means of the anisotropic conductive film.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, in the active matrix substrate, a connecting wiring <b>3</b> is formed on an insulating film <b>2</b> that is on the surface of a glass substrate <b>1</b>. The FPC <b>4</b> includes a substrate made of a flexible material such as polyimide, and a plurality of wiring <b>6</b> made of copper etc. are formed thereon. In an anisotropic conductive film <b>7</b>, conductive spacers <b>8</b> are dispersed into an adhesive <b>9</b> (resin) that cures from heat or light. The connecting wiring <b>3</b> is electrically connected to a wiring <b>6</b> on the FPC <b>4</b> by a conductive spacer <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The connecting wiring <b>3</b> is a two multi-layer structure consisting of a metallic film <b>3</b><i>a </i>such as aluminum and titanium and a transparent conductive film <b>3</b><i>b </i>such as an ITO film. Since the transparent conductive film <b>3</b><i>b </i>utilizes a metallic film such as aluminum, its wiring resistance can be lowered. Hence, there is fear that the metallic film <b>3</b><i>a </i>may be deformed due to being pressed by a conductive spacer <b>8</b>. The transparent conductive film <b>3</b><i>b </i>is made of metal oxide such as indium and tin, thus its degree of hardness is higher than the metallic film <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the transparent conductive film <b>3</b><i>b </i>is formed on the surface of the metallic film, preventing the metallic film <b>3</b><i>a </i>from being damaged or deformed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Nonetheless, a side surface of the metallic film <b>3</b><i>a </i>is in an uncovered state, and exposed to air until an anisotropic conductive film <b>7</b> is formed. The metallic film <b>3</b><i>a </i>is under a state easily exposed to corrosion and oxidation, the cause of lowering the connection reliability of the connecting wiring <b>3</b> and the FPC <b>4</b>. Furthermore, the side surface of the metallic film <b>3</b><i>a </i>is touching the resin in a state where the FPC <b>4</b> is mounted, causing a problem in protecting against moisture.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems, and therefore has an object thereof to realize a high reliability connection between an FPC and the connecting wiring, and to provide a connecting wiring suitable for mass production.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to solve the above problems, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a contact structure for electrically connecting a connecting wiring on a substrate to a wiring on another substrate by means of an anisotropic conductive film, characterized in that the lead wiring is a lamination film formed of a metallic film and a transparent conductive film, and in a connecting portion with the anisotropic conductive film, a side surface of the metallic film is covered with a protecting film.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, according to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor device comprising a first substrate having a circuit structured with a thin film transistor and a second substrate opposing the first substrate, characterized in that a connecting wiring, formed of a metallic film and a transparent conductive film in contact with the metallic film surface for connecting the circuit structured with a thin film transistor to another circuit, and a protecting film in contact with a side surface of the metallic film, are formed on the first substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still further, according to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor device comprising a first substrate having a circuit structured with a thin film transistor and a second substrate opposing the first substrate, characterized in that a connecting wiring formed of a metallic film and a transparent conductive film in contact with the metallic film surface, for connecting the circuit structured with a thin film transistor to another circuit a column-shape spacer for maintaining a space between the first substrate and the second substrate, formed on the thin film transistor, and a protecting film in contact with a side surface of the metallic film formed of a same material as that of the column-shape spacer, are formed on the first substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Embodiment Mode 1</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A contact structure according to the present invention is suitable for a semiconductor device that uses a mounting method in which circuits are connected by means of an anisotropic conductive film, such as an active matrix type liquid crystal display device or an EL display device. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, the contact structure of the present invention when applied to the active matrix type liquid crystal display device is described in Embodiment Mode 1.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A connecting wiring <b>183</b> on an active matrix substrate is electrically connected to an FPC <b>191</b> by an anisotropic conductive film <b>195</b> in a terminal portion <b>182</b>. The connecting wiring <b>183</b> is formed in the same process in which a source/drain wiring of a TFT on the active matrix substrate is formed. In other words, the connecting wiring <b>183</b> is formed from the same material and in the same layer as that of the source/drain wiring. The connecting wiring <b>183</b> is a lamination film of a metallic film <b>140</b> and a transparent conductive film <b>141</b>. In a connecting portion with the anisotropic conductive film <b>195</b>, a side surface of the connecting wiring <b>183</b> is covered with a protecting film <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A side surface of the metallic film <b>140</b> is covered with the protecting film <b>174</b> in this structure. Accordingly, in the connecting portion, the metallic film <b>140</b> is surrounded by and contacts with the transparent conductive film <b>141</b>, an insulating film <b>109</b>, and the protecting film <b>174</b>, with no chance of being exposed to air. Consequently, corrosion of the metallic film <b>140</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The protecting film <b>174</b> can be formed by using the insulating film formed on the upper layer of the source/drain wiring. In Embodiment Mode 1, the protecting film <b>174</b> is formed in the same process with a column-shape spacer <b>172</b> that is formed for the purpose of maintaining a space between the active matrix substrate and an opposing substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, a connecting wiring <b>303</b> can be formed in the same process with a gate wiring of the TFT as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In this case, the connecting wiring <b>303</b> is formed from the same material and in the same layer as the gate wiring. Also in this case, a protecting film <b>304</b> is formed from insulating films <b>138</b> and <b>139</b> formed between the gate wiring and the source/drain wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the present invention, the connecting wiring is formed of a lamination film in which a transparent conductive film is formed covering the surface of the metallic film. The metallic film is not limited to a single layer film. The thickness of the metallic film is between 100 nm and 1 &#x3bc;m. The metallic film may be a metallic layer having an element selected from the group consisting of aluminum (Al), tantalum (Ta), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W) as its principal constituent, or at least containing an alloy layer which contains a metallic element. The following may be given as the alloy: Mo&#x2014;W alloy, Mo&#x2014;Ta alloy, or nitrated compounds with the listed elements above such as tantalum nitride (TaN), tungsten nitride (WN), titanium nitride (TiN), and molybdenum nitride (MoN). In addition, a silicide layer such as tungsten silicide, titanium silicide, and molybdenum silicide may be included in the metallic film.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The thickness of the transparent conductive film is between 50 nm and 5 mm. Materials such as indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), or an indium oxide/tin oxide alloy (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SnO<sub>2</sub>:ITO) formed by utilizing the sputtering method and the vacuum evaporation method may be used as materials for the transparent conductive film. The etching treatment of this type of material is performed with hydrochloric acid solutions. However, particularly the etching of ITO readily generates residues. Therefore, an indium oxide/zinc oxide alloy (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;ZnO) may be used in order to be suitable for the etching process. The indium oxide/zinc oxide alloy has excellent flat and smooth surface properties, and contrary to ITO, also has excellent thermal stability. Accordingly, at an edge surface of a drain wiring <b>169</b> where it comes in contact with Al, corrosion reaction with Al can be prevented. Similarly, zinc oxide (ZnO) is also a suitable material. In order to further improve the transmissivity of visible light and conductivity, zinc oxide doped with gallium (ZnO:G), etc. may be used.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment Mode 2</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, for the case of forming the connecting wiring in the same process with the gate wiring, the shape of the sectional surfaces of the gate wiring and the connecting wiring can be taper shapes. By forming the gating wiring into a taper shape, film thickness is reduced from the center towards the side surface. Because of this variation in film thickness, as shown in an embodiment which will be explained later, changing an impurity concentration to be doped into the semiconductor film can be made by utilizing the variation in film thickness in a process of doping for the semiconductor film with the gate wiring as a mask.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Dry etching utilizing high-density plasma is applied in order to form a taper shaped gate wiring. As a means of achieving high-density plasma, an etching device that utilizes a microwave or an ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) is suitable. Particularly, the ICP etching device can easily control plasma as well as deal with the operation of processing for a large area surface substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As a means for performing plasma treatment with high precision, a plasma treatment device utilizing the ICP employs a method of forming plasma by applying high frequency electric power to a multi-spiral coil formed from 4 whirlpool shaped coil parts connected in series via an impedance matching apparatus. The length of each whirlpool shaped coil parts is set to be &#xbc; times longer than the wavelength of the high frequency. In addition, the plasma treatment device is structured such that a different high frequency electric power is also applied to a base electrode for holding the object to be treated to thereby add a bias voltage. The plasma treatment method utilizing an ICP and plasma treatment device are disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 9-293600.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> schematically shows the structure of the plasma treatment device utilizing such type of ICP (for example, an etching device). On a quartz substrate <b>11</b> of a chamber's top portion, an antenna coil <b>12</b> is arranged, and connected to an RF electric power source <b>14</b> via a matching-box <b>13</b>. Furthermore, a substrate <b>10</b> to be plasma treated is disposed on a base electrode which is provided facing the antenna coil. The base electrode <b>15</b> is also connected to an RF electric power source <b>17</b> via a matching-box <b>16</b>. When an RF electric current flow is applied to the antenna coil <b>12</b> above substrate, an RF electric current J flows in an &#x3b1; direction in the antenna coil <b>12</b> to thereby generate a magnetic field B in a Z direction in accordance with a formula 1.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Plasma is produced when an electron is accelerated in the &#x3b1; direction to thereby collide with a gas molecule in the induction electric field E. Since the direction of the induction electric field E is in the &#x3b1; direction, the probability of losing electric charge due to collision of a charged particle against the wall of the etching chamber or the substrate is reduced. Accordingly, high-density plasma can be generated even at a low pressure of about 1 Pa. Also, there is hardly any magnetic field B in the downward flow, resulting in a high-density plasma region that has widened into a sheet shape.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In order to obtain the high-density plasma with the ICP, it is necessary to flow a high frequency electric current J at a low-loss, which flows to the antenna coil <b>12</b>, and its impedance must be reduced for the large area. Therefore, it is effective to apply a method in which the antenna coil is split.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Regulating the respective RF powers to be applied to the antenna coil <b>12</b> (applied with an ICP power) and the lower electrode <b>15</b> of the substrate side (applied with bias power) makes it possible to independently control the plasma density and the self-bias voltage. Additionally, an RF power with different frequencies may be applied in response to the film to be etched.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">To obtain the high-density plasma with the ICP etching device, the RF electric current J that flows to the antenna coil <b>12</b> needs to be flowed at a low-loss. The inductance of the antenna coil <b>12</b> must be reduced in order to form a large surface area of the substrate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, an ICP etching device having a multi-spiral coil <b>22</b> of a split antenna has been developed to achieve the above stated conditions. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, reference numeral <b>21</b> denotes a quartz substrate, reference numerals <b>23</b> and <b>26</b> denote matching-boxes, and reference numerals <b>24</b> and <b>27</b> denote RF electric power sources. Further, at the bottom portion of the chamber, a base electrode <b>25</b> for holding a substrate <b>28</b> is provided via an insulator <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If the etching device, which uses the ICP and is applied with the multi-spiral coil, is employed, then the etching of the heat-resistant conductive materials can be performed well and in addition, a wiring with a desirable taper angle &#x3b8; may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A bias power density of the ICP etching device is adjusted to thereby obtain a desired taper angle &#x3b8;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a view showing the bias power dependency of the taper angle &#x3b8;. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the taper angle &#x3b8; can be controlled in response to the bias power density. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is the result of examining the taper shape (taper angle) of the patterned edge portion of a W film, which has been formed into a fixed pattern on the glass substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows the bias power (13.56 MHz) dependency of the taper angle and the bias power is applied to the substrate side. As common conditions, the electric discharge power (high frequency power to be applied to the coil, 13.56 MHz) is set to 3.2 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, the pressure is set to 1.0 Pa, and CF<sub>4 </sub>and Cl<sub>2 </sub>are used as the etching gas. The quantity of flow of the etching gas CF<sub>4 </sub>and Cl<sub>2</sub>, are both set to 30 SCCM.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, it has become apparent that when the bias power is in the range of 128 to 384 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, the taper angle may be altered between 70&#xb0; and 20&#xb0;. Note that the quantity of flow of CF<sub>4 </sub>and Cl<sub>2 </sub>are both set to 30 SCCM.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It is also possible to alter the taper angle from 60&#xb0; to 80&#xb0; as can be known from the experiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The experiment conditions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> show the results of examining the dependency of the taper angle on the ratio of the quantity of flow of etching gas. Note that the quantity of flow of CF<sub>4 </sub>is altered in a range of from 20 to 40 SCCM with the condition that the total quantity of flow of CF<sub>4 </sub>and Cl<sub>2 </sub>is set to 60 SCCM. The bias power at this point is set to 128 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, it is deemed that the taper angle &#x3b8; depends on the selectivity of the etching of tungsten and resist <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is a diagram showing the dependency of the taper angle &#x3b8; on the selective ratio of tungsten and resist. Using the ICP etching device in such a way, when the bias power density and the ratio of the quantity of flow of reaction gas are appropriately determined, it is possible to very easily form a wiring with a desired taper angle &#x3b8; of between 3&#xb0; and 60&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, the processing characteristics of the ICP etching device for the heat-resistant conductive materials is taken into consideration. Besides a W film and a Ta film, regarding a molybdenum-tungsten (Mo&#x2014;W) alloy (composition ratio is Mo:W=48:50 wt %) that is often used as the material for the gate electrode, a typical value of an etching speed, an applicable etching gas, and a selective ratio to a gate insulating film that becomes the base of the gate electrode are shown here. The gate insulating film is a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride oxide film formed with plasma CVD. The selective ratio here is defined as the ratio of the etching speed of the gate insulating film to the etching speed of each material.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The etching speed of the Ta film is between 140 and 160 nm/min, and the selective ratio of etching to the gate insulating film is between 6 and 8. This value surpasses the value of the selective ratio between 2 and 4 of the W film to the gate insulating film when the etching speed of the W film in the range of 70 to 90 nm/min. Therefore, the Ta film is also applicable from the viewpoint of the characteristic of the workability. Although not shown in the table, the resistivity of the Ta film is between 20 and 30 &#x3bc;&#x3a9;cm, compared with the resistivity of the W film which is between 10 and 16 &#x3bc;&#x3a9;cm, the Ta film resistivity is relatively higher and resulting into a difficult point.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">On the other hand, the etching speed of the Mo&#x2014;W alloy is slow and between 40 and 60 nm/min, its selective ratio of etching to the gate insulating film is between 0.1 and 2. It can be seen from the viewpoint of the characteristic of the workability that this material is not necessarily applicable. As can be known from table 1, the Ta film shows the best results. However, as stated above, when the resistivity is taken into consideration, then it is deemed that the W film is suitable after considering all the factors.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing the circuit of the active matrix substrate <b>101</b>. The image signal driver circuit <b>186</b> is composed of a shift resistor circuit <b>501</b><i>a</i>, a level shifter circuit <b>502</b><i>a</i>, a buffer circuit <b>503</b><i>a</i>, and a sampling circuit <b>504</b>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The sampling circuit <b>504</b> is formed from an analog switch and its driving voltage is between 14 to 16V. Since the polarity alternately reverses to be driven and there is a necessity to reduce an off current value, it is desired that the sampling circuit <b>504</b> be formed of a second p-channel TFT <b>202</b> and a second n-channel TFT <b>203</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, the driving voltage of the pixel portion is between 14 and 16 V.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A barium borosilicate glass or aluminoborosilicate glass as typified by Corning #7059 glass and #1737 glass can be used for a substrate <b>101</b>. Besides these glass substrates, plastic substrates not having optical anisotropy such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethersulfone (PES), etc, can be used, too. In the case of using a glass substrate, the substrate may be heat-treated in advance at a temperature lower by about 10 to 20&#xb0; C. than a glass strain point. A base film <b>102</b> comprising such as a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film or a silicon oxynitride film is formed over the surface of the substrate <b>101</b>, on which TFT is to be formed, in order to prevent the diffusion of impurities from the substrate <b>101</b>. For example, a laminate of the silicon oxynitride film <b>102</b><i>a </i>formed from SiH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O by plasma CVD to a thickness of 10 to 200 nm (preferably, 50 to 100 nm) and a hydrogenated silicon oxide nitride film <b>102</b><i>b </i>formed similarly from SiH<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O to a thickness of 50 to 200 nm (preferably, 100 to 150 nm), is formed. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The silicon oxynitride film is formed by using the conventional parallel plate type plasma-enhanced CVD. The silicon oxynitride film <b>102</b><i>a </i>is formed by introducing SiH<sub>4 </sub>at 10 sccm, NH<sub>3 </sub>at 100 sccm and N<sub>2</sub>O at 20 sccm into a reaction chamber under the condition of a substrate temperature of 325&#xb0; C., a reaction pressure of 40 Pa, a discharge power density of 0.41 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>and a discharge frequency of 60 MHz. These films can be formed by only changing the substrate temperature and by switching the reactive gases.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The silicon oxynitride film <b>102</b><i>a </i>thus formed has a density of 9.28&#xd7;10<sup>22</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, has a slow etching rate of about 63 nm/min in a mixed solution (&#x201c;L<smallcaps>AL</smallcaps>500&#x201d;, a product of Stella Chemifa Co.) containing 7.13% of ammonium hydrogenfluoride (NH<sub>4</sub>HF<sub>2</sub>) and 15.4% of ammonium fluoride (NH<sub>4</sub>F) at 20&#xb0; C., and is a compact and hard film. When such a film is used for the base film, the diffusion of alkali metal elements from the glass substrate into the semiconductor layers formed thereon can be effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Next, a semiconductor film <b>103</b><i>a </i>having a thickness of 25 to 80 nm (preferably, 30 to 60 nm) and an amorphous structure is formed by a known method such as plasma CVD or sputtering. For example, an amorphous silicon film is formed to a thickness of 55 nm by plasma CVD. Semiconductor films having such an amorphous structure include an amorphous semiconductor film and a micro-crystalline semiconductor film, and a compound semiconductor film having an amorphous structure such as an amorphous silicon-germanium film may also be used. Both the base film <b>102</b> and the amorphous semiconductor layer <b>103</b><i>a </i>can be formed continuously. For example, after the silicon oxynitride film <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the hydrogenated silicon oxynitride film <b>1102</b><i>b </i>are formed continuously by the plasma CVD process as described above, the deposition can be carried out continuously by switching the reactive gases from SiH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2 </sub>to SiH<sub>4 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>, or SiH<sub>4 </sub>alone, without exposing to the atmosphere of the open air. As a result, the contamination of the surface of the hydrogenated silicon oxynitride film <b>102</b><i>b </i>can be prevented, and variance of the characteristics of the TFT to be fabricated and fluctuation of the threshold voltage can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The crystallization step is then carried out to form a crystalline semiconductor film <b>103</b><i>b </i>from the amorphous semiconductor film <b>103</b><i>a</i>. A laser annealing method, a thermal annealing method (solid phase growth method) or a rapid thermal annealing method (RTA) method can be used for this method. In the case of using the glass substrate or the plastic substrate having a low heat resistance, the laser annealing method is employed preferably. The RTA method uses an IR lamp, a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp or a xenon lamp as the light source. Alternatively, the crystalline semiconductor film <b>103</b><i>b </i>can be formed by the crystallization method using a catalytic element in accordance with the technology disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 7-130652. In the crystallization step, hydrogen contained in the amorphous semiconductor film is first discharged preferably. After heat-treatment is conducted at 400 to 500&#xb0; C. for about 1 hour to lower the hydrogen content to 5 atom % or below, the crystallization step is then conducted. In this way, roughness of the film surface can be prevented advantageously.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">When the crystallization step is conducted by the laser annealing method, a pulse oscillation type or continuous light emission type excimer laser, or an argon laser is used as the light source. In the case of using the pulse oscillation type excimer laser, the laser beam is processed to a linear shape and laser annealing is then conducted. The laser annealing condition may be selected appropriately by the operator, for example, the laser pulse oscillation is set at 30 Hz and the laser energy density is 100 to 500 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>(typically, 300 to 400 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>). The linear beams are irradiated to the entire surface of the substrate, and the overlap ratio of the linear beams at this time is 80 to 98%. In this way, the crystalline semiconductor film <b>103</b><i>b </i>can be obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A resist pattern is formed on the crystalline semiconductor film <b>103</b><i>b </i>by photolithography that uses a photo-mask PM<b>1</b>. The crystalline semiconductor film is divided into islands by dry etching, forming thereby island semiconductor films <b>104</b> to <b>108</b>. A mixed gas of CF<sub>4 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>is used for dry etching.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">An impurity imparting p-type may be added in a concentration of about 1&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>to 5&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to the entire surface of the island semiconductor films in order to control the threshold voltage (Vth) of the TFT. The elements of the Group XIII of the Periodic Table such as boron (B), aluminum (Al) or gallium (Ga) are known as the impurity elements for imparting p-type to the semiconductor. Ion implantation or ion doping can be adopted as the method of doping these elements, but ion doping is suitable for processing a substrate having a large area. This ion doping method uses diborane (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) as a source gas and adds boron (B). Addition of such an impurity element is not always necessary and may be omitted. However, this is the method that can be used appropriately for keeping the threshold voltage of the n-channel TFT, in particular, within a prescribed range.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A gate insulating film <b>109</b> is formed from an insulating film containing silicon to a thickness of 40 to 150 nm by plasma CVD or sputtering. For example, it may be formed from a silicon oxynitride film having a thickness of 120 nm. The silicon oxynitride film that is formed by adding O<sub>2 </sub>to SiH<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O has a reduced fixed charge density in the film and is a preferable material for this application. Needless to say, the gate insulating film is not particularly limited to such a silicon oxynitride film but may be a single layered structure of other insulating film containing silicon or their laminate structure.

For example, in the case it is a double layer structure, the upper film is formed from a metal film comprising an element selected from tantalum (Ta), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W), etc. as the principle component or alloy films comprising these elements (typically, a Mo&#x2014;W alloy film, an Mo&#x2014;Ta alloy film), and the lower film is formed from tantalum nitride (TaN), tungsten nitride (WN), titanium nitride (TiN), molybdenum nitride (MoN), etc. For example, in the case of double layer, the upper film may be formed from a nitride of the conductive lower film, when it is denoted like lower/upper, they may be WN film/W film or TaN film/Ta film, or the like. In the case of a triple layer, it may be TaN film/Ta film/TaN film. It is preferable to set the resistivity of the second (upper) conductive film within a range of 10 to 50 mWcm. The impurity concentration contained may be preferably reduced for low resistance, specifically the oxygen concentration may be reduced to 30 ppm or below. For example, resistivity of 20 mWcm or below can be realized with respect to tungsten (W) by setting the oxygen concentration at 30 ppm or below.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, it is preferable to use a film having aluminum as its principle component for achieving low resistivity of the wiring. In this case, the heat resistance may be enhanced by adding trace amount of Si or Sc or the like into aluminum. For example, as a conductive film which forms a gate wiring, Ti film/Al film added with Sc or Ti film/TiN film/Al film added with Sc may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the case of using W for the gate electrode, tungsten nitride (WN) is formed to a thickness of 50 nm for the conductive layer <b>111</b> by sputtering using W as a target and by introducing an argon (Ar) gas and a nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) gas, and W is formed to a thickness of 250 nm for the conductive layer <b>110</b>. As another method, W film can be formed by thermal CVD using tungsten hexafluoride (WF<sub>6</sub>). In any case, the resistance of the gate electrode must be lowered, and the resistivity of the W film is preferably not higher than 20 mWcm. The low resistivity of the W film can be accomplished by increasing the crystal grain size, but the resistivity becomes high when the contents of the impurity elements such as O in W are great because crystallization is impeded. Therefore, when sputtering is employed, the W target used has a purity of 99.9999%, and sufficient attention should be paid lest impurities mix from the gaseous phase during the formation of the film. In this way, the resistivity of 9 to 20 mWcm can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">It is possible to form TaN film and Ta film similarly by sputtering. To form the TaN film, Ta is used as the target and a mixed gas of Ar and nitrogen, as the sputtering gas. Argon (Ar) is used as the sputtering gas to form the Ta film. When a suitable amount of Xe or Kr is added to the sputtering gas, the internal stress of the resulting films can be mitigated and peel of the films can be prevented. The resistivity of the &#x3b1; phase Ta film is about 20 mWcm, and this film can be used for the gate electrode. However, the resistivity of the &#x3b2; phase Ta film is about 180 mWcm and this film is not suitable for the gate electrode. The TaN film has a crystal structure approximate to that of the &#x3b1; phase. Therefore, when the Ta film is formed on the TaN film, the &#x3b1; phase Ta film can be obtained easily. In the present Embodiment, TaN film is deposited as the lower conductive film <b>110</b>, and Ta, as the upper conductive film <b>111</b>, which form the gate wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Incidentally, it is effective to form a phosphorus (P) doped silicon film to a thickness of about 2 to about 20 nm between the conductive film which forms the gate wiring and the gate insulating film <b>109</b>. By doing so, the improvement of adhesiveness and prevention of oxidation of the conductive film formed thereon can be devised and at the same time it is possible to prevent the alkali metal elements contained in the conductive film in a trace amount to diffuse into the gate insulating film <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Next, resist masks RM<b>1</b> to RM<b>6</b> are formed by photolithography by using a photo-mask PM<b>2</b>.

In this way, the low concentration n-type impurity regions <b>124</b> to <b>129</b> are formed in the island-like semiconductor films as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Next, formation of high concentration n-type impurity region that functions as a source or a drain region in the n-channel TFT, is conducted (n<sup>+</sup> doping step). First, resist masks RM<b>8</b> to RM<b>12</b> are formed using a photo-mask PM<b>3</b>, and an impurity element imparting n-type is doped to form high concentration n-type impurity regions <b>130</b> to <b>135</b>. Phosphorus (P) is used as the impurity element imparting n-type.

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a protective insulating film <b>138</b> is formed from above the gate wiring and the gate insulating film. The protective insulating film <b>138</b> may comprise a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, a silicon nitride film or a laminate film comprising the combination of these films. In any case, the protective insulating film <b>138</b> is formed of an inorganic insulating material. The protective insulating film <b>138</b> has a film thickness of 100 to 200 nm. When the silicon oxide film is used, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and O<sub>2 </sub>are mixed, and the film can be formed by plasma CVD with a reaction pressure of 40 Pa, a substrate temperature of 300 to 400&#xb0; C. and plasma is discharged at a high frequency (13.56 MHz) power density of 0.5 to 0.8 W/cm<sup>Z</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">When the silicon oxynitride film is used, the film may comprise a silicon oxynitride film formed by plasma CVD from SiH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3 </sub>or a silicon oxynitride film formed from SiH<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O. The film deposition condition in this case is the reaction pressure of 20 to 200 Pa, the substrate temperature of 300 to 400&#xb0; C., and the high frequency (60 MHz) power density of 0.1 to 1.0 W/cm<sup>z</sup>. The hydrogenated silicon oxynitride film formed from SiH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2 </sub>may be used, as well. The silicon nitride film can be formed similarly from SiH<sub>4 </sub>and NH<sub>3 </sub>by plasma CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Thereafter, the step of activating the impurity elements imparting n-type or p-type added in the respective concentrations is conducted. This step is conducted by a thermal annealing method using a furnace annealing oven. Besides the thermal annealing method, it is possible to employ a laser annealing method and a rapid thermal annealing method (RTA method). The thermal annealing method is conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere containing oxygen in a concentration of 1 ppm or below, preferably 0.1 ppm or below, at 400 to 700&#xb0; C., typically 500 to 600&#xb0; C. In this embodiment, the heat-treatment is conducted at 550&#xb0; C. for 4 hours. When a plastic substrate having a low heat-resistant temperature is used for the substrate <b>101</b>, the laser annealing method is preferably employed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">After the activation step, heat-treatment is further conducted in an atmosphere containing 3 to 100% hydrogen at 300 to 450&#xb0; C. for 1 to 12 hours to hydrogenate the island-like semiconductor film. This is the process step that terminates the dangling bonds of 10<sup>16 </sup>to 10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>in the island-like semiconductor film by hydrogen that is thermally excited. Plasma hydrogenation (using hydrogen that is excited by plasma) may be used as another means for hydrogenation.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">After the activation and hydrogenation steps are completed, an interlayer insulating film <b>139</b> made of an organic insulating material is formed to a mean thickness of 1.0 to 2.0 mm. Examples of the organic resin materials are polyimide, acrylic, polyamide, polyimidamide, BCB (benzocyclobutene), and so forth. When polyimide of the type, that is thermally polymerized after being applied to the substrate, is used, the material is baked at 300&#xb0; C. in a clean oven. When acrylic is used, a two-component type is used. After the main agent and the curing agent are mixed, the mixture is applied to the entire surface of the substrate by using a spinner. Preparatory heating is then conducted by using a hot plate at 80&#xb0; C. for 60 seconds, and baking is then made in the clean oven at 250&#xb0; C. for 60 minutes. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">By forming the interlayer insulating film <b>139</b> from an organic insulating material, its surface can be planarized satisfactorily. The organic resin materials have generally a low dielectric constant, and the parasitic capacitance can be reduced. However, since they are hygroscopic, they are not suitable for the protective film. Therefore, the organic insulating material must be used in combination with the silicon oxide film, the silicon oxynitride film or the silicon nitride film formed as the protective insulating film <b>138</b> as in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Thereafter, a resist mask having a predetermined pattern is formed by using a photomask PM<b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>).

In this case, a mixed gas of CF<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>2 </sub>and He is used as the etching gas. The interlayer insulating film <b>139</b> formed of the organic resin material is first etched. Then, the etching gas is switched to CF<sub>4 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub>, and the protective insulating film <b>138</b> is etched. To improve the selection ratio with the island-like semiconductor films, the etching gas is switched further to CHF<sub>3 </sub>and the gate insulating film is etched. In this way, the contact holes can be formed satisfactorily.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">A laminate film of a metal film <b>140</b> which forms a source/drain wiring and connection wiring <b>183</b> and a transparent conductive film <b>141</b> is formed.

The etching treatment of these materials is performed by solution including hydrochloric acid. However, since residues are easily generated specifically in the etching of ITO, the alloy of indium oxide and zinc oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;ZnO<sub>2</sub>) may be used in order to improve etching workability. The alloy of indium oxide and zinc oxide has superiority in the surface smoothness and in thermal stability compared to ITO, and it can prevent corrosion reaction with Al which will be in contact at the edge surface of the drain wiring <b>169</b>. Similarly zinc oxide (ZnO) is also an appropriate material, and a zinc oxide added with gallium (ZnO:Ga) for the purpose of increasing transmittivity of visible rays and conductivity or the like can also be used.

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Further in this embodiment columnar spacer <b>172</b> is formed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, on the active matrix substrate which went through the above described processes. At the same time, a protection film <b>174</b> which protects side face of the terminal section <b>182</b> of the connection wiring <b>183</b> is formed with the formation of the columnar spacer <b>172</b>. The material of the columnar spacer <b>172</b> is not limited, in particular, and they may be formed by using, for example, &#x201c;NN700&#x201d; of JSR Co., and after the material is coated by a spinner, a prescribed pattern is formed by exposure and development. The pattern is then heated and cured at 150 to 200&#xb0; C. in a clean oven, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The shape of the spacer thus formed can be changed depending on the conditions of exposure and development. Preferably, however, the columnar spacer <b>172</b> has a columnar shape with a flat top as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, so that the mechanical strength as the liquid crystal display panel can be secured when the substrate on the opposite side is put.

<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The connecting wiring <b>183</b> is formed in the same manufacturing process with a source/drain wiring of the TFT in Embodiment 1. In Embodiment 2, the connecting wiring <b>183</b> will be formed in the same process with a gate wiring. Embodiment 2 will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The manufacturing process of the TFT will be employed from Embodiment 1. The reference numerals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> which are identical with those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 8</figref> denote the same constituents.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">First the manufacturing processes until <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> are performed in accordance with those of Embodiment 1. Next, a lamination film of a conductive film <b>301</b> and a transparent conductive film <b>302</b> composing the gate wiring, are formed. The material for forming conductive films <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> composing the gate wiring in Embodiment 1 can be used for the conductive film <b>301</b>. As for the transparent conductive film <b>302</b>, the material used for forming the transparent conductive film <b>141</b> that is formed on the surface of the source/drain wiring of the TFT, can be utilized. As the conductive film <b>301</b>, a lamination film made of a WN film/W film is formed by sputtering, and as the transparent conductive film <b>302</b>, an ITO film is formed. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">A resist mask is then formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Etching is performed on the conductive film <b>301</b> and the transparent conductive film <b>302</b>, then the gate wiring of the TFT and a connecting wiring <b>303</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> are formed. In the case the films are formed from a material including W as its principal constituent, it is desired that dry etching using high-density plasma be applied in order to implement a speedy and precise etching.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As one means of achieving high-density plasma, it is appropriate to employ the ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) etching device. In the etching method of W employing the ICP etching device two types of gas, CF<sub>4 </sub>and Cl<sub>2 </sub>are introduced into the reaction chamber for the etching gas, the pressure is set between 0.5 and 1.5 Pa (preferably 1 Pa), and a 200 W to 1000 W high frequency (13.56 MHz) electric power is applied to the inductively coupled portion. At this point, a 20 W high frequency electric power is applied to a stage disposed with the substrate, and by charging a negative electric potential by self-bias, a positive ion is accelerated to thereby perform anisotropic etching. By using the ICP etching device, an etching speed of between 2 and 5 nm/sec can also be attained from hard metallic films such as W. Further, in order to perform etching without leaving any residues, it is appropriate to increase the etching time about 10% to 20% to perform over-etching.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">However, attention must be paid to the selective ratio of etching to a base film. For example, the selective ratio of the W film to the silicon nitride oxide film (the gate insulating film <b>109</b>) is between 2.5 to 3. Due to this type of over-etching process, an exposed surface of the silicon nitride oxide film is etched between 20 and 50 nm, becoming substantially thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As explained in Embodiment 1, the semiconductor film of the TFT is then doped with phosphorous and boron to thereby form a protecting insulating film <b>138</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Then the phosphorous and boron doped into the semiconductor film is activated. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Thereafter, an interlayer insulating film <b>139</b> is formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. The material for forming the interlayer insulating film <b>139</b> may be selected from the materials described in Embodiment 1, or the interlayer insulating film <b>139</b> may be a silicon base inorganic insulating film, or an organic resin film such as acrylic.

<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a contact hole reaching the source region or the drain region, formed on an island-like semiconductor film, is formed in the protecting insulating film <b>138</b> and the interlayer insulating film <b>139</b>. At the same time, in the terminal portion of the connecting wiring <b>303</b>, a protecting film <b>304</b> for covering the side surface of the terminal portion is formed. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The rest of the processes are carried out in the same way as in Embodiment 1 to thereby complete the active matrix substrate <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In Embodiment 2, because the side surface of the conductive film <b>301</b> of the connecting wiring <b>303</b> is covered with the protecting film <b>304</b>, the conductive film <b>301</b> becomes a structure surrounded by the protecting film <b>304</b>, the gate insulating film <b>109</b>, and the transparent conductive film <b>302</b>, and will not be exposed to air.</p>

The manufacturing process of an active matrix substrate of Embodiment 3 will be explained with references to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A to 19C</figref>. In this Embodiment, a method of simultaneously manufacturing a pixel TFT and a storage capacitor of a pixel portion, and a TFT of a driver circuit provided in the periphery of the pixel portion will be described in detail in accordance with the process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A to 21F</figref> are diagrams showing a manufacturing method of the connecting wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, a base film <b>602</b> formed from an insulating film made of a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, or a silicon nitride oxide film, is formed on the surface of a glass substrate <b>601</b>. In this Embodiment, the silicon nitride oxide film formed from SiH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O at a thickness of between 10 and 200 nm, and a hydrogenated silicon nitride oxide film <b>602</b> formed from SiH<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O at a thickness of between 50 and 200 nm (preferably between 100 and 150 nm) on the surface of the silicon nitride oxide film, are formed in lamination by plasma CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">An amorphous silicon film is next formed at a thickness of 55 nm by plasma CVD, and similar to Embodiment 1, is crystallized to thereby form a crystalline silicon film. Using a photomask PM<b>11</b>, a resist pattern is formed on the crystalline silicon film by a photolithography technique. A crystalline semiconductor film is divided into island shapes by dry etching to form island-like semiconductor films <b>604</b> to <b>608</b>. A gaseous mixture of CF<sub>4 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>is used in the dry etching of the crystalline silicon film. Then a gate insulating film <b>609</b> is formed from the silicon nitride oxide film at a film thickness of 120 nm by plasma CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Subsequently, in order to form the gate wiring on the gate insulating film <b>609</b>, a heat-resistant conductive film is formed from a lamination film of metallic films <b>611</b> and <b>612</b> and a transparent conductive film <b>613</b>. The metallic film <b>611</b> is formed of a WN film, the metallic film <b>612</b> is formed of a W film, and the transparent conductive film <b>613</b> is formed of an indium oxide zinc oxide alloy (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;ZnO).

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Utilizing a second photo mask PM<b>12</b>, resist masks RM<b>21</b> to RM<b>27</b> are formed by using a photolithography technique. The transparent conductive film <b>613</b> is etched to form gate wirings <b>618</b> to <b>622</b> and a storage capacitor <b>623</b>, and uppermost layers <b>618</b><i>a </i>to <b>623</b><i>a </i>and <b>683</b><i>a </i>of a connecting wiring <b>683</b>.

<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18B and 21B</figref>, a side surface of the uppermost layers <b>618</b><i>a </i>to <b>623</b><i>a </i>and <b>683</b><i>a</i>, formed of the transparent conductive film, is etched further back than the resist masks RM<b>21</b> to RM<b>27</b>. Next, the metallic films <b>611</b> and <b>613</b> are etched together to thereby complete the gate wirings <b>618</b> to <b>622</b> having taper shaped sectional surfaces, the capacitor wiring <b>623</b>, and the connecting wiring <b>683</b>.

<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The wirings <b>618</b> to <b>623</b> and <b>683</b> become a laminated structure consisting of the uppermost layers <b>618</b><i>a </i>to <b>623</b><i>a </i>and <b>683</b><i>a </i>formed of the transparent conductive film <b>613</b>, layers <b>618</b><i>b </i>to <b>623</b><i>b </i>and <b>683</b><i>b </i>formed of the metallic film <b>612</b>, and layers <b>618</b><i>c </i>to <b>623</b><i>c </i>and <b>683</b><i>c </i>formed of the metallic film <b>611</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">At this point, etching is performed such that a taper portion is formed at least in the edge portion of the gate wirings <b>618</b> to <b>622</b>. This etching process is carried out with the ICP etching device. Etching is performed under the following conditions: a gaseous mixture of CF<sub>4 </sub>and Cl<sub>2 </sub>is used as the etching gas with the quantity of flow set to 30 SCCM, respectively; discharge power is set to 3.2 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>(13.56 MHZ); bias power is set to 244 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>(13.56 MHZ); and pressure is set to 1.0 Pa. Due to such etching conditions, in the edge portion of the gate wirings <b>618</b> to <b>622</b>, a taper portion with a gradual increase in thickness from the edge portion inward, is formed with an angle of between 25&#xb0; and 35&#xb0;, preferably 30&#xb0;. The angle of the taper portion will greatly influence on a concentration incline of a low-concentration n-type impurity region, which afterwards will form an LDD region. Note that an angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> of the taper portion is expressed by Tan(&#x3b8;<b>1</b>)=HG/WG using the length (WG) and the thickness (HG) of the taper portion.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In addition, in order to perform etching without leaving any residue, over-etching is performed approximately between 10% and 20% to the thickness of the insulating film <b>609</b>. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the selective ratio of etching to a base film at this point. For example, as shown in table 1, the selective ratio of the W film to the silicon nitride oxide film (the gate insulating film <b>609</b>) is between 2 and 4 (typically 3). Due to this type of over-etching treatment, an exposed surface of the silicon nitride oxide film is etched between 20 and 50 nm, becoming substantially thinner to thereby form a new shape gate insulating film <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The process of doping an impurity element that imparts n-type (n<sup>&#x2212;</sup> dope process) is performed with the purpose of forming an LDD region of an n-channel TFT of the driver circuit and the pixel TFT. Resist masks <b>112</b> to <b>117</b> used for the formation of the gate electrode are kept intact, and using the gate wirings <b>618</b> to <b>622</b> having the taper portion in the edge portion as masks, phosphorous as the impurity element that imparts n-type is doped by ion doping in a self-aligning manner. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Here in this process, in order to dope the impurity element that imparts n-type so that it passes through the taper portion of the wirings <b>618</b> to <b>623</b> and the gate insulating film <b>610</b> reaching the semiconductor film positioned underneath, the acceleration voltage is set high, between 80 and 160 keV, and the dose quantity is set low, between 1&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>and 5&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>for the purpose of forming an LDD region. The concentration of the impurity element to be doped into the semiconductor film is doped in the concentration range of between 1&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>and 1&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. Low-concentration n-type impurity regions <b>624</b> to <b>629</b> are thus formed in the island-like semiconductor film as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In this process, in the low-concentration n-type impurity regions <b>624</b> to <b>628</b>, at least the concentration inclination of phosphorous that is included in the portions that are overlaped with the gate wirings <b>618</b> to <b>622</b> reflects the change in film thickness of the taper portion of the gate wiring <b>618</b> to <b>622</b>. In other words, in the region overlapping the gate wiring, low-concentration n-type impurity regions <b>624</b> to <b>628</b> gradually becomes higher towards the side surface of the gate wiring. This is because of the concentration change of phosphorous that has reached the semiconductor film due to the difference in the film thickness of the taper portion. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> is a diagram showing a perspective view of the low-concentration n-type impurity regions <b>624</b> to <b>628</b>. However, this diagram is not exactly a view showing the regions doped with phosphorous, but rather a view showing the above change in concentration of phosphorous occurring in accordance with the shape of the taper portion of the gate wirings <b>618</b> to <b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The formation of high-concentration n-type impurity regions for functioning as a source region or a drain region in the n channel TFT are performed next (n<sup>+</sup> dope process). Leaving the resist masks RM<b>21</b> to RM<b>26</b> intact, phosphorous is doped by the ion doping method under the condition of a low acceleration voltage of between 10 and 30 keV so that this time the gate wiring <b>618</b> to <b>622</b> functions as masks to shield phosphorous. The high-concentration n-type impurity regions <b>630</b> to <b>635</b> are thus formed. Since the gate insulating film <b>610</b> for covering these regions <b>630</b> to <b>635</b> has been treated with over-etching in the process forming the gate wiring, the film thickness of the gate insulating film has become thinner to between 70 and 100 nm compared with the initial thickness of 120 nm. Accordingly, phosphorous can be doped appropriately even under such a condition as low acceleration voltage. The concentration of phosphorous of these regions <b>630</b> to <b>635</b> is set to be in the concentration range of between 1&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>and 1&#xd7;10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.

<p id="p-0159" num="0158">High-concentration p-type impurity regions <b>636</b> and <b>637</b> as the source region and the drain region are formed in the island-like semiconductor films, <b>604</b> and <b>606</b> for forming the p channel TFT. Using the gate wirings <b>618</b> and <b>120</b> as masks here, an impurity element that imparts p-type is doped to thereby form the high-concentration p-type impurity regions <b>636</b> and <b>637</b> in a self-aligning manner. At this point, the island-like semiconductor films <b>605</b>, <b>107</b>, and <b>108</b> for forming the n-channel TFT are covered entirely with resist masks RM<b>29</b> through RM<b>31</b> formed by using the third photo mask PM<b>23</b>.

<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The impurity regions <b>636</b> and <b>637</b> to be formed here are formed by means of ion doping using diborane (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>).

In addition, because an impurity element is also doped into the impurity region that are overlaped with the gate wiring via the gate insulating film and the taper portion of the gate electrode, the region is formed as a substantially low-concentration p-type impurity region with the concentration set to at least 15&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or more. The concentration of boron (B) is set to be 1.5 to 3 times that of phosphorous doped in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>.

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Thereafter, a protecting insulating film <b>638</b> made of oxidized silicon nitride is formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 21D</figref>.

This process is to terminate the 10<sup>16 </sup>to 10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>of dangling bonds in the island-like semiconductor film by the thermally excited hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">After the completion of the activation and the hydrogenation processes, an interlayer insulating film <b>639</b> is formed so that an average film thickness thereof falls between 1.0 and 2.0 mm. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19B and 21E</figref>)</p>

<p id="p-0165" num="0164">This process is performed by means of dry etching.

Furthermore, in order to raise the selective ratio to the island-like semiconductor film, the etching gas is changed to CHF<sub>3 </sub>to etch the gate insulating film <b>610</b> whereby a contact hole can be nicely formed.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21E</figref>, because the side surface of the connecting wiring <b>683</b> is covered with the protecting film <b>673</b>, the surface of the layers <b>683</b><i>b </i>and <b>683</b><i>c</i>, formed from the metallic film of the connecting wiring <b>683</b>, is in a state surrounded by and in contact with the layer <b>683</b><i>a </i>formed from the transparent conductive film, the gate insulating film <b>610</b>, and the protecting film <b>673</b>.

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Such a portable information terminal is often used outdoors as well as indoors. To operate the terminal for a long time, a reflection type liquid crystal display device utilizing external light is more suitable for the low power consumption type than the type using back-light. However, when the environment is dark, a transmission type liquid crystal display device equipped with back-light is more suitable. Under such circumstances, a hybrid type liquid crystal display device having the features of both reflection type and transmission type has been developed. The present invention can be also applied to such a hybrid type liquid crystal display device.</p>
