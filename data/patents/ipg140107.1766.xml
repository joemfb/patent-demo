<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e)(1) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/330,441, filed May 3, 2010, entitled &#x201c;Rolled Mat Heat Exchanger and Method of Manufacture&#x201d;; and the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to fluid-to-fluid bundled tube heat exchangers and methods of manufacture. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to bundled capillary tube heat exchangers useful in cardiopulmonary bypass circuits and including a knitted or woven tube mat symmetrically wound about a mandrel, and related methods of manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fluid-to-fluid heat exchangers are used in many different industries, and are typically constructed in conjunction with the intended end use. For example, a heat exchanger is an important component of an extracorporeal or cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. As a point of reference, an extracorporeal blood circuit is commonly used during cardiopulmonary bypass (i.e., a heart-lung bypass machine) to withdraw blood from the venous portion of the patient's circulation system and return the blood to the arterial portion. The extracorporeal blood circuit generally includes a venous line, a venous blood reservoir, a blood pump, an oxygenator, a heat exchanger, an arterial line, and blood transporting tubing, ports, and connection pieces interconnecting the components. The oxygenator raises the oxygen content and reduces the carbon dioxide content of the blood arriving from the patient. The heat exchanger regulates a temperature of the extracorporeal blood as desired. For example, the heat exchanger can be located upstream of the oxygenator and operated to cool the blood arriving from the patient prior to oxygenation; alternatively, the heat exchanger can be operated to warm the extracorporeal blood.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Regardless of the direction of heat transfer between the heat exchanger and the patient's blood, extracorporeal blood circuit heat exchangers are generally made of a multiplicity of metal or plastic tubes; a suitable heat transfer fluid, such as water, is pumped the through the tube lumens while the blood flows about the tube exteriors. The heat exchange fluid can be heated or cooled (relative to a temperature of the blood). As blood contacts the tubes, heat transfer occurs between the blood and the heat exchange fluid in an intended direction. Alternatively, blood flow can be through the tube lumens, with the heat exchange fluid flowing about the tube exteriors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">So as to have minimal impact on the circuit's prime volume, the extracorporeal heat exchanger is desirably as small as possible while still providing high heat exchange efficiency. To meet these requirements, extracorporeal heat exchanger tubes are micro-diameter or fiber-like (e.g., outer diameter of 0.05 inches or less), and are oftentimes referred to as capillary tubes. The heat exchange fluid is fluidly isolated from blood of the extracorporeal circuit by a wall thickness of the capillary tubes, keeping the fluids separate but allowing the transfer of heat from one fluid to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A common capillary tube format pre-assembles a large number of the micro-diameter tubes into a mat. The tubes are held together with threads forming the warp of the mat. The tube mat is then wrapped in some fashion to form a capillary tube bundle useful for heat exchanger applications. Typically, the mat is wrapped or rolled around a core or mandrel. As the mat is continuously wound about the mandrel, the mat winds onto itself, resulting in series of radially increasing layers. In light of this well-accepted heat exchanger bundling practice, the capillary tubes of the mat are &#x201c;biased&#x201d; so that the tubes are not parallel with a width of the mat. The purpose of the bias angle in the capillary tubes is to prevent the capillaries of subsequent layers from nesting in the gaps between the capillary tubes of an immediately preceding layer as the mat is wound onto itself. The tube angle orientation alternates from layer-to-layer. This arrangement is reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> described in greater detail below, and generally entails the tubes of an outer layer and the tubes of an immediately underlying layer being arranged at a crossing angle relative to each other. This crossing angle effect is commonly achieved by forming the bundled construction from a single, pre-made mat having two layers arranged with the alternating tube orientation, or by arranging two separately made mats at opposing tube angles and then wrapping the two mats as a pair.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, when using a cylindrical mandrel or core to form the capillary tube bundle, an edge of each of a pair of mat layers with alternating tube orientations are attached to one side of the mandrel and then rolled. While viable, this technique inherently results in an asymmetrical arrangement of the bundled mat (and thus of the mat tubes) relative to an axis of the mandrel. This asymmetry, in turn, may undesirably result in uneven flow distribution through the resultant heat exchanger. Further, because heat exchanger tube mats are commonly provided as dual layer or dual ply structures, an edge of the inner layer is attached to the cylindrical mandrel and then the dual layer mat is wrapped about the mandrel. Not only does this approach create the asymmetrical bundle construction described above, but has the further inherent drawback of the outer layer taking a longer path than the inner layer when wrapping about a curved surface. This inherent constraint limits a curvature of the wrap and thus how small the device can be made. Along these same lines, because the outer layer will take a longer path than the inner layer (when being wrapped about a cylindrical mandrel), if the inner and outer mat layers have the same length when flat, after being wrapped around the mandrel, the outer layer ends much sooner than the inner layer. This undesirable difference accumulates as additional layers are added. Even further, the tension required when rolling the mat is different for the outer layer as compared to the inner layer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Rolled mat heat exchangers are widely regarded as uniquely providing the small footprint and high heat exchange efficiency requirements of extracorporeal circuits, at an economically viable cost. Any improvements to rolled mat heat exchanger performance and/or techniques for manufacturing a roiled mat heat exchanger will be well-received.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some aspects in accordance with principles of the present disclosure relate to a method of manufacturing a bundled mat construction for use in a heat exchanger. First and second capillary tube mat segments are attached to opposing sides of a mandrel. In this regard, the mat segments can be provided as part of a single capillary mat, or can be two separate mats. Regardless, the mandrel is rolled relative to the mat segments to generate a bundled mat construction. By attaching the mat segments at diametrically opposite sides of the mandrel and then rolling the mandrel, methods of the present disclosure beneficially create symmetrical bundled mat constructions. Further, methods of the present disclosure can produce multi-layered bundled mat constructions in a simplified, consistent manner. The rolled mat constructions of the present disclosure are highly useful in extracorporeal blood circuit heat exchangers.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">One embodiment of a rolled mat heat exchanger <b>20</b> in accordance with principles of the present disclosure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>. The heat exchanger <b>20</b> includes a bundled mat construction <b>22</b> (illustrated schematically) of micro-diameter heat transfer elements (e.g., capillary tubes), a mandrel or core <b>24</b> and optional bands <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>. Details on the various components are provided below. In general terms, however, the bundled mat construction <b>22</b> is formed about the mandrel <b>24</b> pursuant to the methodologies described below, with the bands <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>(where provided) serving to secure the bundled mat construction <b>22</b> about the mandrel <b>24</b>. The heat exchanger <b>20</b> can be employed in various end-use applications, but has particular usefulness as part of an extracorporeal circuit. In some embodiments, the heat exchanger <b>20</b> is connected within the extracorporeal circuit (or other environment requiring transfer of heat between fluids) as a standalone device (e.g., the heat exchanger <b>20</b> is part of a heat exchanger apparatus, assembled within a separate housing to establish fluid connections and flow paths for the blood and heat exchange fluid); alternatively, heat exchangers of the present disclosure can be assembled to, or formed as part of, a combination extracorporeal blood circuit apparatus or device, such as a combination oxygenator and heat exchanger apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The bundled mat construction <b>22</b> includes one or more capillary mats <b>28</b> (or mat segments) wound or rolled about the mandrel <b>24</b> that each consist of a plurality of hollow heat transfer elements in the form of micro-diameter capillary tubes or fibers <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The capillary tubes <b>30</b> are formed of a thermally conductive polymer or metal, for example polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polyurethane. The tubes <b>30</b> typically have, but are not limited to, an outer diameter in the range of 0.010 inch to 0.050 inch, and an inner diameter in the range of 0.005 inch to 0.030 inch, although other dimensions are also contemplated. The tubes <b>30</b> can be arranged at an angle or bias from normal (i.e., relative to a central axis of the mandrel <b>24</b>) as reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, for example at about a 15 degree angle relative to the central axis of the mandrel <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). Where the bundled mat construction <b>22</b> forms two (or more) layers radially arranged one layer over the other, the tubes <b>30</b> of immediately adjacent layers (in rolled form) can be angled with respect to one another (e.g., the bias of the tubes <b>30</b> in one layer opposes the bias of the tubes <b>30</b> in the immediately adjacent layer). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates that a bias of the tubes <b>30</b> of an outer layer <b>32</b> opposes a bias of the tubes <b>30</b> of an immediately underlying layer <b>34</b>. For example, where the tubes <b>30</b> are arranged at a 15 degree angle from the central axis and immediately adjacent layers are arranged such that they have opposing biases, the net resulting bias for the tubes <b>30</b> between the two layers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> is 30 degrees. A purpose for the opposing biases is to prevent any nesting of the tubes <b>30</b> between the two layers, which could result in increased resistance to liquid flow (e.g., blood flow), and undesirable and unpredictable shear on the liquid (e.g., blood) flowing there through (i.e., between the tubes <b>30</b>). Alternatively, the tubes <b>30</b> can have other angles or biases relative to the central axis, and can be parallel to the central axis.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The tubes <b>30</b> (within each layer of the bundled mat construction <b>22</b>) can be held together by one or more threads or other warp carrier structure. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a plurality of the tubes <b>30</b> knitted together in a spaced apart relationship by a warp carrier <b>40</b>. The warp carrier <b>40</b> can include threads assuming various forms such as a multi-filament thread, ribbon, tape, etc. Other warp carriers and weaving techniques are also envisioned by the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One preferred pre-made heat exchanger capillary mat <b>28</b> useful with the bundled mat construction <b>22</b> is known as HEX PET&#x2122;, available from Membrana of Charlotte, N.C., and generally comprise a single warp layer of capillary tubes or hollow micro-fibers made of PET. In other embodiments, the pre-made capillary mat <b>28</b> consists of two (or more) layers of capillary tubes held together by thread, ribbon, etc. Other heat exchanger mat constructions are equally acceptable. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, regardless of an exact format of the capillary mat <b>28</b>, the bundled mat construction <b>22</b> can be one or more lengths of heat exchanger mats <b>28</b> cut to a certain length and then wrapped about the mandrel <b>24</b>, or can be initially wrapped about a secondary core or mandrel (having a shape and size corresponding with a cylindrical shape of the heat exchanger mandrel <b>24</b>), and then removed from the secondary mandrel and placed concentrically about the heat exchanger mandrel <b>24</b>. With either approach, aspects of the present disclosure implicate bundled mat construction <b>22</b> manufacturing techniques presenting marked improvements over conventional approaches.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> schematically illustrates one heat exchanger bundled mat bundling process in accordance with principles of the present disclosure. A heat exchanger capillary mat <b>100</b> (as described above with respect to the capillary mat <b>28</b>) is provided, along with a mandrel <b>102</b>. The mandrel <b>102</b> can be the heat exchanger mandrel <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), or can be the secondary mandrel or core mentioned previously. Regardless, the capillary mat <b>100</b> includes the tubes <b>30</b> as described above, held together by one (or more) of the warp carriers <b>40</b>. Prior to bundling, several of the tubes <b>30</b> are removed from the pre-made capillary mat <b>100</b>, while corresponding segments of the warp carriers <b>40</b> are left intact to define an open zone <b>104</b>. The mandrel <b>102</b> is inserted within the open zone <b>104</b>, and is connected to one or more of the warp carriers <b>40</b>. In this regard, the mandrel <b>102</b> can include or form fingers <b>106</b> that slidably capture one or more of the warp carriers <b>40</b>. Once inserted, the mandrel <b>102</b> effectively divides the capillary mat <b>100</b> into first and second segments <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>. The segments <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are disposed at opposite sides of the mandrel <b>102</b>. As best reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the tubes <b>30</b> are biased or non-parallel with a central axis C of the mandrel <b>102</b>. The mandrel <b>102</b> is then rolled in the direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to wrap the segments <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> about the mandrel <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Rolling of the mandrel <b>102</b> can continue for the number revolutions (or partial revolutions) necessary to achieve a desired size of the resultant bundled mat construction <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). By providing the two mats segments <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> at diametrically opposite locations relative to the mandrel <b>102</b>, the resultant bundled mat construction is symmetrical (relative to the central axis C of the mandrel <b>102</b>). This symmetrical arrangement is in direct contrast to conventional bundling techniques, and beneficially provides for even distribution of flow through the bundled mat construction <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It will be recognized that following the initial, approximately one-half revolution of the mandrel <b>102</b>, the first mat segment <b>108</b> will begin overlapping the second mat segment <b>110</b> (i.e., a leading edge <b>112</b> of the second mat segment <b>110</b> will be disposed underneath a layer of the first mat segment <b>108</b>), and the second mat segment <b>110</b> will similarly begin overlapping the first mat segment <b>108</b>. As a result, the bundled mat construction <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) can have two (or more) overlapping tube mat layers, with the layers arranged to provide the tube crossing angle between overlapping layers (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). Because this resultant dual or multi layer construction is generated via the two discrete mats segments <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, the mandrel curvature limitations inherently raised by conventional manufacturing processes in which a single mat having a dual layer construction is wrapped about a mandrel are not present. Thus, the mandrel <b>102</b> can have a relative small radius (as compare to mandrels employed with conventional rolled mat heat exchangers), resulting in a more compact construction. With extracorporeal circuit heat exchanger applications, this compact construction desirably reduces the circuit's prime volume. Further, and unlike conventional manufacturing processes using a single mat having dual layer construction, the mats segments <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> can have identical lengths before and after rolling, and an identical tension can be applied to the mats segments <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> during rolling, thereby simplifying the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, tension is maintained in the mat segments <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> while rolling the mandrel <b>102</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates first and second tension devices <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>114</b><i>b </i>connected to a trailing end <b>116</b><i>a</i>, <b>116</b><i>b </i>of the mat segments <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, respectively. The tension devices <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>114</b><i>b </i>can assume any form known in the art (e.g., mechanical, pneumatic and electromagnetic brakes, servo control payout systems, etc.), and can be operable to vary an applied tension during the rolling or winding process. The tension affects or controls spacing between the capillary tubes <b>30</b> of each wound layer. For example, the applied tension can be incrementally increased (or decreased) as each layer is wound. In other embodiments, a tension applied by the first tension device <b>114</b><i>a </i>can differ from that of the second tension device <b>114</b><i>a </i>throughout the winding procedure or at various points during winding (e.g., the first tension device <b>114</b><i>a </i>can impart an elevated tension to the first mat segment <b>108</b> as compared to a tension applied by the second tension device <b>114</b><i>b </i>to the second mat segment <b>110</b>, or vice-versa). Alternatively, the mat segments <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> can be connected to a single tension device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Another heat exchanger mat bundling process in accordance with principles of the present disclosure is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. First and second heat exchanger capillary tube mats <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> (as described above) are provided, along with an appropriately sized and shaped mandrel <b>124</b>. The mandrel <b>124</b> can be the heat exchanger mandrel <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), or can be the secondary mandrel or core mentioned previously. A leading edge <b>126</b> of the first capillary mat <b>120</b> is attached to a first side <b>128</b> of the mandrel <b>124</b>. Similarly, a leading edge <b>130</b> of the second capillary mat <b>122</b> is attached to a second side <b>132</b> of the mandrel <b>124</b>, with the so-selected sides <b>128</b>, <b>132</b> being opposite one another. As a point of clarification, because the mandrel <b>124</b> is cylindrical, the sides <b>128</b>, <b>132</b> may not be discernable features of the mandrel <b>124</b>; as such, reference to &#x201c;first and second sides of the mandrel&#x201d; in the context of the present disclosure means that the leading edges <b>126</b>, <b>130</b> are attached to the mandrel <b>124</b> at diametrically opposite positions. Where the capillary mats <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> are single layer capillary tube mats formed to provide the angled or biased orientation of the corresponding tubes, the mats <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> are arranged relative to the mandrel <b>124</b> such that the tube angle orientation of the first mat <b>120</b> is in opposition to the tube angle orientation of the second mat <b>122</b>. Further, the tube <b>30</b> of both mats <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> are biased relative to the central axis of the mandrel <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Once the first and second mats <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> are attached to the mandrel <b>124</b>, the mandrel <b>124</b> is rolled in the direction indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As a result, the first and second mats <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> wrap about the mandrel <b>124</b> commensurate with the above description. Tension can be applied to the mats <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> during winding as described above. The resultant bundled mat construction <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) is symmetrical relative to a central axis of the mandrel <b>124</b>, and may have a multi-layer construction. The benefits associated with the techniques of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> apply equally to the methodologies of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Another heat exchanger mat bundling process in accordance with principles of the present disclosure is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. First and second heat exchanger capillary mats <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> (as described above) are provided, along with a mandrel <b>154</b>. The mandrel <b>154</b> can be the heat exchanger mandrel <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), or can be the secondary mandrel or core mentioned previously. With the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, however, the mandrel <b>154</b> includes opposing radial steps or offsets <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>, each defining a radial shoulder <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>, respectively, relative to a central axis of the mandrel <b>154</b>. The shoulders <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are diametrically opposed to one another, and a radial extension of the shoulders <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> approximates (e.g., equals) a thickness of the mats <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Manufacturing of a bundled mat construction includes attaching a leading edge <b>164</b> of the first mat <b>150</b> to the first shoulder <b>160</b>, and a leading edge <b>166</b> of the second mat <b>152</b> to the second shoulder <b>162</b>. The mandrel <b>154</b> is then rolled in the direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to wrap the mats <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> about the mandrel <b>154</b> in manners commensurate with the above descriptions with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>. Tension can be applied to the mats <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> during winding as described above. The resultant bundled mat construction <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) is symmetrical relative to a central axis of the mandrel <b>154</b>, and may have a multi-layer construction. Further, the radial offsets <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> provide a smooth transition of the mats <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> from a surface of the mandrel <b>154</b> following the initial one-half revolution. For example, near the end of the first one-half revolution of the mandrel <b>154</b>, the region of the first mat <b>150</b> being wound over the mandrel <b>154</b> will transition from the surface of the mandrel <b>154</b> and on to the previously-applied region of the second mat <b>152</b>, with the first mat <b>150</b> smoothly transitioning off of the second shoulder <b>162</b> and onto the previously-applied region of the second mat <b>152</b>. The benefits described above with respect to the techniques of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> apply equally to the methodologies of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Regardless of the selected manufacturing technique, and returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the resultant bundled mat construction <b>22</b> is applied to the mandrel <b>24</b>. Once again, the bundled mat construction <b>22</b> can be directly wrapped over the mandrel <b>24</b>, in accordance with the above descriptions, or can be wound about a secondary mandrel and subsequently placed over the heat exchanger mandrel <b>24</b>. The heat exchanger mandrel <b>24</b> can assume a variety of forms, and generally defines an inlet <b>200</b>, a passageway <b>202</b>, and one or more outlet openings <b>204</b>. The inlet <b>200</b> is fluidly open to the passageway <b>202</b>, as are the outlet openings <b>204</b>. With embodiments in which the heat exchanger <b>20</b> is intended to impart a radially outward flow pattern onto liquid flowing through the passageway <b>202</b> (and otherwise entering the passageway <b>202</b> via the inlet <b>200</b>), the openings <b>204</b> can be formed along an intermediate portion of the mandrel <b>24</b>, projecting through a wall thickness thereof. Other locations for the outlet opening(s) <b>204</b> are equally acceptable. Several other non-limiting examples of mandrels <b>24</b>A-<b>24</b>D useful with the present disclosure are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the optional bands <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>can be assembled to opposing ends of the bundled mat construction <b>22</b>. The bands <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>hold the bundled mat construction <b>22</b> about the mandrel <b>24</b> in a manner permitting flow of a heat exchange fluid through the tubes (not separately shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) of the bundled mat construction <b>22</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> references a fluid entry side <b>220</b> collectively defined by the capillary tubes, and a corresponding fluid exit side <b>222</b>. Optionally, the entry and exit sides <b>220</b>, <b>222</b> can be embedded in a solidified potting compound as known to those of ordinary skill in the art. As shown, the bands <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>are constructed so as to not impede delivery of fluid to the entry side <b>220</b> or draining of fluid from the exit side <b>222</b>. The bands <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>can assume a number of forms differing from those reflected by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, and in other embodiments can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The heat exchanger <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> can be assembled within a separate outer housing (akin to the housing described below) that establishes or forms fluid pathways for blood and heat exchange fluid within an extracorporeal blood circuit. Cardiopulmonary support heat exchanger housings are known for those of skill, for example the housings provided with an ECMOtherm II&#xae; heat exchanger apparatus or BIOtherm&#x2122; heat exchanger apparatus, both available from Medtronic, Inc., of Minneapolis, Minn. As a point of reference, the term &#x201c;heat exchanger&#x201d; includes the bundled mat construction <b>22</b> and the heat exchanger mandrel (or core) <b>34</b>. The so-defined heat exchanger <b>20</b> can be utilized as part of a standalone, finished heat exchanger apparatus or device that otherwise includes an outer housing and various fluid ports. Alternatively, the so-defined heat exchanger <b>20</b> can serve as the subassembly of a combination extracorporeal blood circuit apparatus that performs heat exchange and one or more additional functions.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As an alternative to the standalone heat exchanger apparatus, rolled mat heat exchangers of the present disclosure (and in particular the bundled mat construction <b>22</b>) can be incorporated into or as part of other fluid handling devices performing differing or additional functions. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a combination oxygenator and heat exchanger apparatus <b>250</b> incorporating the rolled mat heat exchanger <b>20</b>. The apparatus <b>250</b> further includes an oxygenator <b>252</b> and various housing components (referenced generally at <b>254</b><i>a</i>-<b>254</b><i>c</i>). The oxygenator <b>252</b> can assume any form known in the art, as can the housing components <b>254</b><i>a</i>-<b>254</b><i>c</i>. For ease of illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the mandrel <b>24</b> apart from the bundled mat construction <b>22</b>. In other embodiments, the apparatus <b>250</b> can include a separate supportive core over which the heat exchanger mandrel <b>24</b> is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows, in simplified form, fluid flow through the apparatus <b>250</b>. When used for extracorporeal circuit blood handling, the heat exchanger <b>20</b> may either heat or cool the blood flowing through the apparatus <b>250</b>. Since hypothermia may be used during cardiac surgery (especially in infant and pediatric surgeries) to reduce oxygen demand, and since rapid re-warming of the blood undesirably produces bubble emboli, the heat exchanger <b>20</b> is generally used to gradually re-warm blood and prevent emboli formation. The heat transfer medium used in the heat exchanger <b>20</b> may comprise water or other suitable fluids. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> includes arrows (labeled as &#x201c;FLUID&#x201d;) that show the flow of a heat transfer medium through the heat exchanger <b>20</b>, with entry at a fluid inlet port <b>256</b> and exit at a fluid outlet port <b>258</b>. After flowing through the heat exchanger <b>20</b>, blood moves sequentially and radially outward and through the oxygenator <b>252</b> that is arranged around the heat exchanger <b>20</b>. The direction of blood flow is indicated by arrows (labeled as &#x201c;BLOOD&#x201d;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> also includes arrows that show the flow of an oxygen-containing gas medium through the oxygenator <b>252</b> (labeled as &#x201c;GAS&#x201d;). The oxygenator <b>252</b> may concentrically surround the heat exchanger <b>20</b>. Also, the oxygenator <b>252</b> may be wound on the heat exchanger <b>20</b> (e.g., as one or more continuous microporous hollow fibers). It will be understood that the heat exchanger <b>20</b> of the present disclosure can be incorporated into a plethora of other apparatuses that may or may not include the oxygenator <b>252</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The rolled capillary tube mat heat exchangers, and methods of manufacture thereof, of the present disclosure provide marked improvements over existing devices and methods.
