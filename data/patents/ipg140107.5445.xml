<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosed technology relates generally to outsourcing or crowd sourcing jobs and tasks while providing sophisticated worker performance tracking for quality enhancement and cost effectiveness.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Outsourcing mundane tasks and jobs to online labor around the globe has demonstrated potential in assisting entities and individuals complete a large amount of tasks in a time efficient manner. However, given the variability in labor pool, education level, age group, the results of the completed tasks are frequently less than ideal. Although entities could utilize crowd sourcing to have tasks completed in a short amount of time for a reasonable cost, the quality is typically highly variable and frequently unreliable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Crowd sourcing is a growing industry, and online platforms exist for completion of tasks and microtasks. Labor-on-demand platforms provide APIs for application development and an international payment infrastructure for the deployment and implementation of crowd sourced tasks. Crowd sourcing has become a global phenomenon with a low barrier to entry. Millions of people around the world now participate in a digital and virtual workplace. However, the breadth and diversity among crowd sourcing participants, workers and researchers is immense and poses a challenge to implement adequate quality control mechanisms to account for a wide range of worker behavior: scammers, lazy workers, ethical workers, unethical workers, slow learners, etc. in a resource effective manner.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, the client devices <b>102</b> can include mobile, hand held or portable devices or non-portable devices and can be any of, but not limited to, a server desktop, a desktop computer, a computer cluster, or portable devices including, a notebook, a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a palmtop computer, a mobile phone, a cell phone, a smart phone, a PDA, a Blackberry device, a Treo, a handheld tablet (e.g. an iPad, a Galaxy, Xoom Tablet, etc.), a tablet PC, a thin-client, a hand held console, a hand held gaming device or console, an iPhone, and/or any other portable, mobile, hand held devices, etc. The input mechanism on client devices <b>102</b> can include touch screen keypad (including single touch, multi-touch, gesture sensing in 2D or 3D, etc.), a physical keypad, a mouse, a pointer, a track pad, motion detector (e.g., including 1-axis, 2-axis, 3-axis accelerometer, etc.), a light sensor, capacitance sensor, resistance sensor, temperature sensor, proximity sensor, a piezoelectric device, device orientation detector (e.g., electronic compass, tilt sensor, rotation sensor, gyroscope, accelerometer), or a combination of the above.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The client devices <b>102</b>A-N, worker channels <b>108</b>, workers (or contributors) <b>122</b>, gaming server <b>110</b>, third party social network server <b>112</b>, payment processing server <b>114</b>, and/or mobile credit payment server <b>116</b>, can be coupled to a network <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the devices <b>102</b>A-N and host server <b>100</b> may be directly connected to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the host server <b>100</b> is operable to perform crowd sourcing services and/or to process crowd sourcing requests for entities (e.g., companies, organizations or other types of institutions) or users (e.g., individual or groups of users). The host server <b>100</b> can distribute a task to be crowd sourced to multiple workers (who may be located through various different channels <b>108</b>A-N) and provide sophisticated quality control and cost management mechanisms, including tracking worker data over a period of time to provide an indication of worker preference, level of expertise, responsiveness, value of work, performance, speed, and other like performance/quality metrics for the worker or the generated work product.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The host server <b>100</b> of the job distribution platform utilizes workers from multiple worker pools via different channels <b>108</b>. The host server <b>100</b> can have a partnering relationship with one or more of the channels <b>108</b> Channels can be chosen by demographic requirements such as location and general age/sex of the worker pool. When a contributor completes the work required, the job distribution platform can inform the partner (or channel) that a transaction has completed for a specified amount. The partner can then award the contributor some percentage of the amount in either virtual or real currency. The access to multiple worker pools allows the job distribution platform access to a larger group of workers/contributors and enhances scalability and diversifies worker base. The worker pool which is used for a given job or task can be selected manually by the person posting the task and/or determined in part or in whole by the host server <b>100</b>. Some pools have limitations, for example, some do not allow adult content, others do not provide the cultural or language needs of the task.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Quality control and the amount of quality desired can be configured by the requesting entity or user such that for example, a user or entity is only charged for the task if completed to the desired or target accuracy level. The channels <b>110</b> through which labor can be identified can include by way of example, but not limitation, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Give Work, SamaSource, Trial Pay (e.g., a virtual currency provider), third party social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace, third-party social network server <b>112</b>) or gaming platforms (e.g., Gambit, Prodege, etc.) New and additional labor forces are constantly being integrated into the system and partnering with the host <b>100</b>, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The host server <b>100</b>, can in addition, also utilize social networks or social network servers (e.g., the 3rd party social network server <b>112</b>) to aggregate, parse, and/or identify information such as preferences, likes/dislikes, language proficiency, general proficiency, interests, hobbies, expertise related information about workers or contributors which can be used in a worker profile and used as factors in selecting suitable workers for a given job or task.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some instances, the host server <b>100</b> utilizes an online gaming service or platform (e.g., through a third-party gaming server <b>110</b> or other partnering platform) through which to distribute tasks or unit jobs and tasks. Gaming services which provide games to various types of online or web-based platforms can also be partnered with the host server <b>100</b> of the job distribution platform. Note that the host server <b>100</b> may also host gaming services via one or more gaming platforms. The unit jobs can be distributed to garners or other visitors on the gaming platform. In one embodiment, the workers utilized in an online game can be paid in virtual currency, such as virtual currency that can be used to play games on the gaming server <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some instances, the host server <b>100</b> utilizes a payment processing server <b>114</b> to facilitate payment of workers or contributors <b>122</b> in money. The payment processing server <b>114</b> can be integrated or operated by the same entity as the host server <b>100</b> of the job distribution platform, or it may be operated by a third party. The host server <b>100</b> manages the payment preferences of a given worker and ensure, for example, through the payment processing server <b>114</b> that the worker gets paid in the desired currency (e.g., U.S. dollars, Euro, etc.), at the desired frequency, in a desired channel (e.g., online, PayPal, direct bank account deposit, physical check, money order), in a desired format (e.g., money, mobile credits, gaming credits, or other types of virtual currency, etc.). For example, the host server <b>100</b> can also interact with a mobile credit payment service or mobile credit payment server <b>116</b> to facilitate the payment of workers or contributors with mobile credits. The mobile credit payment server <b>116</b> may be operated by a wireless network operator or another third party entity. In some instances, the host server <b>100</b> internally has mobile credit payment services which operates in whole or in part the payment/compensation of workers in mobile credits.</p>

The module, manager, tracker, agent, handler, or engine can include general or special purpose hardware, firmware, or software embodied in a computer-readable (storage) medium for execution by the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used herein, a computer-readable medium or computer-readable storage medium is intended to include all mediums that are statutory (e.g., in the United States, under 35 U.S.C. 101), and to specifically exclude all mediums that are non-statutory in nature to the extent that the exclusion is necessary for a claim that includes the computer-readable (storage) medium to be valid. Known statutory computer-readable mediums include hardware (e.g., registers, random access memory (RAM), non-volatile (NV) storage, to name a few), but may or may not be limited to hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">One embodiment of the host server <b>200</b> includes an attribute module <b>202</b>. The attribute module <b>202</b> can be any combination of software agents and/or hardware modules (e.g., including processors and/or memory units) able to identify, detect, extract, an attribute of a task, which generally includes multiple units.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An attribute of a task can include, by way of example but not limitation, level of difficulty of the task, level of subjectivity, etc. Task attributes can be specified or measured by an amount of time that is needed to complete the task. In addition, the attribute can include determining target accuracy specified by the entity or user requesting the crowd sourcing services.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Task attributes can be determined during a calibration process when the requesting entity is setting up jobs or tasks to be distributed to on-demand labor for completion. Timing, wages, and target accuracy can be determined and computed for a unit job or task.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">One embodiment of the host server <b>200</b> includes a task configuration module <b>204</b>. The task configuration module <b>204</b> can be any combination of software agents and/or hardware modules (e.g., including processors and/or memory units) able to configure a task or unit jobs for quality control and based on a user's specified parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, the task configuration module <b>204</b> allows the user to upload or edit tasks/unit jobs via a web interface. In addition, the task configuration module <b>204</b> calibrates a task by identifying its attributes or attributes of a single unit job. For example, the task configuration module <b>204</b> determines the amount of time needed a certain unit job or task requires. This information can be used to determine the wage to pay a worker when they have completed their jobs, for example, by the wage setting agent <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">One embodiment of the host server <b>200</b> includes a wage setting agent <b>206</b>. The wage setting agent <b>206</b> can be any combination of software agents and/or hardware modules (e.g., including processors and/or memory units) able to set a wage amount that is offered to a worker for completing a unit job of the task based on the attribute and the target accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In general, the wage setting agent <b>206</b> can set the wage based on one or more of the attributes, level of target accuracy, the requestor's budget, etc. In addition, the requesting entity/user can specify a desired level of wage to pay each worker. In one embodiment, the system sets the wage dynamically. For example, the initial calibration of the wage can be an estimate and the actual wage is calculated as the job progresses. The system can continue to track the amount of time/resources needed by workers to complete a job. This way, the system can compensate for jobs that are taking workers different amounts of time from what was originally estimated. For example, while most jobs end up around $x/hr, but jobs that are extremely time sensitive can be much higher (e.g., as much as 4-20&#xd7;/hr). There is also a direct correlation between quality of the work and payment amount. Using the wage amount, the agent <b>206</b> can also determine the total cost to the requesting entity to complete the task using the total number of job units in the task. The wage setting agent <b>206</b> is configured such that the requestor (entity or user) can tweak the total cost by adjusting, one or more of, the target level of accuracy and the desired/ideal level of wage for paying the workers.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">One embodiment of the host server <b>200</b> includes an accuracy manager module <b>208</b>. The accuracy manager module <b>208</b> be any combination of software agents and/or hardware modules (e.g., including processors and/or memory units) able to determine, set, identify, the target accuracy in completion of the task by the entity.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The target accuracy can be, for example, specified by the entity/user requesting that a task be distributed to multiple workers (e.g., including online labor, on-demand labor) for completion. The target accuracy can be specified during calibration. The user/entity and indicate whether more or less accuracy is desired. Generally more accurate results require additional results to be obtained per job unit, thus potentially increasing the total cost to complete the task. In some instances, the target accuracy may be set by default rather than user customized.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">One embodiment of the host server <b>200</b> includes a quality control module <b>210</b>. The quality control module <b>210</b> can be any combination of software agents and/or hardware modules (e.g., including processors and/or memory units) able to implement quality control mechanisms to ensure that the results of the completion of the task are of a quality expected by the requestor.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The quality control module <b>210</b> can compute the number of results (e.g., judgments) needed per job unit based on the target accuracy. To compute the number of results, in one embodiment, a minimum number of judgments is initially set. If the measure of agreement is below a predefined percentage once the minimum number of judgments has been collected, more judgments can be collected until the predefined agreement has been met. A maximum number of judgments can also be set, for example to ensure jobs run within budget.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, the quality control module <b>210</b> can manage the standards for each task used for quality control. For example, the quality control module <b>210</b> enables the requesting entity/user to specify a select set of unit jobs that are presented to online labor units for the entity to evaluate quality of task completion. The questions can be added. In general, the types of tasks that are good for the quality control are those with a right or wrong answer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">For these questions, the correct answers or responses are typically specified. The user/entity can also monitor/track the efficacy of the selected questions. A user can see each selected question and whether workers have correctly answered these questions. The user can also see, access, and/or track how many workers have responded to a selected question. Using the statistics, the user can modify the selection accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Using these questions, the quality control module <b>210</b> can determine the quality of the work and the quality of a particular worker's work product. For example, the quality control module <b>210</b> may include a statistics tracking module which tracks, collects and/or aggregates statistics of the online labor units completing the select jobs. In most instances, workers are able to choose any job that has been assigned as long as they meet certain requirements (e.g., age and/or language, etc.). However, workers can also be prohibited from working on a single job, single type of job, or all jobs. For example, workers history, statistics, and performance, can be used to target jobs to workers based on what they have performed well on. Workers are typically allowed to attempt any job they have not been blocked from. If it is the first time they have seen the task they will only be asked known questions. If they have not answered a pre-defined number of questions correctly within a certain time period they are typically not allowed to perform the actual task.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">One embodiment of the host server <b>200</b> includes a worker selection module <b>212</b>. The worker selection module <b>212</b> can be any combination of software agents and/or hardware modules (e.g., including processors and/or memory units) able to select workers (e.g., online workers, on-demand labor, etc.) to whom to distribute unit jobs of a task.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The worker selection module <b>212</b> can select a channel based on the user/entity's selection (e.g., Mechanical Turk, Crowdflower, Gambit (e.g., a third party gaming platform), Give Work, SamaSource, Trial Pay (e.g., a virtual currency provider), Gambit, Internal, etc.). New and additional labor forces are constantly being integrated into the system, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Based on the selected channel, the task distributor can then distribute jobs to various workers for completion of unit jobs in the task.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one embodiment, the selected channel is an online gaming environment in which garners or other users are presented with unit jobs while playing games or doing something else. These users can be paid in virtual currency, for example, that they can use in the online gaming environment. Such a process can be performed by the gaming service manager. The gaming server manager can manage games internal to the host server <b>200</b> or manage communications with an external gaming server (e.g., the gaming server <b>110</b> shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The tasks can be presented on a site hosted by the server <b>200</b> of presented to workers on the third party site.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, the gaming server manager in the worker channel selection module <b>212</b> communicates with the wage setting agent <b>206</b> to determine the wage that a worker/gamer would be entitled to upon completion of a unit job or task. The gaming server manager can then determine the amount of virtual currency to which the wage converts. The gaming server manager then communicate the tasks to be presented via the gaming site to the third party gaming server.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">One embodiment of the host server <b>200</b> includes a worker manager and tracker module <b>220</b>. The worker channel selection module <b>212</b> can be any combination of software agents and/or hardware modules (e.g., including processors and/or memory units) able to detect, track, compute, generate, determine, and/or identify job performance data or job performance-related data for multiple workers/contributors via the job distribution platform. Other types of worker information may also be tracked and generated for multiple workers in various worker pools (channels), for example, psych questions or other more subjective data collected from a worker or contributor in addition to performance.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Worker information including job performance data, can be tracked over a period of time (e.g., historical performance data) for a worker. For example, performance data can be tracked for a given task, a given job (a job can include multiple tasks), a session (e.g., a worker can work on multiple jobs and tasks during a given work session), a day, a week, a month, a year, etc. Useful statistical data can be generated or computed by the manager and tracker module <b>220</b> for the job distribution platform to more effectively and efficiently control quality of work product, extract/determine meaningful information about each individual worker/contributor, and/or allow jobs/projects to be more effectively cost managed. By tracking, aggregating, and storing performance data for multiple users across several worker pools, the job distribution platform can have access to useful information for distributing work and managing quality and cost.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, a &#x201c;module,&#x201d; a &#x201c;manager,&#x201d; an &#x201c;agent,&#x201d; a &#x201c;tracker,&#x201d; a &#x201c;handler,&#x201d; a &#x201c;detector,&#x201d; an &#x201c;interface,&#x201d; or an &#x201c;engine&#x201d; includes a general purpose, dedicated or shared processor and, typically, firmware or software modules that are executed by the processor. Depending upon implementation-specific or other considerations, the module, manager, tracker, agent, handler, or engine can be centralized or its functionality distributed. The module, manager, tracker, agent, handler, or engine can include general or special purpose hardware, firmware, or software embodied in a computer-readable (storage) medium for execution by the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As used herein, a computer-readable medium or computer-readable storage medium is intended to include all mediums that are statutory (e.g., in the United States, under 35 U.S.C. 101), and to specifically exclude all mediums that are non-statutory in nature to the extent that the exclusion is necessary for a claim that includes the computer-readable (storage) medium to be valid. Known statutory computer-readable mediums include hardware (e.g., registers, random access memory (RAM), non-volatile (NV) storage, to name a few), but may or may not be limited to hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">One embodiment of the worker manager/tracker <b>220</b> includes a job history tracker module <b>225</b>. The job history tracker module <b>225</b> can be any combination of software agents and/or hardware modules (e.g., including processors and/or memory units) able to monitor, track, determine, record, tasks, microtasks, jobs, projects that workers or contributors have worked on through the job distribution platform hosted by server <b>200</b>. Job attributes, owners, details and the knowledge/expertise involved in each job/task/project can be determined, tracked, recorded for each worker or contributor performing the job and stored (e.g., in repository <b>132</b>) in association with any quality or performance data for the worker.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The job history tracker module can track and store the jobs performed by workers in a given session (e.g., by the session tracker <b>226</b>). For example, a worker can perform several jobs in a given work session (e.g., from the time a worker logs in to access work distributed by the job distribution platform to when the user logs out or times out, or stops working for a certain amount of time). A work session can also have a default time period duration (e.g., one day, a certain number of hours, user gets logged out of the system, a few days, etc.) as specified by the worker, job distribution platform, or a given job.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In a given work session, a worker/contributor can work on several projects or jobs, with each project or job having several tasks. The session tracker <b>226</b> can track the projects, jobs, and/or tasks that the worker has worked on in a given session and generate or compute statistics (e.g., job performance metrics) for a given project, job, or task in a given session or across multiple sessions. The statuses of the various projects, jobs, and/or tasks performed in a session can also be determined and stored. For example, the session tracker <b>226</b> can track one or more tasks that span current jobs and a history of previous jobs distributed to the worker and job performance data for the worker is collected for current and previous jobs.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Similarly, the job history tracker module can track the tasks performed by workers in a given job or across multiple jobs (e.g., by the job tracker module <b>227</b>). The job tracker <b>227</b> can identify, record, and store tasks assigned to and/or performed on, worked on by the workers/contributors. The job tracker module <b>227</b> can track a history of previous jobs having tasks a worker has worked on. The statuses of various jobs and/or tasks worked on by workers/contributors can be determined and/or recorded. The worker tracker <b>228</b> can track workers that have worked in the sessions, jobs, projects, and on tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one embodiment, the worker tracker <b>228</b> assigns a unique identifier (e.g., using the ID tracker <b>229</b>) to each unique worker/contributor who has worked on tasks assigned via the job distribution platform. The unique identifier can be used to identify worker profile information and/or worker performance data. The unique identifier can be assigned to the worker to be associated with the worker across various jobs and tasks. The worker manager/tracker <b>220</b> can also track a worker based on the worker pool or channel though which the worker is connected to the job distribution platform, for example, by the channel tracker <b>230</b>. In some instances, a given worker may be a part of multiple worker pools and the unique worker ID can be assigned to a given worker regardless of their multiple worker pool affiliations.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The performance data generator <b>250</b> of the worker manager/tracker module <b>220</b> can be any combination of software agents and/or hardware modules (e.g., including processors and/or memory units) able to monitor, track, determine, record, job performance data over a period of time for workers/contributors performing work through the job distribution platform that crowd sources tasks to multiple workers.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In general, the job performance data can be collected when the worker performs the tasks distributed online to their respective computing devices by the job distribution platform. In one embodiment, the job performance data includes quantitative metrics which can be determined or computed by the performance agent <b>235</b> for various performance and/or quality measures. For example, the rejection and judgment tracker <b>236</b> can detect and record results submitted by a worker/contributor that were rejected as faulty or accepted as a correct result (e.g., a judgment). Managing the distribution of tasks can be performed by a task requisition system, for example, using a custom implementation of the in-memory repository or database (e.g., Redis). The repository can be optimized for ensuring redundancy and performing the corresponding de-duplication. For instance, de-duplication can be implemented such that no contributor or worker sees the same task more than a specified number (e.g., once, twice, three times, etc.). If a contributor or worker is rejected, the tasks they had previously completed can be re-routed to other contributors or workers.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In one embodiment, the job performance data includes quantitative metrics indicating a rate or number of instances of bans from the system of flags from assigned jobs, for example, by the bans or flag tracker <b>237</b>. In general, a &#x2018;flagged&#x2019; worker prevents the workers or contributors from continuing to work on a specific task, or set of tasks. If a worker is banned, it is generally a one time event, and prevents a worker from doing future work through the platform.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A worker/contributor may be banned from performing work through the platform or flagged from performing specific jobs or tasks when the quality or speed of the work does not meet a threshold, which can be set by the job or the job distribution platform. For example, a worker/contributor may be temporarily or permanently suspended from a job if a number of results they provided are inaccurate, or if they submit a certain number of inaccurate results in a certain amount of time, or if the worker does not complete a task within a specified time frame (e.g., by the job poster or the job distribution platform).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one embodiment, the job performance data includes quantitative metrics indicating a rate or number of instances of the worker has been flagged for performance review but not actually banned from a job or task, for example, by the performance flagging agent <b>238</b>. Flagging can occur manually or programmatically after certain thresholds have been met. For example, flagging occurs after a peer review system has indicated a contributor is not performing accordingly or showing indicators of poor performance (e.g., spelling mistakes, irrelevant answers, or any other subjective requirements detectable by reviewers). A worker/contributor may be flagged when their performance (e.g., as indicated by one or more performance metrics of quality or speed) falls below a certain threshold, which may be set by a job requestor and/or in part or in whole determined by the job distribution platform. The rate or number of instances when the worker has been flagged for performance review can be used in assessing overall quality/performance of the worker.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one embodiment, the performance data generator <b>250</b> tracks a rate or time with which the worker completes the one or more tasks, for example, via the speed tracker <b>255</b>. The speed tracker <b>255</b> can also determine the speed, rate with which, or amount of time it takes a worker to complete a job, on average over a period of time, over a set of tasks, or over a set of jobs, for example. The rate or time with which the worker completes a task can be used as an indication in a worker profile of how efficient the worker is.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The speed tracker <b>255</b> can also track instances when the worker performs or completes a task exceeding a rate or speed, which may be an indication that a worker is not paying attention to performing the assigned tasks. As such, the job performance data can include quantitative metrics indicating a rate or number when the worker has performed or completed one or more tasks exceeding a rate or speed. In addition, the job performance data can include quantitative metrics indicating an average rate or speed with which the worker can satisfactorily complete a task, which can be used as an indicator for efficiency and/or accuracy of the worker. Each or any of the above metrics of job performance can be tracked for workers for a given job, a work session, or a number of tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one embodiment, the value assessor <b>260</b> determines the value, either quantitative or qualitative value, of work generated by workers/contributors. For example, the financial/monetary value of work generated by workers can be determined by module <b>262</b> and included as a quantitative metric of job performance data stored for a given worker/contributor. In one embodiment, the quality assessor <b>240</b> can determine the accuracy of work generated by the worker using test jobs (e.g., jobs or tasks with known responses/answers). Using test jobs/tasks with known responses/answers, the quality/accuracy of a worker's work product can directly be determined and used in computing a quantitative metric indicating the accuracy of a worker's work product. Quality assessment using test jobs/tasks can be performed by the gold standard metric module <b>242</b>. In addition, the quality assessment can be performed by the peer review metric module <b>241</b>, where a worker's work product can be evaluated using results generated by other workers (e.g., determine whether they match or not).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">One embodiment of the performance data generator <b>250</b> includes an experience level assessor <b>265</b> which can determine an experience level of the worker based on duration or tenure with the job distribution platform. The job performance data for workers can thus include quantitative and/or qualitative metrics indicating the experience level of the worker. In addition, experience level can be determined with respect to specific types of jobs/tasks (e.g., business listing verification, content generation, adult-content detection, search result verification, etc.), or with respect to specific disciplines (e.g., art, computer science, math, language, etc.) and indicated in the job performance data of the user profile.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one embodiment, satisfaction and/or frustration level with the job distribution platform is determined, for example, by the worker sentiment determination engine <b>270</b> to be included in the profile data. For instance, quantitative metrics indicating the satisfaction or frustration levels can be included in a worker's profile data.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In one embodiment, the profile data further includes, identification of devices used by the worker to perform tasks distributed by the job distribution platform or a preference of the worker to use one or more devices to work on tasks or specific types of tasks. The devices can be identified by the worker preference engine <b>275</b>, or the device identifier <b>245</b>. In general, the worker preference engine <b>275</b> can determine, identify, track, record, or store the preferences of the workers. Worker preferences can be explicitly specified by the worker, determined from the worker pool or specific channel through which the worker is accessed, and/or inferred from worker behavior by the job distribution platform. Worker preferences can include an indication of a preferred time of day to perform tasks (e.g., by the work time preference handler <b>278</b>), indication of willingness to perform tasks involving objectionable content or adult content (e.g., by the objectionable content preference handler <b>277</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Worker preferences can further include compensation preferences, which can specify preferred wage, preferred currency, and preferred type of currency and/or specify preferred payment mechanism including one or more of, direct deposit, indirect deposit, or mobile credits. Compensation preferences may be determined, tracked, and/or managed by the payment preferences handler <b>276</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The user profile for workers can also include static profile data created or aggregated by the static profile aggregator <b>280</b>. For example, demographic profile information (e.g., including, but not limited to, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, education, location, etc.) of workers can be determined, tracked, received, processed, recorded and managed by the demographic information generator <b>281</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The user profile can also include dynamic profile data which can be collected, aggregated, determined, detected, inferred, tracked, processed, received, stored and/or recorded by the dynamic profile data aggregator <b>285</b>. For example, employment status information for workers can be determined and tracked by the employment information manager <b>286</b>. Social profile data and/or professional profile data can also be aggregated for workers, for example from social network services including third party social networks and servers. Dynamical profile elements generated from historical work data can also be used. For example, the aggregator <b>285</b> can determine or track workers' historical speed, accuracy, or answer distribution and make this information queryable through the contributor profile. The aggregator <b>285</b> can also apply learning algorithms to good signals to predict future performance of a worker.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The worker profile generator <b>290</b> can use any combination of or all of the above user data including, but not limited to, quantitative and/or qualitative performance metrics for worker performance quality indicating accuracy, efficiency, knowledge, financial value, and/or expertise, worker preference (explicit or non-explicit), static or dynamic profile data (e.g., demographic information, real-life employment information, social network, presence, location information) to generate a worker profile for the worker.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The worker profile or any of the information contained therein can be used by the worker selection engine <b>295</b> in selecting a suitable worker from the repeat workers for a given task. For example, a given worker or workers can be selected to perform the new job based on worker preferences indicating willingness or unwillingness to work on objectionable or controversial content, or other criteria related to experience level, efficiency, or overall quality/accuracy.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The performance and profile data can include information aggregated or determined by the worker manager/tracker <b>220</b> shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the various components therein. As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the worker profile elements can include static data <b>334</b>, dynamic data <b>336</b>, worker preference information <b>338</b>, and/or performance data <b>340</b>.
