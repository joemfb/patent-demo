<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to vehicle suspension assemblies. More particularly, the invention relates to axle mounting assemblies for trailers. Still more particularly the present invention relates to alignment apparatus for a trailing beam hanger assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A trailing beam suspension typically utilizes a beam having a leading end opposite a trailing end. The beam is mounted lengthwise to a hanger at its leading end for swinging movement about an axis transverse to a trailer. The hanger is typically secured to a chassis or frame of the trailer by suitable means such as welding. A suspension unit such as an air bag extends between the trailing end of the beam and the chassis of the trailer. An axle is mounted to the beam transverse to the beam between the leading and trailing ends of the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The above suspension arrangement is referred to as a &#x201c;trailing beam&#x201d; suspension because the beam extends rearwardly from its connection to the hanger and accordingly the axle &#x201c;trails&#x201d; the pivot point of the suspension system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In assembling a trailer, there is a need, because of manufacturing tolerances, to provide for some fore and aft adjustment of the axle relative to the hanger to ensure that the axle is orthogonal to a centre line of the trailer. In its simplest form, the adjustment may simply be effected by providing slots in the hangers for receiving a pivot member about which the beam swings to enable fore/aft movement of the pivot member during assembly subsequent to which the components may be secured by friction (bolting), welding or both.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A disadvantage with simply providing a slot to enable movement is that it lacks apparatus for effecting the movement. Accordingly, external force needs to be applied to the beam or the axle to move the pivot member fore and aft. This makes minute adjustments somewhat difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Screw type adjusters which act between the pivot member and the hanger have been proposed, however, such adjusters must be made quite robust and as well, the hanger suitably braced, for such to be effective. In any case, the screw generally cannot be relied upon to control fore/aft movement and accordingly, absent welding the components in place after adjustment, there is a risk of movement of the pivot member in the slot and ensuing misalignment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Its is an object of the present invention to provide a trailing beam hanger and alignment apparatus which overcomes at least some of the problems associated with prior devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides an eccentric pivot member for effecting fore/aft movement of the leading end of the beam in response to rotation of the pivot member. Ratchet collars are provided to mechanically secure the assembly against rotation and any associated inadvertent misalignment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">More particularly, a mounting and alignment apparatus is provided for a trailing beam hanger having walls at least partially defining a box with an opening for receiving a leading end of the trailing beam. The hanger is securable to a trailer with the opening facing in a rearward direction. The walls include a pair of spaced apart sidewalls for receiving the leading end of the trailing beam therebetween. The apparatus includes an eccentric pivot bolt having a center section between threaded, generally coaxial end sections. The center section is larger in diameter than the end sections and has a center section axis generally parallel to but non-coaxial with an axis of the end sections. The center section of the eccentric pivot bolt is receivable in a rigid center tube of a bushing mounted in a passage extending transversely through the leading end of the trailing beam. A first ratchet collar extends about and is secured to one of the end sections. The first ratchet collar has a flange extending through the passage to abut the center tube. A second ratchet collar is rigidly secured to the eccentric pivot bolt. The second ratchet collar has a grippable portion associated therewith for facilitating rotation of the second ratchet portion along with the eccentric pivot bolt about the axis of the end section. The first and second ratchet collars engage each other to provide at least unidirectional rotation of the second ratchet collar relative to the first ratchet collar. A hanger side reinforcement extends about the other of the end sections, the hanger side reinforcement has a raised collar for extending through an adjacent of the thrust washers to abut against the center tube. A nut threadedly engages the other of the end sections for acting against the hanger side reinforcement to urge the first and second ratchet collars toward each other to secure the ratchet collars and in turn the pivot bolt against rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The apparatus may include a spring extending between the nut and the hanger side reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A washer may extend between the nut and the spring.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The spring may be one or more disc springs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The grippable portion may be a nut welded to the second ratchet collar.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The center tube is surrounded by a resilient material to provide cushioning between the hanger and the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first and second ratchet collars may have teeth which mesh with each other and which are profiled to cause unidirectional rotation corresponding with a tightening direction of the nut to restrain the ratchet collars from moving relative to each other in such a manner as to cause loosening of the components of the apparatus.</p>

In response, the axis <b>43</b> of the center section <b>42</b> can move fore and aft of the axis <b>45</b> of the end sections.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The leading end <b>32</b> of the trailing beam <b>30</b> has a transversely extending passage <b>34</b> which receives a bushing <b>50</b>. The bushing <b>50</b> typically has a resilient shell <b>54</b> of an elastometric material surrounding a rigid tubular, typically steel, center tube <b>52</b>. The center tube <b>52</b> in turn receives the center section <b>42</b> of the pivot bolt <b>40</b>. The bushing <b>50</b> both mounts the leading end <b>32</b> to the hanger <b>20</b> and isolates the hanger from road shock transmitted along the trailing beam <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Respective wear discs <b>60</b> extend about the end sections <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> on opposite sides of the leading end <b>32</b> of the trailing beam <b>30</b>. The wear discs <b>60</b> have an opening <b>62</b> having a diameter at least as large as the ends of the center tube <b>52</b> of the bushing <b>50</b> so as not to interfere with the center tube <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A first ratchet collar <b>70</b> extends about the end section <b>46</b> of the pivot bolt <b>40</b> adjacent an outer face of one of the sidewalls <b>24</b>, to which it is secured (welded). The first ratchet collar <b>70</b> has a flange <b>71</b> extending through opening <b>25</b> in the adjacent sidewall <b>24</b> to abut bushing <b>50</b>. The first ratchet collar <b>70</b> has outwardly facing teeth <b>72</b>. A second ratchet collar <b>74</b> is mounted over the same end section <b>46</b> as is the first ratchet collar <b>70</b>. The second ratchet collar has inwardly facing teeth <b>76</b> which face and engage with the outwardly facing teeth <b>72</b> of the first ratchet collar <b>70</b>. The first and second ratchet collars, <b>70</b> and <b>74</b> respectively, fit closely over the end section <b>46</b>. The flange <b>71</b> fits closely within the opening <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The second ratchet collar <b>74</b> may be welded to a nut <b>80</b> which is in turn welded to the end section <b>46</b>. The nut <b>80</b> provides a grippable portion associated with the second ratchet collar <b>74</b> to facilitate co-rotation of the pivot bolt <b>40</b> and the second ratchet collar <b>74</b>. Other arrangements are no doubt possible, such as, providing facets on the second ratchet member <b>74</b> or welding the nut to the pivot bolt <b>40</b> directly without welding it to the second ratchet member <b>74</b>. Basically, what is desired is some provision to facilitate rotation of the pivot bolt, preferably using a simple tool, such as a wrench.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The teeth <b>72</b> and <b>76</b> of the first and second ratchet collars <b>70</b> and <b>74</b> respectively are preferably configured to allow rotation of the first and second ratchet collars relative to each other in a tightening direction and to block rotation in the opposite, loosening direction. As discussed below, such an arrangement ensures against loosening of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A hanger side reinforcement <b>90</b> is welded to the sidewall <b>24</b>, aligning passage <b>92</b> with opening <b>29</b> in hanger sidewall. The hanger side reinforcement <b>90</b> is a cylindrical disc having a passage <b>92</b> therethrough for receiving the end section <b>44</b>. The opening in the sidewall <b>25</b> should be large enough to admit the end section <b>44</b> of the pivot bolt <b>40</b> therethrough. The opening in the hanger would typically be sized to closely receive the end section <b>44</b> it surrounds to constrain the end section <b>44</b> against fore and aft movement (toward and away from the forward wall <b>22</b>). Accordingly, rotation of the end sections <b>44</b> &#x26; <b>46</b> about their axes will result in fore and aft movement of the center section <b>42</b> and in turn, fore and aft movement of the trailing beam <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One or more disc springs <b>100</b> are mounted over the end section <b>44</b> outboard of the hanger side reinforcement <b>90</b>. Two are illustrated. Resilient means other than a disc spring may be workable. The disc springs <b>100</b> should, preferably in an uncompressed state, allow enough axial movement of the pivot bolt <b>40</b> to enable the teeth of the first and second ratchet members, <b>70</b> and <b>74</b> respectively, to move into and out of meshing engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A washer <b>110</b> and locknut <b>120</b> complete the assembly. The washer <b>110</b> mounts over the end section <b>44</b>, engages the disc spring <b>100</b> on one side and is engaged by the locknut <b>120</b> on its opposite side. The locknut <b>120</b> threadedly engages the end section <b>44</b>. Tightening the locknut <b>120</b> causes the disc springs <b>100</b> to be compressed into a collapsed configuration and urges the first and second ratchet collars, <b>70</b> and <b>74</b> respectively, toward each other to lock the pivot bolt <b>40</b> against rotation. Preferably the teeth <b>72</b> and <b>76</b> of the first and second ratchet collars <b>70</b> and <b>74</b> respectively are configured (profiled) to block rotation in the loosening direction of the pivot bolt <b>40</b> and locknut <b>120</b>, assembly. The trailing beam <b>30</b> should be firmly mounted in the hanger <b>20</b> without binding and without excessive side-play. Accordingly, the amount of clamping force applied to the center tube <b>52</b> of the bushing <b>50</b> should be controlled, for example, by having the flange <b>71</b> and the sidewalls <b>24</b> abut against respective ends of the center tube <b>52</b> of the bushing <b>50</b>. Assuming the flange <b>71</b> and sidewalls <b>24</b> are correctly dimensioned, the spring washers <b>100</b> and the hanger side reinforcement <b>90</b>, which is welded to hanger side <b>24</b> and the tightening of the locknut <b>120</b> compresses the center tube <b>52</b> against the ratchet collar <b>70</b> and the hanger sidewall <b>24</b>.</p>
