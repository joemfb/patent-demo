<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Patent Application No. 2008-313368 filed on Dec. 9, 2008, in the Japan Patent Office, of which the contents are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a fuel cell stack comprising a stack body formed by stacking a plurality of unit cells in a horizontal direction, and a casing containing the stack body. Each of the unit cells is formed by sandwiching an electrolyte electrode assembly between separators. The electrolyte electrode assembly includes a pair of electrodes and an electrolyte interposed between the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, a solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell employs an electrolyte membrane (electrolyte). The electrolyte membrane is a polymer ion exchange membrane. The electrolyte membrane is interposed between an anode and a cathode to form a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The membrane electrode assembly and separators sandwiching the membrane electrode assembly make up a unit cell for generating electricity. In use, typically, a predetermined number (e.g., several tens to hundreds) of unit cells are stacked together to form a fuel cell stack for achieving the desired level of power generation output.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The fuel cell stack has the stack body formed by stacking a predetermined number of unit cells and a box-shaped casing containing the stack body. In order to suppress the increase in the weight and dimensions of the entire fuel cell stack, in most cases, the casing is made of thin metal plates. Under the circumstances, the stack body formed by stacking a large number of unit cells is considerably heavy. Therefore, since an excessively large load of the stack body is applied to the bottom of the casing, the bottom of the casing may be deformed undesirably.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this regard, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a fuel cell disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 08-171926 includes a lower case <b>1</b>, and the lower case <b>1</b> is made up of a bottom part <b>2</b> and side parts <b>3</b>. The bottom part <b>2</b> has an upwardly protruding curved portion <b>4</b>, and curved portions <b>5</b> adjacent to the respective side parts <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, a downwardly protruding curved portion <b>6</b> is formed at the bottom part <b>2</b>. The curved portions <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> are used for positioning components stacked into a stack body (not shown). Moreover, the curved portions <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> achieve improvement in the rigidity of the lower case <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the conventional technique, in particular, when the heavy stack body is disposed in the lower case <b>1</b>, a considerably large load is applied to the bottom part <b>2</b>. In particular, an excessively large load tends to be applied to the curved portion <b>4</b>. Therefore, the bottom part <b>2</b> tends to be deformed easily in a direction to open the curved portion <b>4</b> (toward the side plates <b>3</b>).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has been made to solve the problem of this type, and an object of the present invention is to provide a fuel cell stack which makes it possible to achieve reduction in the thickness and the weight of a casing, and reliably support the load of a stack body to suitably prevent deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention relates to a fuel cell stack comprising a stack body formed by stacking a plurality of unit cells in a horizontal direction, and a casing containing the stack body. Each of the unit cells is formed by sandwiching an electrolyte electrode assembly between separators. The electrolyte electrode assembly includes a pair of electrodes and an electrolyte interposed between the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The casing has a bottom plate member including a ridge for receiving a load of the stack body, and a separate reinforcement member bridging a recess of the back surface of the ridge is provided on the bottom plate member.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the present invention, the load of the stack body is supported by a relatively low ridge provided integrally with the bottom plate member of the casing. By the reinforcement member bridging the recess, which corresponds to the back surface of the ridge, deformation in a direction to open the ridge is prevented. In the structure, reduction in the thickness and the cost of the casing itself is achieved. Further, it becomes possible to improve the rigidity in cross section, the flexural elasticity, and the shearing reaction force, and thus, obtain the lightweight casing having high rigidity. Further, the height of the ridge is reduced effectively, and the overall height of the casing is reduced as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown by way of illustrative example.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a ridge <b>64</b> is formed integrally, at the center of the side panel (bottom plate member) <b>18</b><i>d </i>of the casing <b>14</b> in a width direction indicated by an arrow B. The ridge <b>64</b> abuts against the load receivers <b>60</b> and receives the loads of the fuel cell units <b>12</b>. The ridge <b>64</b> extends in a longitudinal direction of the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>indicated by an arrow A (stacking direction of the fuel cell unit <b>12</b>). The side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>has a plurality of separate reinforcement plates (reinforcement members) <b>66</b> bridging a recess <b>64</b><i>a</i>, which forms the back surface of the ridge <b>64</b>.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the reinforcement plate <b>66</b> bridging the recess <b>64</b><i>a </i>has a flat shape, and is provided on the outer surface of the side panel <b>18</b><i>d</i>. Both ends of the reinforcement plate <b>66</b> are fixed to welding points <b>68</b> of the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>by spot welding. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the reinforcement plates <b>66</b> are fixed to the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>at intervals of L<b>1</b> in the direction indicated by the arrow A. It should be noted that the reinforcement plates <b>66</b> may be fixed to the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>by other fixing methods such as crimping or brazing, or using rivets or screws.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The coupling portions of the side panels <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>are fixed together by bolt members <b>70</b> and nuts <b>72</b>. Tip ends of the bolt members <b>70</b> are screwed into the nuts <b>72</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Operation of the fuel cell stack <b>10</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Firstly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the fuel cell stack <b>10</b>, an oxygen-containing gas (air) is supplied to the oxygen-containing gas supply passage <b>30</b><i>a</i>, and a fuel gas such as a hydrogen-containing gas is supplied to the fuel gas supply passage <b>32</b><i>a</i>. Further, pure water, ethylene glycol, oil or the like is supplied to the two coolant supply passages <b>34</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the oxygen-containing gas is supplied to the oxygen-containing gas supply passage <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the fuel cell unit <b>12</b> in the direction indicated by the arrow A, and flows into the first oxygen-containing gas flow field <b>46</b> of the second separator <b>26</b> and the second oxygen-containing gas flow field <b>50</b> of the third separator <b>28</b>. The oxygen-containing gas supplied into the first oxygen-containing gas flow field <b>46</b> flows along the cathode <b>40</b> of the first membrane electrode assembly <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and the oxygen-containing gas supplied into the second oxygen-containing gas flow field <b>50</b> flows along the cathode <b>40</b> of the second membrane electrode assembly <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The fuel gas is supplied through the fuel gas supply passage <b>32</b><i>a </i>into the first fuel gas flow field <b>42</b> of the first separator <b>24</b> and the second fuel gas flow field <b>48</b> of the second separator <b>26</b>. Thus, the fuel gas flows along the anodes <b>38</b> of the first membrane electrode assembly <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the second membrane electrode assembly <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Thus, in each of the first membrane electrode assemblies <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the second membrane electrode assemblies <b>22</b><i>b</i>, the oxygen-containing gas supplied to the cathode <b>40</b>, and the fuel gas supplied to the anode <b>38</b> are consumed in the electrochemical reactions at catalyst layers (not shown) of the cathode <b>40</b> and the anode <b>38</b> for generating electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Then, the oxygen-containing gas after partially consumed at each cathode <b>40</b> flows into the oxygen-containing gas discharge passage <b>30</b><i>b</i>, and is discharged from the fuel cell stack <b>10</b>. Likewise, the fuel gas after partially consumed at each anode <b>38</b> flows into the fuel gas discharge passage <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and is discharged from the fuel cell stack <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, the coolant flows from the coolant supply passages <b>34</b><i>a </i>to the coolant flow field <b>44</b> between the fuel cell units <b>12</b>, and flows in the direction indicated by the arrow B. After the coolant is used for skip cooling of the first membrane electrode assembly <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the second membrane electrode assembly <b>22</b><i>b</i>, the coolant flows through the coolant discharge passages <b>34</b><i>b</i>, and is discharged from the fuel cell stack <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the fuel cell stack <b>10</b>, a plurality of the fuel cell units <b>12</b> are disposed in the casing <b>14</b>. The load of the fuel cell units <b>12</b> is applied to the single ridge <b>64</b> formed integrally with the side panel <b>18</b><i>d</i>. Therefore, as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the downward deflection force in a direction indicated by the arrow C<b>1</b> is applied to the ridge <b>64</b>. Therefore, the ridge <b>64</b> tends to be deformed in a direction to open the recess <b>64</b><i>a </i>(in the directions indicated by arrows B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this regard, in the first embodiment, the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>has the separate reinforcement plates <b>66</b> bridging the recess <b>64</b><i>a</i>, which is the back surface of the ridge <b>64</b>. Therefore, in the side panel <b>18</b><i>d</i>, deformation in the directions indicated by the arrow B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> due to the deflection force applied in the direction indicated by the arrow C<b>1</b> is prevented reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Specifically, in each of a conventional example where no reinforcement plates <b>66</b> are provided and the first embodiment, an experiment was conducted for detecting the relationship between the number of times of starting operation and the deflection amount in the stacking direction. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the conventional example, every time operation of the fuel cell is started particularly at low temperature, the deflection load is increased and the deflection amount is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the first embodiment, reduction in the thickness and the cost of the casing <b>14</b> itself is achieved. Further, it becomes possible to improve the rigidity in cross section, the flexural rigidity, and the shearing reaction force, and thus, obtain the lightweight casing <b>14</b> having high rigidity.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, the height of the ridge <b>64</b> is reduced effectively, and the overall height of the casing <b>14</b> is reduced as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a bottom view of a fuel cell stack <b>80</b> according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The constituent elements that are identical to those of the fuel cell stack <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment are labeled with the same reference numerals, and description thereof will be omitted. In third and other embodiments described later, the constituent elements that are identical to those of the fuel cell stack <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment are labeled with the same reference numerals and description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A plurality of reinforcement plates <b>66</b> bridging the recess <b>64</b><i>a </i>are fixed individually to the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>of the fuel cell stack <b>80</b>. The interval between the reinforcement plates <b>66</b> at both ends of the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>in the direction indicated by the arrow A is L<b>1</b>, and the interval between the reinforcement plates <b>66</b> at the center of the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>in the longitudinal direction indicated by the arrow A is L<b>2</b>. The interval L<b>2</b> is smaller than the interval L<b>1</b> (L<b>2</b>&#x3c;L<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the second embodiment, the interval L<b>2</b> between the reinforcement plates <b>66</b> at the center of the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>in the direction indicated by the arrow A is smaller than the interval L<b>1</b>. Owing thereto, in the side panel <b>18</b><i>d</i>, in particular, the reinforcement plates <b>66</b> are fixed mainly to the central portion in the longitudinal direction where the deflection force is large in comparison with the other portions. Therefore, the deflection force is distributed further reliably. Accordingly, in the second embodiment, the same advantages as in the case of the first embodiment are obtained. Additionally, further improvement in the rigidity of the casing <b>14</b> is achieved reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a partial exploded perspective view of a fuel cell stack <b>90</b> according to a third embodiment of the preset invention.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the fuel cell stack <b>90</b>, a reinforcement plate (reinforcement member) <b>92</b> is provided on the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>of the casing <b>14</b>. The reinforcement plate <b>92</b> is a plate having narrow portions <b>92</b><i>a </i>at both ends in the direction indicated by the arrow A. Further, holes <b>92</b><i>b </i>are formed in the respective narrow portions <b>92</b><i>a </i>for weight reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The reinforcement plate <b>92</b> is fixed to the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>at a plurality of welding points <b>94</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a predetermined number of the welding points <b>94</b> are formed in each of both sides of the recess <b>64</b><i>a. </i>Specifically, the welding points <b>94</b> are arranged in one line on each side of both end portions in the direction indicated by the arrow A, and the welding points <b>94</b> are arranged in two lines on each side of the center portion in the direction indicated by the arrow A. A drainage hole <b>96</b> is provided at substantially the central position of the reinforcement plate <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the third embodiment, in correspondence with the area where the load may be applied to the casing <b>14</b> and deformation of the casing <b>14</b> may occur, the shape of the reinforcement plate <b>92</b> and distribution of the welding points <b>94</b> are determined. Specifically, at both ends of the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>in the direction indicated by the arrow A where the deformation and load are small, the narrow portions <b>92</b><i>a </i>and the holes <b>92</b><i>b </i>are provided in order to reduce the weight of the reinforcement plate <b>92</b>. Further, at the center of the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>in the direction indicated by the arrow A where the deformation and load are large, the welding points <b>94</b> are arranged in two lines on each of both sides of the recess <b>64</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the third embodiment, the deflection force applied to the center of the side panel <b>18</b><i>d </i>can be supported reliably and easily. Accordingly, the same advantages as in the cases of the first and second embodiments are achieved. For example, deformation of the casing <b>14</b> is prevented as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, the drainage hole <b>96</b> is provided at the portion where the maximum deformation tends to be caused, i.e., at the center of the reinforcement plate <b>92</b>. The condensed water in the fuel cell stack <b>90</b> and water introduced into the casing <b>14</b> is eliminated through the drainage hole <b>96</b>. Thus, improvement in the rust prevention property and insulating property is achieved suitably.</p>
