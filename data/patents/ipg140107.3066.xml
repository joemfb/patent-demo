<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 2010-0042787, filed on May 7, 2010 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Example embodiments relate to a multilayer stretchable cable for minimizing electromagnetic interference of an electric signal and at the same time transmitting the resultant electric signal at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a stretchable cable or circuit has flexibility as a result of having a flexible printed circuit (FPC) or flexible flat cable (FFC), and also has elasticity. If the stretchable cable or circuit is used for a hinge or driver that repeatedly moves, a structure of a product may be more simplified and a design time may be shortened. In addition, the stretchable cable or circuit can manufactured with relative ease, such that production costs thereof can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to transmit an electric signal at high speed, a cable structure composed of a signal line and a ground line is desired. In order to minimize electromagnetic interference of an electric signal and transmit the resultant electric signal at high speed, a predetermined/desired distance between the signal line and the ground line should be maintained. However, if a conventional stretchable cable or circuit is used for a manufactured product that transmits an electric signal at high speed, a distance between the signal line and the ground line is changed when either the cable or circuit is stretched, such that electromagnetic interference occurs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an example embodiment, a multilayer stretchable cable includes a multilayer stretchable film and a plurality of conductive lines in the multilayer stretchable film. The conductive lines are in at least two different layers of the multilayer stretchable film in a thickness direction of the stretchable film, at least one conductive line is a signal line and at least one other conductive line in a layer adjacent to the signal line is a ground line. The signal line and the ground line are in zigzag patterns and are parallel to a width direction of the multilayer stretchable film.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an example embodiment, the signal line and the ground line are mapped to each other on a one-to-one basis. The zigzag patterns of the signal and ground lines cross each other.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an example embodiment, the signal lines on a same layer are parallel to each other in a width direction of the stretchable cable and are spaced apart from each other at a desired distance. A pitch between the signal line and the ground line on different layers is 5 mm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an example embodiment, the ground line is on upper and lower layers of the signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an example embodiment, a shield plane is on an upper layer of the signal line and on a lower layer of the ground line.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an example embodiment, the shield plane has a beehive-shaped mesh structure in which thin lines are repeatedly entwined with each other.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are plan views illustrating a multilayer stretchable cable according to an example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, a stretchable cable is divided into two layers. The stretchable cable may include a plurality of conductive lines <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> arranged at each of the two layers, and a stretchable film <b>1</b> serving as an insulator covering the conductive lines. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the conductive lines <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are curved in a zigzag manner, and are arranged parallel to a cable-width direction <b>4</b> on each layer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the conductive lines <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are curved in a manner that the zigzagged shape is repeated in a horseshoe-shaped fat mat, such that the conductive lines can be arranged parallel to a cable-width direction <b>4</b> on each layer.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the stretchable film <b>1</b> is stretched by external stress, the zigzagged arrangement or the horseshoe-shaped arrangement may be stretched with the stretchable film <b>1</b>. The zigzagged patterns are not limited only to a triangular- or horseshoe-shaped pattern, and may also include any zigzag pattern as required by design.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each conductive line has a relatively thin thickness and/or a relatively small diameter (about 0.01&#x2dc;5 mm), and both ends thereof may be connected to a predetermined/desired connector, or may be directly connected to a terminal of a circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The conductive line may be comprised of a conductive metal wire, or may also be comprised of a conductive yarn or a bundle of twisted conductive yarns. In order to form the conductive yarn, a conductive metal (such as copper, silver, gold, white gold, iron or nickel) is coated on the surface of a core such as a non-conductive fiber or a polymer thread.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, the conductive line may prevent the short-circuiting of a conductive line using a conductive metal wire enclosed with a non-conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The conductive line may be fanned by winding a conductive metal wire on the surface of a stretchable core. The core may be comprised of a non-conductive material, such as silicon, polyurethane (PU), synthetic rubber, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this case, a conductive line is prevented from being short-circuited when the stretchable cable is manufactured or stretched.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The stretchable film <b>1</b> includes an upper film and a lower film, each of which is formed of a thin-film stretchable polymer, a thin-film stretchable rubber, or a combination thereof. The upper film and the lower film cover zigzagged or U-shaped conductive lines that are arranged in parallel to one another. Polyurethane (PU) may be used as stretchable polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Among conductive lines that are divided into two layers and arranged on each layer, a conductive line arranged at an upper layer may be used as a signal line <b>2</b>, a conductive line arranged at a lower layer may be used as a ground line <b>3</b>. Needless to say, the positions of the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b> may be exchanged with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The structure that uses the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b> is generally used to transmit an electric signal at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In order to minimize electromagnetic interference of the electric signal and transmit the resultant electric signal at high speed, it is necessary for the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b> to be spaced apart from each other at a predetermined/desired distance, and the predetermined/desired distance may be fixed. In addition, the average distance from a noise generation source to the ground line <b>3</b> must be identical to that from the noise generation source to the signal line <b>2</b>. During the transmission of an electric signal, if the distance from the noise generation source to the signal line <b>2</b> or the ground line <b>3</b> changes, impedance also changes. If the average distance from the noise generation source to the ground line <b>3</b> is different from that from the noise generation source to the signal line <b>2</b>, a difference in signal distortion occurs while noise is applied, such that electromagnetic interference occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A group of components or products that must accommodate stretching, twisting, and folding caused by external stress is desired to use a flexible or stretchable cable. At the same time, if high-speed transmission of the electric signal is desired, the distance between the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b> may be constant, and it is necessary to use a cable in which the average distance from the noise generation source to the signal line <b>2</b> is almost identical to that of the noise generation source to the ground line <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Conventionally, in order to allow a cable to be freely stretched in response to external stress and at the same time transmit an electric signal at high speed, the signal line and the ground line are zigzagged and arranged on a single layer, and a stretchable cable that covers the signal line and the ground line with an insulator is used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The signal line and the ground line are zigzagged such that they can be freely stretched in response to external stress. However, when the cable is stretched, the distance from the signal line and the ground line that are arranged on a single layer is changed, such that impedance is also changed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In case of a single-layered cable in which the signal line and the ground line are arranged in parallel to each other on the same layer, when noise is received from an external part, an average distance from the noise generation source to the signal line is different from an average distance from the noise generation source to the ground line, such that a difference in signal distortion occurs between the signal line and the ground line because of noise. As a result, it is difficult to minimize electromagnetic interference of the electric signal and at the same time transmit the resultant electric signal at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Example embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> provide a stretchable cable structure that is capable of solving the problem of a conventional stretchable cable structure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The signal line <b>2</b> arranged on an upper layer is one-to-one matched to the ground line <b>3</b> arranged on a lower layer. The zigzag format of the signal line <b>2</b> located on the upper layer may cross with the ground line <b>3</b> located on the lower layer (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line are arranged in different layers, the distance between the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b> can be constantly maintained even when the cable is stretched. As a result, the impedance change caused by a variation of the difference between the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, if the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b> are arranged on different layers in a manner that the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b> are matched on a one-to-one basis, the average distance from the noise generation source to the signal line <b>2</b> may be identical to that from the noise generation source to the ground line <b>3</b> while noise is present, differently from the conventional structure in which the signal line and the ground line are arranged in parallel on a single layer. As a result, when noise is present, there is minimal difference in signal distortion between the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If zigzagged formats of the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b> are crossed with each other on different layers, electromagnetic interference can be minimized as in a twisted pair cable in which electric wires are twisted.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Therefore, the stretchable cable may be stretched, may minimize electromagnetic interference of the electric signal, and may transmit the resultant electric signal at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a multilayer stretchable cable shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> or <b>1</b>B. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the multilayer stretchable cable structure can be understood. A signal line <b>2</b> is arranged at an upper layer, and a ground line <b>3</b> is arranged at a lower layer, and the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b> can be mapped to each other on one-to-one basis.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A pitch between the signal line and the ground line <b>3</b> may be set to 5 mm or less. If necessary, the pitch can be reduced to 0.05 mm or less in response to a thickness of the stretchable film <b>1</b>. If the pitch <b>5</b> is set to a low value, a difference between an average distance from a noise generation source to the signal line <b>2</b> and an average distance from the noise generation source to the ground line <b>3</b> may be further reduced when noise is applied. Therefore, the occurrence of a difference in signal distortion between the signal line <b>2</b> and the ground line <b>3</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> illustrate a double-layered stretchable cable, it should be noted that the number of layers may not be limited thereto and example embodiments may be extended to cables having more than two layers.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, a stretchable cable may include a stretchable film <b>1</b> that is divided into two layers.

The zigzagged patterns are not limited only to a triangular- or horseshoe-shaped pattern, and a variety of patterns may be used as per design requirements. The ground plane <b>7</b> may have a beehive-shaped mesh structure in which thin lines are repeatedly entwined with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In accordance with a conventional stretchable cable, in the case of using the ground plane instead of the ground line so as to transmit an electric signal at high speed, a signal line is curved in a zigzag manner and is arranged in parallel to a cable-width direction, the ground plane is arranged at a lower layer of the signal line, and a stretchable film formed of an insulator covers the signal line and the ground plane.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The ground plane for use in the above-mentioned conventional stretchable cable may be fowled of conductive metal that does not have flexibility and elasticity, such that it is difficult to give elasticity to the above ground plane.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As a result, it is difficult for the conventional stretchable cable to be freely stretched in response to external stress and to transmit an electric signal at high speed.</p>
