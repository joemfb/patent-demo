<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The disclosure is directed to certain diesel fuel additives and to diesel fuels and diesel fuel additive concentrates that include the additive. In particular the disclosure is directed a diesel fuel additive that is effective to enhance the performance of fuel injectors for diesel engines.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">It has long been desired to maximize fuel economy, power and driveability in diesel fuel powered vehicles while enhancing acceleration, reducing emissions, and preventing hesitation. While it is known to enhance gasoline powered engine performance by employing dispersants to keep valves and fuel injectors clean, such gasoline dispersants are not necessarily effective in diesel fuel applications. The reasons for this unpredictability lie in the many differences between how diesel engines and gasoline engines operate and the chemical differences between diesel fuel and gasoline.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Over the years, dispersant compositions for diesel fuel have been developed. Dispersant compositions known in the art for use in diesel fuel include compositions may included polyalkylene succinimides, which are the reaction products of polyalkylene succinic anhydrides and amines. Dispersants are suitable for keeping soot and sludge suspended in a fluid, however these are not particularly effective for cleaning surfaces once deposits have formed on the surfaces. Hence, diesel fuel compositions that include dispersants often still produce undesirable deposits on diesel engine injectors. Accordingly, improved compositions that can prevent deposit build up, maintaining &#x201c;as new&#x201d; cleanliness for the vehicle life are desired. Ideally, the same composition that can clean up dirty fuel injectors restoring performance to the previous &#x201c;as new&#x201d; condition would be equally desirable and valuable in the attempt to reduce air borne exhaust emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">In accordance with the disclosure, exemplary embodiments provide a diesel fuel, diesel fuel additive concentrate and method for improving the performance of fuel injectors for a diesel engine. The diesel fuel includes a major amount of middle distillate fuel; and a reaction product of a hydrocarbyl substituted dicarboxylic acid or anhydride and an amine compound or salt.

wherein R<sup>2 </sup>is a hydrocarbyl moiety, such as for example, a polyalkenyl radical having a number average molecular weight of from about 100 to about 5,000. For example, the number average molecular weight of R<sup>2 </sup>may range from about 200 to about 3,000, as measured by GPC. Unless indicated otherwise, molecular weights in the present specification are number average molecular weights.

<p id="p-0028" num="0029">The R<sup>2 </sup>polyalkenyl radicals may comprise one or more polymer units chosen from linear or branched alkenyl units. In some aspects, the alkenyl units may have from about 2 to about 10 carbon atoms. For example, the polyalkenyl radical may comprise one or more linear or branched polymer units chosen from ethylene radicals, propylene radicals, butylene radicals, pentene radicals, hexene radicals, octene radicals and decene radicals. In some aspects, the R<sup>2 </sup>polyalkenyl radical may be in the form of, for example, a homopolymer, copolymer or terpolymer. In one aspect, the polyalkenyl radical is isobutylene. For example, the polyalkenyl radical may be a homopolymer of polyisobutylene comprising from about 10 to about 60 isobutylene groups, such as from about 20 to about 30 isobutylene groups. The polyalkenyl compounds used to form the R<sup>2 </sup>polyalkenyl radicals may be formed by any suitable methods, such as by conventional catalytic oligomerization of alkenes.</p>

These hydrocarbyl moieties can range from about 8 carbon atoms to over 40 carbon atoms. For example, alkenyl moieties of this type may be derived from a linear C<sub>18 </sub>or a mixture of C<sub>20-24 </sub>alpha olefins or from acid-isomerized C<sub>16 </sub>alpha olefins.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">In some aspects, high reactivity polyisobutenes having relatively high proportions of polymer molecules with a terminal vinylidene group may be used to form the R2 group. In one example, at least about 60%, such as about 70% to about 90%, of the polyisobutenes comprise terminal olefinic double bonds. There is a general trend in the industry to convert to high reactivity polyisobutenes, and well known high reactivity polyisobutenes are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0033" num="0034">The hydrocarbyl carbonyl compounds may be made using any suitable method. Methods for forming hydrocarbyl carbonyl compounds are well known in the art. One example of a known method for forming a hydrocarbyl carbonyl compound comprises blending a polyolefin and maleic anhydride. The polyolefin and maleic anhydride reactants are heated to temperatures of, for example, about 150&#xb0; C. to about 250&#xb0; C., optionally, with the use of a catalyst, such as chlorine or peroxide. Another exemplary method of making the polyalkylene succinic anhydrides is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,234,435, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

In some aspects, the methods comprise injecting a hydrocarbon-based compression ignition fuel comprising the bis-aminotriazole additive of the present application, through the injectors of the diesel engine into the combustion chamber, and igniting the compression ignition fuel. In some aspects, the method may also comprise mixing into the diesel fuel at least one of the optional additional ingredients described above.</p>

In these examples as well as elsewhere in this application, all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. It is intended that these examples are being presented for the purpose of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention disclosed herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">A 950 molecular weight polybutenyl succinic anhydride was heated to 95&#xb0; C. An oil slurry of aminoguanidine bicarbonate (AGBC) was added over a 45 minute period. The mixture was heated under vacuum to 160&#xb0; C. and held at that temperature for about 6 hours, removing water and carbon dioxide. The resulting mixture was filtered.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">In the following example, an injector deposit test was performed on a diesel engine using a conventional diesel engine fuel injector test as described below.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Test Protocol</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">The test protocol used is described by Graupner et al. &#x201c;Injector deposit test for modern diesel engines &#x201d;, Technische Akademie Esslingen, 5th International Colloquium, 12-13 Jan. 2005, 3.10, p 157, Edited by Wilfried J Bartz. Briefly, the protocol utilizes a modern diesel engine with an emphasis on the fuel injector deposit formation. The test is split into five stages:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0054">a) measurement of engine power output</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0055">b) an 8 hour endurance run</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0056">c) an extended soaking period (3 to 8 hours) during which the engine is stopped and allowed to cool</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0057">d) a second 8 hour endurance run</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0058">e) measurement of engine power output.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0059">For the data presented herein, the five stages above were used however, stages b), c), and d) may be repeated any number of times to suit the testing program being undertaken. Also, stages a) and e) may be omitted but are useful to improve understanding of the results. Results are reported as the difference between an average torque at the start of the test during stage a) and an average torque at the end of the test during stage e). Alternatively, if stage a) and stage e) of the above procedure is not run, the measured difference between starting torque at full load/full speed and final load/speed may be used. Differences in smoke production are also noted. The formation of injector deposits will have a negative influence on the final power output and will increase the amount of smoke observed. In order to replicate the conditions expected in a modern diesel engine, a small amount of metal contamination in the form of zinc neodecanoate was added to the fuel used to run the engine. In the table BAT is a bis-aminotriazole compound as described above.</p>
