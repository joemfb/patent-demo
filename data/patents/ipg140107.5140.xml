<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to apparatuses which handle a control signal for the whole radio system operated at each region that include a common control channel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A cognitive pilot channel (CPC) is being proposed in which is distributed, to the whole radio system operated at each of regions, information including a frequency and a radio scheme which are utilized within each of the regions. The cognitive pilot channel may be applied to eliminate a process of scanning basic parameter information of a radio system to which a terminal apparatus can connect to. Moreover, applying the cognitive pilot channel allows for changing apart of parameters of a radio system by changing the above-described information distributed. Furthermore, the cognitive pilot channel may be applied without changing the terminal apparatus itself.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, adopting the present technique makes it possible to decrease a price of the terminal apparatus and to deal with changing a radio system parameter. Moreover, as it is made possible to deal with changing the radio system parameter, it is possible to expect an easy transition to a radio system with a high frequency utilization efficiency. In the present technique, a coverage area of a base station apparatus is divided into multiple meshes. In the coverage area of the base station apparatus, a control signal is transmitted. Then, in units of the meshes as described above, a method of utilizing a radio resource is reported over multiple times. Information reported may be the same. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a downlink broadcast cognitive pilot channel. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a coverage area of a base station is divided into N<sub>m </sub>meshes, where N<sub>m </sub>is an integer greater than 1. In each of the meshes, control information is continually transmitted on a periodic basis. When the cognitive pilot channel is detected, the terminal apparatus waits until control information is transmitted which corresponds to a mesh at which the terminal apparatus resides. A total time (T<sub>m,B</sub>) over which the control information is transmitted at each of the meshes depends on a bit rate at which a downlink broadcast cognitive pilot channel is transmitted. The T<sub>m,B </sub>includes multiple time slots shown with Ts. In this way, the terminal apparatus may synchronize with all information sequences transmitted in the channel.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, a radio network controller which distributes all radio system parameters as described in the above Background section has the following problems. For example, when distributing such a radio control signal, the terminal apparatus may not conduct communications utilizing each radio system being operated unless it may receive the control signal. Moreover, the terminal apparatus must provide sufficient communications quality in a region at which communications are provided utilizing the radio resource.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, as the control signal is distributed in units of the meshes, a radio system being operated at the mesh or the radio parameter thereof may differ. In this case, the control signal may differ from one mesh in which distribution is conducted to another, causing the control signal to differ from one base station apparatus to another. Therefore, it is difficult to apply a technique for transmitting the same signal from all base station apparatuses of a single frequency network (SFN), etc., and to provide sufficient reception quality. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a case is described of Cells #<b>1</b> and #<b>2</b> existing at which cognitive pilot channels are transmitted (below called CPC Cell #<b>1</b> and CPC Cell #<b>2</b>) are transmitted. The CPC Cells #<b>1</b> and #<b>2</b> include multiple meshes. In such a case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when a timing at which a cognitive pilot channel is transmitted in a Mesh #i included in the CPC Cell#<b>1</b> overlaps with a timing at which a cognitive pilot channel is transmitted in a Mesh #j included in the CPC Cell #<b>2</b> that neighbors the Mesh #i, the terminal apparatus receives a cognitive pilot channel which is always subjected to an interference signal having an equivalent reception power.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, allocating a wide bandwidth to a control signal is not preferable as an overhead increases. Therefore, one frequency-repeating operation is necessary which utilizes the same frequency in each base station apparatus. When considering the one frequency-repeating operation, it is mandatory to implement a sophisticated transmission and reception algorithm which yields a high reception quality in the terminal apparatus. However, it is difficult to implement the sophisticated algorithm for all terminal apparatuses utilizing a radio system which has been operated from before. Thus, it is preferable to provide the base station apparatus with the sophisticated transmission algorithm, which makes it possible to satisfy a sufficient reception quality even for a terminal apparatus which implements a simple reception algorithm.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0085">With reference to the drawings, a description is given below with regard to embodiments of the present invention. Throughout the drawings for explaining the embodiments, same letters are used for those having the same functions, so that repetitive explanations are omitted.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">A First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0086">A communications system according to the present embodiment is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The communications system according to the present embodiment includes base station apparatuses <b>200</b> (<b>200</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>200</b><sub>2</sub>). Moreover, the communications system according to the present embodiment includes a radio network controller. Furthermore, the communications system according to the present embodiment includes a terminal apparatus <b>100</b>. Moreover, a function of the radio network controller may be arranged to be included in the base station apparatus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows two base station apparatuses, which may also be in three or more. Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows one terminal apparatus, which may also be in two or more.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0087">Each base station apparatus <b>200</b> covers a cognitive pilot channel cell (CPC Cell: Cognitive Pilot Channel Cell) (below called CPC Cell) as a region (an area) which distributes control information. Each CPC cell includes multiple meshes. A mesh is an area, wherein which area is in multiple numbers and each of which area is divided from a coverage area of the base station apparatus. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, Mesh #i included in CPC Cell#<b>1</b> and Mesh #j included in CPC Cell #<b>2</b> are neighboring. Moreover, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, meshes with the same hatching are covered by the same radio communications system. Here, the cognitive pilot channel is control information for each mesh. For example, the control information may be arranged to include control information of a radio communications system operated at the mesh.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0088">An order of a mesh in which control information is distributed by the base station apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The control information may be arranged to include a cognitive pilot channel. Moreover, the control information may be arranged to include a common control channel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an example of an order of meshes in which the base station apparatus <b>200</b> performs distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0089">When distributing control information of each of the meshes, the base station apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment randomizes the order of the meshes to be transmitted in. In other words, each time the control information of each of the meshes is distributed, the base station apparatus <b>200</b> changes a time interval from a previous timing. In this way, changing the time interval from the previous timing rather than distributing the same control signal at equal time intervals reduces a probability that a timing at which control information is transmitted in Mesh #i included in the base station apparatus <b>200</b> and a timing at which control information is distributed in Mesh #j included in a CPC cell #<b>2</b> neighboring the Mesh #i overlap. In other words, in a predetermined mesh in which the base station apparatus <b>200</b> distributes, it is arranged for a mesh in which a neighboring base station distributes at the same timing as a timing at which the base station apparatus <b>200</b> distributes to be different for each distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0090">In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a time interval for distributing control information of Mesh #i in CPC Cell #<b>1</b> is randomized. In this way, at a certain distribution timing, even when there is an overlap between a riming at which control information is transmitted in Mesh #i and a timing at which control information is transmitted in Mesh #j included in CPC Cell #<b>2</b> which neighbors the Mesh #i, subsequent distribution timings may be varied. Thus, as interference distributed to Mesh #j which neighbors Mesh #i is reduced, reception quality may be improved for a terminal device <b>100</b> which is located at Mesh #i. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at a first transmission timing, a timing at which control information is transmitted in Mesh #i included in CPC Cell #<b>1</b> overlaps a timing at which control information is transmitted in Mesh #j included in CPC Cell #<b>2</b> which neighbors the Mesh #i, but timings at which the following control information sets are transmitted differ.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0093">The base station apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment has a transmission timing determining unit <b>206</b>. The transmission timing determining unit <b>206</b> determines an order of distribution of control information in each mesh included in a CPC Cell covered by the base station apparatus <b>200</b> based on the random number generated in the random number generator <b>208</b>. According to the determined order of distribution, when a time of transmission in a mesh arrives, the transmission timing determining unit <b>206</b> inputs an identifier of a mesh distributed in into a below-described common control channel information database <b>202</b>.

<p id="p-0072" num="0094">The base station apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment has a common control channel information database <b>202</b>. The common control channel information database <b>202</b> holds control information needed for communicating using a radio system within each mesh.

The common control channel information database <b>202</b> inputs an applicable common control channel into a below-described control channel transmitter <b>204</b> based on a mesh identifier input.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0095">The base station apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment has a control channel transmitter <b>204</b>. The control channel transmitter <b>204</b> distributes a common control channel input.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0096">An operation of the base station apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0097">The base station apparatus <b>200</b> generates a random number (step S<b>702</b>). For example, the random number generator <b>208</b> generates the random number.

<p id="p-0076" num="0098">Based on the generated random number, the base station apparatus <b>200</b> determines an order of distribution of each mesh (step S<b>704</b>).

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">A Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0100">A communications system according to the present embodiment is similar to the communications system described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0104">The base station apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment has a reference transmission power database <b>210</b>. The reference transmission power database <b>210</b> holds information indicating transmission power to be a reference in each mesh.</p>

The common control channel information database <b>202</b> inputs the held control information into a below-described control channel transmitter <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0106">The base station apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment has a control channel transmitter <b>204</b>. The control channel transmitter <b>204</b> distributes control information according to transmission power held in the reference transmission power database <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0107">An operation of the base station apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0108">In the present embodiment, an order of a mesh in which control information is transmitted is predetermined.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0109">The base station apparatus <b>200</b> determines position information of a mesh to be distributed in according to an order of distribution of the mesh (step S<b>902</b>). For example, the mesh position database <b>212</b> determines position information of a mesh to be distributed in according to the order of distribution of the mesh. Then, the mesh position database <b>212</b> inputs position information of the mesh to be distributed in into the reference transmission power database <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0110">The base station apparatus <b>200</b> determines transmission power based on a position of the mesh determined in step S<b>902</b> (step S<b>904</b>). For example, the reference transmission power database <b>210</b> determines transmission power corresponding to the position based on the mesh position information input. For example, the reference transmission power database <b>210</b> specifies transmission power corresponding to a mash included in a CPC Cell covered by the base station apparatus <b>200</b> according to a distance from the base station apparatus <b>200</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a small transmission power is specified for a mash positioned close to the base station apparatus <b>200</b>. Moreover, a large transmission power is specified for a mesh positioned far from the base station apparatus <b>200</b>. This is merely exemplary, so that the transmission power corresponding to the mesh position may be changed as needed. The reference transmission power database <b>210</b> inputs information indicating transmission power into a control channel transmitter <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0111">The base station apparatus <b>200</b> transmits a common control channel input by the common control channel information database <b>202</b> with transmission power determined in step S<b>904</b> (step S<b>906</b>). According to a distribution order of a mesh, the common control channel information database <b>202</b> inputs the common control channel into the control channel transmitter <b>204</b>. The control channel transmitter <b>204</b> transmits the input mesh control information with transmission power reported from the reference transmission power database <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0112">According to the present embodiment, transmission power may be varied for each mesh transmitted in. Thus, it is possible to control interference power according to the position of the mesh. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a relationship between reception timing and transmission power of each mesh. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the vertical axis is transmission power and the horizontal axis is time.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0113">According to the present embodiment, the transmission power of the control information differs even when reception timings overlap in neighboring meshes. Thus, interference may be reduced which control information received by the terminal apparatus is subjected to. Thus, control of reception quality of control information may be achieved, and improvement in reception quality may be achieved in the terminal apparatus.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0154">The terminal apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment has a synthesis processing controller <b>106</b>. The synthesis processing controller <b>106</b> synthesizes received signals.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0155">The terminal apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment has a control signal processor <b>108</b>. The control signal processor <b>108</b> performs control based on information of a radio system being operated in a mesh in which the terminal apparatus <b>100</b> resides.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0156">In the radio communications system according to the present embodiment, control information of each mesh is transmitted multiple times with different distribution interval and/or transmission power. Therefore, in the terminal apparatus <b>100</b>, different reception qualities are each time transmission is conducted. The terminal apparatus <b>100</b> preferably performs a synthesis process at the reception signal synthesis processor <b>102</b>, taking into account that reception qualities are different. In this way, reception quality may be improved. This is because, by synthesizing received signals, it is likely to obtain reception quality of an environment with a small interference power at a transmission opportunity following too large interference power because of a different distribution order at a neighboring base station apparatus. Moreover, this is also because it is likely to obtain good reception quality with a large interference power from a distribution with high transmission power in the following order of distribution even when the transmission power is too low.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0157">According to the base station apparatus of the present embodiment, an order of distribution of each mesh is randomized. For example, a mesh to be distributed in is randomly extracted, and control information of the mesh is distributed. In this way, a reception state may be made always different without providing the same interference signal to a terminal apparatus. For example, as a neighboring base station apparatus similarly distributes information of a different mesh, an interference signal becomes different when receiving at the terminal apparatus. As a result, reception quality may be improved in the terminal apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0158">Moreover, according to a base station apparatus of the present embodiment, transmission power is determined based on a position of a mesh to be distributed in. In this way, an effect on a terminal apparatus of an interference signal transmitted from a neighboring base station apparatus may be reduced. For example, a transmission power at the time of distribution may be set such it is becomes power minimally receivable in a mesh to be distributed in. This is because, in order to transmit at a minimum power receivable within the mesh, transmission is not performed with excessive power, making it possible to make a signal to be interference to a neighboring region small. Moreover, for example, an average transmission power for each mesh is specified, and, within a range of power which is transmittable by the base station apparatus which meets the average value thereof, a transmission power of control information transmitted multiple times may be controlled randomly. By selecting transmission power randomly, it is possible, in a certain transmission time, to reduce an interference signal to a neighboring area. In particular, for transmitting the same signal multiple times as anticipated in the control signal this time, the probability of success of reception may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0159">Furthermore, according to the base station apparatus of the present embodiment, conducting transmission power control based on a position of a mesh distributed and/or randomizing of an order of the mesh distributed in makes it possible in a terminal apparatus to reduce the probability of receiving information on a mesh required by the terminal apparatus simultaneously with a large interference signal successively.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0160">Moreover, according to the base station apparatus of the present embodiment, control information of a part of the meshes is transmitted simultaneously in multiple base station apparatuses. In this way, for the terminal apparatus, an interference signal may be reduced and reception quality may be improved. For example, it may be arranged to distribute the same control signal at the same transmission time from a base station apparatus being operated in a neighboring region to a region in which ensuring of reception quality cannot be performed efficiently even for transmission based on maximum transmission power and high efficiency, such as an edge of a region each base station apparatus services. This is because distributing the same control signal at the same transmission time makes it possible to reduce interference power and to improve reception power. Moreover, transmission power control based on a position of a mesh to be distributed in and/or randomizing of an order of a mesh to be distributed in may be arranged to be performed simultaneously. For example, in order to distribute the same control signal at the same transmission time, the radio network controller which controls the base station apparatus controls transmission power and distribution time of meshes which are preferred to be transmitted in at the same time. Then, based on the above-described control, the radio network controller randomly selects, with respect to the base station apparatus, a distribution time for a mesh in which the same signal is not to be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0161">According to the terminal apparatus of the present embodiment, a control signal is distributed multiple times. Thus, not only a reception process of such a signal is performed for each of the distribution timings, but also signals received up to then may also be combined. The terminal apparatus makes it possible to obtain a time diversity effect and improve reception quality also by combining the signals received up to then.</p>
