<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/352,235, filed Feb. 13, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,773,583 which relates to a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/352,235, filed Feb. 13, 2006. This application relates to and claims priority from Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2005-035409, filed on Feb. 14, 2005 and 2006-015767, filed on Jan. 25, 2006. The entirety of the contents and subject matter of all of the above is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an IP telecommunication system, a method for controlling communication in an IP network, a client terminal and a client server, and more particularly, relates to a system wherein a client terminal applied to a thin client system may be used as, for example, an IP phone or a TV phone, and a telecommunication terminal, a telecommunication method and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, due to the trend of price reduction in personal computers (PCs) and network devices, companies that promote streamlining of their operations by distributing terminals such as PCs to most of their employees have become a majority. As PC prices become lower and PC usage grows, the amount of maintenance work to be performed by intra-firm device administrators increases in proportion to the number of PCs. Examples of such maintenance work include version upgrading and bugfixing of operating systems (OSs) and business applications, responding to hardware-related failures, taking measures and countermeasures against computer viruses and the like. Performing such maintenance work requires significant management costs that will increase dramatically as the numbers of employees increase.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A method of system operation called the server-client method is employed as an approach for reducing such management costs. This method involves accumulating primary programs and data at a server side for collective management, and accessing the programs and data through remote control from the PC terminals of individuals. Terminals under the server-client method are ordinary PC terminals implemented with remote control programs. However, a PC terminal using this method is not required to accumulate application programs or data other than the remote control program. This allows thin client (hereinafter referred to as TC) terminals that are not equipped with storage devices such as hard disk devices to be used as terminals under the server-client method. In light of the recent enforcement of the personal information protection law, TC terminals have been attracting attention as terminals free from personal information leakage, and as a result a server-client method using such TC terminals has been gaining popularity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram showing a TC system employing TC terminals. The TC system comprises a TC server and a plurality of TC terminals. The TC server performs processing by having processes activated by each user communicate with the TC terminals to which they correspond one-to-one. Since each TC terminal does not store communication data in external storage devices such as fixed magnetic disk devices, their primary components are input/output devices and their driver/processing sections (so-called drivers), and data communication sections. Data processing of the main body desired by a user is performed at the TC server side. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to perform updating and the like of application programs at the TC terminals. This results not only in a reduction in terminal management costs, but also in prevention of information leaking even in the event of loss or theft of TC terminals since no confidential data is retained in the TC terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, in recent years, IP phones have been rapidly spreading. For example, a basic configuration of a corporate IP phone system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a single telephony server or a plurality of telephony servers carry out the role of a so-called internal phone exchange device, and perform call control between telephone terminals. Telephone terminals include an IP phone <b>801</b> that connects to an IP network, or a softphone <b>812</b> that is a telephone program on a PC. The softphone is a program that controls calling and receiving operations, generally using the PC that it is running on as its own telephone terminal. In addition, by comprising an image transmitting/receiving function that uses a camera <b>813</b> as a part of the softphone's function, the softphone can also be used as a TV phone terminal or a TV conference terminal. Communication with a fixed-line telephone <b>831</b> may be achieved via a fixed telephone network <b>830</b> through a gateway device <b>820</b>, while communication with a cellular phone <b>833</b> may be achieved via a cellular phone network <b>832</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Next, fundamental operations of an IP phone will be described using an example wherein a telephone terminal <b>801</b> dials out to a softphone <b>812</b>. When dialing out from the telephone terminal <b>801</b>, a telephony server <b>800</b> receives this as a callout information from the telephone terminal. After confirming the telephone status and the like of the softphone <b>812</b>, the telephony server notifies the telephone terminal <b>801</b> of an IP address <b>843</b> of the softphone, and notifies the softphone <b>812</b> of an IP address <b>842</b> of the telephone terminal. Then, both telephone terminals establish connection by mutually transmitting/receiving voice packets between their IP addresses, and achieve voice communication. Image communication can be achieved through a similar connection method, wherein connection is established by mutually transmitting/receiving image packets between softphones equipped with image functions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Several technical challenges exist when realizing IP phone functions with a TC terminal according to the above described TC system. With a TC terminal, since application programs are executed at the TC server side, the TC terminal side cannot communicate even when a softphone that is a telephone program is executed on the TC server side. Even if the communication is established, the plurality of softphones virtually running on the TC server remains as a problem, preventing identification of virtual terminals on the TC server through call control under conventional IP address exchange methods. One such call connection method is provided, for example, in JP-A-2003-158534. More specifically, JP-A-2003-158534 presents a method of solving the problem wherein TC terminals cannot be identified from the outside when a plurality of TC terminals is connected to a TC server.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the method of the above described Patent Document 1, each telephone terminal is identified while a plurality of softphones runs on a TC server in the TC system described above. Therefore, all communications between TC terminals and exterior IP phone terminals were communications via the TC terminal, and terminal-to-terminal communication that characterizes the fundamental operations of IP phones was not achieved. Furthermore, since the method required TC terminals to exist on the same network segment as the TC server, communications by TC terminals via the outside or wireless LANs were also not achieved.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The construction of a system capable of performing communication between TC terminals and communication terminals without going through a TC server, and a communication control method thereof have been desired.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention was made in consideration of the above problems. By providing a TC terminal side with a communication control means for allowing communication with, for example, a telephone on a network, call establishment between a TC terminal and a communication terminal is performed via a TC server, and communication between the TC terminal and the communication terminal is performed via the network without having to go through the TC server. Specific means thereof are as described in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the present invention, a TC terminal may also be used as, for example, an IP phone terminal, a TV phone terminal an image-receiving terminal or the like. Therefore, there are no risks of leaking of personal information such as address books through the use of TC terminals, and the same TC terminal can be used to securely communicate voice and images according to a user's work regardless of location, for example even at external locations such as a business trip destination or a user's home.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also, since communication is possible without going through a TC server, optimization of processing bottlenecks and network traffic related to server processing can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, since TC terminals are unable to accumulate data, voice, images and the like, copyright protection when receiving image distribution services can also be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For the purpose of preventing information leakage caused by loss of conventional mobile PCs and the like, the present inventor first considered a personal TC system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. More specifically, the personal TC system is composed of: a TC terminal <b>960</b> freely usable by an individual, a desktop TC server <b>930</b>, for example, that manages the application programs, data and the like of the TC terminal, and a network <b>990</b> that connects them; wherein the TC server <b>930</b> comprises an OS <b>933</b>, an application program <b>937</b>, a storage device <b>934</b> having an area <b>936</b> for storing terminal IP addresses, a CPU <b>931</b>, a memory <b>932</b>, a remote controller SV<b>935</b> and the like; and the TC terminal <b>960</b> comprises an OS <b>972</b>, an IC card control section <b>976</b>, a device control section <b>973</b>, a CPU <b>974</b>, a memory <b>975</b> having an area <b>981</b> for storing server IP addresses, a remote controller CL<b>971</b> and the like, as well as an IC card <b>962</b> having an area <b>982</b> for storing server IP addresses, and an input/output device comprising a keyboard <b>963</b>, a display device <b>961</b> and the like. Transmitting and receiving input/output information between the TC server and the TC terminal is performed by respectively transmitting/receiving IP packets between the remote controllers SV<b>935</b> and CL<b>971</b>. The IC card <b>962</b> is used as a personal identification device to prevent illegal connection. For example, allowing or disallowing connection is controlled by storing in advance a personal identification number and a password inside the IC card <b>962</b>, and matching those with a personal identification number and a password that are input upon connecting to the PTC server.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present invention is premised on the personal TC system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. A configuration and fundamental operations of the personal TC system will now be described. In the following description, PTC will be used as an abbreviation of &#x201c;personal thin client&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The PTC system is composed of a PTC server <b>930</b>, a PTC terminal <b>960</b>, and a network <b>990</b> that connects the two. The PTC server <b>930</b> is composed of a CPU <b>931</b>, a memory <b>932</b>, a storage device <b>934</b>, an OS <b>933</b>, an application program AP<b>937</b>, and a remote controller SV<b>935</b>. The PTC server <b>930</b> may be a desktop PC with an input/output device. The PTC terminal <b>960</b> is composed of a CPU <b>974</b>, a memory <b>975</b>, a device control section <b>973</b>, an IC card control section <b>976</b>, an OS <b>972</b>, a main body <b>970</b> consisting of a remote controller CL<b>971</b>, input devices in the form of a mouse <b>964</b> and a keyboard <b>963</b>, a display device <b>961</b>, and an IC card <b>962</b>. According to the present configuration, because the PTC terminal <b>960</b> does not have an external storage device, it is incapable of executing what is called application programs. However, since the PTC terminal <b>960</b> is unable to store data such as personal information, there are no risks of information leakage when lost or the like. The network <b>990</b> is, for example, the Internet <b>991</b> or a wired LAN or a wireless LAN or the like, and is capable of identifying targets by their IP addresses.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The PTC system functions by establishing communication between the PTC server <b>930</b> and the PTC terminal <b>960</b>. This establishment of the communication is achieved upon establishment of communication between the remote controllers, when the remote controller CL<b>971</b> of the PTC terminal sends a communication start request to the remote controller SV<b>935</b> of the PTC server, which is in a connection wait state. An IP address of the PTC server preset in the server IP address storage area <b>981</b> of the memory <b>975</b> is used as the target IP address for the transmission of the communication start request. Also, when the IC card is connected, the IP address preset in the server IP address storage area <b>982</b> of the IC card <b>962</b> is used. This enables individuals to connect to their respective PTC servers without identifying PTC terminals. When the communication start request initially arrives from the remote controller CL<b>971</b>, the IP address sent from the remote controller CL<b>971</b> is stored in the terminal IP address storage area <b>936</b> of the storage device <b>934</b>. Subsequently, communication is performed towards the stored IP address. In addition, when terminating communication, the IP address in the terminal IP address storage area <b>936</b> is erased.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When communication has already been established between the PTC server and the PTC terminal, the PTC system operates as follows. Input operation through the mouse <b>964</b> or the keyboard <b>963</b> of the PTC terminal <b>960</b> is transmitted as input information <b>950</b> from the remote controller CL<b>971</b> to the PTC server <b>930</b>. The remote controller SV<b>935</b> of the PTC server <b>930</b> receives this information, and hands it over to the OS <b>933</b> as input information addressed to the PTC server <b>930</b>. The OS <b>933</b> executes processing according to the input information from the remote controller SV<b>935</b>. Screen information and the like representing the results of the processing are transmitted as output information <b>951</b> from the remote controller SV<b>935</b> to the PTC terminal <b>960</b>. The remote controller CL<b>971</b> receives this information, and outputs it onto the display device <b>961</b> via the OS <b>972</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present configuration is characterized by configuring the TC server <b>930</b> without an input/output device while configuring the TC terminal <b>960</b> with only an input/output device, and remotely connecting the two. By placing the TC server <b>930</b> according to the present configuration in a secure area, possibility of information leakage can be virtually eliminated even in the event that the TC terminal <b>960</b> is lost externally.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention utilizes the characteristics of such personal TC systems, and further enables audio, video and other communication functions such as a telephone function, a TV phone function, and music and image receiving functions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing a configuration of a system for implementing a telephone function according to an embodiment of the present invention. The system configuration according to the present invention is an addition of necessary functions to the PTC server <b>930</b> and the PTC terminal <b>960</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In other words, although not shown, the PTC server <b>110</b> is configured identically to the PTC server <b>930</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, except that a server side telephone control section <b>111</b> consisting of a call control section <b>112</b> is added. Also, the PTC terminal <b>120</b> is configured identically to the PTC terminal <b>960</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, except that a terminal side telephone control section <b>121</b> consisting of a device control section <b>122</b> and a voice packet communication section <b>123</b> is added. In addition, the PTC terminal <b>120</b> is configured to accept connection of a handset <b>130</b>. Therefore, in the system configuration according to the present invention, the PTC system <b>100</b> is composed of a PTC server <b>110</b>, a PTC terminal <b>120</b> and a network <b>990</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The server side telephone control section <b>111</b> performs call connection via a telephony server <b>800</b> and the call control section <b>112</b>, and transmits to and receives from the terminal side telephone control section <b>121</b> telephone control information to enable the PTC terminal <b>120</b> to function as a telephone terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The terminal side telephone control section <b>121</b> transmits to and receives from the server side telephone control section <b>111</b> and telephone control information <b>140</b>, and provides control over the handset <b>130</b> and the voice packet communication section <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The device control section <b>122</b> controls the various functions of the handset <b>130</b>, and is therefore implemented according to the type of the handset <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The handset <b>130</b> is connected to the PTC terminal <b>120</b> via, for instance, a USB interface and the like. The fundamental functions of the handset <b>130</b> include input/output of voice data, as well as key input, turning lamp on and off, off-hook, ringing tone generation and the like. Also, possible forms of the handset <b>130</b> include a fixed phone type, a headset type and other types.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, the telephony server <b>800</b> possesses functions as a telephone exchange device for connecting telephone terminals (the PTC terminal <b>120</b> and the telephone terminal <b>801</b>). In order to perform this telephone exchange function, the telephony server <b>800</b> internally comprises a telephone number management table. The management table is composed of telephone numbers and call control target IP addresses, and by referencing this table, connection target terminals may be identified by their telephone numbers, thereby enabling processing of call connections. In the PTC system <b>100</b> according to the present invention, while it is the PTC server <b>110</b> that performs call connection with the telephony server <b>800</b>, a single telephone number is assigned to the PTC system <b>100</b>. To give a specific example, IP addresses &#x201c;192.168.1.1&#x201d;, &#x201c;192.168.1.2&#x201d;, &#x201c;192.168.10.1&#x201d; and &#x201c;192.168.1.3&#x201d; are respectively assigned to the PTC server <b>110</b>, the PTC terminal <b>120</b>, the telephony server <b>800</b> and the telephone terminal <b>801</b>. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the telephone numbers &#x201c;3000&#x201d; and &#x201c;3001&#x201d; are respectively assigned to the PTC system <b>100</b> and the telephone terminal <b>801</b>. Furthermore, the contents of the telephone number management table of the telephony server <b>800</b> at this point are as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The following specific example will be described on the premise that a telephone system is configured with telephone numbers and IP addresses assigned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Also, the telephone terminal <b>801</b> will be described as an IP phone capable of initiating and receiving calls through call connection with the telephony server <b>800</b>, and is also capable of communicating with other telephone terminals by transmitting/receiving voice packets.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Operation of implementing a telephone function according to the PTC terminal <b>120</b> according to the present embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, it is assumed that the PTC server and the telephone terminal are already registered with the IP telephony server, and the telephone number management table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> has already been created. In addition, processing of transmitting/receiving information at the PTC terminal <b>120</b> is performed by the terminal side telephone control section <b>121</b>, while processing of transmitting/receiving information at the PTC server <b>110</b> is performed by the server side telephone control section <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a sequential diagram showing the flow of call connection when calling out from the PTC terminal <b>120</b> to the telephone terminal <b>801</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">By dialing the phone number of a communication target telephone terminal (target telephone number) &#x201c;3001&#x201d; from a handset <b>130</b> mounted on the PTC terminal <b>120</b>, input information <b>1201</b> requesting &#x201c;callout to number 3001&#x201d; is transmitted from the terminal side telephone control section <b>121</b> of the PTC terminal <b>120</b>, via the remote controller CL<b>971</b> as well as the remote controller SV<b>935</b> of the PTC server <b>110</b>, to the server side telephone control section <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Based on this request information, the PTC server <b>110</b> transmits call connection request information <b>1202</b> that includes the target telephone number &#x201c;3001&#x201d; and a communication target IP address <b>1</b> &#x201c;192.168.1.2&#x201d; as parameters, to the telephony server <b>800</b>. At this point, the communication target IP address <b>1</b> &#x201c;192.168.1.2&#x201d; is stored as a parameter into a terminal IP address storage area <b>936</b> in a storage device <b>934</b>. Based on the above call connection request information <b>1202</b>, the IP telephony server <b>800</b> references a telephone number management table <b>1001</b> from the telephone number &#x201c;3001&#x201d; designated as a parameter, identifies a call connection target IP address &#x201c;192.168.1.3&#x201d;, and transmits call connection request information <b>1203</b> to the telephone terminal <b>801</b>. At this point, the IP telephony server <b>800</b> transmits the communication target IP address &#x201c;192.168.1.2&#x201d; received from the PTC server <b>110</b> as a parameter. At the same time, information <b>1204</b> indicating a calling status is transmitted to the PTC server <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Upon receiving the information <b>1204</b> indicating a calling status, the PTC server <b>110</b> transmits information <b>1205</b> indicating a calling status to the PTC terminal <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the PTC terminal <b>120</b> receives the information <b>1205</b>, the terminal side telephone control section <b>121</b> of the above described PTC terminal rings the handset <b>130</b> via the device control section <b>122</b> to change the status of the PTC terminal <b>120</b> to calling.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Upon receiving call connection request information <b>1203</b> from the telephony server <b>800</b>, the telephone terminal <b>801</b> rings a ringing tone through reception processing, and at the same time receives the communication target IP address &#x201c;192.168.1.2&#x201d; transmitted as a parameter. Then, after its status changes to communicatable by lifting the receiver and the like, a communication OK <b>1206</b> is transmitted to the telephony server <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Upon receiving the communication OK <b>1206</b>, the telephony server <b>800</b> transmits a communication OK <b>1207</b> to the PTC server with a communication target IP address <b>2</b> as a parameter. The telephone terminal IP address &#x201c;192.168.1.3&#x201d; obtained from the telephone number management table <b>1001</b> is set here as the communication target IP address <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The PTC server <b>110</b> receives the communication OK <b>1207</b>, and transmits a communication OK <b>1208</b> including the parameter to the PTC terminal <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As the PTC terminal <b>120</b> receives the communication OK <b>1208</b>, the terminal side telephone control section <b>121</b> of the above described PTC terminal sends the communication target IP address in the parameter to the voice packet communication section <b>123</b> of the above described PTC terminal. The voice packet communication section <b>123</b> designates the received communication target IP address &#x201c;192.168.1.3&#x201d; as the destination of the voice packet to be transmitted, and commences packet transmission (communication <b>1209</b>). At the same time, it starts receiving packets sent from the other party.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">On the other hand, when the telephone terminal <b>801</b> side assumes a communicatable status, it commences transmission of a voice packet addressed to the communication target IP address &#x201c;192.168.1.2&#x201d; received from the telephony server <b>800</b>, and at the same time starts receiving packets sent from the other party.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">This enables the PTC terminal <b>120</b> and the telephone terminal <b>801</b> to commence direct communication <b>1209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, while the present description involved dialing out from the handset of the PTC terminal, it is also possible to attach a dialing out function to the PTC server side. In this case, the step of information notification <b>1201</b> in the sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is no longer necessary, and the sequence will start at <b>1202</b>.</p>

Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, initiating and receiving calls as well as communication are now possible between the telephone terminal <b>801</b> and the PTC terminal <b>120</b>, thereby enabling use of the PTC terminal <b>120</b> as a single telephone terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, while the IP address exchange procedures between communication terminals shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> are the same procedures seen in Voice over IP call control technology (such as ITU-T H.323 or IETF SIP), as long as IP addresses can be exchanged between telephone terminals, the present invention is not dependent on the use of either call control procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">This also applies to cases where a plurality of telephony servers <b>800</b> are used, or alternate telephone exchange means is used.</p>

A terminal side telephone control section <b>210</b> is equipped with a ringing tone control section <b>211</b>. The AD conversion section <b>220</b> and the ringing tone control section <b>211</b> are not restricted to any particular form of implementation, and may be hardware, firmware or software.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The method of implementing communication function according to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is as follows. In the communication <b>1209</b> state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, analog data <b>241</b> input to and/or output from the microphone <b>231</b> and the speaker <b>232</b> is passed through the AD conversion section <b>220</b> and converted into digital data <b>242</b>, which is then input to and/or output from a voice packet communication section <b>123</b> to achieve communication with a target.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The method of implementing a calling tone and a ringing tone according to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is as follows. In the case of a calling tone, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, as the PTC terminal <b>200</b> receives information <b>1205</b> indicating a calling state, the terminal side telephone control section <b>210</b> notifies the ringing tone control section <b>211</b> to generate tone. Upon receiving the notification, the ringing tone control section <b>211</b> transmits calling tone data <b>212</b> to the AD conversion section <b>220</b>, and a calling tone is produced from the speaker <b>232</b>. Also, in the case of a ringing tone, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, as the PTC terminal <b>200</b> receives an incoming call <b>1303</b>, the terminal side telephone control section <b>210</b> notifies the ringing tone control section <b>211</b> of the incoming call. Upon receiving the notification, the ringing tone control section <b>211</b> transmits ringing tone data <b>213</b> to the AD conversion section, and a ringing tone is produced from the speaker <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The method of implementing dialing and other telephone operations according to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is as follows. The server side telephone control section <b>111</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has an interface that allows on-screen input/output. When the PTC server <b>110</b> is activated, a display device <b>961</b> of the PTC terminal <b>200</b> displays an input/output screen <b>601</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. For outgoing calls, calling out is possible through dial input by operating a mouse <b>964</b> or a keyboard <b>963</b>. Also, for incoming calls, communication can be initiated by designating an on-screen off-hook button or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">According to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, since even the microphone <b>231</b> and the speaker <b>232</b> may employ telephone functions, the use of, for instance, a headset that integrates the microphone <b>231</b> and the speaker <b>232</b> may also be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is diagram showing a configuration of a PTC system <b>400</b> comprising a PTC server side equipped with a voice packet communication section <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, use of the PTC terminal <b>420</b> as a single telephone terminal may be realized by designating the IP address of the PTC server <b>410</b> as the communication target IP address designated in the call connection processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> or <b>13</b>. More specifically, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, when making a call connection request to the telephony server <b>800</b>, the IP address &#x201c;192.168.1.1&#x201d; of the PTC server <b>410</b> is set as the communication target IP address parameter. In addition, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when sending a communication OK to the telephony server <b>800</b>, the IP address &#x201c;192.168.1.1&#x201d; of the PTC server <b>410</b> is set as the communication target IP address parameter. This enables voice packet communication between the telephone terminal <b>801</b> and the PTC server <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">After converting the voice packet data to voice data, the voice packet communication section <b>123</b> transmits to and/or receives from the terminal side telephone control section <b>421</b> the voice data. The terminal side telephone control section <b>421</b> performs voice input and/or output to the handset <b>130</b> via the device control section <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">According to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, since voice data <b>441</b> passes through the PTC server <b>410</b>, recording of communication may be easily realized by using voice recording programs or the like that run on the PTC server <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Incidentally, the voice packet communication section <b>123</b> may be equipped to the PTC terminal <b>120</b> side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or equipped to the PTC server <b>410</b> side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, or equipped to both the PTC server <b>410</b> and the PTC terminal <b>420</b> to be switched from one to the other according to purpose of use.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is diagram showing a block configuration of a PTC terminal <b>500</b> with the call control section <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> equipped to the PTC terminal <b>500</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, since the PTC terminal <b>500</b> single-handedly comprises a telephone function, the PTC terminal <b>500</b> may be used as a single telephone terminal totally independent of the operation of the PTC server <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when constructing a telephone system using the PTC terminal <b>500</b> as a single telephone terminal, &#x201c;192.168.1.2&#x201d; is set in the telephone number management table <b>1001</b> in the telephony server <b>800</b> as the call control target IP address corresponding to &#x201c;3000&#x201d;. This enables call connection between the telephony server <b>800</b> and the PTC terminal <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">When the call control target IP address is the same as the communication target IP address, as in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, either the call connection target IP address may be set as the communication target IP address, or the parameter may be left unset in the call connection procedures of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. If no parameter is set for the communication target IP address, the telephony server <b>800</b> references the telephone number management table <b>1001</b>, and by notifying the other party of the call connection target IP address as the communication target IP address, the IP addresses of both parties may be exchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">According to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, since telephone functions may be used through the PTC terminal <b>500</b> alone and totally independent of the operation of the PTC server <b>110</b>, calls can be made, for example, even when the PTC server <b>110</b> is not turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing a block configuration of a PTC terminal <b>320</b>, configured to allow connection of an IC card <b>330</b> and equipped with an IC card control section <b>321</b> that reads information from the IC card <b>330</b>, and a configuration of a PTC system <b>300</b> using the PTC terminal <b>320</b> and a method for implementing telephone functions.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Telephone numbers are registered in advance in a telephone number storage area <b>331</b> of the IC card <b>330</b>. When the IC card <b>330</b> is inserted, the terminal side telephone control section <b>341</b> reads a telephone number stored in the telephone number storage area <b>331</b> of the IC card <b>330</b> via the IC card control section <b>321</b>, and transmits a telephone number registration notification with the new telephone number as a parameter to the server side telephone control section <b>111</b></p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Upon receiving this notification, the server side telephone control section <b>111</b> sends a registration request <b>340</b> for the new telephone number to the telephony server <b>800</b> via the call control section <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Upon receiving the registration request <b>340</b>, the telephony server <b>800</b> rewrites the telephone number corresponding to the IP address in the telephone number management table to the new telephone number.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">This renews the telephone number of the PTC system <b>300</b>, and other telephone terminals can connect to the PTC system <b>300</b> by using the new telephone number.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In addition, other configurations wherein the IC card <b>330</b> is connected may be considered, such as a configuration wherein the IC card <b>330</b> is connected to the PC server <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or a configuration wherein the IC card <b>330</b> is connected to the PTC terminal <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In either configuration, the processing for telephone number registration and the like will be the same as above.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As described above, an advantage of the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is that the IP address of the connection target PTC server may be registered into the IC card <b>330</b>. By arranging the IC card <b>330</b> to carry caller information as well, simply inserting the IC card will connect the PTC terminal <b>320</b> to a private desktop PC, and will further allow the PTC terminal <b>320</b> to be used as a telephone terminal with a personal extension number. Thus, a secure remote office environment may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In addition, when using the PTC terminal <b>120</b> as a mobile device, by configuring, for example, a telephone program that is a function of the server side telephone control section <b>111</b> to link with a personal cellular phone, the PTC terminal <b>120</b> can be carried around together with the cellular phone.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In a corporate information system, when a TC system and an IP internal phone network are to be concurrently constructed, the present invention can provide an environment that allows mobile operations at a user's home or a business trip destination to be performed in a more secure and comfortable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">It should be further understood by those skilled in the art that although the foregoing description has been made on embodiments of the invention, the invention is not limited thereto and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.</p>
