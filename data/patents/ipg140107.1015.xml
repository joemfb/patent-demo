<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">This device feeds and sorts tablets or small parts from a common hopper to a product count sensor head. Two parallel feed rolls and two transport rollers rotate together on an adjustable incline. The feed rolls are positioned above the transport rolls. The rotation direction of each feed and transport roller can vary along with its speed. As the feed rollers rotate the feeding threads will push out the product from the hopper and drop the product onto the transport rollers which will sort them along the length of the transport rollers. As the roller angle increases so does the product feed rate.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention is a feed and transport system to transport and count items of a tablet form from a common stored area to a product counting sensor head. Two parallel feed and transport rollers align the product before allowing it to exit downwards past a product sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Prior Art Statement</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Machines currently in use have problems feeding tablets or small parts smoothly, accurately, quickly and in line to a product sensor. Common practice is to vibrate tablets in a vibratory bowl or down &#x201c;V&#x201d; shaped vibrating channels by a product sensor. Part of the problem with vibrating the tablets are that the vibration itself could damage the product, thus producing dust that must later be extracted before the product can be packaged. Also, vibration is loud and there is a maximum output product feed rate that any vibrator can produce. Another problem is that on high speed counting machines several vibrating &#x201c;V&#x201d; shaped channels are operated by one vibrator, thus making it impossible to control the feed rate of only one &#x201c;V&#x201d; shaped channel at a time. For instance, see the Batchmaster&#xae; II brochure and/or the Batchmaster&#xae; III brochure from Batching Systems Inc., 50 Jibsail Drive, Prince Frederick, Md. 20678.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Rotating centrifugal discs or discs with pockets are also used to align and to feed tablets into a straight row. Tablets are deposited on to a rotating flat surface which rotates and centrifugal force moves the tablets to the outside guide over the disc to align the tablets into a straight row. These types of systems are prone to jamming and could require changing parts to suit different tablet sizes and shapes. For instance, see the RTC 15 and RTC 200 brochures from Romaco US, 104 American Road, Morris Plains, N.J. 07950.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another common method of feeding tablets is using a horizontal rotating disk. Centrifugal force forces the tablets to an outside guide. Many times there would be two or more rows of tablets together, so special adjustable deflectors are used to separate them toward the most outward row. This type of system could also cause product jamming or damage. For instance, see the brochure on the Pharmafill Model TC4 manufactured by Deitz Co., 1750 Route 34, P.O. Box 1108, Wall, N.J., 07719.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another method is using a rotating vacuum disc, sucking the tablets to it. These discs are normally shaped to suite different tablet profiles. For instance, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,505,460 issued on 14 Jan. 2003 to John T. Aylward. A related method and apparatus is a machine with a rotating vacuum drum having holes disposed through one face of the drum wherein a vacuum is supplied to that face which holds tablets against the drum face until dropped by removal of the vacuum. For instance, see the U.S. Pat. No. 6,997,341 issued to Pearson, et al., on 14 Feb. 2006.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Yet another method is having moving or rotating pockets designed specifically for each different tablet Profile. This method is expensive, complicated, it takes a lot of time to clean and to change over, and dedicated to tablet size and shape. For instance, see the Pragron CC30 brochure of Pragron Engineering Co., Plot No. 164/B, Door No 1, 1st floor Daudi Road, Off Kalyan Shill Road, Dombivali (E) Thane&#x2014;400 606&#x2014;Maharashtra, India.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A method of conveying contamination sensitive product to containers to be filled is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,568,151 issued to Buckley, et al., on 27 May 2003 wherein a conveyor belt with pockets moulded in to suit each tablet shape and size moves the product toward an end thereof where the product drops into aligned containers. The belt is discarded with each run of product.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">All of these common practices are either expensive, noisy, may damage the product, dedicated to given tablet size, and/or each lane is not independently controllable.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is also known to align product into a given orientation using inclined, spaced apart rolls rotating in the same direction. A typical device is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 477,093 issued on 14 Jun. 1892 to Charles K. Wead. The spacing between the rolls is critical in order to allow a narrow portion of the article to drop between the rolls thus aligning the article in the proper orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another method of aligning product into a given orientation is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,434,886 issued to John Fajt on 6 Mar. 1984 wherein the inclined, spaced apart tapered rolls are counter rotating. Parts are deposited adjacent the large end of the rolls and the parts assume a particular orientation by action of the rolls and incline. The parts are moved to the small end of the rolls and accumulated thereat by spring wires.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is further known to provide a seed planter with counter rotating rolls disposed below a seed hopper wherein the rolls transport seed to a drop point. For instance, see the U.S. Pat. No. 3,913,798 issued on 21 Oct. 1975 to Steve R. Allen or the U.S. Pat. No. 1,604,133 issued on 26 Oct. 1926 to Eugene Rebechini The rolls of these devices have grooves disposed into the surface thereof which is detrimental to formed tablets of the pharmaceutical industry. Grooved rolls tend to chip, fracture and abrade these formed tablets. Therefore, it is of great importance to provide a sort and transport roller with a smooth surface and/or a superimposed thread to reduce the incidence of breakage or dusting.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Finally, it is known to introduce pharmaceutical products into blister packs with an apparatus that has counter rotating rolls of a particular configuration in order to allow the product to drop between the rolls into wells of the blister pack. For instance, see the U.S. Pat. No. 7,318,304 B2 issued on 15 Jan. 2008 to Hiddink, et al.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">All of these rotating roll devices rely upon precise configuration of the rolls and critical spacing in order to perform the particular task. In order to perform a similar task on a different product, either the spacing must be changed, the rolls reconfigured to accommodate the new product or both.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, the aforementioned problems and difficulties are obviated by the present invention. This high-speed item feeder provides a quiet, individual, non-change part feeding system for tablets or small parts. Items to be transported, counted and collected in a container are either circular, spherical, oblate spheroid, cylindrical or oblong, hereinafter tablets, in general and round tablets for circular or spherical items and capsule tablets for cylindrical or oblong items. Such items may be medicaments, confections, toys, wooden or metal plugs, caps, pins and the like. Thus, round tablets usually have a thickness less than the diameter thereof or may be entirely spherical. In contrast, capsule tablets have a greater length than width and/or height. The device of this invention is short in length and can adapt to most tablet shapes and sizes. It's individually controlled and feeds and separate tablets/parts in a single row towards a product count sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Therefore it's among the primary objectives of this invention to provide a spaced out single row of tablets towards a product count sensor head.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A second object of this invention is to provide two parallel rollers with or without different thread configurations in order to drive tablets or product along its length from a hopper to its lower discharge end.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A third objective of the present invention is to be able to control the speed and direction of rotation of the feed and transport rollers and to be able to start and stop the rollers to control each individual feeding lane.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A fourth objective is to have the two feed and transport rollers with or without feed threads extended into the product hopper which will assist in pushing the product out of it.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A fifth objective is to have two feed rolls with or without feed threads extended under a product hopper which will assist in pushing the product out of the hopper transport rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A sixth objective is to have two sort and transport rollers with or without feed threads that extend beyond an end of two feed rolls for sorting objects dropped thereon by the feed rolls into a stable and steady stream.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Yet another objective is to provide a hopper with a sloped bottom wall disposed above two feed rolls wherein the sloped wall terminates adjacent a square thread superimposed upon the feed rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Still another objective is to provide a counting and reject block with a curved wall which has a center point on a pivot of a roller module to direct tablets smoothly toward a counting field established by a counting sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another objective of the invention is to demonstrate different feed thread configurations and surface finishes that will assist in transporting the product along the parallel rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Still another objective of the invention is to be able to control the angle of the rollers so as to increase the feed rate of the tablets/parts, and/or to reduce the flow as the tablets could have a tendency to roll or slide easily.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A last objective is to add in a lane divider along the centre line of the feed and transport rollers thus creating two separate tablet lanes with its own tablet sensor. By doing so effectively, the tablet output rate could be doubled.</p>

Side plates <b>67</b> have a deflector assembly <b>6</b> movably associated therewith, deflector assembly <b>6</b> having a lower edge <b>56</b> disposed between tablet guides <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and disposed in proximity to feed rolls <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>. In the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, feed roll <b>4</b> has smooth surface <b>59</b> extending beyond exit port <b>58</b> of hopper <b>1</b> to end plate <b>15</b> and feed roll <b>5</b> is a fluted roll having a thread <b>36</b> built upon a smooth surface <b>57</b>, the function of rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> to be fully set forth hereafter. Pivot plate <b>21</b> has a handle <b>10</b> extending beyond frame <b>27</b>, handle <b>10</b> used to pivot roller module <b>20</b> relative to base frame <b>55</b> around pivot <b>65</b> to provide for different traverse speeds along smooth portions of rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>, base frame <b>55</b> comprises a pair of bottom rails <b>60</b>, only one visible, which have end blocks <b>61</b> affixed thereto. End blocks <b>61</b> support a top plate <b>13</b> of base frame <b>55</b> in spaced relationship to bottom rails <b>60</b>. Pivotally mounted adjacent one end block <b>61</b> and opposite tablet chute <b>16</b>, is a pin support <b>8</b>, pin support <b>8</b> having a plurality of notches <b>62</b> disposed into one edge thereof for receiving a pin <b>9</b> protruding from drive plate <b>22</b> of roller module <b>20</b>. Top plate <b>13</b> has pivot support <b>14</b> extending upwardly therefrom, pivot support <b>14</b> provided with pivot <b>65</b> adjacent an upper end thereof. Pivot <b>65</b> may comprise a roll pin or the like, pivot <b>65</b> passing through side plates <b>67</b> and pivot support <b>14</b>. Pivot support <b>14</b> and pin support <b>8</b> cooperate to allow roller module <b>20</b> to be disposed at various angles relative to base frame <b>55</b>. When handle <b>10</b> of roller module <b>20</b> is lifted to tilt roller module <b>20</b>, and hence rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, pin <b>9</b> is engaged within one notch <b>62</b> to retain roller module <b>20</b> at a specific angle to enhance movement of tablets <b>101</b> downwardly along rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>. A jacking motor <b>11</b> is supported by top plate <b>13</b> for mechanically raising and lowering roller module <b>20</b>, however, roller module <b>20</b> may also be raised by hand using handle <b>10</b>. At the beginning of an operation, tablets <b>101</b> are placed into hopper <b>1</b> in engagement with thread <b>35</b> of rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>. As transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> rotate along their axis, tablets <b>101</b> are pushed through exit port <b>58</b> of hopper <b>1</b> and along the length of transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. As the angle of roller module <b>20</b> is increased, tablets <b>101</b> will flow more easily due to gravity. Also, as tablets <b>101</b> travel down the centerline between transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, they are separated by the action of thread <b>36</b> and the rotation of transport rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, tablets <b>101</b> then exit at exit drop point <b>64</b> of transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> and drop down tablet chute <b>16</b>, through a product sensor/reject block <b>17</b> and are then gated and discharged through a discharge chute <b>19</b> into an empty container (not shown) below.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> specifically, a typical drive arrangement of prime mover <b>12</b> drives a driver pulley <b>26</b> and through belt <b>25</b> drives driven pulley <b>42</b>. Driven pulley <b>42</b> is affixed to an end of roller <b>5</b> and drives a gear <b>23</b> which in turn drives transport roller <b>4</b> through another gear <b>23</b>. Prime mover <b>12</b> is preferably mounted to drive plate <b>22</b> with a shaft protruding through drive plate <b>22</b> for affixing pulley <b>26</b> thereto. Likewise, roller <b>5</b> extends through drive plate <b>26</b> a sufficient distance in order to affix gear <b>23</b> and driven pulley <b>42</b> thereto and roller <b>4</b> extends through drive plate <b>26</b> far enough to mount its driven gear <b>23</b>. In another embodiment, prime mover <b>12</b> may be coupled directly to gear <b>23</b>, therefore not using the belt <b>25</b> and pulley <b>42</b> and <b>26</b> arrangement. In yet another embodiment, a &#x201c;V&#x201d; belt or &#x201c;O&#x201d; ring type belt, could be used to replace the drive shown. This system would allow for slippage of feed screws <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> if some tablets <b>101</b> should get jammed in hopper <b>1</b> exit port <b>58</b>. Tablet deflector <b>6</b> is supported slightly above tablet guides <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> disposed on side plates <b>67</b> and has legs <b>7</b> extending downwardly alongside side plates <b>67</b>. Legs <b>7</b> may be attached to side plates <b>67</b> or may be movable therealong for repositioning tablet deflector <b>6</b> in multiple positions along side plates <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, roller module <b>20</b> is removable from base <b>55</b> by removal of pivot <b>65</b>, thus allowing roller module <b>20</b> to be lifted free of base <b>55</b>. Roller module <b>20</b> as shown now separated from base <b>55</b> could be stacked or arranged with other roller modules <b>20</b> to form a high output capacity machine with each roller module <b>20</b> having its own drive and control system as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> a high speed tablet feeder machine comprises multiple pairs of roller modules <b>20</b>, equally spaced, in side by side relationship, independently acting and discharging tablets <b>101</b> past at least one product count head <b>17</b> through a tablet gating system into separate containers below. All of these roller assemblies <b>20</b> would be fed from a common hopper <b>1</b> and tilting device. This high speed tablet feeder machine would have an independent prime mover and control systems for each roller module <b>20</b> to separately control each tablet pair feed rate and their starting and stopping points. Alternately, roller modules <b>20</b> may all discharge through a common counting head with discharge into a single container for bulk packing of production runs.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a high-speed rotary tablet-filling machine comprises many roller modules <b>20</b> grouped together with a common hopper <b>1</b> and tilting arrangement in a circular orientation, equally spaced from a common centre point outwards. Each roller module <b>20</b> would have an independent prime mover <b>12</b> and control system (not shown). This group of roller modules <b>20</b> would rotate around their common centre axis while each set of roller modules dispense tablets <b>101</b> to a single container below. Other configurations of multiple roller modules <b>20</b> of this invention may be designed to take advantage of the high speed feeding nature of roller modules <b>20</b>. Another version of this high speed counting machine comprises the option of adding or removing high speed tablet feeder modules in order to increase the overall machine tablet output rate. This machine would be made out of individual roller modules that are operated independently out of one controller.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a pair of smooth transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b> after feed thread <b>35</b> ends proximate exit port <b>58</b> of hopper <b>1</b>. Smooth rolls <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> are well suited for capsule tablets <b>28</b> having a longitudinal length greater than the transverse width or diameter, if round. Feed threads <b>35</b> are used to help feed and push capsule tablets <b>28</b> out of hopper <b>1</b>, preferably seriatim, however, exit port <b>58</b> of hopper <b>1</b> is sufficiently large to pass all sizes and shapes of tablets <b>101</b>. It should be apparent that although capsule tablets <b>28</b> generally have the greatest length, the aspect ratio of height or thickness to length is less than some round tablets <b>29</b>. Thus, more than one capsule tablet <b>28</b> may pass through exit port <b>58</b> and become &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; upon at least one other capsule tablet <b>28</b>. Accordingly, exit port <b>58</b> of hopper <b>1</b> may be fitted with a movable gate to assist with an orderly discharge of tablets <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> from hopper <b>1</b>. Smooth rolls <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> allow tablets <b>101</b> to move freely upon the outer surfaces <b>59</b>, <b>63</b> respectively, thereof, and with an increasing angle to roller module <b>20</b>, capsule tablets <b>28</b> may become dislodged from the &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; relationship by the rolling action of rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b>, however, as will be fully explained later, mechanical means is also provided to ensure that &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; tablets <b>101</b> are not permitted to pass a tablet counter sensor <b>54</b> thus ensuring an accurate count of tablets <b>101</b> in all containers.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows a roller arrangement similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, but instead of having two smooth rollers, transport roller <b>30</b> was replaced with threaded roller <b>5</b> having thread <b>36</b> disposed upon smooth surface <b>57</b>, thread <b>36</b> disposed at a higher angle helix than thread <b>35</b> under hopper <b>1</b>. This arrangement, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, helps feed round shaped tablets <b>29</b>, separate them, and control their travel as they roll and move down towards exit drop end <b>64</b> of transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. As a round tablet <b>29</b> encounters thread <b>36</b>, that round tablet <b>29</b> will follow thread <b>36</b> downwardly toward exit drop point <b>64</b> of rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> allowing other round tablets <b>29</b> to follow in close proximity. Typically, at the high speed rate of roller module <b>20</b> of this invention, round tablets <b>29</b> are disposed in a contiguous sequence along the length of rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, but roller <b>4</b> has been replaced with a threaded roller <b>31</b>, threaded roller <b>31</b> having a thread <b>36</b> disposed in opposite hand to thread <b>36</b> of roller <b>5</b>. As both rollers <b>31</b> and <b>5</b> are threaded, there is a greater tendency to push round tablets <b>29</b> toward exit drop point <b>64</b> thus increasing the overall rate of production. The counter rotating threads serve as well to increase the transport rollers <b>31</b> and <b>5</b> round tablets <b>29</b> stopping ability.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> shows threaded transport roller <b>5</b> having a higher pitch thread <b>24</b> adjacent exit drop point <b>64</b> with a variable thread pitch <b>43</b> or transition thread <b>43</b> on roller <b>5</b> between standard pitch thread <b>36</b> and high speed thread <b>24</b>. Thus, as thread <b>36</b> extends toward exit drop point <b>64</b> of roller <b>5</b>, the pitch of thread <b>36</b> increases. This produces more space between the flutes of threads <b>36</b>, thus spacing out round tablets <b>29</b> more therefore resulting in less doubling up of round tablets <b>29</b> at exit drop point <b>64</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> shows smooth roller <b>4</b> and compound thread roller <b>5</b>, however, a cooperating compound roller <b>5</b> may be used in place of smooth roller <b>4</b> without detriment to the function of roller module <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows threads <b>36</b> separating the flow of round tablets <b>29</b> along the length thereof. Threads <b>36</b> prevent round tablets <b>29</b> from rolling uncontrollably off exit drop point <b>64</b> of transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. When transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> stop turning, threads <b>36</b> act as a stop and prevents round tablets <b>29</b> from rolling off exit drop point <b>64</b> while rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> are stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a cross section view of tablet feed threads <b>35</b> of all rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b> which are located under hopper <b>1</b>. A typical tooth profile of thread <b>35</b> is shown, threads <b>35</b> spaced closer together compared with transport threads <b>36</b>. Tablet feed threads <b>35</b> have rounded edges so as not to damage tablets <b>101</b> but have straight sides to allow maximum pull or feeding of the tablets <b>101</b> from hopper <b>1</b> through exit port <b>58</b>. Feed threads <b>35</b> under hopper <b>1</b> tend to agitate and rotate tablets <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> thus dislodging dust associated therewith wherein the dust and any chips contained in the bulk of tablets will drop through a gap <b>39</b> between rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b> into a tray or be drawn away from roller assembly <b>20</b> in a vacuum system.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows across section view of the transport threads <b>36</b> of rollers <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b>. These threads <b>36</b> are spaced further apart compared with tablet feed threads <b>35</b>. Transport threads <b>36</b> group several round shaped tablets <b>29</b> together which act as a stop when transport roller <b>5</b> is not rotating. The tooth profile of transport threads <b>36</b> is rounded in order not to damage tablets <b>101</b>. Additionally the tooth profile does not have straight right angle sides so as to enable tablets <b>101</b> to slide over the top of transport threads <b>36</b> in order to fill in any tablet gaps in the tablet stream. The principle is not only to allow the flow of tablets <b>101</b> to spread out evenly along the length of the transport roller <b>5</b>, but also to prevent round tablets <b>29</b> from rolling off of exit drop point <b>64</b> of transport roller <b>5</b> when the roller has stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a side view of high-speed tablet feeder <b>100</b>. The two possible methods of tilting roller module <b>20</b> of high-speed tablet feeder <b>100</b> are shown. As previously set forth, one method is to use jacking motor <b>11</b> extending or retracting a screw which will raise or lower pivot plate <b>21</b> and hence entire roller module <b>20</b>, thus increasing or decreasing transport roller angle. Another way to change the angle of roller module <b>20</b> is to manually lift tilt handle <b>10</b> up or down. As roller module <b>20</b> is raised by tilt handle <b>10</b>, tilt pin <b>9</b> is relocated into one of notches <b>62</b> in tilt plate <b>8</b>. Likewise, when roller module <b>20</b> is lowered, tilt handle <b>10</b> is used to support roller module <b>20</b> while disengaging pin <b>9</b> from one notch <b>62</b>. Roller module <b>20</b> is then lowered to a desired angle and has pin <b>9</b> re-engaged with another notch <b>62</b>. Although only two notches <b>62</b> are shown in tilt plate <b>8</b>, any number of notches <b>62</b> may be provided consistent with the size of notches <b>62</b>. Thus, as tilt plate <b>8</b> is pivotable upon, and relative to frame <b>55</b>, the angle of roller module <b>20</b> relative to frame <b>55</b> may readily be altered.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows different angles for transport of common round tablets <b>29</b> and capsule shaped tablets <b>28</b>. Raising roller module <b>20</b> and hence transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> will increase tablet flow rate on smooth sections <b>57</b>, <b>59</b> of rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>. Since round tablets <b>29</b> will start to roll at a smaller angle as compared to an angle allowing capsule shaped tablets <b>28</b> to slide, the angle of tilt of roller module <b>20</b> need not be as great for round tablets <b>29</b>. However, by holding back round tablets <b>29</b> against thread <b>36</b> will result in tablet transport threads <b>36</b> allowing transport roller <b>5</b> to be disposed at a greater angle than the angle of repose for round tablets <b>29</b>. Though applicable to rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b> but best visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the last short portion <b>37</b> of transport rollers <b>4</b> does not have tablet threads <b>36</b> disposed thereon and hence, this last section <b>37</b> is smooth before the tablets <b>29</b> exit transport roller <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b>. Smooth section <b>37</b> is there to stabilize the discharging tablets <b>29</b> so as to increase the accuracy of drop of round tablets <b>29</b> for detection and counting. Capsule tablets <b>28</b> do not roll so there is no requirement for the use of tablet threads <b>36</b> and therefore the angle of smooth transport rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> angle can be greater than with round tablets <b>29</b>. Normally for capsule tablets <b>28</b>, the angle of roller module <b>20</b> and hence transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b> is increased to a point just before tablets <b>28</b> start to slide on their own due to gravity with rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> stopped, generally known as the angle of repose.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows pivot <b>65</b> of roller module <b>20</b> relative to transport rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b>. Pivot <b>65</b> is on the centerline <b>69</b> of transport rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b> and exactly at exit drop point <b>64</b>. By having pivot <b>65</b> in this location, the discharge height location from rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b> will always remain the same though roller module <b>20</b> may be disposed at the various angles as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows an end cross-section view of transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b>. Adjacent and overlapping at least a portion of each of rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> is a tablet side guide <b>33</b>, side guide <b>33</b> disposed between each set of transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b> when rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> are arranged in side by side relationship as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref>. Side guide <b>33</b> has a slope <b>66</b> to prevent any tablets <b>29</b> from collecting on it and due to gravity, helps push any &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; tablets <b>29</b> downwards into the centre roll gap <b>39</b>. Tablet side guide <b>33</b> covers at least one half of the length of transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b>, from exit port <b>58</b> of hopper <b>1</b> without presenting any horizontal surface between rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b>, thus preventing any tablets <b>29</b> from collecting instead of travelling along rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b>. Tablet side guide <b>33</b> is also used to cover an empty space between sets of transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows a one-piece version of tablet side guide <b>33</b> comprising sloped surfaces <b>66</b> formed within a top guide cover <b>34</b>. Tablet top guide cover <b>34</b> acts like a tablet side guide <b>33</b> and a cover over tablets <b>29</b> all in one, thus guiding tablets <b>29</b> and protecting tablets <b>29</b> from the environment. Top guide cover <b>34</b> could be transparent and may be made to cover many transport roller assemblies <b>20</b> at once.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows how capsule tablets <b>28</b> exit a square shaped end <b>41</b> at exit point <b>64</b> of a smooth transport roller <b>32</b>, transport roller <b>32</b> differing from transport roller <b>4</b> by this square end <b>41</b>. Elongated capsule tablets <b>28</b> exiting square end <b>41</b> of rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> will exit at different orientations as the center of gravity of each tablet <b>28</b> passes blunt end <b>41</b> causing capsule tablets <b>28</b> to tumble when discharging from exit point <b>64</b>. This tablet flipping action causes capsule tablet <b>28</b> to be unstable and can increase the difficulties for the product count sensor <b>54</b> to distinguish between different tablets <b>101</b> thus likely rejecting and gating these spinning tablets <b>28</b> as they are falling and bouncing downwardly toward and into sensor field <b>70</b> established by product count sensors <b>54</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Therefore, in the instant invention, a roller chamfer <b>40</b> is used to best advantage for capsule shaped tablets <b>28</b>. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows capsule shaped tablet <b>28</b> exiting chamfer shaped end <b>40</b> at exit point <b>64</b> of a transport roller <b>4</b> therefore gradually directing the flow direction of capsule tablets <b>28</b>. Here capsule tablets <b>28</b> do not just drop off exit point <b>64</b> of transport roller <b>4</b>, but are directed as shown into a substantially continuous stream as established between transport rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> during the transport of tablets <b>28</b> along the length thereof. As can be appreciated by observing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, tablets <b>28</b> are oriented in a particular aspect and retain that aspect upon dropping from exit point <b>64</b> thus permitting extremely accurate detection and counting by tablet count sensors <b>54</b>. However, it has been found that the orderly dropping action provided by roller chamfer <b>40</b> is disrupted in prior art sorting machines as these prior art machines are provided with a discharge chute having straight walled front sensor block <b>71</b> and a straight walled rear sensor block <b>72</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>. Thus, capsule tablets <b>28</b> are caused to fall against the straight wall of straight walled front sensor block <b>71</b> and the flipping action of capsule tablets <b>28</b> is again regenerated as capsule tablets <b>28</b> fall toward sensor field <b>70</b>. Some capsule tablets <b>28</b> may fall freely and most impact the straight wall, therefore increasing the likelihood that two or more capsule tablets <b>28</b> will be in sensor field <b>70</b> at the same time as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> and thus one or more of capsule tablets <b>28</b> do not get counted. The discharge speed, and/or the mass of capsule tablets <b>28</b> also alter the exit trajectory and may cause some capsule tablets <b>28</b> to bounce against the straight wall of straight walled front sensor block <b>71</b> rebounding against a straight wall of straight walled rear sensor block <b>72</b> further impacting count accuracy. Bouncing against straight walls may cause damage to capsule tablets <b>28</b>, including fragmentation and most certainly results in dust being created by the frictional engagement against these straight walls. Fragments created by the bouncing action will pass into sensor field <b>70</b> and thus may be counted as a complete capsule tablet <b>28</b> rather than being rejected, thus causing an inaccurate count in a container being filled. Bouncing against the straight walls also causes deceleration of the capsule tablets <b>28</b>, again greatly increasing the likelihood that multiple capsule tablets <b>28</b> may be in sensor field <b>70</b> simultaneously and therefore causing an inaccurate count. Furthermore, where the flow of capsule tablets <b>28</b> is split by count sensor <b>54</b>, tumbling capsule tablets <b>28</b> and/or fragments may be misdirected into an incorrect container and the count in one container may be high while another container count is low. Of course, since multiple tumbling capsule tablets <b>28</b> may not be counted there is the possibility that all containers being filled may be high.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In contrast to the tumbling action of capsule shaped tablets <b>28</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> and the preferred orderly stream shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows round shaped tablets <b>29</b> exiting cleanly and in a straight orientation from square shaped end <b>41</b> at exit point <b>64</b> of smooth transport roller <b>32</b>. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows round shaped tablets <b>29</b> exiting cleanly, stable, and in a straight orientation from chamfer shaped end <b>40</b> at exit point <b>64</b> of a transport roller <b>4</b>. As round tablets <b>29</b> exit from exit drop point <b>64</b> in the same orientation as established upon rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b>, detection and counting of round tablets <b>29</b> is easily and accurately accomplished. It has also been found that the orderly dropping action of round tablets <b>29</b> is disrupted in prior art sorting machines by the straight walled front sensor block <b>71</b> and a straight walled rear sensor block <b>72</b> discharge chute as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>. As with capsule tablets <b>28</b>, round tablets <b>29</b> also fall against the straight wall of straight walled front sensor block <b>71</b> and thus round tablets <b>29</b> also flip as round tablets <b>29</b> fall toward sensor field <b>70</b>. Some round tablets <b>29</b> may fall freely but most impact the straight wall wherein some rebound against a straight wall of rear sensor block <b>72</b> and some tip into a flat orientation therefore increasing the likelihood that two or more round tablets <b>29</b> will be in sensor field <b>70</b> at the same time as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> and thus one or more of round tablets <b>29</b> do not get counted. Likewise, as discharge speed of round tablets <b>29</b> and/or the mass of round tablets <b>29</b> is changed, the exit trajectory is altered further impacting count accuracy. Bouncing against straight walls may cause damage to round tablets <b>29</b>, including fragmentation and most certainly results in dust being created by the frictional engagement against these straight walls. Fragments created by the bouncing action will pass into sensor field <b>70</b> and thus may be counted as a complete round tablet <b>29</b> rather than being rejected, thus causing an inaccurate count in a container being filled. Bouncing against the straight walls also causes deceleration of the round tablets <b>29</b>, again greatly increasing the likelihood that multiple round tablets <b>29</b> may be in sensor field <b>70</b> simultaneously and therefore causing an inaccurate count. Furthermore, where the flow of round tablets <b>29</b> is split by count sensor <b>54</b>, tumbling round tablets <b>29</b> and/or fragments may be misdirected into an incorrect container and the count in one container may be high while another container count is low. Of course, since multiple tumbling round tablets <b>29</b> may not be counted there is the possibility that all containers being filled may be high.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Counting accuracy is greatly improved in the instant invention by providing roller chamfer <b>40</b> on feed and transport rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B and 11B</figref> or sort and transport rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> and by providing a curved wall <b>76</b> on a discharge side of a radiused tablet guide block <b>73</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref> such that both capsule tablets <b>28</b> and round tablets <b>29</b> engage curved wall <b>76</b> in a tangential fashion thus directing the previously established orderly stream of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> toward and through sensor field <b>70</b>. Since tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> follow along curved wall <b>76</b>, flipping is eliminated and thus only one tablet <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> is presented to sensor field <b>70</b> at a time and therefore product count sensors <b>54</b> provide exact counting of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b>. Curved wall <b>76</b> has a fixed radius centered on pivot <b>65</b> and thus radiused tablet guide block <b>73</b> remains fixed in position, tablet sensors <b>54</b> remain fixed and discharge chute <b>19</b> remains vertically oriented.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A</figref>, B, C, and D show different transport roller rotating configurations and how the rotation affects round tablet <b>29</b> placements on smooth transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b>. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b> are rotating inwardly and downwardly with respect to each other, typical round shape tablet <b>29</b> sitting between rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> wherein the action of transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b> is pulling round tablet <b>29</b> downwardly resulting in a more vertical orientation for round tablet <b>29</b>. In this vertical orientation, there is more friction and load on round tablets <b>29</b>. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> shows transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b> rotating outwardly and upwardly with respect to each other resulting in round tablet <b>29</b> tending to tip toward one of transport rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b>. This set up lifts tablet <b>29</b> and reduces the friction and stress on it and hence, round tablet <b>29</b> is freer to move and to roll forward. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> is a preferred direction of rotation for rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> which is especially true with fluted rollers <b>5</b>, <b>31</b> as the outwardly and upwardly counter rotation cooperates with thread <b>36</b> to advance round tablets <b>29</b> along the length thereof. It is possible within the scope of this invention to provide for rotation of both rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> in the same direction. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>, transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b> are shown turning clockwise in the same direction which causes capsule tablets <b>28</b> to roll and could cause round shaped tablets <b>29</b> to flip. This same direction rotation set up results in tablets <b>101</b> being less stable and could cause flipping or rolling at the point of exit <b>64</b>. Though rolls <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> are shown to be turning clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, counterclockwise rotation is also within the scope of this invention. Additionally, it is fully within the scope of this invention to provide for smooth roll <b>4</b> to be larger or smaller in diameter than an adjacent smooth roll <b>30</b> or fluted roll <b>5</b> to further assist in orientation of tablets <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>. Prime mover <b>12</b> may also be modulated such that rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b> are rapidly rotated and stopped imparting a rotational vibration thereto to facilitate movement of tablets <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>. Thus, rollers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>32</b> may be different in diameter, rotated at different constant angles of rotation, and/or rotationally oscillated.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref>, round shaped tablets <b>29</b> acting as explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> with typical tablet side guides <b>33</b> will slide into gap <b>39</b> by action of side guides <b>33</b> and counter rotation of rolls <b>4</b>, <b>30</b>. Some round tablets <b>29</b> may tilt toward one roll <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> while others may tilt toward the opposed roll <b>30</b>, <b>4</b>. Where a round tablet <b>29</b> tends to ride high on a roll <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> such as shown on roll <b>30</b>, round tablet <b>29</b> will rotate on its axis by action of roll <b>30</b> along side guide <b>33</b> and move inwardly toward gap <b>39</b>. Likewise, a round tablet <b>29</b> tending to ride under another round tablet <b>29</b> as on roll <b>4</b>, the upper round tablet <b>29</b> will also rotate on its axis, and by rotation of roll <b>4</b> and retention of side guide <b>33</b> will tend to push this upper round tablet <b>29</b> downwardly into gap <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> shows that a single capsule shaped tablet <b>28</b> between smooth transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b> does not rotate since both transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b> are turning in opposite directions upwardly and outwardly with respect to each other. It is necessary then to angle roller module <b>20</b> at a sufficient angle to allow capsule shaped tablets <b>28</b> to move along the length of rolls <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> to exit point <b>64</b>. Usually, capsule shaped tablets <b>28</b> will move in single file along the length of rolls <b>4</b>, <b>30</b>, however, in certain instances as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, two capsule tablets <b>28</b> are &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; together. In this orientation, a bottom tablet <b>45</b> is sitting in between transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b>, and because of &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; tablet <b>44</b>, bottom tablet <b>45</b> is rolling in one direction, usually opposite in direction to the roll <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> against which tablet <b>45</b> has the greatest force. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, that higher force caused by &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; tablet <b>44</b> is against roll <b>4</b> and hence bottom tablet <b>45</b> rotates opposite to roll <b>4</b>. Since &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; tablet <b>44</b> has the bulk of its weight against roll <b>30</b>, &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; tablet <b>44</b> is rotating in a direction opposite to roll <b>30</b> and opposite to bottom tablet <b>45</b>. This rolling action dislodges upper tablet <b>44</b> and makes it unstable causing upper tablet <b>44</b> to work its way downwards to an empty space between other tablets <b>28</b> on transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a typical isometric view of a section of transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b>. Round shaped tablets <b>29</b> align themselves in a single row due to rotation and gravity. Any &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; tablets <b>29</b> will pry, find, or create a gap in between other round tablets <b>29</b> in the row of tablets <b>29</b> disposed in gap <b>39</b> between rolls <b>4</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> shows the function of tablet deflector <b>6</b> and how tablet deflector <b>6</b> allows only a single stream of capsule tablets <b>28</b> to pass under it. Tablet deflector <b>6</b> stops &#x201c;piggybacked&#x201d; or doubled up rows of tablets <b>28</b>. Where &#x201c;piggybacked&#x201d; tablets <b>28</b> occur, the upper tablet <b>44</b> will rotate as shown due to the rotating transport roller <b>4</b> as explained above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> while tablet <b>45</b> under upper tablet <b>44</b> will be rotating in the opposite direction. This rotation reduces the friction between tablets <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> and allows lower tablet <b>45</b> to continue to pass under the tablet deflector <b>6</b>. Upper tablet <b>44</b> will stay in this position until a space occurs between the lower flow of tablets <b>45</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> shows an end cross-section view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> and the respective rotations of capsules shaped tablets <b>44</b> and <b>45</b>, rolls <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> and a gap <b>38</b> under tablet deflector <b>6</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref> shows a top view of a typical capsule shaped tablet <b>28</b> grouping between two transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b> prior to encountering tablet deflector <b>6</b>. Arrangement &#x201c;A&#x201d; shows a typical &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; tablet <b>44</b> which will rotate between each other in opposite directions as explained above. Also upper tablet <b>44</b> will normally travel along the top of lower tablets <b>45</b> until tablet <b>44</b> finds a space in flow of tablet <b>45</b>. Since there is less friction for upper tablet <b>44</b> against bottom tablet <b>45</b> than the friction tablet <b>45</b> has against rolls <b>4</b>, <b>30</b>, upper tablet <b>44</b> will travel faster than bottom tablet <b>45</b>. Arrangement &#x201c;B&#x201d; shows a typical wedge in tablet <b>46</b>. Front tablet <b>48</b> in front of wedge tablet <b>46</b> will continue to advance forward until wedge tablet <b>46</b> drops into tablet flow between tablet <b>48</b> and any trailing tablet. In some instances, it is possible for a partially &#x201c;piggy backed&#x201d; tablet to advance ahead of a lower tablet. For instance, in arrangement &#x201c;C,&#x201d; lead-in wedge tablet <b>47</b> will slide ahead of trailing tablet <b>49</b> and drop in place in front of tablet <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16D</figref>, E, and F show a capsule shaped tablet <b>50</b> horizontally across both rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> and stopped by tablet deflector <b>6</b> as transport rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b> continue to rotate. One end of capsule shaped tablet <b>50</b> will drop down between two rollers <b>4</b> and <b>30</b>, and then rotate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> shows a side view of tablet deflector <b>6</b> with roll <b>30</b> removed for clarity. Lower leading edge <b>56</b> of tablet deflector <b>6</b> has a generous radius thereupon in order to deflect or guide tablets <b>101</b> downwards and under tablet deflector <b>6</b> without jamming the tablet flow. This radius acts for &#x201c;piggybacked&#x201d; tablets <b>44</b> as it stops upper tablet <b>44</b> from travelling forward. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> shows a &#x201c;piggybacked&#x201d; tablet <b>44</b> on an angle in front of a second tablet <b>28</b>. This wedge tablet <b>44</b> will be directed under tablet guide <b>6</b> and any trailing tablet will wait until wedge tablet <b>44</b> passes through. Wedged <b>44</b> tablet will also rotate due to its contact with one roller <b>4</b>, <b>30</b>. The tablet rolling action will help prevent tablet <b>44</b> from jamming and thus tablet <b>44</b> will wiggle its way under tablet deflector <b>6</b>. This tablet deflector <b>6</b> could be made out of a flexible material such as rubber or spring loaded in order to lessen the possibility of jamming. Also the height of tablet deflector <b>6</b> above rolls <b>4</b>, <b>30</b> can be raised or lowered to increase or to decrease the gap between deflector <b>4</b> and transport rollers <b>4</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">An alternate roller module <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> wherein a single lane divider <b>52</b> along the centre line between transport rollers <b>5</b> and <b>31</b>. Lane divider <b>52</b> travels the entire length of transport rollers <b>5</b> and <b>31</b> from inside product hopper <b>1</b> past tablet exit point <b>64</b> of transport rollers <b>5</b> and <b>31</b>. Lane divider <b>52</b> thus divides tablets <b>101</b> from hopper <b>1</b> into two separate streams for separate counting and capturing through separate tablet chutes <b>53</b> and past individual tablet counters <b>54</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> shows an end view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> where transport rollers <b>5</b> and <b>31</b> are shown rotating in directions opposite to each other, although they could be rotated in any direction desired. Lane divider <b>52</b> is shown standing vertical and on the centre line between transport rollers <b>5</b> and <b>31</b>. Transport rollers <b>5</b> and <b>31</b> have tablet feed threads <b>35</b> disposed under hopper <b>1</b> and tablet threads <b>36</b> along the entire length thereof similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. A capsule shaped tablet <b>28</b> will tend to rotate and align parallel to the lane divider <b>52</b> and transport rollers <b>5</b> and <b>31</b>. Round shaped tablets <b>29</b> will remain flat against transport roller <b>5</b> and <b>31</b> as shown. Tablet side guides <b>33</b> act in the same manner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> shows a top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>. Tablets <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> are being divided into two lanes by the lane divider <b>52</b>. Tablets <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> are propelled forward by transport rollers <b>5</b> and <b>31</b> and threads <b>36</b>. Each lane of tablets <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> are independent of each other and when tablets <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> exit transport rollers <b>5</b> and <b>31</b>, they will drop down two tablet chutes <b>53</b>, past each separate tablet count sensors <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref> shows a plurality of roller assemblies <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> in side by side relationship but separated, each roller module <b>20</b> with it's own lane divider <b>52</b>. The tablets will act in the same manner as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In yet another embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref>, several transport rollers <b>31</b> are rotating independently and parallel to each other, rollers <b>31</b> divided with lane dividers <b>52</b>, however, lane dividers <b>52</b> of this alternate invention pass through the gap between rollers. Transport rollers <b>31</b> are mounted closely together and are rotating in the same direction.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">A further enhancement to roller module assembly <b>20</b> of the instant invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref> A-E wherein a set of feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> are spaced above sort rolls <b>79</b>-<b>80</b>. Sort and transport rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> are provided with a smooth portion disposed substantially under feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> and may further be provided with thread <b>36</b> extending from the smooth portion to a tapered end <b>41</b> thereof. Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>, feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> preferably are geared together to rotate in opposite hand as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</figref> and are driven independently from sort rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b>. Though feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> are preferably geared together, feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> may be driven independently by separate prime movers to provide for more positive feeding of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> from hopper <b>1</b>. As feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> are preferably geared together, feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> rotate upwards from the inside thus lifting up tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> causing a floating effect reducing the possibility of jamming of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> together or the damaging of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b>. The speed, acceleration or deceleration of feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> may be adjusted for different tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> or may be adjusted during a particular run of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> to ensure a steady flow of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> to sort rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b>. By rapidly starting and stopping feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b>, a vibratory action can be imparted to feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> thus helping to dislodge tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> from hopper <b>1</b> and to spread out tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> along the length of feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b>. Feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> are shorter in length than sort rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> such that tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> are positively driven from hopper <b>1</b> and dropped onto sort rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> in order to ensure that a steady stream of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> are presented to count sensors <b>54</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24C</figref>, feed roll <b>78</b> is shown as a smooth roll while feed roll <b>77</b> has been provided with a thread <b>35</b> thereupon, however, it is fully within the scope of this invention to provide a thread <b>35</b> upon both rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> or to have no thread <b>35</b> upon either roll <b>79</b> or <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Hopper <b>1</b> is provided with a sloped bottom wall <b>68</b> at an angle <b>75</b> from feed rollers <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> which effectively guides tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> along bottom wall <b>68</b> and onto feed rollers <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>. Sloped bottom wall <b>68</b> of hopper <b>1</b> extends over feed rollers <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> and terminates just above feed thread <b>35</b> of feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b>. By guiding tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> along bottom wall <b>68</b>, a smooth transition between hopper <b>1</b> and feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> is created and hopper jamming is prevented. Additionally, tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> assume a preferred orientation with respect to feed rollers <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> while moving along bottom wall <b>68</b> such that engagement with feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> is enhanced and tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> are positively pulled from hopper <b>1</b>. Feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> are provided with a blunt end <b>41</b> to intentionally cause destabilisation of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> thus flipping tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> onto feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b>. Accordingly, separation of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> is enhanced and piggybacking of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">By having two sets of rolls, feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> may be driven at different rotational speeds than sort rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> thus allowing individual control of feeding speeds and sorting speeds. Additionally, either set of rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> or <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> may be vibrated by rapidly altering the rotational speed to enhance dislodging of piggyback tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b>. With blunt end <b>41</b> provided on feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b>, a drop point is established between feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> to dislodge, un-piggyback and/or separate tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> as tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> drop onto sort rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b>. Additionally, since feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> are arranged over a smooth portion of sort rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b>, dust and/or fragments in hopper <b>1</b> are allowed to fall freely from feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> through sort rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> prior to tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> being discharged onto sort and transport rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> thus eliminating dust and/or fragments from sort stream. Also, feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> may be removed from roller assembly <b>20</b> for cleaning or changing to a different set of feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> without removing sort and transport rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b>. Finally, gating of tablets <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> can be accomplished by jogging or controlling the speed of sort and transport rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> while feed rolls <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> continue to feed tablets <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> from hopper <b>1</b>. Gating of tablets <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> may be automatically controlled by count sensors <b>54</b> or may be controlled by an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref> D and <b>24</b>E, thread <b>35</b> on feed roll <b>77</b> and/or <b>78</b> has a square profile which performs the same function as previously stated with regard to the square thread <b>35</b> on a combination feed and transport roller <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>. Square thread <b>35</b> is substantial in height and thus positively pushes tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> engaged therewith away from hopper <b>1</b> and onto sort and transport rolls <b>79</b>, <b>80</b>. The pitch of thread <b>35</b> is less than the pitch of thread <b>36</b> to pull out tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> from hopper <b>1</b> whereafter thread <b>36</b> has a greater pitch to spread apart and space tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> into an orderly stream. Thread <b>36</b> of sort and transport roll <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> is shorter in height and narrower in width such that doubled tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> may easily ride over the thread to find an opening in the orderly stream. Thread <b>36</b> is useful to provide a stop to reduce rolling of round tablets <b>29</b> and sliding of tablets <b>28</b> or <b>29</b> along sort and transport roll <b>79</b>, <b>80</b>.</p>
