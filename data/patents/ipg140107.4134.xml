<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a zoom lens, an optical apparatus having this zoom lens, and a method of manufacturing the zoom lens.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Because of the recent advances in optical design and manufacturing technologies, zoom lenses have progressed to smaller sizes and higher variable powers. However the increase in the focal length in the telephoto end state, due to increasing the variable power, has made problems with hand motion blur more conspicuous. For hand motion blur, various zoom lenses having hand motion blur correction functions have been proposed (see e.g., Patent Document 1).</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, a zoom lens according to the present embodiment has, in order from an object, a first lens group G<b>1</b> having positive refractive power, a second lens group G<b>2</b> having negative refractive power, a third lens group G<b>3</b> having positive refractive power, and a fourth lens group G<b>4</b> having positive refractive power, and upon zooming from a wide-angle end state to a telephoto end state, the distance between the first lens group G<b>1</b> and the second lens group G<b>2</b> increases, the distance between the second lens group G<b>2</b> and the third lens group G<b>3</b> decreases, and the distance between the third lens group G<b>3</b> and the fourth lens group G<b>4</b> changes, and the third lens group G<b>3</b> further has, in order from the object, a thirty first lens group G<b>31</b> having positive refractive power and a thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> having negative refractive power, and an image plane, when a hand motion blur is generated, is corrected by moving the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> so as to have components orthogonal to the optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The third lens group G<b>3</b>, of which lens diameter can be decreased more easily than the other lens groups, is appropriate to enclose a vibration isolation mechanism. Therefore even if a vibration isolation mechanism is enclosed in the lens barrel, the size of the lens barrel does not increase. The third lens group G<b>3</b> has the thirty first lens group G<b>31</b> having positive refractive power and the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> having negative refractive power, and the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> is used as the vibration isolation lens group, whereby the vibration isolation mechanism can be smaller and the vibration isolation lens group can be lighter. By distributing appropriate refractive power to the third lens group G<b>3</b>, deterioration of the image forming performance can be decreased when the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b>, which is the vibration isolation lens group, is moved so as to have components orthogonal to the optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the present embodiment, in the above mentioned configuration, the following conditional Expression (1) is satisfied, where X1 denotes a moving distance of the first lens group G<b>1</b> upon zooming from the wide-angle end state to the telephoto end state, and fw denotes a focal length of the zoom lens in the wide-angle end state. The sign of the moving distance X1 is positive when the position of the first lens group G<b>1</b> in the telephoto end state is located toward the object side from an origin, which is a position of the first lens group G<b>1</b> on the optical axis in the wide-angle end state.

</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Conditional Expression (1) satisfies an appropriate moving distance X1 of the first lens group G<b>1</b> upon zooming from the wide-angle end state to the telephoto end state in order to ensure high magnification. If the condition exceeds the upper limit value of the conditional Expression (1), the moving distance of the first lens group G<b>1</b> with respect to zooming increases, and the quantity of light in the telephoto end state decreases. As a result, the total length and diameter of the zoom lens increase, which makes it difficult to render this zoom lens into practical use. Fluctuation of the spherical aberration also increases, which is not desirable. If the condition is below the lower limit value of the conditional Expression (1), on the other hand, the moving distance of the first lens group G<b>1</b> with respect to zooming decreases too much, and it becomes necessary to relatively increase the power of the first lens group G<b>1</b>, or to implement the zooming effect by another lens group, and as a result, fluctuation of the image plane and the deterioration of spherical aberration in the telephoto end state become conspicuous, which is not desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To ensure the effect of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the upper limit value of the conditional Expression (1) is 5.0. To further ensure the effect of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the upper limit value of the conditional Expression (1) is 3.5. To even further ensure the effect of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the upper limit value of the conditional Expression (1) is 3.0. To ensure the effect of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the lower limit value of the conditional Expression (1) is 2.8.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the present embodiment, it is preferable that the conditional Expression (2) is satisfied, where f2 denotes a focal length of the second lens group G<b>2</b>, and f3 denotes a focal length of the third lens group G<b>3</b>.

</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The conditional Expression (2) specifies an appropriate ratio of the focal length f2 of the second lens group G<b>2</b> to the focal length f3 of the third lens group G<b>3</b>. If the condition exceeds the upper limit value of the conditional Expression (2), it becomes difficult to simultaneously correct the coma aberration in the wide-angle end state, spherical aberration in the telephoto end state, and fluctuation of the curvature of field when correcting hand motion blur, which is not desirable. If the condition, is below the lower limit value of the conditional Expression (2), on the other hand, refractive power of the second lens group G<b>2</b> becomes relatively high, and deterioration of astigmatism and curvature of field in a wide-angle end state deteriorate considerably, which is not desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In order to ensure the effect of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the upper limit value of the conditional Expression (2) is 0.48. To further ensure the effect of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the upper limit value of the conditional Expression (2) is 0.45. To ensure the effect of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the lower limit value of the conditional Expression (2) is 0.40.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to another embodiment, in the above mentioned zoom lens configuration comprised of the first lens group to the fourth lens group, the above mentioned conditional Expression (2) is satisfied, where f2 denotes a focal length of the second lens group G<b>2</b>, and f3 denotes a focal length of the third lens group G<b>3</b>. The upper limit value and the lower limit value of the conditional Expression (2) in this case are the same as above.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the present embodiment, it is preferable that the following conditional Expression (3) is satisfied, where f1 denotes a focal length of the first lens group G<b>1</b>, and fw denotes a focal length of this zoom lens in the wide-angle end state.

</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The conditional Expression (3) specifies an appropriate range of the focal length f1 of the first lens group G<b>1</b> in order to secure the back focus and ensure image forming performance. If the condition exceeds the upper limit value of the conditional Expression (3), the total length and diameter of the zoom lens increase, which makes it difficult to turn this zoom lens into practical use. The fluctuation of the curvature of field also increases, which is not desirable. If the condition is below the lower limit value of the conditional Expression (3), back focus becomes short, and image forming performance in the telephoto end state, particularly spherical aberration, deteriorates.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To ensure the effect of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the upper limit value of the conditional Expression (3) is 4.0. To ensure the effect of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the lower limit value of the conditional Expression (3) is 3.6.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present embodiment, it is preferable that the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> is a cemented lens of a biconcave negative lens and a positive lens (a cemented lens of the lens L<b>321</b> and lens L<b>322</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Then fluctuation of chromatic aberration on the image plane, when the thirty second lens G<b>32</b> is decentered for vibration isolation, can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present embodiment, it is preferable that the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> has an aspherical surface (surface number <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). It is especially preferable that the negative lens included in the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> (lens L<b>322</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) has an aspherical surface. Then fluctuation of the decentering coma aberration, when the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> is decentered for vibration isolation, can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the present embodiment, it is preferable that the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> is a cemented lens of a biconcave negative lens and a positive lens (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Particularly in the present embodiment, it is preferable that the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> is a cemented lens of, in order from the object, a biconcave negative lens and a positive meniscus lens having a convex surface facing the object, or a cemented lens of, in order from the object, a positive meniscus lens having a convex surface facing the image and a biconcave lens. Then fluctuation of chromatic aberration on the Image plane, when the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> is decentered for vibration isolation, can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present embodiment, it is preferable that the fourth lens group G<b>4</b> has a positive lens disposed closest to the object (lens L<b>41</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and at least one cemented lens (cemented lens of the lens L<b>43</b> and lens L<b>44</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Then the divergent bundle of rays from the third lens group G<b>3</b> can be quickly converged, and an increase in size of the fourth lens group G<b>4</b> can be suppressed, and fluctuation of coma aberration in the wide-angle end state can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is more preferable that the lens surface closest to the object of the fourth lens group G<b>4</b> (surface number <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is an aspherical surface, then not only is coma aberration decreased, but fluctuation on the image plane due to zooming can be corrected well. Thereby deterioration of performance, when the thirty second lens group is decentered for vibration isolation, can be further decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the present embodiment, it is preferable that, upon zooming from the wide-angle end state to the telephoto end state, the first lens group G<b>1</b>, the third lens group G<b>3</b> and the fourth lens group G<b>4</b> move toward the object. Then the zooming efficiency can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the present embodiment, it is preferable that the air space between the third lens group G<b>3</b> and the fourth lens group G<b>4</b> in the wide-angle end state is greater than the air space between the third lens group G<b>3</b> and the fourth lens group G<b>4</b> in the telephoto end state. Then fluctuation on the image plane due to zooming, particularly the curvature of field in mid-position, can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a digital single lens reflex camera CAM (optical apparatus) having a zoom lens with the above configuration as a camera lens <b>1</b>. In the digital single lens reflex camera CAM shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, lights from an object, which is not illustrated, are collected by the camera lens <b>1</b>, and form an image on a focal plane plate <b>4</b> via a quick return mirror <b>3</b>. The lights which formed an image on the focal plane plate <b>4</b> are reflected a plurality of times in a penta prism <b>5</b>, and guided to an eye piece <b>6</b>. Thereby the user can observe the object image as an upright image via the eye piece <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If the user presses a release button, which is not illustrated, the quick return mirror <b>3</b> is retracted out of the optical path, and the lights of the object, which is not illustrated, collected by the camera lens <b>1</b> form an object image on a picture element <b>7</b>. Thus the lights from the object are captured by the picture element <b>7</b>, and recorded in a memory, which is not illustrated, as an object image. In this way, the user can photograph an object using this camera CAM. The camera CAM in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may removably hold the camera lens <b>1</b>, or may be integrated with the camera lens <b>1</b>. The zoom lens of the present embodiment can ensure sufficient length of back focus, and the camera CAM may be a single lens reflex camera, or a camera which has no quick return mirror.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> are graphs showing various aberrations of the zoom lens according to Example 1 upon focusing on infinity in the wide-angle end state, and graphs showing coma aberrations when a 0.59&#xb0; rotation blur is corrected. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates graphs showing various aberrations of the zoom lens according to Example 1 upon focusing on infinity in the intermediate focal length state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> are graphs showing various aberrations of the zoom lens according to Example 1 upon focusing on infinity in the telephoto end state, and graphs showing coma aberrations when a 0.19&#xb0; rotation blur is corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In each graph showing aberration, FNO is an F number and Y is an image height (unit: mm). In the graphs showing spherical aberration, a value of the F number corresponding to the maximum aperture is shown; in the graphs showing astigmatism and graphs showing distortion, a maximum value of the image height is shown respectively; and in graphs showing coma aberration, a value of each image height is shown. d indicates various aberrations at d-line (wavelength: 587.6 nm), and g indicates various aberrations at g-line (wavelength: 435.8 nm), and no indication indicates various aberrations at d-line. In the graphs showing astigmatism, the solid line indicates the sagittal image surface, and the dotted line indicates the meridional image surface. The description on the graphs showing aberrations is the same for other examples.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As each graph showing aberrations clarifies, the zoom lens according to Example 1 has about an &#xd7;10 zoom ratio, a 70&#xb0; or more angle of view in the wide-angle end state, and has excellent image forming performance that corrects various aberrations well in each focal length state from the wide-angle end state to the telephoto end state.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Example 2 will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and Table 2. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram depicting a configuration of a lens according to Example 2, and show a wide-angle end state (W), intermediate focal length state (M), and telephoto end state (T) in order from the top. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows, a zoom lens according to Example 2 has, in order from an object, a first lens group G<b>1</b> having positive refractive power, a second lens group G<b>2</b> having negative refractive power, a third lens group G<b>3</b> having positive refractive power, and a fourth lens group G<b>4</b> having positive refractive power.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The first lens group G<b>1</b> has, in order from the object, a cemented lens of a negative meniscus lens L<b>11</b> having a convex surface facing the object and a biconvex positive lens L<b>12</b>, and a positive meniscus lens L<b>13</b> having a convex surface facing the object.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The second lens group G<b>2</b> has, in order from the object, a negative meniscus lens L<b>21</b> having a convex surface facing the object, a biconcave negative lens L<b>22</b>, a biconvex positive lens L<b>23</b> and a biconcave negative lens L<b>24</b> having a concave surface facing the object. The negative meniscus lens L<b>21</b> disposed closest to the object among the second lens group G<b>2</b> is an aspherical lens of which glass lens surface on the object side is provided with a resin layer.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The third lens group G<b>3</b> has, in order from the object, a thirty first lens group G<b>31</b> having positive refractive power, and a thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> having negative refractive power, and is used for correcting hand motion blur (vibration isolation) by moving the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> so as to have components orthogonal to the optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The thirty first lens group G<b>31</b> has, in order from the object, a biconvex positive lens L<b>311</b>, and a cemented lens of a biconvex positive lens L<b>312</b> and a biconcave negative lens L<b>313</b>. The thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> has, a cemented lens of, in order from the object, a biconcave negative lens L<b>321</b> and a positive meniscus L<b>322</b> lens having a convex surface facing the object.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The fourth lens group G<b>4</b> has, in order from the object, a biconvex positive lens L<b>41</b>, a cemented lens of a biconvex positive lens L<b>42</b> of a biconvex positive lens L<b>42</b> and a biconcave negative lens L<b>473</b> and a positive lens L<b>44</b> having a convex surface facing the image. The biconvex positive lens L<b>41</b> disposed closest to the image among the fourth lens group G<b>4</b> is an aspherical lens of which aspherical surface is the lens surface at the object side.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the zoom lens according to this example which has this configuration, upon zooming from a wide-angle end state to a telephoto end state, the first lens group G<b>1</b>, third lens group G<b>3</b> and fourth lens group G<b>4</b> move to the object so that the air space between the first lens group G<b>1</b> and the second lens group G<b>2</b> increases, the air space between the second lens group G<b>2</b> and the third lens group G<b>3</b> decreases, and the air space between the third lens group G<b>3</b> and the fourth lens group G<b>4</b> decreases. The second lens group G<b>2</b> moves toward the object first, then moves toward the image.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">An aperture stop S is disposed between the second lens group G<b>2</b> and the third lens group G<b>3</b>, and moves together with the thirty first lens group G<b>31</b> upon zooming from the wide-angle end state to the telephoto end state.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to Example 2, in order to correct an angle &#x3b8; of rotation blur, the moving lens group for blur correction is moved so as to have components orthogonal to the optical axis by (f&#xb7;tan &#x3b8;)/K, where f is a focal length of the zoom lens, and K is a ratio of the moving distance of the image on the image forming surface to the moving distance of the moving lens group, that is a vibration isolation coefficient, in the blur correction. In the wide-angle end state of Example 2, the vibration isolation coefficient is 0.789, and the focal length is 28.80 (mm), so the moving distance of the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> for correcting a 0.59&#xb0; rotation blur is 0.370 (mm). In the telephoto end state of Example 2, the vibration isolation coefficient is 1.638, and the focal length is 292.0 (mm), so the moving distance of the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> for correcting a 0.19&#xb0; rotation blur is 0.583 (mm).</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in the data table in Table 2, the zoom lens according to Example 2 satisfies all the conditional Expression (1) to (3).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> are graphs showing various aberrations of the zoom lens according to Example 2 upon focusing on infinity in the wide-angle end state, and graphs showing coma aberrations when a 0.59&#xb0; rotation blur is corrected. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are graphs showing various aberrations of the zoom lens according to Example 2 upon focusing on infinity in the intermediate focal length state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> are graphs showing various aberrations of the zoom lens according to Example 2 upon focusing on infinity in the telephoto end state, and graphs showing coma aberrations when a 0.19&#xb0; rotation blur is corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As each graph showing aberrations clarifies, the zoom lens according to Example 2 has about an &#xd7;10 zoom ratio, a 70&#xb0; or more angle of view in the wide-angle end state, and has excellent image forming performance that corrects various aberrations well in each focal length state from the wide-angle end state to the telephoto end state.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the above embodiment, the following content can be adopted within a range where the optical performance is not diminished.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the above examples, a zoom lens formed of four lens groups was shown, but the present invention can also be applied to a configuration having a different number of lens groups, such as 5 or 6 lens groups. In concrete terms, a configuration where a positive or negative lens group is added to the side closest to the object, a configuration where a positive or negative lens group is added to the side closest to the image, or a configuration where a positive or negative lens group is added between the third group and fourth group, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">A single or plurality of lens groups or a partial lens group may be designed to be a focusing lens group, which performs focusing from an object at infinity to an object at close distance by moving in the optical axis direction. This focusing lens group can be applied to auto focus, and is also suitable for driving a motor for auto focusing (e.g. driving using an ultrasonic motor). It is particularly preferable that the second lens group G<b>2</b> is designed to be the focusing lens group.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A lens group or a partial lens group may be designed to be a vibration-isolating lens group, which corrects image blurs generated by hand motion, by vibrating the lens group or partial lens group in a direction perpendicular to the optical axis. It is particularly preferable that the thirty second lens group G<b>32</b> is designed to be the vibration-isolating lens group, as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The lens surface may be formed to be a spherical surface or plane, or an aspherical surface. If the lens surface is a spherical surface or plane, then lens processing, assembly and adjustment are easy, and deterioration of optical performance, due to an error in processing, assembly and adjustment, can be prevented. Even if the image plane is shifted, the drawing performance is not affected very much, which is desirable. If the lens surface is an aspherical surface, the aspherical surface can be any one of an aspherical surface generated by grinding, a glass molded aspherical surface generated by forming glass in an aspherical shape using a die, and a composite aspherical surface generated by forming resin on the surface of the glass to be an aspherical shape. The lens surface may be a diffraction surface, and the lens may be a refractive index distributed lens (GRIN lens) or plastic lens.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">It is preferable that the aperture stop S is disposed near the third lens group G<b>3</b>, but the role of the aperture stop may be substituted by the frame of the lens, without disposing a separate element as the aperture stop.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Each lens surface may be coated with an anti-reflection film which has high transmittance in a wide wavelength region, in order to decrease flares and ghosts, and implement a high optical performance with high contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The zoom ratio of the zoom lens of the present embodiment is 5 to 18, and is preferably 8 to 12.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the zoom lens of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the first lens group G<b>1</b> has two positive lenses and one negative lens. In the first lens group G<b>1</b>, it is preferable that the lenses are disposed in the sequence of negative, positive and positive in order from the object.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the zoom lens of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the second lens group G<b>2</b> has one positive lens and three negative lenses. In the second lens group G<b>2</b>, it is preferable that the lenses are disposed in the sequence of negative, negative, positive and positive in order from the object.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the zoom lens of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the third lens group G<b>3</b> has three positive lenses and two negative lenses. In the third lens group G<b>3</b>, it is preferable that two positive lens components, which are fixed during vibration isolation, and one negative lens component, which can move during vibration isolation, are disposed in order from the object.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the zoom lens of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the fourth lens group G<b>4</b> has two positive lenses and one negative lens.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The embodiments were described with the configuration requirements to clarify the present invention, but needless to say, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Now a method of manufacturing the zoom lens will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. According to this method, the first lens group G<b>1</b>, second lens group G<b>2</b>, third lens group G<b>3</b> and fourth lens group G<b>4</b> of the present embodiment are assembled in a cylindrical lens barrel first (step S<b>1</b>). When each lens group is assembled in the lens barrel, each lens group may be disposed sequentially in the lens barrel one at a time in order along the optical axis, or part or all of the lens group may be integratedly held on a holding member, and then assembled in the lens barrel. Particularly in the present embodiment, the third lens group to the fifth lens group may be held on one holding member, and then assembled in the lens barrel. After assembling each lens group in the lens barrel, it is checked whether the object image is formed in a state where each lens group is assembled in the lens barrel, that is, it is checked whether the center of each lens group is aligned (step S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As mentioned above, various operations of the zoom lens are checked after the zoom lens is assembled (step S<b>3</b>). Examples of various operations are a zoom operation in which at least a part of the lens groups move along the optical axis upon zooming, a focusing operation in which a lens group, which performs focusing from an object at a long distance to an object at a short distance, moves along the optical axis, and a hand motion blur correction operation in which at least a part of the lenses moves so as to have components orthogonal to the optical axis. In the present embodiment, upon zooming from the wide-angle end state to the telephoto end state, each lens group moves so that the distance between the first lens group G<b>1</b> and the second lens group G<b>2</b> increases, the distance between the second lens group G<b>2</b> and the third lens group G<b>3</b> decreases, and the distance between the third lens group G<b>3</b> and the fourth lens group G<b>4</b> decreases. In the zoom lens of the present embodiment, upon zooming from the wide-angle end state to the telephoto end state, the first lens group G<b>1</b> moves toward the object by the moving distance X1 along the optical axis direction. The sequence of checking the various operations is arbitrary.</p>
