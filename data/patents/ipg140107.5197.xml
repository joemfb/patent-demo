<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This document relates generally to implantable medical systems and particularly, but not by way of limitation, to an implantable medical device including an acoustic transducer for communications with another device by acoustic coupling.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Medical devices are implanted in human bodies for monitoring physiological conditions, diagnosing diseases, treating diseases, or restoring functions of organs or tissues. As one type of such implantable medical devices, an implantable CRM device monitors a patient's cardiac functions and/or treats cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and other cardiac disorders by delivering electrical and/or other therapies to the patient's cardiovascular system including the heart. One example of implantable CRM devices is implantable pacemakers. An implantable pacemaker delivers electrical pulses to the heart to restore cardiac rhythm and coordinate contractions in various cardiac regions, thereby improving hemodynamic performance. Another example of implantable CRM devices is implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICDs). ICDs deliver higher energy electrical stimuli to the heart to treat tachyarrhythmias including tachycardia and fibrillation. In addition to pacemakers and ICDs, examples of implantable CRM devices include, but are not limited to, implantable pacemaker/defibrillators that combine the functions of implantable pacemakers and ICDs, implantable drug delivery devices, and any other implantable devices for monitoring, diagnosing, and/or treating cardiac disorders.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because an implantable CRM device is often intended for long-term use after being implanted in a patient, its size, complexity, and power consumption are inherently constrained. Consequently, a CRM system may include an external device or system and one or more implantable devices. The external device or system provides for a user interface for the CRM system and enables the CRM system to perform functions that the implantable CRM device alone is incapable of performing. Communication between an implantable CRM device and the external device or system is performed by telemetry through an inductive couple or a radio-frequency electromagnetic link. The CRM system may also perform certain functions by coordinated operation of the implantable CRM device and another one or more implantable devices. Such coordinated operation enables the CRM system to perform, for example, monitoring and/or therapeutic functions at multiple locations in a body that are practically difficult to access by using a single implantable device. For this and other reasons, there is a need for an intra-body communication link between two implantable medical devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An implantable medical device includes an acoustic transducer for intra-body communication with another medical device via an acoustic couple.

These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that the embodiments may be combined, or that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural, logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description provides examples, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It should be noted that references to &#x201c;an&#x201d;, &#x201c;one&#x201d;, or &#x201c;various&#x201d; embodiments in this document are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references contemplate more than one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">This document discusses, among other things, an implantable medical device including an acoustic communication circuit for intra-body acoustic communication. The intra-body acoustic communication is performed between two implantable medical devices or between one implantable medical device and one external medical device attached onto the skin. The implantable medical device of the present subject matter is described in this document by using an implantable CRM device as a specific example. However, it is to be understood that the present methods and apparatuses may be employed in other types of implantable medical devices, including, but not being limited to, neural stimulators, neuromuscular stimulators, drug delivery devices, and various types of other therapeutic and monitoring devices.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a CRM system <b>100</b>, and portions of an environment in which system <b>100</b> is used. System <b>100</b> includes an implantable medical device <b>110</b>, a lead system <b>108</b>, another implantable medical device <b>120</b>, and an external system <b>190</b>. An acoustic couple <b>115</b> provides for communication between implantable medical device <b>110</b> and implantable medical device <b>120</b>. A wireless telemetry link <b>180</b> provides for communication between implantable medical device <b>110</b> and external system <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After implantation, implantable medical device <b>110</b> operates within a body <b>102</b> of a patient to sense activities of a heart <b>105</b> and deliver one or more therapies to heart <b>105</b> through lead system <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, implantable medical device <b>110</b> is an implantable CRM device that delivers one or more therapies including, but are not limited to, a pacing therapy, a cardioversion/defibrillation therapy, a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), a remodeling control therapy (RCT), a drug therapy, and a biological therapy such as a cell therapy and a gene therapy. Implantable medical device <b>120</b> also operates within body <b>102</b> to perform one or more sensing and/or therapeutic functions. In one embodiment, implantable medical device <b>120</b> supports or supplements one or more functions of implantable medical device <b>110</b>. Acoustic couple <b>115</b> allows implantable medical device <b>110</b> and implantable medical device <b>120</b> to communicate with each other when a wired connection between the two implantable medical devices is difficult to implement because of, for example, anatomical structure of body <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Lead system <b>108</b> provides one or more electrical connections between implantable medical device <b>110</b> and heart <b>105</b>. In one embodiment, lead system <b>108</b> includes one or more leads each including one or more electrodes configured for endocardial and/or epicardial placement. Pacing and/or cardioversion/defibrillation are delivered to heart <b>105</b> through such leads and electrodes. In one embodiment, one or more leads of lead system <b>108</b> also include therapy delivery ports configured for endocardial, epicardial, and/or intravascular placement. Substances such as chemical or biological agents are delivered to heart <b>105</b> through such leads and therapy delivery ports.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, implantable medical device <b>120</b> includes an implantable sensing module. In one specific embodiment, the implantable sensing module is a pressure sensing module implanted in the left ventricle (LV) to sense an LV pressure that is used by implantable medical device <b>110</b> as a signal controlling its therapy delivery function. The use of such an implantable sensing module allows LV pressure sensing while avoiding the difficulty associated with accessing the LV using an implantable pressure catheter connected to implantable medical device <b>110</b>. In other specific embodiments, the implantable sensing module is used to sense a pulmonary pressure or an aortic pressure while avoiding the use of an implantable pressure catheter that has to pass two cardiac valves to connect to implantable medical device <b>110</b>. Acoustic couple <b>115</b> provides for communications between implantable medical device <b>110</b> and implantable medical device <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, where implantable medical device <b>120</b> is a pressure sensing module employed for sensing an intracardiac or intravascular pressure, implantable medical device <b>110</b> sends a command via acoustic couple <b>115</b> to activate implantable medical device <b>120</b> when the pressure sensing is needed. In response, implantable medical device <b>120</b> is activated and sends data representative of the sensed pressure to implantable medical device <b>110</b> via acoustic couple <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Acoustic couple <b>115</b> is a data communication link formed between two acoustic couplers. When being used for intra-body communications, acoustic communication is substantially more energy-efficient when compared to telemetry communication based on inductive couple (magnetic field) or radio-frequency electromagnetic waves. Implantable medical device <b>110</b> and implantable medical device <b>120</b> each include an acoustic coupler, which includes an acoustic transducer. The acoustic transducer converts electrical energy to acoustic energy for transmitting a signal and converts acoustic energy to electrical energy for receiving a signal. The acoustic signals usable for intra-body communication purposes include audible and ultrasonic signals. The carrier frequency for the acoustic signals can be up to 5 MHz. In one embodiment, the carrier frequency range is generally within an ultrasonic range. The lower bound of the carrier frequency range is chosen based on considerations of patient's audio perception of the acoustic signal and the design constraints of the acoustic transducer, and the upper bound of the frequency range is chosen based on considerations of tissue absorption of the acoustic energy and the directionality of the acoustic transducer in transmitting and receiving audio signals. The carrier frequency is chosen to avoid using an acoustic signal audible to the patient. Structural constraints, such as size and material, that generally apply to implantable medical device <b>110</b> also affect the selection of the carrier frequency. For example, size of the transducer, stiffness of the support structure to which the transducer is attached, and whether the transducer is to operate in resonance are among the factors to be considered in selecting the carrier frequency. Such factors are dependent on the overall size, material, and structure of implantable medical device <b>110</b>. In one specific embodiment, the lower bound of the carrier frequency is about 30 kHz. The tissue absorption of acoustic energy generally increases with the frequency of the acoustic signal, making acoustic communication less energy-efficient at higher frequencies. The degree of directionality also generally increases with the frequency of the acoustic signal, making an acoustic coupler more directional (i.e., covering a smaller space) at higher frequencies. In one embodiment, the upper bound of the frequency range is about 60 kHz, where the tissue absorption is not considered significant and an approximately omni-directional acoustic coupler can be implemented. An omni-directional acoustic coupler is desirable because the acoustic communication is not affected by the relative positions of the implantable medical device <b>110</b> and implantable medical device <b>120</b>, which change as the patient makes a movement.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">External system <b>190</b> communicates with implantable medical device <b>110</b> via telemetry link <b>180</b>. External system <b>190</b> allows a physician or other caregiver to communicate with implantable medical device <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, external system <b>190</b> includes an external programmer. In another embodiment, external system <b>190</b> includes a patient management system including an external device communicating with implantable medical device <b>110</b> via telemetry link <b>180</b>, a network coupled to the external device, and a remote device coupled to the network. Such a patient management system allows a physician or other caregiver to communicate with implantable medical device <b>110</b> through the remote device in a distant location. In one embodiment, the physician or other caregiver also communicates with implantable medical device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Telemetry link <b>180</b> provides for data transmissions between implantable medical device <b>110</b> and external system <b>190</b>. In one embodiment, telemetry link <b>180</b> also provides for data transmissions between implantable medical device <b>120</b> and external system <b>190</b>. In another embodiment, implantable medical device <b>120</b> and external system <b>190</b> communicate via acoustic couple <b>115</b> and telemetry link <b>180</b>, using implantable medical device <b>110</b> as a repeater. In one embodiment, telemetry link <b>180</b> is an inductive telemetry link. In an alternative embodiment, telemetry link <b>180</b> is a far-field radio-frequency telemetry link. In another alternative embodiment, telemetry link <b>180</b> is another acoustic couple. An acoustic coupler device of external system <b>190</b> includes an acoustic transducer that is to be attached to the skin of the patient such that intra-body acoustic communication can be performed using body <b>102</b> as the medium. Data transmission provided by telemetry link <b>180</b> may include, for example, transmitting real-time physiological data acquired by implantable medical devices <b>110</b> and/or <b>120</b>, extracting physiological data acquired by and stored in implantable medical devices <b>110</b> and/or <b>120</b>, extracting therapy history data stored in implantable medical devices <b>110</b> and/or <b>120</b>, and extracting data indicating an operational status of implantable medical devices <b>110</b> and/or <b>120</b> (e.g., battery status and lead impedance). Telemetry link <b>180</b> also provides for data transmission from external system <b>190</b> to implantable medical devices <b>110</b> and/or <b>120</b>. This may include, for example, programming implantable medical devices <b>110</b> and/or <b>120</b> to acquire physiological data, programming implantable medical devices <b>110</b> and/or <b>120</b> to perform at least one self-diagnostic test (such as for a battery status and lead impedance status), and programming implantable medical devices <b>110</b> and/or <b>120</b> to deliver at least one therapy. Examples of signals represented by the physiological data include, but are not limited to, electrograms, heart sounds or signals indicative of heart sounds, activity level signals, pressure signals, impedance signals, and respiratory signals. In one embodiment, the physiological data also include parameters measured from one or more of these signals. In one embodiment, external system <b>190</b> or the physician or other caregiver determines and/or adjusts a therapy based on these signals and/or physiological data.</p>

In this embodiment, a diaphragm <b>645</b> is connected to exterior surface <b>343</b> of wall <b>342</b> to form an isolated cavity <b>647</b> between diaphragm <b>645</b> and exterior surface <b>343</b>. Acoustic transducer <b>232</b> is fastened to diaphragm <b>645</b> and is within cavity <b>647</b>. Diaphragm <b>645</b> is sufficiently thin to be acoustically transparent, i.e., to have minimal acoustic absorption, and protects acoustic transducer <b>232</b>, such as from effects of tissue growth. In one embodiment, diaphragm <b>645</b> and implantable housing <b>212</b> are made of the same type biocompatible metal, such as titanium. In another embodiment, diaphragm <b>645</b> and implantable housing <b>212</b> are made of different type biocompatible metals. In one embodiment, diaphragm <b>645</b> is welded to exterior surface <b>343</b>. Acoustic transducer <b>232</b> is connected to acoustic communication circuit <b>230</b> via one or more hermetically sealed feedthroughs across wall <b>342</b>. Damage to diaphragm <b>645</b> does not destroy the hermetical sealing of implantable housing <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, diaphragm <b>645</b> is configured to have a resonant frequency approximately equal to the carrier frequency of the acoustic signal. This increases the efficiency of the acoustic transmission. Resonance occurs at a primary frequency and its harmonic frequencies, thus providing a number of frequencies that can be used as the carrier frequency of the acoustic communication when maximum efficiency is sought. In one embodiment, diaphragm <b>645</b> is substantially thinner than wall <b>342</b> to provide a resonance frequency in the carrier frequency range for the acoustic communication, e.g., about 30 kHz-60 kHz. When acoustic transducer <b>232</b> is fastened to a thicker diaphragm <b>645</b> or wall <b>342</b>, the efficiency for the acoustic communication is lower.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Data transmitter <b>1660</b> includes a carrier generator <b>1662</b>, a modulator <b>1664</b>, and a buffer <b>1666</b>. Carrier generator <b>1662</b> generates the carrier signal for the acoustic communication. In one embodiment, the carrier signal is a square wave.

An external device including an acoustic transducer is used to transmit energy to implantable medical device <b>110</b> through acoustic transducer <b>1632</b>. In one embodiment, power receiver <b>1675</b> includes a rectifier circuit and a low-pass filter to convert the acoustic signal to a dc voltage, which is then used to recharge a rechargeable battery being a power supply of implantable medical device <b>110</b>. Though it may take several days to fully recharge a substantially depleted rechargeable battery, this method can be applied to partially recharge a rechargeable battery, for example, whenever the external device is coupled to implantable medical device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one embodiment, acoustic couple <b>115</b> employs frequency diversity for a reliable acoustic communication between implantable medical device <b>110</b> and implantable medical device <b>120</b>. Two or more substantially different frequencies are used as carrier frequencies of the acoustic signal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a diagram illustrating the need for frequency diversity. An acoustic signal is transmitted from implantable medical device <b>110</b> to be received by implantable medical device <b>120</b>. The acoustic wave propagated from implantable medical device <b>110</b> is reflected at boundaries of different anatomical structures within body <b>102</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the acoustic wave is reflected at a reflector <b>1792</b>, which is an anatomic structure such as a bone. Solid lines <b>1794</b> represent equipotential surfaces of the incident acoustic wave propagated from the acoustic transducer of implantable medical device <b>110</b>. Solid lines <b>1795</b> represent equipotential surfaces of the reflected acoustic wave due to reflector <b>1792</b>. The positions of solid lines <b>1794</b> and solid line <b>1795</b> are a function of the carrier frequency of the acoustic signal. One effect of the reflection of the acoustic wave caused by reflector <b>1792</b> is &#x201c;nulls&#x201d; distributed in body <b>102</b>. The nulls are illustrated as solid dots <b>1796</b>. Each null represents a point where the incident acoustic wave and the reflected acoustic wave cancel out. If the acoustic transducer of implantable medical device <b>120</b> happens to coincide with one of the nulls, it does not receive the acoustic signal. Due to the body anatomy and movements of the patient, numerous reflectors exist in body <b>102</b> and their location relative to implantable medical devices <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> change from time to time. The relative locations of implantable medical devices <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> also change for the same reason. It is therefore infeasible to avoid the nulls by choosing implantation sites for implantable medical devices <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">One approach to ensure substantially uninterrupted reception of the acoustic signal is frequency diversity. If the acoustic signal at a first carrier frequency is not receivable due to a null, a substantially different second carrier frequency is used. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, solid lines <b>1794</b> represent equipotential lines of the incident wave, and solid lines <b>1795</b> represent equipotential lines of the reflected wave, at the first carrier frequency. Dashed lines <b>1797</b> represent equipotential lines of the incident wave, and dashed lines <b>1798</b> represent equipotential lines of the reflected wave, at the second carrier frequency. Solid dots <b>1796</b> represent the nulls at the first frequency. Hollow dots <b>1799</b> represent the nulls at the second frequency. The acoustic signal is received by implantable medical device <b>120</b> when the acoustic transducer does not coincide with nulls at both frequencies, i.e., does not coincide with both one of solid dots <b>1796</b> and one of hollow dots <b>1799</b>. Three or more carrier frequencies may be used for the frequency diversity to further ensure reliability of the acoustic communication. In one embodiment, two carrier frequencies are considered sufficient because the chance that the nulls at two substantially different frequencies coincide is considered as being sufficiently small.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one embodiment, when the error rate of the incoming date exceeds the predetermined threshold rate, as determined by error detector <b>1676</b>, frequency selection circuit <b>1678</b> selects a substantially different frequency to be the carrier frequency for the acoustic communication. For example, acoustic communication circuit <b>1630</b> uses first and second carrier frequencies for the acoustic communication via acoustic couple <b>115</b>. When acoustic couple <b>115</b> is established or activated, frequency selection circuit <b>1678</b> selects the first carrier frequency. When error detector <b>1676</b> detects an intolerable error rate, frequency selection circuit <b>1678</b> selects the second carrier frequency to replace the first carrier frequency. When error detector <b>1676</b> detects another intolerable error rate, with the second carrier frequency, frequency selection circuit <b>1678</b> selects the first carrier frequency to replace the second carrier frequency. In this embodiment, carrier generator <b>1660</b> includes a variable-frequency carrier generator that generates the carrier signal at the frequency selected by frequency selection circuit <b>1678</b>. In one specific embodiment, the first carrier frequency is 39 kHz, and the second carrier frequency is 43 kHz. In one embodiment, the acoustic transducer has a low quality factor (Q). Components of acoustic communication circuit <b>1630</b>, except carrier generator <b>1662</b>, need no adjustment when the carrier frequency changes from the first carrier frequency to the second carrier frequency. In one embodiment, acoustic communication circuit <b>1630</b> has two frequency bands each accommodate one of the carrier frequencies. In another embodiment, acoustic communication circuit <b>1630</b> has one wide frequency band that accommodates both carrier frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment, frequency diversity is employed to allow implantable medical device <b>110</b> to communicate with two or more other implantable medical devices via separate acoustic couples each using a substantially distinctive carrier frequency. This allows simultaneous communications via multiple acoustic couples.</p>
