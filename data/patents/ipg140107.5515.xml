<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention generally relates to a system and method for enabling product trials and, in particular, to dynamically collect information relating to the product trials.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A virtual universe (VU) is an interactive simulated environment accessed by multiple users through an online interface. Users inhabit and interact in the VU via avatars, which are a user's representation of himself or herself. These representations can be in the form of a three-dimensional model, a two-dimensional icon, a text construct, a user screen name, etc. Although there are many different types of VUs, there are several features many VUs generally have in common. These features include, for example,
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0003">Shared Space: the VU allows many users to participate at once;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0004">Graphical User Interface: the VU depicts space visually, ranging in style from 2D &#x201c;cartoon&#x201d; imagery to more immersive 3D environments;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0005">Immediacy: interaction takes place in real time;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0006">Interactivity: the VU allows users to alter, develop, build, or submit customized content;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0007">Persistence: the VU's existence continues regardless of whether individual users are logged in; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0008">Socialization/Community: the VU allows and encourages the formation of social groups such as teams, guilds, clubs, cliques, housemates, neighborhoods, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0009">Many real world interactions can occur within a VU. For example, users in a VU can work, vacation, and even shop for goods and/or services within a VU. As VUs become more popular, the number of users purchasing goods and/or services in VUs has continued to increase. This increase has brought with it the need for businesses to develop marketing and advertising strategies to effectively reach users that are participating in a VU.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0010">Businesses have traditionally marketed and advertised products to possible consumers in the real world using methods such as conducting questionnaires, tracking coupon usage, and conducting telephone surveys. While these methods provide some statistical data for marketers, these methods provide little to no information on why people use a product, when the product is being used, and/or how people are using the product. Without answers to these questions, businesses must make a number of assumptions as to the effectiveness of a product, how much consumer interest a product has, and how long to keep a product on the market. This information is important in the real world and especially in VUs where opinions about products as well as product trends can occur quickly and spread easily throughout the VU. As such, it is important to obtain accurate information on products to develop effective marketing and/or advertising strategies for products in the real world as well as product in VUs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0011">In a first aspect of the invention, a system comprises a tagging engine configured to tag one or more products, which are part of a product trial in a virtual universe. The system also includes a tracking engine configured to track information on the one or more products via a tag and a storage unit configured to collect the tracked information.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0012">In another aspect of the invention, a method for tracking product trials in a virtual universe comprises allowing a product in a virtual universe to be taken on a product trial and tagging the product with at least one tag.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0020">The invention is directed to a system and method for enabling product trials and, in particular, to dynamically collect data relating to the product trials. More specifically, the present invention provides a method for test marketing products within a VU by giving VU users the opportunity to take and use one or more products within a VU for a specified period of time and/or for a specified number of uses. The products may be taken on trial for free by those wanting to participate in the product trial or a fee may be charged to the user for taking a product on trial. In embodiments, users may be rewarded for participating in the trial program by being able to keep the trial unit and/or receiving virtual and/or real world rewards, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0021">Items that are taken on trial, or for a &#x201c;test drive&#x201d;, may include an identifier tag. The identifier tag may be used, e.g., to identify a product as one that may be borrowed from a VU store, kiosk, etc., before purchasing the product. The tag may be used to dynamically collect product usage data and trend data relating to where the user's avatar goes with the product, how it is used, who uses it, when it used, etc. For example, the tag identifier could be used to track locations the user visited prior to entering into a VU store, products purchased in previously visited locations, general shopping habits, modifications made to the product once taken on trial, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">Data collected by the identifier tag can be tracked during the trial and the results of the collected trial data may be provided to vendors, manufacturers, advertisers, etc., for free, at a cost, or on a subscription fee basis. This data may be used to provide, e.g., targeted advertisements to the individual taking the trial. Embodiments may also aggregate the trial data and use it to market to large groups of similar users. Aggregated data may also be used, in embodiments, to help businesses make decisions regarding the product itself, such as, e.g., how long to market the product, where the product should be marketed, what demographic to market the product to, etc. This information may be used in VUs and in the real world.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023">Thus, the present invention equips VU and real world vendors, manufacturers, advertisers, etc., with a comprehensive profile of their customers and provides them with insight on how their product is actually being used, as opposed to how they think the product is being used.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">System Environment</heading>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Exemplary Implementation of the System</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0044">The present invention is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0045">These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable medium that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0046">The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0047">The flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a determination as to whether a product can be taken on trial is performed, at step <b>200</b>. This determination may be performed by looking at one or more tags associated with the product and identifying whether the product's tag permits the product to be taken on trial. In embodiments, product trials may be limited to specific products, to a limited number of users, and/or be limited to specific users within the VU. If the product tag does not permit a product trial, the user may be presented with a message indicating the product is not available for trial and/or may merely be denied access to a product trial.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0049">If a product may be taken on trial, the product trial may be created, at step <b>210</b>. A product trial may be created by allowing a user to select the product trial from a vendor, manufacturer, advertiser, etc., using any number of selection processes known to those of skill in the art. A product trial may also be created by allowing a vendor, manufacturer, advertiser, etc., to prompt a user to accept the product trial while the user is participating in the VU. Moreover, in embodiments, a product trial may also be created by allowing a vendor to proactively place a product into a user's inventory with or without the user's request.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0050">A product may also be created by allowing a user's avatar to request a clone of a product that a second avatar has on trial and/or has purchased from a virtual vendor. This clone may be created with or without the approval of a vendor, manufacturer, advertiser, etc. The process of creating a clone of the product may include, for example, copying the product along with one or more tags that are associated with the product. In embodiments, any tags that link the second avatar to the product may be removed and/or replaced with one or more new tags, which link or associate the new user with the cloned product. Any number of these tags may be linked back to a vendor, manufacturer, advertiser, etc., and be used to track information on the user's product trial.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0051">The product trial may include a number of terms and/or agreements, which may be dispositive in determining how long the product trial can last, how many times the user may take a specific and/or related product on trial, how many times the product trial may be renewed, etc. The product trial may also include a termination agreement, such that the trial product may be ended if the user attempts to misuse the product and/or disparages the product. In embodiments, the product trial may also include features that prevent the user from copying, removing tags, and or stealing the product (e.g., write protections). These features can be implemented by a programmer having ordinary skill in the art and, as such, no further description is necessary herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0052">A product that is taken on trial can include one or more tags, at step <b>220</b>. A tag is metadata, i.e., data about data, which may be added by any one or more vendors, distributors, retail providers, users, etc., via the Tagging Engine. Tags may also be added by any number of additional entities that come into contact with the product that is on trial. For example, a tag may include a name value, such as the borrower's name. A tag may also include the time the product trial began, when the product trial is set to expire, any modifications that may be performed on the product, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0053">Any number of tags may be associated with the product and/or user taking the product on trial. These tags may be used to dynamically collect data about where the avatar goes with the product, how it is used, who uses it, when it is used, how much it is used, what features of the product are used, etc. Tags may also be used to track the location that a product is used at and/or one or more circumstances that surround the use of the product. A tag may also be used to track what other products were used when the product on trial was used and/or who the user interacted with when using the product. In embodiments, modifications that may have been made to the product as well as who made the modification and when the modifications were made, etc., may also be tracked. Moreover, tags may be used to keep track of the state of a product, e.g., whether the product is in use, in inventory, has been returned, has been cloned, etc. One or more of the tags, which are associated with the product and/or the user taking the product on trial, may be tracked, at step <b>230</b>. The information may be tracked throughout one or more VUs by the Tracking Engine by periodically pulling information from the product on trial. Optionally, in embodiments, the product on trial may include a software agent configured to report or push information to the Tracking Engine regarding the status, changes, configuration, usage, etc., of the product on trial.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0054">Information about a product on trial and/or the user taking the product on trial may be tracked periodically or on an event driven basis. For example, in embodiments, a product may be tracked whenever the product is in use or being displayed by a user, i.e., whenever the product is in the possession of a user but is not in the user's inventory. Placing the product back into inventory, or otherwise removing the product from the user's possession can be used to disable tracking by the Tracking Engine.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0055">Information about modifications to a product, which have been dynamically performed during a product trial, may also be tracked by the Tracking Engine. In embodiments, vendors, manufacturers, advertisers, etc., may provide for automatic modification of a product during the trial period based on one or more preset rules. Product modification may include product upgrades or downgrades based on, e.g., the user's status. Thus, a user that frequently uses a product may receive an automatic upgrade, whereas a user who keeps the product in inventory may have the product automatically downgraded. In embodiments, these modifications may be represented as tags by the Tagging Engine.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0056">Product modifications may also be used to provide the user with additional functionality during the product trial based on how the user has been using the product. For example, an audio device may be taken on trial and may contain a set list of audio clips, as well as controls for volume, balance, bass, and treble. If the user taking the audio device on trial performs what is considered an advanced function such as, e.g., modifying the play list, or adjusting bass and/or treble preferences, the user may be categorized as an advanced user. This categorization may allow the user to have access to advanced functions such as, e.g., a full audio equalizer. Moreover, in embodiments, the Tracking Engine may automatically detect and categorize one or more user based on active versus passive usage patterns, and separate trial data evaluation for basic and advanced users.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0057">In addition to automatic modifications, the present invention allows one or more users to independently make modifications to a product on trial. In embodiments, modifications may be performed by any user that has a product on trial or may be limited based on a customer's status, the amount a customer has spent in a VU, etc. The types of modifications may be unlimited and permit users to change one or more product attributes, e.g., change the color of a product, combine features of one or more products, etc. However, in embodiments, there may be limits on the types of modifications that may be performed to keep the user from copying and/or stealing the product (e.g., write protection). Moreover, in embodiments, certain features may be non-modifiable, such as trademarks, so as to prevent disparagement of a product or a product identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0058">Information that is tracked by the Tracking Engine may be stored in a relation database application (RDB) such as storage system <b>22</b>B. This allows for categorization, field separation, and scalability of the invention and also provides ease of data access and correlation using industry standard tools. Additionally, queries utilizing industry standards (such as SQL), as well as additional tools, may be used to provide functions relating to viewing, merging, associating, summarizing, and mining data, etc. As should be understood by those of skill in the art, the flexibility of database and table layout, key, and indexing schemes in RDB applications make them desirable for a wide variety of formatted data storage, analysis, tracking, and discovery requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0059">A product trial may terminate, at step <b>240</b>. The termination of the product trial may occur when the user purchases the product, the product is returned during and/or at the end of the trial period, the product is deactivated, disabled, or destroyed, and/or when the user is prompted to terminate the trial, etc. In embodiments, the product trial may also be terminated when the product is given, at no charge or for a fee, to the user for participating in the product trial. In those instances where the user maintains possession of the product at the end of the product trial, the user may be able to retain the modifications that were made to the product during the product trial.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0060">In embodiments, the user may be able to purchase a real world product based on the product trial. For example, a user taking a product trial of a personal digital assistant (PDA) in a VU, may decide that he/she likes the product and would like to purchase a real world version of the PDA at the market price or at a reduced price for having participated in the product trial. Moreover, in embodiments, the user may have the option of purchasing a real world product having one or more of the modifications that were made to the product during the product trial, thereby allowing the user to customize a real world product based on virtual experiences with the product.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0061">Data on the product trial may be provided to vendors, manufacturers, advertisers, etc., at step <b>250</b>. In embodiments, the data may be provided after one or more product trials have been completed or while one or more product trial are still being conducted. The information collected from one or more of the product trials may be taken individually or aggregated and used to provide insight to vendors, manufacturers, advertisers, etc., about how the product is actually used, versus how they think it will be used, or how other means of market research indicate that it may be used. Additionally, this information may be used to provide mass marketing strategies to better market and advertise products.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an exemplary illustration of a database table, which comprises data that has been tracked about a product on trial, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The table may include, e.g., a column indicating the time a product was used in a VU, at column <b>300</b>. The table may also include information on the location that the product was used, at column <b>310</b>. Moreover, the table may include the type of action that occurred when the product was used, at column <b>320</b>. For example, at 13:43 on Mar. 7, 2008, a product may be taken on trial from store #1 on Green Island.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustrative example of a RDB database table layout according to embodiments of the present invention. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a master trial record for a product, at table <b>400</b>. This table may include data on when a product trial began, when the product data is scheduled to end, and/or the number of participants in the product trial, etc. In embodiments, the number of participants in a product trial may be limited or available to any number of users wanting to participate in the product trial.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also includes a list of product features, at table <b>410</b>. The product features may be identified by, e.g., a feature name and a feature type. For example, a PDA being taken on a product trial may include basic features &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d;, and &#x201c;C&#x201d;, which may be available to certain users. However, the same PDA may include advanced feature &#x201c;D&#x201d;, which may be made available to a subset of the users participating in the product trial.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0065">Detailed data on a product trial may be tracked in the database, at table <b>420</b>. In embodiments, this detail data may include a user name, user identifier, user status, and/or which features are being used by the user, etc. Thus, it can be determined which users still have a product on trial and which users have ended their product trials. Moreover, it can be determined which features are being used and/or which features were used during the product trial.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0066">Data on a product trial can be aggregated and summarized, at table <b>430</b>. For example, information on the total number of users that participated in the product trial can be tracked along with a break down of how many of the total participating users are still participating in the product trial and how many have completed the product trial. Moreover, the aggregated data may include a summary of which features were used by the users while taking the product on trial. This data may be used, e.g., to better understand what product features are being used and to help marketers and advertisers provide better marketing and/or advertising for the products in the VU as well as in the real world.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0067">While the invention has been described in terms of embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications and in the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
