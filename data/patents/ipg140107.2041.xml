<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to patterned conductive elements and method for making the same, particularly, to a carbon nanotube based patterned conductive element and a method for making the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patterned conductive elements, especially patterned transparent conductive elements, are widely used in the electronic devices such as a touch screen, a liquid crystal display (LCD), or a field emission display (FED).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A conventional patterned transparent conductive element includes a patterned transparent conductive indium tin oxide (ITO). However, the ITO layer has poor wearability, low chemical endurance and uneven resistance in an entire area of the panel. Furthermore, the ITO layer is generally formed by means of ion-beam sputtering and etched by laser beam, and the method is relatively complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed, therefore, is to provide a patterned conductive element and a method for making the same which can overcome the shortcoming described above.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;one&#x201d; embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">References will now be made to the drawings to describe, in detail, various embodiments of the present patterned conductive elements and methods for making the same.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a patterned conductive element <b>10</b> of one embodiment includes a substrate <b>12</b>, an adhesive layer <b>13</b>, and a patterned carbon nanotube layer <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The substrate <b>12</b> can be flat or curved and configured to support other elements. The substrate <b>12</b> can be insulative and transparent, opaque, or translucent.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the transmittance of the substrate <b>12</b> can be greater than 75%. The substrate <b>12</b> can be made of rigid materials such as silicon, ceramic, glass, quartz, diamond, plastic or any other suitable material. The substrate <b>12</b> can also be made of flexible materials such as polycarbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate acrylic (PMMA), polyimide (PI), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), polyether polysulfones (PES), polyvinyl polychloride (PVC), benzocyclobutenes (BCB), polyesters, or acrylic resin. In one embodiment, the substrate <b>12</b> is a flat and flexible PET plate.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The adhesive layer <b>13</b> is configured to fix the patterned carbon nanotube layer <b>18</b> on the substrate <b>12</b>. The adhesive layer <b>13</b> can be transparent, opaque, or translucent. In one embodiment, the transmittance of the adhesive layer <b>13</b> can be greater than 75%. The adhesive layer <b>13</b> can be made of materials such as hot plastic or UV (Ultraviolet Rays) glue, for example PVC or PMMA. The thickness of the adhesive layer <b>13</b> can be in a range from about 1 nanometer to about 500 micrometers, for example, the thickness is in a range from about 1 micrometer to about 2 micrometers. In one embodiment, the adhesive layer <b>13</b> is a UV glue layer with a thickness of 1.5 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The patterned carbon nanotube layer <b>18</b> can be a continuous structure or includes a plurality of spaced carbon nanotube patterns arranged in the form of an array. The plurality of carbon nanotube patterns can be hexagonally arranged, squarely arranged, or concentrically arranged. The carbon nanotube pattern can be a triangle, parallelogram, diamond, square, trapezoid, rectangle, or circle. In one embodiment, the patterned carbon nanotube layer <b>18</b> includes a plurality of carbon nanotube patterns having the same shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In one embodiment, the patterned carbon nanotube layer <b>18</b> includes a plurality of carbon nanotube patterns having different shapes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the patterned carbon nanotube layer <b>18</b> includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes <b>182</b>. The carbon nanotubes <b>182</b> in each carbon nanotube pattern are joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force therebetween to form an integral structure. A majority of the carbon nanotubes <b>182</b> are arranged to extend along the direction substantially parallel to the surface of the adhesive layer <b>13</b>. A plurality of gaps is defined between adjacent carbon nanotubes <b>182</b> so that part of the adhesive layer <b>13</b> is exposed. The surface of the exposed adhesive layer <b>13</b> is substantially smooth. The plurality of gaps is filled with the adhesive layer <b>13</b>, namely part of the adhesive layer <b>13</b> permeates into the patterned carbon nanotube layer <b>18</b>.

After the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> is placed on the adhesive layer <b>13</b>, the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> on the solidified adhesive layer <b>132</b> is only located on surface of the solidified adhesive layer <b>132</b> and connected with the solidified adhesive layer <b>132</b> by van der Waals attractive force.

<p id="p-0035" num="0043">The carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> can be a substantially pure structure of the carbon nanotubes, with few impurities and chemical functional groups. A majority of the carbon nanotubes are arranged to extend along the direction substantially parallel to the surface of the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b>. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> can be single-walled, double-walled, or multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The length and diameter of the carbon nanotubes can be selected according to need, for example the diameter can be in a range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 50 nanometers and the length can be in a range from about 200 nanometers to about 900 nanometers. The thickness of the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> can be in a range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 100 micrometers, for example in a range from about 100 nanometers to about 200 nanometers. The carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> has a good flexibility because of the good flexibility of the carbon nanotubes therein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0044">The carbon nanotubes of the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> can be arranged orderly to form an ordered carbon nanotube structure or disorderly to form a disordered carbon nanotube structure. The term &#x2018;disordered carbon nanotube structure&#x2019; includes, but is not limited to, to a structure where the carbon nanotubes are arranged along many different directions, and the aligning directions of the carbon nanotubes are random. The number of the carbon nanotubes arranged along each different direction can be almost the same (e.g. uniformly disordered). The carbon nanotubes in the disordered carbon nanotube structure can be entangled with each other. The term &#x2018;ordered carbon nanotube structure&#x2019; includes, but is not limited to, a structure where the carbon nanotubes are arranged in a consistently systematic manner, e.g., the carbon nanotubes are arranged approximately along a same direction and/or have two or more sections within each of which the carbon nanotubes are arranged approximately along a same direction (different sections can have different directions).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0045">In one embodiment, the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> is a free-standing structure. The term &#x201c;free-standing structure&#x201d; means that the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> can sustain the weight of itself when it is hoisted by a portion thereof without any significant damage to its structural integrity. Thus, the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> can be suspended by two spaced supports.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0046">The carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> includes at least one free-standing carbon nanotube film. The free-standing carbon nanotube film can be drawn from a carbon nanotube array and then placed on the patterned adhesive layer <b>13</b> directly and easily. In one embodiment, the carbon nanotube film can be made by the steps of: growing a carbon nanotube array on a wafer by chemical vapor deposition method; and drawing the carbon nanotubes of the carbon nanotube array to from the carbon nanotube film. During the drawing step, the carbon nanotubes are joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force therebetween along the drawing direction. The carbon nanotube film has the smallest resistance along the drawing direction and the greatest resistance along a direction perpendicular to the drawing direction. Thus, the carbon nanotube film is resistance anisotropy. Furthermore, the carbon nanotube film can be etched or irradiated by laser. After being irradiated by laser, a plurality of parallel carbon nanotube conductive strings will be formed and the resistance anisotropy of the carbon nanotube film will not be damaged because the carbon nanotube substantially extending not along the drawing direction are removed by burning. Each carbon nanotube conductive string includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0047">In one embodiment, the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> is a single carbon nanotube film. The carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of successive and oriented carbon nanotubes joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. The carbon nanotube film is a free-standing film. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of successively oriented carbon nanotube segments joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. Each carbon nanotube segment includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes parallel to each other, and combined by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. Some variations can occur in the carbon nanotube film. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film are oriented along a preferred orientation. The carbon nanotube film can be treated with an organic solvent to increase the mechanical strength and toughness and reduce the coefficient of friction of the carbon nanotube film. A thickness of the carbon nanotube film can range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 100 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">The carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> can include at least two stacked carbon nanotube films. In other embodiments, the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> can include two or more coplanar carbon nanotube films. Additionally, when the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film are aligned along one preferred orientation, an angle can exist between the orientations of carbon nanotubes in adjacent films, whether stacked or adjacent. Adjacent carbon nanotube films can be combined by only the van der Waals attractive force therebetween. An angle between the aligned directions of the carbon nanotubes in two adjacent carbon nanotube films can range from about 0 degrees to about 90 degrees. When the angle between the aligned directions of the carbon nanotubes in adjacent stacked carbon nanotube films is larger than 0 degrees, a plurality of micropores is defined by the carbon nanotube film. Stacking the carbon nanotube films will also add to the structural integrity of the carbon nanotube film.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">In step (S<b>50</b>), the method for solidifying the non-solidified adhesive layer <b>134</b> is same as the method for solidifying the adhesive layer <b>13</b> provided in step (S<b>30</b>). Because the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> on the non-solidified adhesive layer <b>134</b> is infiltrated into the non-solidified adhesive layer <b>134</b>, the carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> on the non-solidified adhesive layer <b>134</b> is fixed by the adhesive layer <b>13</b> to form the fixed carbon nanotube layer in step (S<b>50</b>). The carbon nanotube layer <b>14</b> on the solidified adhesive layer <b>132</b> will not be fixed by the adhesive layer <b>13</b> and will form the non-fixed carbon nanotube layer. In one embodiment, the non-solidified adhesive layer <b>134</b> is solidified by irradiating with ultraviolet light <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">In step (S<b>60</b>), the non-fixed carbon nanotube layer on the solidified adhesive layer <b>132</b> can be removed by a method such as stripping by an adhesive tape or peeling by a roller having an adhesive outer surface. Because the bonding force between the non-fixed carbon nanotube layer and the solidified adhesive layer <b>132</b> is weak, the non-fixed carbon nanotube layer will be removed easily by the adhesive tape or the roller having an adhesive outer surface. In one embodiment, the non-fixed carbon nanotube layer is stripped by an adhesive tape. Compared to the process of forming ITO layer by ion-beam sputtering and etching ITO layer by laser beam, the process of making the patterned carbon nanotube layer <b>18</b> is simple and low cost. Furthermore, the non-fixed carbon nanotube layer can be removed by a method such as laser-beam etching, ion-beam etching, or electron-beam etching. The fixed carbon nanotube layer on the will be remained to form the patterned carbon nanotube layer <b>18</b>.</p>
