<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A reinforced wellhead member for use during fracing operations. The wellhead member is preloaded at a flange section by creating compressive stresses via a ring that interacts with a tightening nut on a bolt. The bolt is rigidly attached to an adapter which may also be modified to create stresses on the flange of the wellhead member. The induced stresses counter the tensile stresses experienced by the flange during fracing operations, allowing a standard wellhead member to be utilized.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates in general to an improved wellbore fracturing system, and in particular to an improved wellhead fracture isolation system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One type of treatment for an oil or gas well is referred to as well fracturing or a well &#x201c;frac.&#x201d; Typically an operator connects an adapter to the upper end of a wellhead member such as a tubing head and pumps a liquid at a very high pressure down the well to create fractures in the earth formation. The operator will also then disburse beads or other proppant material in the fracturing fluid to enter the cracks to keep them open after the high pressure is removed. This type of operation is particularly useful for earth formations that have low permeability but adequate porosity and contain hydrocarbons, as the hydrocarbons can flow more easily through the fractures created in the earth formation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The pressure employed during the frac operation may be many times the natural earth formation pressure that ordinarily would exist. For example, during a frac operation the operator might pump the fluid at a pressure of 8,000 to 9,000 psi, whereas the normal pressure in the wellhead might be only a few hundred to a few thousand psi. Because of this, the body of the wellhead and its associated valves typically may be rated to a pressure that is much lower than what is desired for frac operations. While this is sufficient to contain the normal well formation pressures, it is not enough for the fluid pressure used to fracture the earth formation. Thus, the wellhead and associated valves may be damaged during frac operations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, because of the proppant material contained in the frac fluid, the frac fluid can be very abrasive and damaging to parts of the wellhead. To allow the operator to use a pressure greater than the rated capacity of the wellhead seals (including the various valves associated with the wellhead) and to protect against erosion resulting from the frac fluid being pumped at high pressure and volume into the well, the operator may employ an isolation sleeve to isolate these sensitive portions of the wellhead from the frac fluid. An isolation sleeve seals between an adapter above the wellhead and the casing or tubing extending into the well. The sleeve isolates the high pressure, abrasive fracturing fluid from those portions of the wellhead that are most susceptible to damage from the high pressures and abrasive fluids used in well fracturing operations. However, even with the use of an isolation sleeve, unacceptable levels of tensile stress may be induced in the hub section of the wellhead. It is desirable to reduce these tensile stresses in the wellhead.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An isolation sleeve is carried by a running tool or an adapter assembly for insertion into the bore of a wellhead or tubing head. The wellhead is the surface termination of a wellbore and typically includes a casing head for installing casing hangers during the well construction phase and (when the well will be produced through production tubing) a tubing head mounted atop the casing head for hanging the production tubing for the production phase of the well. The casing in a well is cemented in place in the hole that is drilled. The fluids from the well may be produced through the casing or through production tubing that runs inside the casing from the wellhead to the downhole formation from which the fluids are being produced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The isolation sleeve may be configured to be installed and retrieved from the wellhead by a running/retrieval tool. The tool can be lowered through a double studded adapter connected to the tubing head and frac valve if installed. Lockdown screws may be used to maintain the isolation sleeve within the tubing head during fracturing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A washer and split ring assembly is utilized at a hub or flange section at an upper portion of the tubing head. The washer is axially located between the flange and nuts threaded onto the studs or bolts of the adapter, which run through the flange. The ring is radially located between the washer and the tubing head body. The ring may have a tapered outer shoulder that contacts a corresponding shoulder on the washer such that when the nut is tightened, at least a portion of the tightening force is transmitted via the washer and ring to the flange of the tubing head. The force induces a compressive stress on the flange that advantageously counters the tensile stresses experienced by the flange section during fracing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The interface between the adapter plate and the tubing head flange may also be modified to counter the tensile stresses experienced during fracing operations. An inner shoulder may be formed on a lower end of the adapter plate that protrudes further downward than an outer shoulder of the adapter plate. Both inner and outer shoulders contact the upper end of the flange of the tubing head when the adapter is fully made up with the flange. During tightening of the adapter bolts, the inner shoulder will first contact the upper end of the flange. Because the inner shoulder is radially disposed a distance &#x201c;r&#x201d; from the bolt axis, a moment is advantageously created that acts as a preload that must be overcome by the tensile stresses. At final bolt torque, the outer shoulder contacts the flange to serve as a stop and prevent further movement of the adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">These features advantageously counter the unacceptable tensile stresses induced on the flange of a tubing head during well fracturing operations.</p>

The wellhead or tubing head <b>10</b> may be rated for a working pressure of 5000 psi and has a bore <b>13</b> extending vertically through it (the lower portion of the wellhead is not shown). Tubing head <b>10</b> is a spool like member with a flange on its lower end that projects radially outward. In this embodiment, the lower end of the tubing head <b>10</b> fits over an upper end of production casing <b>12</b>, an annular packoff bushing <b>14</b> coaxially located within the lower end of the tubing head <b>10</b> provides a sealed connection between the casing <b>12</b> and tubing head <b>10</b>. The production casing <b>12</b> may protrude from a casing head <b>16</b> that can support the tubing head <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the tubing head <b>10</b> is mounted on top of the casing head <b>16</b>. A gasket <b>20</b> provides a seal between the tubing head <b>10</b> and the casing head <b>16</b>. Potential leaks at the gasket <b>20</b> can be detected through a test port <b>22</b> on the tubing head <b>10</b> shown in communication with the annular space interior to the gasket <b>20</b>. In this embodiment, the packoff bushing <b>14</b> has an outer profile that corresponds to an interior recess in the bottom of the tubing head <b>10</b>. The packoff bushing <b>14</b> can be locked in place within the tubing head by an annular snap ring <b>24</b> and sealed against the production casing <b>12</b> with an annular o-ring seal <b>26</b>. An annular o-ring seal <b>28</b> with anti-extrusion ring can be installed on the low pressure side of the o-ring seal <b>26</b> to prevent elastomer extrusion into a clearance gap between the production casing <b>12</b> and the packoff bushing <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An isolation sleeve <b>18</b> is shown installed within the bore <b>13</b> of the tubing head <b>10</b> to protect the tubing head <b>10</b> from the high pressure and abrasive fluids imposed during a well fracturing operation. The pressure during fracturing operations can be significantly higher than the rating of the wellhead <b>10</b> and associated components such as valves. Thus, isolation sleeve <b>18</b> and packoff bushing <b>14</b> are rated for pressures above 5000 psi normal working pressure. A lower end of isolation sleeve <b>18</b> may be inserted into an upper receptacle <b>30</b> on an upper end of the packoff bushing <b>14</b> having an upward facing shoulder <b>32</b>. An anti-rotation key <b>34</b> located on the lower end of packoff bushing <b>14</b> that interferes with a slot <b>36</b> formed in tubing head <b>10</b> to prevent the packoff bushing <b>14</b> from rotating if the isolation sleeve <b>18</b> is installed within the packoff bushing <b>14</b> by threading or a Back Pressure Valve (BPV) (not shown) is made or removed from the packoff bushing <b>14</b>. The bore of the packoff bushing <b>14</b> below the shoulder <b>32</b> may be prepared with a threaded profile to receive a BPV. Further, a downward facing shoulder <b>40</b> located in the recess of the wellhead member <b>10</b> interferes with an upward facing shoulder <b>42</b> located on the outer surface of the packoff bushing <b>14</b> to limit the upward movement of the packoff bushing <b>14</b> within the wellhead member <b>10</b>. In this example, lockdown screws <b>44</b> engage a groove <b>46</b> formed on an exterior surface of the isolation sleeve <b>18</b> to maintain the isolation sleeve <b>18</b> in place during fracturing operations. The tapered shoulder <b>32</b> prevents the lower end of the isolation sleeve <b>18</b> from coming into contact with the top of the production casing <b>12</b> to thereby create a gap between the two well components.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in this embodiment tubing head <b>10</b> can have one or more production outlets <b>48</b> located at a point above production casing <b>12</b> and extending laterally from the tubing head <b>10</b> for the flow of well fluid during production. Alternatively, outlets <b>48</b> could be used as instrumentation ports or outlets for leak detection. Further, tubing head <b>10</b> can have a tapered shoulder <b>50</b> formed inside the bore of tubing head <b>10</b> that can support a tubing hanger (not shown) and function to transfer load to the tubing head <b>10</b> if desired. Such a tubing hanger could be held in place within tubing head <b>10</b> by the lockdown screws <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A gasket <b>52</b> provides a seal at the interface between a flange <b>66</b> of the tubing head <b>10</b> and an annular double-studded adapter (DSA) <b>60</b> having a bore diameter that can accommodate the outer diameter of the isolation sleeve <b>18</b>. The DSA <b>60</b> comprises a plate <b>61</b> and may be provided with test ports (not shown) to allow detection of potential leaks. A set of threaded studs <b>62</b> each secure to threaded holes of the DSA <b>60</b>, and protrude upward and downward from DSA <b>60</b>. The studs <b>62</b> projecting downward may be of a different size than studs <b>62</b> projection upward. The lower ends of studs <b>62</b> extends through holes in an external flange <b>66</b> of tubing head <b>10</b> and secure DSA <b>60</b> to tubing head <b>10</b> with nuts <b>64</b>. A washer and reinforcement ring assembly <b>70</b> may be located between the nut <b>64</b> and a lower surface <b>72</b> of the flange <b>66</b> to provide a compressive load that counters tensile stresses experienced at the flange <b>66</b> during fracing operations. The washer and ring assembly <b>70</b> will be discussed in more detail in a subsequent section. The upper studs or bolts <b>62</b> of the DSA <b>60</b> allow additional equipment, such as a frac valve <b>80</b>, to be mounted to an upper portion of the DSA <b>60</b>. An annular gasket <b>82</b> may be utilized at the interface between a flange of the frac valve <b>80</b> and the DSA <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a partial sectional view of a portion of the washer and split ring assembly <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown in more detail. A washer <b>90</b> is installed between the nut <b>64</b> and the flange <b>66</b>. In this embodiment the washer <b>90</b> is segmented and has two semi-circular halves that are fastened to each other by screws <b>92</b> that correspond to passages <b>93</b> formed at joining ends of the washer <b>90</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Holes <b>89</b> are formed on the washer <b>90</b> that correspond to the bolts <b>62</b> to allow the bolts <b>62</b> to pass through. When installed, a gap <b>91</b> exists between a top end of the washer <b>90</b> and the lower surface <b>72</b> of the flange <b>66</b> and remains even after the flange <b>66</b> is fully made up. The washer <b>90</b> has a tapered shoulder <b>98</b> formed on an interior diameter of the washer <b>90</b>, which contacts a corresponding shoulder <b>96</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) formed on an outer diameter of a reinforcement ring or wedge ring <b>94</b>. The wedge ring <b>94</b> may be segmented and is radially located between the washer <b>90</b> and an outer surface <b>95</b> of the tubing head <b>10</b>. Surfaces <b>97</b>, <b>99</b> of the wedge ring <b>94</b> are orthogonal to each other and contact the lower surface <b>72</b> of the flange <b>66</b> and the outer surface <b>95</b> of the tubing head <b>10</b>, respectively. Further, a junk ring <b>100</b>, which may be composed of metal, is wedged between the tubing head <b>10</b> and a tapered shoulder <b>102</b> formed on an inner diameter of the wedge ring <b>94</b>. When the nut <b>64</b> is tightened onto the bolt <b>62</b> and contacts a lower portion of the washer <b>90</b>, at least a portion of the tightening force is transmitted via the washer <b>90</b>, to the ring <b>94</b>, and to the flange <b>66</b> of the tubing head <b>10</b>. The junk ring <b>100</b> may be deformed during tightening of the nuts <b>64</b> to provide a better fit. A radial inward component of the force is applied to the flange <b>66</b> due to the correspondingly tapered shoulders <b>98</b>, <b>96</b> on the washer <b>90</b> and wedge ring <b>94</b>. This radial, inward component of the force induces a compressive stress on the flange <b>66</b> that advantageously counters tensile stresses that may be experienced by the flange <b>66</b> section during fracing operations. The washer <b>90</b> and wedge ring <b>94</b> provide reinforcement to the flange <b>66</b>, allowing the use of a standard low pressure tubing head <b>10</b> during fracing operations rather than a more expensive tubing head with a higher pressure rating.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In general, during fracing operations, pressure from the high pressure fracturing pushes against frac valve <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and places tensions on the upward facing bolts <b>62</b>. Tension in the bolts <b>62</b> pulls on the outer radius of the flange <b>66</b> of the tubing head <b>10</b> and &#x201c;bends&#x201d; it upward. The torque due to this tension is represented by a curved arrow, TF, under the bolts <b>62</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that is shown clockwise if on the left bolt <b>62</b> and would be counter clockwise if on a right bolt <b>62</b>. The prestress disclosed in this application induces a prestress torque, TPS, directed opposite to the torque, TF, in the flange <b>66</b>, which is demonstrated by an oppositely oriented arrow adjacent the plate <b>61</b>. Thus, under normal pressure, the plate <b>61</b> and flange <b>66</b> would be prestressed, due to TPS, but during the high pressure fracturing operations, the torque from the tension in the bolts <b>63</b>, TF, cancels out the prestress, TPS.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another embodiment of the invention, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the plate <b>61</b> of the DSA <b>60</b> is modified to provide reinforcement to the flange <b>66</b> to counter the tensile stresses experienced during fracing operations. An annular recess <b>110</b> is formed on a lower surface of the DSA plate <b>61</b>. A centerline of the recess <b>110</b> is offset from a bolt axis y and defines an inner shoulder <b>112</b> formed on the lower surface of the adapter plate <b>61</b> between the recess <b>110</b> and bore. The recess <b>110</b> also defines an outer shoulder <b>114</b> on the lower surface of the adapter plate <b>61</b> between the recess <b>110</b> and outer diameter of the plate <b>61</b>. The inner shoulder <b>112</b> protrudes further downward than the outer shoulder <b>114</b> such that a gap L<sub>1 </sub>between the inner shoulder <b>112</b> and a top surface <b>116</b> of the flange <b>66</b> is smaller than a gap L<sub>2 </sub>between the outer shoulder <b>114</b> and the top surface <b>116</b>. Both gaps L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>are closed when the inner and outer shoulders <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> contact the top surface <b>116</b> of the flange <b>66</b> when the adapter <b>60</b> is fully made up with the flange <b>66</b>. During tightening of nuts <b>64</b> on the adapter bolts <b>62</b>, the inner shoulder <b>112</b> will first contact the top surface <b>116</b> of the flange <b>66</b>. Because the inner shoulder <b>112</b> is radially disposed a distance &#x201c;r&#x201d; from the bolt axis y, a moment is advantageously created that acts as a preload that must be overcome by the tensile stresses. At final bolt torque, the outer shoulder <b>114</b> contacts the top surface <b>116</b> of the flange <b>66</b> to serve as a stop and prevent further movement of the adapter <b>60</b>. The modification to the DSA <b>60</b> described in this embodiment may be used separate from or together with the features described in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While the invention has been shown in only a few of its forms, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that it is not so limited but is susceptible to various changes without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
