Wireless networks, such as Wi-Fi networks, allow for such communication without the need for a wired connection between the computing device and the network. A computing device may connect to a wireless access point using Radio Frequency (RF) communications.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Computer networks include various network elements, such as routers and switches. These types of elements are typically connected to each other through the use of physical cables. A client device may also use physical cables to connect to the network. In order to add wireless capabilities to a network, a wireless access point may be added. A wireless access point typically refers to a device that contains RF components, such as radios, that permit wireless clients to connect to the access point. It is through the wireless access point, which may simply be referred to as an access point, that the client devices gain wireless access to the network.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An access point may be configured with several parameters in order to operate. For example, the access point may be configured with a radio channel or frequency in which to operate, an RF power level, and various authentication and security parameters. In simple network topologies, an access point may be configured directly by an administrator. However, as the network topology complexity increases and additional access points are required, direct administrator configuration of all access points becomes increasingly complex. Furthermore, configuration of each access point may depend on the operational status of all other access points on the network. For example, if an access point is taken out of service, the remaining access points may need to be reconfigured to compensate for the inoperative access point.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to eliminate the need for direct configuration of an access point, a network controller, or simply a controller, may be employed. The access point may connect to a controller and the operational parameters may be sent to the access point from the controller. The controller may be aware of the operational status of all connected access points and may configure the access points based on this status. More than one network controller may be present in some network architectures. For example, based on the number of access points that will connect to the network, individual controller capacity may determine that more than one controller is needed. As another example, for geographically diverse networks, separate controllers may be used for each geographic region.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A problem may arise in network topologies that contain more than one controller. When an access point is first connected to the network, the access point may need to connect to a controller to receive operational parameters. However, the presence of multiple controllers may complicate the process as the access point may be faced with multiple candidate controllers from which to select. Further exacerbating the problem is the fact that each controller may only be aware of its own operational status with respect to connected access points and may not contain a network wide view of the entire state of all access points within the network. For example, an individual controller may be overloaded with access points while other controllers are more lightly loaded. Such information may not be available given the distributed nature of the controllers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Techniques described herein may be useful in overcoming the problems presented by multiple controllers. A network may contain multiple controllers. The group of controllers, which can be referred to as a team of controllers, may have one controller designated as the master controller. The master controller may maintain data about the entire network, including data such as which access points are connected to which controller.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An access point that is in the process of connecting to a network may broadcast a controller discovery request on the network. All controllers that are available may receive this broadcast discovery request. Every controller that receives the discovery request may send an ownership request to the master controller. The ownership request may be a request by the controller to take ownership of the access point. The master controller may receive the ownership requests from all of the available controllers. The master controller may make a determination as to which controller shall take ownership of the access point. The determination may be based on the current operational status of the network including the status of all of the controllers. The master controller may instruct one controller to take ownership of the access point and instruct the remaining controllers to ignore the discovery request. The selected controller may then send a join request to the access point to inform the access point that it shall connect to the selected controller. The selected controller may then send any operational parameters that are needed for operation to the access point.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example of a system which may implement techniques described herein. The system <b>100</b> may include controllers <b>110</b>,<b>120</b>, <b>130</b>. Of these controllers, one controller <b>110</b>, may be designated the master controller. The remaining controllers may be designated as slave controllers. The master controller may be used to select to which controller an access point will connect, as will be described in further detail below. Although only master controller <b>110</b> is shown in detail, controllers <b>120</b>,<b>130</b> may have a similar structure to the master controller. In some example implementations, the master controller and the slave controllers may have identical structure and may be distinguished by the functionality that is enabled. For example, the master controller functionality may lie dormant on slave controllers. However, the master controller functionality may be present on the slave controllers and may be enabled if it is determined that a slave controller should become the master. For example, if a master controller is taken out of service, a slave controller may be promoted to master.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The master controller may include a processor <b>112</b>. The processor may be used to execute instructions that cause the controller to implement the techniques described herein. For example, coupled to the processor may be a non-transitory processor readable medium <b>114</b> that contains instructions, which if executed by the processor, cause the controller to implement the techniques described herein. The medium may include controller instructions <b>115</b> that cause the processor to provide functionality of a non-master controller. For example, the controller instructions may be used to take ownership of an access point, once instructed by the master controller, and send any operational parameters that are needed by the access point to the access point.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The medium <b>114</b> may also include master controller instructions <b>116</b>. The master controller instructions may include instructions which if executed by the processor cause the processor to provide the functionality of a master controller. For example, the master controller instructions may be used to receive ownership requests for an access point from the team of controllers and determine which controller shall take ownership of the access point.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The medium may also include access point association <b>117</b> data. Access point association data may include a listing of which access points are currently owned, which may also be referred to as associated with, each controller. In some example implementations, the access point associations may be maintained in a table, with each entry in the table specifying an access point and to which controller that access point is associated. Furthermore, the table may contain information which may be used to determine if a controller that was active, in other words operational, is still active. Use of the access point association data will be described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The processor <b>112</b> may also be coupled to a network interface <b>118</b>. The network interface may be used by the master controller to communicate with the various elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The master controller may use network interface to communicate with network <b>140</b>, which will be described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">System <b>100</b> may also include slave controllers <b>120</b>,<b>130</b>. As mentioned above, slave controllers may have the same general structure as the master controller. However, certain instructions may be dormant on the slave controller unless the slave controller is promoted to master. For example, the master controller instructions may be present in the slave controller, but the instructions are not executed by the processor of the slave controller.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The master controller <b>110</b> and the slave controllers <b>120</b>,<b>130</b> may exchange data, such as the data that is contained in the access point association <b>117</b> data. In some example implementations, the master controller may update the access point association data on the slave controllers when there is a change in the association information. By doing so, the slave controllers may maintain knowledge of the current association of access points to controllers. Thus, if a master controller is taken out of service and a slave controller is promoted to master, the promoted slave may already contain the association data and need not rebuild the associations.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, the master controller and the slave controllers may exchange data to inform each other of their own operational status. In one example implementation, the slave controllers may maintain communications with the master controller to inform the master controller that the slave controller is active and operational. Lack of such communication may indicate that the slave controller is not active and is thus not available to take ownership of an access point. Furthermore, such communications may be used by the team of controllers to identify which controller is currently designated the master controller.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">System <b>100</b> may also include network <b>140</b>. The network may allow the elements depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to communicate with each other. The network may be any type of network that enables communication between the various network elements depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The network may be a public or private network. The network may be a local or wide area network (LAN or WAN). The network may be an intranet or the public Internet. It should be understood that any network capable of enabling communications between the elements described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> would be suitable and the techniques described herein are not dependent on the particular type of network that is used.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The system <b>100</b> may include any number of wireless client devices. Client devices may include devices such as computers, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, or any other device that is able to wirelessly connect to a network via an access point. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a single client device <b>150</b>, however it should be understood that there may be any number of client devices. As shown, client device <b>150</b> may be in wireless communication with access point <b>160</b>. Client device <b>150</b> may gain access to network <b>140</b> through the access point <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">System <b>100</b> may also include one or more access points <b>160</b>,<b>170</b>. The access points may include any necessary hardware to enable wireless communications with client devices. For example, the access points may include radio hardware to enable wireless communications. The access point may also include security and authentication to ensure that only authorized clients are able to connect to the access point. The access points <b>160</b>,<b>170</b> may receive their operational parameters from one of controllers <b>110</b>,<b>120</b>,<b>130</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, access point <b>160</b> may be associated <b>180</b> with slave controller <b>120</b>. In other words, slave controller <b>120</b> may be responsible for sending the operational parameters needed for operation of access point <b>160</b> to the access point.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Access point <b>170</b> may be an access point that has just attached itself to the network <b>140</b>. As such, access point <b>170</b> may not yet be configured. In order to become operational, access point <b>170</b> may need to receive operational parameters from one of controllers <b>110</b>,<b>120</b>,<b>130</b>. Prior to receiving the operational parameters, it may need to be determined to which controller access point <b>170</b> should associate. The process of determining the proper controller to which to associate will be described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an example of a message exchange sequence. In some example implementations the message sequence described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may describe the message flows for an access point that has just attached to the network and needs to be configured with operational parameters. As described above, in some example implementations, it must first be determined with which controller the access point will associate. Once the access point has associated with the determined controller, the process of configuration of the access point by the controller may begin.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Access point <b>270</b> may represent an access point that has just attached to a network, but has not yet been configured. For example, access point <b>270</b> may represent access point <b>170</b> that was described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Upon connection to the network, access point <b>270</b> may broadcast a discovery request <b>240</b> (<i>a</i>-<i>c</i>). In some example implementations the access point may send a single discovery request message on the network that is addressed to all controllers. In other example implementations, the access point may send an individual discovery request message to each controller. Regardless of the implementation, the discovery request may be received by each of controllers <b>210</b>,<b>220</b>,<b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Upon receipt of the discovery request, each controller may send an ownership request to the master controller to determine if the sending controller should take ownership of the access point. As shown, controller <b>230</b> may send an ownership request <b>245</b> to the master controller <b>210</b>. Likewise, controller <b>220</b> may also send an ownership request <b>250</b> to the master controller. Master controller <b>210</b> may also send an ownership request <b>255</b> to the master controller. As shown, the master controller may send the ownership request to itself. By doing so, the master controller may be able to segregate functionality that is provided by the master controller from functionality that is provided by all controllers. For example, the master controller may simply respond to a discovery request by executing the same instructions that a slave controller would execute. Thus, any controller that receives a discovery request sends an ownership request to the master controller, even if the controller that received the request and the master controller are the same device.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be understood that at this point in the message sequence, the controllers have not allocated any resources, such as memory, for use by the access point, because it is not yet known to which controller the access point will associate. As such, the controllers need not reserve any resources at this point in time. It is not until ownership of the access point has been determined that resources will be allocated by the controller that is selected to own the access point.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The master controller <b>210</b> may receive the ownership requests from each of the controllers <b>210</b>,<b>220</b>,<b>230</b>. The master controller may make a decision as to which controller shall take ownership of the access point <b>270</b>. In one example implementation, the master controller may simply grant ownership to the first controller that sends an ownership request. In a different example implementation, the master controller may first examine the access point association <b>117</b> data to determine the loading of each controller. Because the master controller is aware of the loading of each controller, the master controller is able to determine to which controller the access point should be associated based on some assignment policy. For example, an assignment policy may indicate that the controller with the least number of associated access points should be granted ownership of a new access point. Thus, the master controller may be able to determine to which controller the access point will be associated, because the master controller has a system wide view of the current access point to controller associations.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some example implementations, the master controller may determine the proper controller to grant ownership based on if the access point was previously owned by a controller and if that controller is still active. For example, an access point may have been owned by controller <b>220</b>. The access point may have been taken out of service for some reason. For example, the access point may have rebooted due to an error. When the access point attempts to reconnect to the network, the access point association data may show that the access point was previously owned by controller <b>220</b>. If controller <b>220</b> is currently active, the master controller may determine that ownership of the access point shall remain with controller <b>220</b>. However, if the controller <b>220</b> is no longer active, for example, the controller <b>220</b> may be out of service for some reason, the master controller is aware of this through the inter-controller communication described above. Thus, the master controller would not attempt to grant ownership to controller <b>220</b> even though that controller previously owned the access point.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once the master controller has made a decision as to which controller may take ownership of the access point, the master controller may send an ownership response <b>260</b>,<b>265</b>,<b>268</b> to the controllers <b>210</b>,<b>220</b>,<b>230</b>. The ownership response may include an indication to ignore the discovery request from the access point, which means that the controller receiving the ownership response indicating ignore will not take ownership of the access point. As shown, ownership responses <b>260</b>,<b>265</b> sent to controllers <b>210</b>,<b>220</b> inform the controllers that they will not take ownership of the access point <b>270</b>. As such, controllers <b>210</b>,<b>220</b> will take no further action with respect to the access point <b>270</b>. As no resources were previously allocated by controllers <b>210</b>,<b>220</b> with respect to access point <b>270</b>, there are no resources that need to be released.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The master controller <b>210</b> may send an ownership response indicating success to one of the controllers <b>210</b>,<b>220</b>,<b>230</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, ownership response <b>268</b> sent from the master controller to controller <b>230</b> indicates a successful response. In addition, the master controller may update the access point association <b>117</b> data to indicate that the selected controller is to take ownership of the access point. The controller <b>230</b> may receive the successful ownership response and take ownership of the access point <b>270</b>. For example, the controller <b>230</b> may send a join request <b>275</b> to access point <b>270</b> which informs the access point that it may be associated with controller <b>230</b>. It should be understood that the access point may receive a join request from a single controller. As such, the access point need not make any determination as to which controller to join, as there is only one controller that has invited the access point to join. The controller <b>230</b> and access point <b>270</b> may then exchange the necessary operational parameters for the access point to successful connect to the network and be properly configured. The specific protocol used to configure the access point once ownership by a controller has been determined is generally not important. However what should be understood is that the problem of determining which controller shall take ownership of an access point is solved through the use of the master controller, as has been described above.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some cases, the master controller may determine that no controller shall take ownership of the access point. For example, if all controllers are at their maximum capacity, it may not be possible for any controller to take ownership of the access point. As explained above, the master controller, through the use of the access point association <b>117</b> data, is aware of how many access points are currently associated with each controller. If the access point is not to be associated with any controller due to insufficient capacity on all of the controllers, the master controller may send a capacity exceeded ownership response (not shown). Each controller that receives a capacity exceeded ownership response may not take ownership of the controller. In addition, the controller may report the capacity exceeded response to a system administrator, such that the administrator may determine if corrective action, such as adding additional controllers, is needed. Furthermore, the controller may implement a throttling procedure to ensure that an access point that cannot be owned does not cause an excessive number of ownership requests to be sent to the master controller from the team of controllers. The throttling process will be described in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an example of a high level flow diagram for requesting ownership. In block <b>305</b> a discovery request may be received by a controller from an access point. In block <b>310</b> the controller may send an ownership request to the master controller. As mentioned previously, the master controller may be a different controller or it may be the controller that received the discovery request in block <b>305</b>. What should be understood is that the ownership request may be sent to whichever controller has been designated as the master controller. In block <b>315</b>, an ownership response may be received from the master controller.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In block <b>320</b>, the ownership response may be examined to determine if the ownership response indicates a successful ownership request. If not, the process moves to block <b>330</b>, which is described below. If the ownership response does indicate a successful request, the process may moves to block <b>325</b>. In block <b>325</b>, the controller may send a join request to the access point. The join request informs the access point that the controller sending the join request will be taking ownership of the access point. The access point and the controller may then exchange operational parameters using any suitable protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In block <b>330</b> the ownership response may be examined to determine if the ownership response indicates that the discovery request should be ignored. If not, the process moves to block <b>340</b>, which is described below. If the ownership response does indicate that the discovery request should be ignored, the process moves to block <b>335</b>. In block <b>335</b> the discovery request is ignored. The controller may take no further action and no further communication with the access point may be needed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In block <b>340</b>, an ownership response indicating the capacity of access points has been exceeded. The reason for this is that for a new access point, there may be three possibilities. The access point may be owned by the controller, the access point may be owned by a different controller, so the current controller may ignore the discovery request, or that there is insufficient capacity on the entire team of controllers. As the previous two cases are addressed in blocks <b>320</b> and <b>330</b>, block <b>340</b> handles the case where the access point may not be owned by any controller in the team of controllers, as there is insufficient capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In block <b>345</b>, the controller may report the capacity of access points exceeded response to an administrator interface. The report may be used by an administrator to indicate that insufficient controller resources were available at the time the access point attempted to connect to the network. The administrator may take corrective action, such as adding additional controllers, as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In block <b>350</b>, subsequent discovery requests from the access point may be ignored for a designated period of time. As mentioned above, when ownership of an access point is denied because of insufficient capacity, it may become necessary to throttle the number of ownership request sent to the master controller. In normal operation, if an access point does not receive a join request from any controller, it may broadcast additional discovery requests. These requests will in turn trigger additional ownership requests to be sent from each controller to the master controller. This process may continue until the access point receives a join request from a controller.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If an ownership request for an access point is denied because of insufficient capacity, the capacity issue may not be resolved in the timeframe between subsequent discovery requests from the access point. Thus, the additional discovery request may result in unnecessary ownership requests, as ownership of the access point may not be granted until the capacity issue is resolved. As such, in block <b>350</b>, subsequent discovery requests from an access point may be ignored for a designated period of time. The designated period of time may be configured by an administrator of the system or may be predefined. In block <b>355</b> it is determined if the designated period of time has elapsed. If not, the process returns to block <b>350</b>, wherein a subsequent discovery request from the access point may continue to be ignored. Once the designated period of time has elapsed, the process returns to block <b>305</b>, wherein the discovery request may be handled as was described above.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an example of a high level flow diagram for determining ownership. In block <b>410</b> an access point ownership request may be received from a controller. For example, the controller may be the master controller. In block <b>420</b> it may be determined if the access point is owned by another active controller. In other words, it may be determined if the access point association <b>117</b> data indicates that the access point is owned by another controller and that controller is currently operational. This situation can occur, for example, if an access point disconnects from the network because of a reboot caused by an error. The access point may then attempt to reconnect to the network. As the access point had previously been owned by a controller, it may increase efficiency if ownership is again granted to the same controller, assuming that controller is still active.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If it is determined that the access point is owned by another active controller, the process moves to block <b>430</b>, wherein a ownership response indicating ignore may be sent to the controller. The reason for this is that ownership would preferably be granted to the controller that previously owned the access point. An ownership request from that controller should be granted, and as such, the ownership request received in block <b>410</b> should be ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In block <b>440</b> it may be determined if there is sufficient capacity available on the controller to take ownership of the access point. As mentioned above, the master controller, through the access point association data is aware of the current load of all controllers within the system and is thus able to make a determination as to which controller should take ownership. Sufficient capacity on a controller may include the ability of the controller itself to take ownership of the access point. Furthermore, sufficient capacity may also include the ability of the controller to take ownership of the access point, relative to other controllers. For example, even if a controller has sufficient capacity to take ownership of the access point, there may be another controller that is more lightly loaded. It may be preferable to assign the access point to the more lightly loaded controller.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If it is determined that sufficient capacity is available on the controller, the process moves to block <b>450</b>, wherein an ownership response indicating success may be sent to the controller. If sufficient capacity is not available on the controller, the process may move to block <b>460</b>. In block <b>460</b>, it may be determined if sufficient capacity is available on any controller within the team of controllers. If sufficient capacity is not available on any controller, the process moves to block <b>470</b>, wherein an ownership response indicating capacity exceeded may be sent. The reason for this is that there is no controller that has sufficient capacity to take ownership of the access point. The controller receiving the capacity exceeded response may then implement the throttling procedure described above.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If sufficient capacity is available on the team of controllers, the process moves to block <b>430</b>, wherein an ownership response indicating ignore may be sent to the controller. The reason that an ignore ownership response is sent is because there is insufficient capacity available on the controller that sent the ownership request, as was determined in block <b>440</b>. However, there is sufficient capacity available on the entire team of controllers. A capacity exceeded response may not be appropriate because although the controller that sent the ownership request in block <b>410</b> may not have sufficient capacity, at least one other controller in the team does have sufficient capacity. The remaining controllers may also send ownership requests. At least one of those request may come from a controller that has sufficient capacity. As such, the ownership request from the controller with sufficient capacity should be granted once received.</p>
