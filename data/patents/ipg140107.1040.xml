<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a filtering device for plastic melts exhibiting at least one screen plunger arranged in a screen plunger hole movably between an inlet channel and an outlet channel of a housing and containing replaceable, three-dimensional filter elements, whereby the inside of the filter element is connected to at least one melt channel formed in the screen plunger, said melt channel being connected to the inlet or outlet channel of the housing when in the production position.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such a filtering device is known from DE 44 20 119 C1. Although it has been successful, housing and screen carrier plungers are specially matched to each other with regard to the inlet and outlet openings of the melt channels, such that it is not possible to place the also known screen carrier plungers into the housing when they exhibit screen surfaces with an onflow perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. In particular, filtering devices with such screen carrier plungers exhibiting screen surfaces with an onflow perpendicular to the longitudinal axis cannot be converted to operate using a screen carrier plunger with cartridge filters as known from the aforementioned patent document.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, it has been observed that maintenance and cleaning of the known filtering device is very time-intensive.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is, therefore, the objective of the invention to improve a filtering device of the aforementioned kind such that easy maintenance and cleaning is possible, while still providing a large filtration surface.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This objective is achieved by a filtering device, in which the screen plunger has at least one receiving chamber that can be closed by a cover on the face side, and in which a plurality of filter elements are bundled together with a central distribution element to a filter cartridge that can be placed in the receiving chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In short, the distinctive feature of the design according to the invention is to form a solid screen carrier plunger in part as a tube and to populate the receiving chamber created therein with a filter cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The filter cartridge is formed from numerous candle filters, which are essentially known. These are positioned at the joint central distribution element, are fed from there, and discharge the melt across it.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The preferred flow through the filter elements is from the outside to the inside. This avoids expanding of the filter elements due to a high differential pressure between the inner and outer side. However, with a proper design of the filter elements or with a reduction of the forces acting upon them, a reverse direction of the flow is possible as well.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">By using numerous filter elements, in particular candle filters or stacked filter discs, a significantly increased filtering surface is available compared to a screen carrier plunger with flat surface screens.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An additional advantage is that a perpendicular flow through the screen carrier plunger is possible. Thus, the filter plungers, which in most existing filtering devices are located in the openings for the melt feed and discharge diametrically opposite the borehole, can be connected to a screen carrier plunger designed according to the invention, with the flow passing through them. Therefore, even already existing filtering devices can be provided with the screen carrier plungers designed according to the invention without the need to modify the housing and the screen plunger boreholes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, filter elements are positioned on both face sides of the central distribution element. This creates a dual pack of filter elements with a disc-shaped central distribution element in the center. The central distribution element being located in the center doubles the usable filter surfaces once more. At the same time, the receiving chamber in the screen carrier plunger is divided into two screen chambers that can be ventilated separate from each other after cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one preferred embodiment, the melt is guided via a first melt channel located on the inside of the central distribution element into a receiving chamber and from there flows from the outside through the outer jacket of the candle filter. The melt that flows from the inside of the respective filter element via several outlet openings is collected in a second melt channel in the central distribution element and from there discharges from the screen plunger.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Without any design changes, the flow through the filtering device can also occur in the other direction. In such a case, the melt is distributed via the second melt channel to numerous outlet openings, which are followed by the inner sides of the candle filters or the other three-dimensional filter elements, respectively. The melt then exits through the outer cover of the filter elements and enters into the receiving chamber of the screen carrier plunger. From there, the melt flows via an additional outlet opening into the second melt channel in the central distribution element and from there to the outlet opening of the screen carrier plunger.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a first embodiment of the invention, the filter elements are formed by candle filters, which extend parallel to the longitudinal axis of the screen plunger, and with their open side are attached to openings on the face side of the central distribution element.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With a second and third embodiment of the invention, a second melt channel extends in the central distribution element to at least one distribution tube that protrudes into the receiving chamber and exhibits several outlet openings, and where each said distribution tube is followed by at least one filter element. Initially, the distribution tube enables the flow of the melt also in the depth of the receiving chamber, facing away from the central distribution element, whereby a uniform distribution to the filter elements that are strung along the distribution tube occurs. Short, radially oriented candle filters or disc-shaped, hollow filters are used as filter elements and surround the distribution tube at least in the area of its, in particular radial outlet openings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the rear area, the screen carrier plunger exhibits an outer, smooth cover area to enable closing of the channels that conduct the melt. This serves the purpose of taking one respective screen carrier plunger out of operation for maintenance, while the other screen carrier plunger continues with the filtration of the melt. The rear section can be formed by a solid material or a tube.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the central distribution element is located approximately in the center of the receiving chamber and divides said chamber into two chambers that are sealed from each other. This allows for the simultaneous use of two filter cartridges, thus doubling the filter surface.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A rod or a tube that leads from the central distribution element to the cover facilitates the removal of the filter cartridge from the receiving chamber. In addition, pressure is applied from the cover to the central distribution element via the rod or the tube pressing said central distribution element with its edge onto the seal seat.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">If a rear chamber is present, a tube can be provided there as well allowing free discharge of the melt at the end.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For a full understanding of the present invention, reference should now be made to the following detailed description of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref><i>c </i>of the drawings. Identical elements in the various figures are designated with the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a filtering device <b>100</b> that features a housing <b>1</b> with two screen carrier plunger boreholes <b>4</b>. The screen carrier plunger boreholes <b>4</b> are connected to inlet and outlet openings <b>3</b>, <b>2</b> via channels <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In its inner receiving chamber <b>14</b>, the screen carrier plunger <b>10</b> includes a filter cartridge <b>30</b>. Towards the outside, the receiving chamber <b>14</b> is closed through a cover <b>16</b> located at the face side. In the rear area, the screen carrier plunger <b>10</b> exhibits an outer, smooth jacket area to enable closing of the channels <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> that conduct the melt.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is sufficient to remove the cover <b>16</b> from the screen carrier plunger <b>10</b> in order to pull the inserted filter cartridge <b>30</b> forward and out. The inner, empty receiving chamber <b>14</b> of the screen carrier plunger is then accessible for cleaning from the front side of the housing <b>1</b>. While a conventional screen carrier plunger with perpendicular flow through the plane screen plates needs to be pulled out significantly for maintenance in order to make the screen location accessible, the screen carrier plunger designed according to the invention only needs to be pulled forward a few centimeters and rotated. This movement is necessary only to affect the closing of the channels <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>. However, it is not necessary to pull the screen carrier plunger <b>10</b> out further for maintenance purposes. This also saves space on the side next to the filtering device <b>100</b>, a space that needed to remain free with known filtering devices for pulling the screen carrier plungers out sufficiently for cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a semi-section of the screen carrier plunger <b>10</b> removed from the housing <b>1</b> such that the filter cartridge <b>30</b> contained in the receiving chamber <b>14</b> is visible.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The replaceable filter cartridge <b>30</b> essentially consists of a central distribution element <b>20</b> and filter elements <b>25</b> placed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> on the left, the inflow opening <b>12</b> can be recognized in the central distribution element <b>20</b>, which is connected to an outlet opening <b>23</b> via a first melt channel <b>22</b> such that a direct path is established for the flow of the melt through the central distribution element <b>20</b> and into the receiving chamber <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the filter cartridge <b>30</b> removed from the screen carrier plunger <b>10</b>, said filter cartridge consisting in this shown first embodiment of the central, disc-shaped central distribution element <b>20</b> and several candle filters <b>25</b> screwed into them on the face side. In this embodiment, the candle filters <b>25</b> extend on both sides of the central distribution element <b>20</b>. Thus, the central distribution element <b>20</b> also separates the receiving chamber <b>14</b> in the screen carrier plunger <b>10</b> into two separate chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A lay-on edge <b>29</b> of the central distribution element rests on a respective shoulder at the inner jacket of the receiving chamber <b>14</b> and in this manner enables the tight separation of the receiving chamber into one chamber located before and another one located after the central distribution element <b>20</b>. In addition, it defines the axial position of the filter cartridge <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Sealing between the chambers is required to avoid a transfer of melt into the outlet opening <b>11</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in the jacket of the screen carrier plunger <b>10</b>. Otherwise, the filtered and non-filtered material could mix at this location.</p>

The melt enters through the porous filter material of the candle filters <b>25</b>, which, for example, consists of a metal mesh, into the candle filters <b>25</b>, which are located upstream of the outlet openings <b>24</b> in the central distribution element <b>20</b>. From the outlet opening <b>24</b>, the melt flows into the second melt channel <b>21</b>&#x2014;exhibiting a clasp shape in a cross-sectional view&#x2014;that acts as a collector and re-combines the partial melt streams from the various openings <b>24</b>. From there, discharge occurs via a second outlet opening <b>11</b> out of the screen carrier plunger <b>10</b> into the channel <b>6</b> in the housing <b>1</b> and finally at the discharge opening <b>2</b> into a subsequent process.</p>
