<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional Application No. 61/254,231, filed Oct. 23, 2009.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a tool for dispensing a roll of stock material. More particularly, the invention relates to tool for manually dispensing and applying an elongated flexible stock material with one hand.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In shipping and storing goods, a flexible stock material such as a plastic stretch film can be used to protect and secure a load. The advantages of the use of stock materials are numerous. The stock material produces a tight wrap and protects the wrapped load from damage due to weather, abrasions, punctures, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To utilize the stock material in an optimum manner, the material must be applied to the load at an appropriate tension. If the material is stretched too tight, the material will be difficult to wrap about the load and may break or tear. If the tension in the material is insufficient, the material will not conform to the shape of the load and the material wrap will be undesirably loose.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A number of devices have been developed for controlling the tension applied to the stock material during application of the material to a load. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,722,493; 4,834,312; 4,872,623 and 5,203,517 show examples of such devices. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,834,312 discloses a device having a head of a size and shape to be inserted into a core. Fixedly projecting from the head is a handle in the form of a spindle. The spindle carries a flexible grip in which the spindle normally freely rotates and which the flexible grip may be selectively squeezed to vary the friction between the grip and the spindle, thus varying the tension in the stock material being applied. Specifically, the grip includes a split cylindrical member telescoped over the spindle. Insertable devices, such as disclosed in these patents, often have multiple pieces most of which are plastic. The complexity of these designs and even the use of plastic increase their cost.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,102,323 discloses a web dispensing tool that has an elongate shaft rather than an insertable dispensing handle. The disclosed design includes a gripper with a sleeve fitted inside it that makes the gripper generally rigid so that tightening the grip on the gripper does not affect (slow or stop) the rotation of the shaft. Instead, when the user wants to tension the film by slowing the motion of the handle the user must move his thumb and forefinger to squeeze a recess portion of the gripper into a groove in the shaft for frictional braking. This design purposely avoids locating the tensioning/braking mechanism in the main portion of the gripper.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, a dispensing tool with minimal number parts, many of which are reusable and/or recyclable, is disclosed that is easily operated by one hand with the tensioning/braking mechanism located in the main portion of the gripper. The dispending tool or apparatus includes a shaft that has a core segment for supporting a roll of material and a handle segment that is integral with the core segment, the handle segment having an annular recess therein, a collar received in the annular recess, and a gripper comprising a generally cylindrically shaped body having an open center and an open upper end and a closed lower end, the gripper being positioned on the handle segment with the open upper end between the collar and the core segment. The shaft of the apparatus is rotatable relative to the gripper and the gripper is hand-compressible to bring the gripper into frictional contact with the shaft to slow or stop the rotation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the shaft is a corrugated paper shaft. In another embodiment, the shaft may include a roll of stock material wound onto the core segment to be dispensed when the shaft rotates, such as a roll of stretch wrap film.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect an apparatus for dispensing a roll of material with one hand is disclosed that includes a shaft having a core segment for supporting a roll of material integral with a handle segment that includes a groove and a washer channel with the groove positioned nearer to the core segment than the washer channel. The apparatus also includes an elastomeric washer received in the washer channel and a gripper received over the handle segment of the shaft. The gripper includes a cylindrically shaped body defining an open center and having an open upper end and a closed lower end. When the gripper is slide over the handle segment its open upper end passes over the elastomeric washer and is received in the groove on the handle segment of the shaft. The shaft is rotatable relative to the gripper and the gripper is hand-compressible to bring the gripper into frictional contact with the washer to slow or stop the rotation of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the shaft may include a roll of stock material wound onto the core segment to be dispensed when the shaft rotates, such as a roll of stretch wrap film.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> show embodiments of a dispensing tool <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>&#x2032;, respectively, that are assembled by sliding a gripper <b>16</b> over a handle segment <b>22</b> of a shaft <b>12</b>. The shaft <b>12</b> includes a cylindrical body <b>32</b> surrounding a hollow center <b>24</b> as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>5</b>A. The shaft <b>12</b> includes two segments, a core segment <b>26</b> and a handle segment <b>22</b>, that are integral with one another. The core segment <b>26</b> defines one end of the shaft <b>12</b> and the handle segment <b>22</b> defines the other end. The core segment <b>26</b> supports a roll <b>28</b> of stock material having an inner end <b>46</b> and an outer end <b>48</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), for example a stretch film, and the handle segment <b>22</b> receives the gripper <b>16</b>. The core segment <b>26</b> stops and the handle segment <b>22</b> begins at the inner end <b>46</b> of the roll <b>28</b>. The core segment <b>26</b> and the handle segment <b>22</b> may be the same or different lengths, relative to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The shaft <b>12</b> has a rigid construction such that the core segment <b>26</b> does not readily deform or break upon application of bending or compressive forces. The shaft <b>12</b> is fabricated of a plurality of concentrically wound layers of a paper or plastic material. The layers of the paper material are bonded together using a suitable adhesive in conventional fashion. Additionally, the paper material has the consistency of paper board material known and used in the industry for cores designed to support paper or plastic products, often referred to as a corrugated core. The paper board core may be preferable because it is biodegradable and/or recyclable and will contribute plastic to land fills.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Now referring to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the handle segment <b>22</b> has a first annular recess <b>18</b> and a second annular recess <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, the second annular recess <b>30</b> may be located in a generally central portion of the shaft <b>12</b> in close proximity to the roll <b>28</b> of stock material. It is appreciated that the second annular recess <b>30</b> may be located at other points along the shaft <b>12</b>. The first annular recess <b>18</b> is adjacent the second annular recess <b>30</b> with the second annular recess <b>30</b> positioned nearer to the core segment <b>26</b> or the roll <b>28</b> than the first annular recess <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first annular recess <b>18</b> is generally wider than the second annular recess <b>30</b> and may be cut, milled, or machined into the core, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but is not limited thereto. The second annular recess <b>30</b> may be a depression that is cut, milled, pressed, or machined into the core, but is not limited thereto. It is possible that the first annular recess <b>18</b> may also be pressed into the core, but as the recess increases in width this may become a less desirable option. One skilled in the art will appreciate that other methods of making the first and/or the second annular recesses <b>18</b>, <b>30</b> are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the first annular recess <b>18</b> provides a seat for a collar <b>20</b> and is preferably made into the shaft <b>12</b> to a depth suitable therefore. In one embodiment, the first annular recess <b>18</b> is deeper than the second annular recess <b>30</b>. The collar <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, is seated in the first annular recess <b>18</b>. The collar <b>20</b> act as a backstop for the gripper <b>16</b> once the tool <b>10</b> is assembled that prevents the gripper <b>16</b> from sliding back off the handle segment <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, the collar <b>20</b> may be or include a washer such as an elastomeric washer. The elastomeric washer should be stretchable enough to fit over the shaft <b>12</b> and thick enough to seat within the first annular recess <b>18</b> with a portion thereof extending out of the first annular recess. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the elastomeric washer may be made of or include any elastomer suitable for frictional engagement with the gripper <b>16</b>. For example, the washer may be or include neoprene, natural rubber, or pliable PVC, but is not limited thereto. In one embodiment, the washer may be a standard toroidal-shaped washer, such as an O-ring. In another embodiment, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the washer may be a quarter-quadrant washer, i.e., a &#xbc; segment of a toroidal-shaped washer <b>20</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The gripper <b>16</b> provides a support surface for a user's hand during manipulation of the tool <b>10</b>. The gripper <b>16</b> is preferably molded of a soft pliable plastic material such a polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, thermoplastic rubber resins, or a material of similar characteristics that enables the gripper to flex in response to the pressure applied by the user's hand. Preferably, the gripper <b>16</b> is molded of PVC. The gripper <b>16</b> can alternately be made of a pliable paperboard. The embodiments, herein provide a gripper that is removable and reusable with subsequent rolls of stock material. Such grippers are better for the environment as they are less likely to be discarded and end up in a land fill.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The gripper <b>16</b> includes a cylindrical body <b>42</b> defining an open center <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>. The open center <b>34</b> is closed at one end <b>58</b> by an integrally formed cap <b>40</b> while the opposite end <b>60</b> is open. The gripper <b>16</b> also includes a generally circumferential indentation <b>36</b> in the exterior surface of the gripper near the open end <b>60</b>. The indentation <b>36</b> forms a protrusion <b>39</b> into the open center <b>34</b> of the gripper to define a narrower opening <b>44</b> therein. The top edge of the recessed portion <b>36</b> is contiguous with an outwardly projecting flange <b>38</b>. The lower edge of the recessed portion <b>36</b> may adjoin an annular projection <b>37</b> having an arcuate cross-sectional shape and projecting outwardly from the recessed portion <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The flange <b>38</b> extends around the outer periphery of the upper end <b>60</b> of the gripper <b>16</b>, providing a barrier between the bottom portion of the roll <b>28</b> of stock material and the user's hand. The flange <b>38</b> includes an upwardly extending lip <b>54</b>. The lip <b>54</b>, in an embodiment where the upper end <b>60</b> of the gripper <b>16</b> is in general contact with the roll <b>28</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, can act as a bearing surface against which the roll <b>28</b> rotates. In another embodiment, the upper end <b>60</b> of the gripper <b>16</b> does not contact the roll <b>28</b> and instead is separated from the roll be a length of shaft as would be true in an assembled version of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Upon assembly, the shaft <b>12</b> receives the collar <b>20</b> in the first annular recess <b>18</b> and then the gripper <b>16</b> is slide over the handle segment <b>22</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> until the protrusion <b>39</b> passes over the collar <b>20</b> and is optionally received in the second annular recess <b>30</b>. The protrusion <b>39</b> acts as a bearing surface or a hub about which the shaft rotates. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the handle segment <b>22</b> is received in the open center <b>34</b> of the gripper <b>16</b> with enough space between the gripper and the shaft to permit the shaft to rotate freely therein. Additionally, there is a space between the gripper <b>16</b> and the collar <b>20</b> to permit the shaft to rotate freely until increased pressure is applied to the gripper <b>16</b> to cause the gripper to flex inward into frictional engagement with the collar <b>20</b>, which allows the user to take tension on the stretch film thereby putting into action the film's stretch ability. The gripper <b>16</b> is not in constant contact with the collar <b>20</b> unless sufficient pressure is applied to warrant that contact.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The collar <b>20</b> also keeps the gripper <b>16</b> from sliding off the handle segment <b>22</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> after assembly. The collar <b>20</b> extends out from the shaft <b>12</b> far enough to provide a ledge or backstop that the protrusion <b>39</b> of the gripper <b>16</b> would encounter if trying to slide off the handle segment <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the collar <b>20</b> may be a quarter-quadrant washer <b>20</b>&#x2032;. The rounded lower surface <b>62</b> facing the oncoming gripper <b>16</b> facilitates sliding the narrowed opening <b>44</b> of the gripper <b>16</b> over the collar <b>20</b> and the flat or planar upper surface <b>64</b> prevents the gripper <b>16</b> from sliding off the handle segment <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, includes a circumferentially extending first annular recess <b>18</b>&#x2032; in the handle segment <b>22</b> positioned such that the gripper <b>16</b> slides over the handle segment and receives the first annular recess <b>18</b>&#x2032; inside the gripper. It is appreciated that the first annular recess <b>18</b>&#x2032; may be located at various points along the shaft <b>12</b>, but should be close enough to the core segment <b>26</b> and the roll <b>28</b> to provide the user with adequate control of the dispensing tool, especially for one-hand operation. In one embodiment, the first annular recess <b>18</b>&#x2032; is positioned such that the flange <b>38</b> of the open end <b>60</b> of the gripper <b>16</b> is juxtaposed to the roll <b>28</b> when assembled, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, with enough space between the gripper <b>16</b> and the shaft <b>12</b> to permit the shaft <b>12</b> to rotate freely therein. The first annular recess <b>18</b>&#x2032; may be a depression that is pressed or milled into the core in the shape of a ring. One skilled in the art will appreciate that other methods of making the first annular recess <b>18</b>&#x2032; in shaft <b>12</b> are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">First annular recess <b>18</b>&#x2032; receives collar <b>70</b> seated therein. Collar <b>70</b> acts as a bearing surface or a hub about which shaft <b>12</b> rotates within the gripper <b>16</b> as a user dispenses the stock material from the roll <b>28</b>. Collar <b>70</b> may also act as a backstop that prevents the gripper <b>16</b> from sliding off the handle segment <b>22</b> after assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, collar <b>70</b> includes at least a first collar segment <b>70</b><i>a </i>and a second collar segment <b>70</b><i>b </i>that are mateable with one another to form a collar about shaft <b>12</b>. In particular, the first and second collar segments <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>form a substantially circular ring that seats within first annular recess <b>18</b>&#x2032;. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first and second collar segments <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>both may be semicircular as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In another embodiment, the first and second collar segments <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>may form un-equal portions of the collar.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each collar segment <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>may include at least one member <b>72</b> for mating the segments together to form the collar <b>70</b>. In one embodiment, the collar segments <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>are releasably mated. Releasably mated segments allow the gripper <b>16</b> and collar <b>70</b> to be reusable on another shaft <b>12</b>, for example, once roll <b>28</b> is empty or on a roll of a different stock material. In one embodiment, the first and second collar segments <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>include at least one set of male and female mating members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> to mate their respective ends together with the male mating member <b>74</b> and the female mating member <b>76</b> being opposite one another on different collar segments. In another embodiment, each collar segment <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>may include a plurality of male and female mating members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> at their respective ends. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each collar segment <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>may include one male and one female mating member on one or both end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Alternately, the collar segments <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b</i>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> for collar segment <b>70</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;, may have two female mating members <b>76</b> at one end and two male members <b>74</b> at the other end. The collar segment <b>70</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; is also illustrated as being semi-circular. The members <b>72</b> have been illustrated and described as being male and female mating members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, but the means for mating the collar segments together is not limited thereto. The collar segments <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>may be mated by an adhesive, a weld, a press-fit feature, a latch and/or other types of fasteners. Each collar segment, as shown for segment <b>70</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, has an inner diameter D<sub>I </sub>and an outer diameter D<sub>O</sub>. The collar segments <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b</i>, are preferably of uniform dimensions (i.e., thickness or of uniform inner and outer circumferences) such that the collar segments when assembled provide a uniform inner and outer diameter D<sub>I </sub>and D<sub>O </sub>over the length of the collar.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in another embodiment, the collar <b>70</b> may be formed of a plurality of collar segments <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> hingedly attached to one another at hinge <b>90</b>. The collar segments <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> are mateable at a first end <b>92</b> and a second end <b>94</b> to form collar <b>70</b>, which may be substantially circular. The collar segments <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> may be mateable by one or more combinations of male and female mating members <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, as described above, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Upon assembly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the shaft <b>12</b> receives the collar segments <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>in the first annular recess <b>18</b>&#x2032; to form the collar <b>70</b>. Then, the gripper <b>16</b> is slid over the handle segment <b>22</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> with the open end <b>60</b> of the gripper <b>16</b> passing over the collar <b>70</b> and being juxtaposed to the inner end <b>46</b> of roll <b>28</b>. The outer diameter D<sub>O </sub>of the collar <b>70</b> is larger than the outer diameter D<sub>1 </sub>of the portion of shaft <b>12</b> that is between the first annular recess <b>18</b>&#x2032; and the inner end <b>46</b> of the roll <b>28</b>. The gripper <b>16</b> is positioned such that the circumferential indentation <b>36</b> in the exterior surface of the gripper and its corresponding inwardly extending protrusion <b>39</b> are between the inner end <b>46</b> of the roll <b>28</b> and the collar <b>70</b>. Accordingly, collar <b>70</b> prevents the gripper <b>16</b> from sliding away from the roll <b>28</b> and off of the handle segment <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In use, the stock material is drawn from roll <b>28</b> of one of the dispensing tools disclosed herein. The user manipulates the dispensing tools <b>10</b> or <b>10</b>&#x2032; by wrapping one hand around the outer periphery of the gripper <b>16</b> and dispenses the stock material by placing the leading edge of the film on a surface to be covered or wrapped with the stock material. The user dispenses the desired amount of film by moving the tool <b>10</b> or <b>10</b>&#x2032; along the surface to be covered, causing the roll <b>28</b> to rotate. The shaft <b>12</b>, in particular the handle segment <b>22</b>, rotates freely in the open center <b>34</b> of the gripper <b>16</b> relative to the gripper <b>16</b> itself.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To slow or stop the rotation of the roll <b>28</b>, the user simply increases his grip on the gripper <b>16</b>, thereby increasing the inwardly directed pressure on the gripper <b>16</b> which will bring the gripper <b>16</b> into frictional contact with the shaft <b>12</b>. By slowing the rotational motion of the roll <b>28</b>, the user varies the tension applied to the stock material. Consequently, the user can control the amount of tension applied on the stock material as the film is dispensed simply by varying (i.e., loosening or tightening) their grip on the gripper <b>16</b>. Upon stopping the rotation of the roll <b>28</b>, the user can easily sever the unwound stock material from the roll <b>28</b> by moving the tool <b>10</b> or <b>10</b>&#x2032; away from the unwound stock material that is wrapped around a desired object(s) and causing the stock material to stretch, deform and eventually separate from the roll <b>28</b> or by cutting or tearing the stock material.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The disclosed embodiments have been provided to illustrate the invention. There are a variety of configurations that may be employed to fabricate the dispensing tool <b>10</b>. Therefore, the disclosed embodiment is not intended to limit the scope and spirit of the invention. Consequently, the invention should be limited only by the appended claims.</p>
