<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">As the number of patients suffering from diabetes and similar medical conditions increases, self-monitoring of blood glucose wherein the patient monitors his or her blood glucose levels has become a common practice. The purpose of monitoring the blood glucose level is to determine the concentration level and then to take corrective action, based upon whether the level is too high or too low, to bring the level back within a normal range. The failure to take corrective action can have serious medical implications. Glucose monitoring is a fact of everyday life for diabetic individuals. Failure to test blood glucose levels properly and on a regular basis can result in serious diabetes-related complications, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, nerve damage and blindness.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A number of biosensors, such as glucose meters, are currently available that permit an individual to test the glucose level in a small sample of blood. Many of the meter designs currently available make use of a disposable test element which in combination with the meter measures the amount of glucose in the blood sample electrochemically or optically. In current glucose meters, the information displayed as a consequence of a successful blood glucose measurement is the respective blood glucose value, typically shown in mg/dL or mmol units, and perhaps the time and date the measurement was performed. This information in combination with calculation of planned or known intake of carbohydrates or planned or known activities and knowledge of other situational or individual factors is in most cases sufficient to allow diabetics to adjust or derive their dietary intake and/or an immediate dose of insulin to inject to control blood glucose level on the short-term. Also, in case of low glucose values, diabetics can detect the need for intake of sugar to avoid hypoglycemia.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disposable test elements are typically highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Exposure to humidity in particular can stress a test element to the extent that it is incapable of providing an accurate test. Failsafes and corrections are typically implemented in measurement methods performed by meters corresponding to the particular test element. However, avoiding the adverse environmental conditions altogether is a better way to ensure more accurate test results. In order to avoid such conditions, test elements can be packaged and distributed in containers configured to prevent ingress of moisture from humidity or other sources. In some containers, desiccant material is incorporated somehow within the container, such as in the lid or cap of the container, or an insert that is left in the container with the test elements. However, it is a constant challenge to provide a desiccant material that provides optimum effectiveness. For example, a container having one type of desiccant may be effective during winter months but may not be during summer months, depending on the desiccant material's capacity to absorb and retain environmental moisture. This capacity is itself dependent on several other factors, such as shape, size, and materials.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Given the ramifications of accurate recording, reporting and analyzing of blood glucose measurements, improvements in the containers for packaging and distributing test elements used to meter blood glucose are desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A container includes an internal chamber in communication with one or more desiccants and/or desiccant materials. In one form, the one or more desiccants and/or desiccant materials are arranged such that the surface area of the one or more desiccants and/or desiccant materials in communication with the internal chamber is increased, thereby resulting in greater moisture control within the internal chamber and reducing the likelihood of moisture contamination of any items positioned therein. In one form, wherein test elements for use with a biosensor, such as a blood glucose meter, are positioned in the internal chamber, the reduced likelihood of moisture contamination also reduces the likelihood of error in tests performed with the test elements, as testing accuracy can be adversely affected by moisture contamination of the test elements, among other things.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, a container includes an external housing including a sidewall extending between a first end and a second end, and an internal chamber extending between the first and second ends and surrounded by the sidewall. The container also includes a corrugated desiccant in communication with the internal chamber. The desiccant extends along and lines the sidewall of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one refinement of the aspect, the external housing includes an opening at the first end and a support surface at the second end which encloses the internal chamber at the second end.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another refinement of the aspect, the desiccant comprises a sleeve member removably positionable in the internal chamber and formed of a desiccant material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In still another refinement of the aspect, the sleeve member is sized and shaped to substantially correspond in size and shape to the internal chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another refinement of the aspect, the external housing is resiliently flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another refinement of the aspect, the sidewall includes oppositely positioned first and second portions extending substantially parallel to one another at the first end.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In still another refinement of the aspect, the first and second portions of the sidewall at the first end are releasably engageable with one another to close the internal chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another refinement of the aspect, the container further includes at least one component for use with a biosensor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In yet another refinement of the aspect, the at least one component includes a plurality of test elements.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In still another refinement of the aspect, the test elements include a plurality of test strips.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another refinement of the aspect, the test strips are coupled together in a unitary arrangement wherein the test strips are individually removable from the arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another aspect a container includes an external housing extending between a first end and a second end, and a sidewall surrounding an internal chamber. The container also includes a first desiccant including a corrugated sleeve member removably positioned in the internal chamber and formed of a desiccant material. The corrugated sleeve member extends along a longitudinal axis and is generally sized and shaped to substantially correspond in size and shape to the internal chamber as defined by the sidewall.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one refinement of the aspect, the corrugated sleeve member includes a hollow interior for receiving one or more items stored in the container.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another refinement of the aspect, the corrugated sleeve member includes a plurality of corrugations extending along the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another refinement of the aspect, the container further includes a porous sleeve member positioned in the hollow interior of the corrugated sleeve member.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In yet another refinement of the aspect, the porous sleeve member includes a hollow interior for receiving the one or more items stored in the container.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In still another refinement of the aspect, the porous sleeve member includes a plurality of openings extending through a sidewall surrounding the hollow interior.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another refinement of the aspect, the container further includes a second desiccant positioned between the porous sleeve member and the corrugated sleeve member.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another refinement of the aspect, the desiccant comprises a particulate material.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In order to control and more effectively adjust the therapy, level of activity and lifestyle to achieve optimum glycemic control, diabetics need to measure blood glucose levels on a regular basis. Similarly, diabetics rely on the accuracy of these blood glucose level measurements to properly develop and execute diabetes management plans. Several factors can contribute to inaccuracies and deficiencies in these blood glucose level measurements. For example, contamination of test elements used with a biosensor, such as a blood glucose meter, can lead to false and/or inaccurate blood glucose level measurements. In one particular form, exposure of the test elements to moisture before use with the biosensor can lead to result-affecting contamination. Various embodiments of the present application are related to a desiccant and/or dessicant material for use with a test element container that addresses these and other aspects. In one embodiment, a container includes an internal chamber in communication with one or more desiccants and/or desiccant materials. In one form, the one or more desiccants and/or desiccant materials are arranged such that the surface area of the one or more desiccants and/or desiccant materials in communication with the internal chamber is increased, thereby resulting in greater moisture control within the internal chamber and reducing the likelihood of moisture contamination of any items, such as test elements, positioned therein. As used herein, the term &#x201c;desiccant&#x201d; when used alone generally refers to a drying or moisture control substance or agent, while the term &#x201c;desiccant material&#x201d; generally refers to a material suitable for performing drying and/or moisture control.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring now generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, various aspects of one embodiment of a container <b>10</b> are illustrated. Container <b>10</b> includes an external housing <b>12</b> having at least one longitudinal sidewall <b>14</b> extending along a longitudinal axis L and having a length A between a first end <b>16</b> and a second end <b>18</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, external housing <b>12</b> has a generally cylindrical outer profile and sidewall <b>14</b> circumferentially or laterally surrounds an internal chamber <b>20</b> that extends between first end <b>16</b> and second end <b>18</b>. Similarly, internal chamber <b>20</b> includes a hollow cylindrical shape that generally corresponds to the outer profile of external housing <b>12</b>. It should be appreciated however that in alternative forms one or both of external housing <b>12</b> and internal chamber <b>20</b> could have other shapes, including non-circular shapes and polygonal shapes, such as oval, rectangular, triangular or square configurations, just to provide a few possibilities. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, where like numerals refer to like features described with respect to container <b>10</b>, an external housing <b>12</b><i>a </i>that has a generally oval outer profile and an internal chamber <b>20</b><i>a </i>that has a hollow oval shape generally corresponding to the outer profile of external housing <b>12</b><i>a </i>are illustrated. With reference again to container <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it also includes an opening <b>22</b> extending through first end <b>16</b> of external housing <b>12</b> and providing access to internal chamber <b>20</b>. Opposite opening <b>22</b>, a bottom or support surface <b>24</b> extends between sidewall <b>14</b> and provides support for items positioned in internal chamber <b>20</b>, while also enclosing internal chamber <b>20</b> at second end <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the illustrated embodiment, container <b>10</b> also includes a cap member <b>26</b> coupled to external housing <b>12</b> adjacent first end <b>16</b> via a coupling element <b>28</b>, although in other alternative, non-illustrated forms it is contemplated that cap member <b>26</b> may not be coupled to external housing <b>12</b>, or may be omitted entirely or replaced by an alternative arrangement for closing internal chamber <b>20</b>. Coupling element <b>28</b> is generally flexible and facilitates movement of cap member <b>26</b> relative to external housing <b>12</b>. An annular projection <b>30</b> extends from the bottom side of cap member <b>26</b> and is generally structured to sealingly engage with the internal surface of sidewall <b>14</b> and close internal chamber <b>20</b> at first end <b>16</b>. For example, annular projection <b>30</b> may be provided with a diameter that is the same or substantially similar to an internal dimension, which in the illustrated form is diameter B, of internal chamber <b>20</b>. When projection <b>30</b> is positioned in internal chamber <b>20</b> and engages with sidewall <b>14</b>, an annular flat portion <b>32</b> of cap member <b>26</b> lies against the end of sidewall <b>14</b> at first end <b>16</b> of external housing <b>20</b>. Cap member <b>26</b> also includes a projection <b>34</b> extending laterally beyond flat portion <b>32</b> along one side thereof. When cap member <b>26</b> is engaged with external housing <b>12</b>, projection <b>34</b> extends outwardly from sidewall <b>14</b> thereby allowing a user to engage cap member <b>26</b> and move it away from first end <b>16</b> of external housing <b>12</b> to provide access to internal chamber <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">While not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be appreciated that one or both of sidewall <b>14</b> and projection <b>30</b> could be provided with a sealing member, such as an o-ring, gasket, interlocking members, or other configuration. It should also be appreciated that cap member <b>26</b> may be sized and shaped to correspond with alternative, non-illustrated sizes and shapes of external housing <b>12</b>. Additional variations in the arrangement between cap member <b>26</b> and external housing <b>12</b> are also contemplated. For example, in one non-illustrated form, cap member <b>26</b> can be configured to extend around first end <b>16</b> and along the exterior of sidewall <b>14</b> toward second end <b>18</b>. Cap member <b>26</b> may be configured to engage sidewall <b>14</b> with a threaded, twist lock, bayonet lock, friction fit, or other suitable engagement relationship. In another form, cap member <b>26</b> can include an opening extending therethrough and a closing member cooperating with the opening such that one or more items can be removed from internal chamber <b>20</b> without disengaging cap member <b>26</b> from external housing <b>12</b>. The closing member can be in the form of a plug, valve, or other suitable closeable access device.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Container <b>10</b> also includes a desiccant <b>34</b> in the form of a sleeve member <b>36</b> extending along longitudinal axis L between a first end <b>38</b> and a second end <b>40</b>. In one or more non-illustrated forms however, it is contemplated that container <b>10</b> may also include another desiccant in addition to desiccant <b>34</b>. For example, in one particular form, sidewall <b>14</b> of external housing <b>12</b> could be formed from a desiccant entrained polymer material, although other configurations are contemplated. Sleeve member <b>36</b> includes a hollow interior <b>42</b> that extends between and opens at first and second ends <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>. In one non-illustrated form however, sleeve member <b>36</b> could be provided with a bottom surface that encloses hollow interior <b>42</b> at second end <b>40</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, sleeve member <b>36</b> also includes a length C between first end <b>38</b> and second end <b>40</b> and an external dimension, which in the illustrated form is diameter D, which substantially correspond to length A of external housing <b>12</b> and the internal dimension (diameter B in the illustrated form) of internal chamber <b>20</b>, respectively, such that sleeve member <b>36</b> substantially corresponds in size and shape to internal chamber <b>20</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for example, sleeve member <b>36</b> is removably positionable in internal chamber <b>20</b> such that desiccant <b>34</b> extends along and lines the interior surface of sidewall <b>14</b> between first and second ends <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> of external housing <b>12</b>. When sleeve member <b>36</b> is positioned in internal chamber <b>20</b>, hollow interior <b>42</b> provides a storage chamber for receiving one or more items stored in container <b>10</b>. In one or more non-illustrated forms, it is contemplated that sleeve member <b>36</b> could be secured in internal chamber <b>20</b> by fasteners or adhesives, or could be formed integrally as a monolithic structure with sidewall <b>14</b>. In another form, sleeve member <b>36</b> is configured to achieve a press fit engagement with internal chamber <b>20</b>, further details of which will be provided below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. In still another form, it is contemplated that sleeve member <b>36</b> may be retained in internal chamber <b>20</b> by a retention ring (not shown), although other alternative configurations for retaining sleeve member <b>36</b> in internal chamber <b>20</b> are also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the illustrated embodiment, sleeve member <b>36</b> is corrugated and includes a plurality of corrugations <b>44</b> extending along longitudinal axis L from first end <b>38</b> to second end <b>40</b>. However, alternative arrangements for corrugations <b>44</b> are also contemplated. For example, in one non-illustrated form, corrugations <b>44</b> may extend orthogonally or obliquely relative to longitudinal axis L. In another non-illustrated embodiment, sleeve member <b>36</b> may be provided with corrugations <b>44</b> that extend only partially between first end <b>38</b> and second end <b>40</b>. For example, in one form, sleeve member <b>36</b> may include one or more non-corrugated portions positioned between one or more corrugated portions. Alternatively, sleeve member <b>36</b> may only be corrugated adjacent first end <b>38</b> or second end <b>40</b>, or at intermittent locations along the length of sleeve member <b>36</b>. In other forms, sleeve member length C is substantially less than length A of external housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is contemplated that sleeve member <b>36</b> may be formed by any suitable process. In one non-limiting example, sleeve member <b>36</b> may be formed utilizing extrusion methods and processes. Another non-limiting example is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. More particularly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, opposite end portions <b>37</b><i>a </i>and <b>37</b><i>b </i>of a corrugated sheet <b>37</b> may be rotated toward each other to arrive at the arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> where end portion <b>37</b><i>b </i>is positioned above end portion <b>37</b><i>a</i>. End portions <b>37</b><i>a </i>and <b>37</b><i>b </i>may then be joined together in overlapping fashion by taping, gluing, or crimping, just to name a few possibilities, to form sleeve member <b>36</b>. In an alternative form, it is also contemplated that the ends of end portions <b>37</b><i>a </i>and <b>37</b><i>b </i>could be connected in an abutting fashion to provide sleeve member <b>36</b>. Still, it should be appreciated that sleeve member <b>36</b> could be formed by other manners as well. For example, in one alternative form, it is contemplated that sleeve member <b>36</b> could include an integral structure that is free from any interconnection between opposite ends of a corrugated sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Sleeve member <b>36</b> is generally formed from or includes one or more desiccant materials, non-limiting examples of which may include porous paper, cellulosic fiber, a desiccant entrained polymer, porous plastic, molecular sieves, silica gels, clays, starches, calcium sulfate and/or calcium chloride, just to provide a few non-limiting possibilities. In one form, it is contemplated that the desiccating characteristics of sleeve member <b>36</b> can be adjusted in relation to the moisture control conditions required in internal chamber <b>20</b>. For example, in one form it is contemplated that the desiccant material from which sleeve member <b>36</b> is formed may be chosen to meet the required moisture control conditions of all or one or more parts of internal chamber <b>20</b>. In another form, sleeve member <b>36</b> may include two or more portions that are formed of separate desiccant materials each having unique drying or moisture control characteristics. For example, in one form, sleeve member <b>36</b> may be formed of a first desiccant material adjacent first end <b>38</b> that provides a first level of desiccating and a second desiccant material adjacent second end <b>40</b> which achieves a second level of desiccating that is different from the first level. In another form, it is contemplated that the material forming sleeve member <b>36</b> could include a variable thickness between first end <b>38</b> and second end <b>40</b>. For example, the thickness of the material may taper from first end <b>38</b> to second end <b>40</b>, with sleeve member <b>36</b> providing greater desiccating adjacent first end <b>38</b> compared to the desiccating provided adjacent to second end <b>40</b>. In still another form, it is contemplated that the desiccating characteristics of sleeve member <b>36</b> can be determined by adjusting the amount of desiccant material it includes. In one particular example of this form, sleeve member <b>36</b> may be formed of different amounts of desiccant material along one or more distinct regions to provide corresponding regions of unique desiccating characteristics. However, it should be appreciated that alternative configurations of sleeve member <b>36</b> to achieve unique dryness or moisture control conditions are also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for example, a plurality of test elements <b>46</b> suitable for use with a biosensor is positionable in hollow interior <b>42</b> of sleeve member <b>36</b> when sleeve member <b>36</b> is positioned in internal chamber <b>20</b>. It should be appreciated however that other items, in addition to or in lieu of the plurality of test elements <b>46</b>, may be stored in container <b>10</b>. In the illustrated form, test elements <b>46</b> are provided as electrochemical test strips <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>c </i>which are useable with a blood glucose meter (not shown) to perform a blood glucose measurement utilizing electrochemical techniques. In one alternative, non-illustrated form, test elements <b>46</b> may be provided as test strips used to perform a blood glucose measurement utilizing optical techniques. An example of a test element <b>46</b> configured for use with electrochemical techniques is the ACCU-CHEK&#xae; Aviva test strip, which is described more fully in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0016844, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; and an example of a test element configured for use with optical techniques is the ACCU-CHEK&#xae; Compact test strip, which is described more fully in U.S. Pat. No. 7,008,799, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Each of these exemplary test elements are distributed in the United States by Roche Diagnostics Corporation of Indianapolis, Ind.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further details and examples of conventional blood glucose meters and related electrical and optical components and their respective measurement techniques are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,352,351; 4,999,482; 5,438,271; 6,645,368; 5,997,817; 6,662,439; RE 36,268; 5,463,467; 5,424,035; 6,055,060; 6,906,802; and 5,889,585; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">While not previously described, it should be appreciated that in one or more forms sleeve member <b>36</b> can be compressible to facilitate its positioning in the internal chamber of a plurality of alternatively sized and shaped containers. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, where like numerals refer to like features described with respect to container <b>10</b>, an external housing <b>12</b><i>b </i>includes a generally cylindrical outer profile and an internal chamber <b>20</b><i>b </i>includes a hollow cylindrical shape that generally corresponds to the outer profile of external housing <b>12</b><i>b</i>. It should be appreciated however that in alternative forms one or both of external housing <b>12</b><i>b </i>and internal chamber <b>20</b><i>b </i>could have other shapes, including non-circular shapes and polygonal shapes, such as oval, rectangular, triangular or square shapes, just to provide a few possibilities. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, sleeve member <b>36</b> includes an initial external dimension F which generally corresponds to a cross sectional dimension taken laterally across sleeve member <b>36</b>. Initial external dimension F is larger than the internal dimension, which in the illustrated form is diameter E, of internal chamber <b>20</b><i>b</i>, although it is contemplated that sleeve member <b>36</b> could be used with an internal chamber that is similarly sized or larger than initial external dimension F. To facilitate positioning of sleeve member <b>36</b> into internal chamber <b>20</b><i>b</i>, an external force indicated by directional arrows G may be applied to compress sleeve member <b>36</b>, resulting in reduced external dimension H illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In the illustrated form, it is contemplated that sleeve member <b>36</b> may be compressed to provide reduced external dimension H by being folded or bent along one or more of corrugations <b>44</b>, although alternative configurations for providing sleeve member <b>36</b> in a compressible configuration are contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Reduced external dimension H of sleeve member <b>36</b> is generally at least slightly smaller than diameter F of internal chamber <b>20</b> to allow positioning of sleeve member <b>36</b> therein as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, where sleeve member <b>36</b> has been partially inserted into internal chamber <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Once sleeve member <b>36</b> has been fully positioned in internal chamber <b>20</b><i>b </i>and the external forces (indicated by directional arrows G) have been removed therefrom, it resiliently expands to generally conform in size and shape with internal chamber <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Similarly, an expansion force along and against internal chamber <b>20</b><i>b </i>is created by sleeve member <b>36</b> such that sleeve member <b>36</b> is securely retained in internal chamber <b>20</b><i>b</i>. However, it should be appreciated that sleeve member <b>36</b> may also be retained in internal chamber <b>20</b><i>b </i>by fasteners, adhesives, or a retention ring as discussed above. As would be appreciated by those skilled in the art, when sleeve member <b>36</b> is provided in the compressible configuration described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, it is variably adjustable and thus suitable for use with a variety of alternatively sized and shaped containers.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">An alternative embodiment container <b>110</b> is illustrated in cross section view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, where like numerals refer to like features of container <b>10</b> previously described. Container <b>110</b> is similar to container <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with sleeve member <b>36</b> positioned in internal chamber <b>20</b>, but further includes a porous sleeve member <b>150</b>, which is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Porous sleeve member <b>150</b> includes an elongate body <b>152</b> having a substantially cylindrical external profile, although it should be appreciated that body <b>152</b> may be provided with alternative configurations to correspond with alternative configurations of container <b>110</b>.
