<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/272,496 filed on Sep. 30, 2009, the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the general field of substance analysis, and is particularly concerned with a method and device for measuring optical nonlinear interactions in a sample.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many types of spectroscopies require that a sample to characterize be illuminated with light having two different wavelengths simultaneously. Then, the interaction of the sample with this simultaneous illumination is characterized.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Characterization of optical nonlinearities in substances is of great importance for many applications. For example, in Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS), a substance is illuminated with pulses of laser light having two different wavelengths. Laser light at a first wavelength is pulsed at a first pulse frequency. Laser light at a second wavelength, that interacts with the laser light of first wavelength in the substance to produce the SRS effect, is pulsed at a second pulse frequency, which is typically substantially half the first pulse frequency. The first and second laser lights are synchronized such that at predetermined time intervals, the substance is simultaneously illuminated with the first and second laser lights, and at other time intervals, only one of the first and second laser lights illuminates the substance. This same method is usable to perform Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A disadvantage of this method resides in that when the nonlinear effect is present, in other words when the substance is illuminated with first and second laser lights, the optical power received by the substance is different from the power received when only one of the laser lights is present. Therefore, it is relatively difficult to quantitatively assess the non-linear interactive effects because of these power variations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also, the acquisition of a spectrum requires that the wavelength of one of the first and second laser lights be varied in time. This process is typically relatively slow.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Against this background, there exists a need in the industry to provide an improved mode-locked laser. An object of the present invention is therefore to provide such a device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a broad aspect, the invention provides a spectrometer for characterizing a sample, the spectrometer comprising: a triggering element for generating a series of trigger signals; a first laser operatively coupled to the triggering element for receiving the series of trigger signals and emitting toward the sample a first laser light pulse having a first wavelength in response to receiving each of the trigger signals from the series of trigger signals, the first laser light pulses being each emitted after a corresponding predetermined first laser delay after reception of each of the trigger signals, the first laser being wavelength tunable so that the first wavelength is selectively variable, the predetermined first laser delay being dependent on the first wavelength; a second laser operatively coupled to the triggering element for receiving the series of trigger signals and emitting toward the sample a second laser light pulse having a second wavelength in response to receiving each of the trigger signals from the series of trigger signals, the second laser light pulses being each emitted after a corresponding predetermined second laser delay after reception of each of the trigger signals; a dithering element operable between an active state and an inactive state, wherein, in the active state, the dithering element is operatively coupled to the first and second lasers and to the triggering element for selectively retarding transmission of the trigger signals to at least one of the first and second lasers such that the first and second laser light pulses are received at the sample substantially non-simultaneously, and, in the inactive state, the trigger signals are transmitted to the first and second lasers such that the first and second laser light pulses are received at the sample substantially simultaneously; a delaying element operatively coupled to the first and second lasers and to the triggering element for retarding transmission of the trigger signals to at least one of the first and second lasers in a manner such that the first and second laser light pulses are received at the sample substantially simultaneously when the dithering element is in the inactive state; a light detector for detecting light from the sample produced in response to illumination with the first and second laser light pulses; whereby the delaying element compensates for variations in the first laser delay as a function of the first wavelength to maintain substantially simultaneous illumination of the sample with the first and second laser light pulses with the dithering element in the inactive state, and the dithering element selectively delays the first and second laser light pulses with respect to each other to allow alternatively simultaneous and non-simultaneous illumination of the sample with the first and second laser light pulses, the spectrometer allowing for characterization of the sample both with substantially simultaneous and substantially non-simultaneous illumination with the first and second laser light pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Advantageously, decoupling of the &#x201c;delay&#x201d; function and of the &#x201c;dither&#x201d; function in different elements creates a very flexible spectrometer that is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and relatively easy to use. This decoupling also facilitates precise timing for the reception of the first and second laser light pulses even when the first wavelength is varied rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, in some embodiments of the invention, consecutive trigger signals from the series of trigger signals are separated from each other by a respective inter-signal interval, the first wavelength being a predetermined function of the inter-signal interval. Synchronization of laser light pulse emissions and variations in the first wavelength are thus performed automatically and easily, ensuring good spectrum acquisition.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments of the invention, the first laser includes a pump light source for emitting a pump light; an optical resonator having a configuration, optical properties and dimensions such that a round-trip time of the first laser light in the optical resonator depends on the first wavelength; a gain medium inserted in the optical resonator and optically coupled to the pump light source, the gain medium being responsive to the pump light for converting the pump light to the first laser light; an optical intensity modulator inserted in the optical resonator for absorbing a portion of the first laser light as the first laser light propagates back and forth in the optical resonator, the optical intensity modulator having a light absorption coefficient that is modulated as a function of the trigger signals; and an output port for releasing the first laser light from the optical resonator. When the gain medium is pumped with the pump light, modulating the optical intensity modulator produces the first laser light having the first wavelength, with the first wavelength depending on the inter-signal intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments of the invention, the first laser, second laser and light detector are configured and positioned for performing Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) spectroscopy, Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy (SRS), sum frequency generation spectroscopy or difference frequency generation spectroscopy. However, the reader skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the proposed spectrometer allows for measuring any suitable optical effects in which the first and second laser lights interact in the sample with an interaction term that involves the intensity of the first and second laser lights to any non-zero power.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another broad aspect, the invention provides a method for characterizing a sample using a first laser and a second laser, the first and second lasers emitting respectively first and second laser light pulses at respectively a first and a second laser light wavelength. The method includes generating a series of trigger signals; transmitting each of the trigger signals to the first laser with a respective first delay; emitting toward the sample one of the first laser light pulses with the first laser when each of the trigger signals is received at the first laser; transmitting each of the trigger signals to the second laser with a respective second delay; and emitting toward the sample one of the second laser light pulses with the second laser when each of the trigger signals is received at the second laser. The first and second delays are selected such that for a subset of the trigger signals from the series of trigger signals, the first and second laser light pulses emitted when the trigger signals from the subset of the trigger signals are received at the first and second lasers arrive at the sample substantially simultaneously, and the first and second laser light pulses emitted when the trigger signals other than the trigger signals from the subset of the trigger signals are received at the first and second lasers arrive at the sample substantially non-simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another broad aspect, the invention provides a method for measuring an optical non-linear interaction in a sample, the method using a first laser light having a first wavelength and a first predetermined power and a second laser light having a second wavelength and a second predetermined power. The method includes: illuminating substantially simultaneously the sample with the first and second laser lights to produce an optical response in the sample to simultaneous illumination with the first and second laser lights; measuring the optical response to simultaneous illumination; illuminating the sample with the first laser light only to produce an optical response in the sample to first laser light illumination; measuring the optical response to first laser light illumination; illuminating the sample with the second laser light only to produce an optical response in the sample to second laser light illumination; measuring the optical response to second laser light illumination; adding the optical response to first and second laser light illuminations to obtain an optical response to non-simultaneous illumination; and comparing the optical responses to simultaneous and non-simultaneous illumination to obtain a measure of non-linear effects in the sample; whereby both optical responses to simultaneous and non-simultaneous illuminations are obtained with substantially similar illumination powers.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a spectrometer <b>110</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The spectrometer <b>110</b> is usable for characterizing a sample <b>112</b>. Typically, the spectrometer <b>110</b> measures an optical nonlinear interaction in a sample <b>112</b> between light emitted by the spectrometer <b>110</b> and the matter contained in the sample <b>112</b>. For example, a first laser <b>10</b>, a second laser <b>114</b> and a light detector <b>116</b> are configured and positioned for performing a spectroscopy selected from the group consisting of Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) spectroscopy, Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy (SRS), sum frequency generation spectroscopy and difference frequency generation spectroscopy, among other possibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The physical disposition of the first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b> and of the light detector <b>116</b> relatively to each other and relatively to the sample <b>112</b> depends on the nature of the sample <b>112</b> and on the nature of the interaction between first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> emitted respectively by the first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b> and this sample <b>112</b>. Such physical dispositions are well known in the art will therefore not be described in further details. Also, in a typical spectrometer <b>110</b>, there will be optical components to guide the light emitted by the first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b> and by the sample <b>112</b>. These optical components, for example lenses, mirrors and optical fibers, among other possibilities, have been omitted from the drawings for clarity reasons. The reader skilled in the art will be able to easily select and position such optical components as needed as a function of the disposition and geometry of the spectrometer <b>110</b>. Furthermore, while the present description refers to lasers, in alternative embodiments of the invention, light sources other than lasers are usable to perform spectroscopy as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The spectrometer <b>110</b> includes a triggering element <b>124</b> for generating a series of trigger signals. The first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b> are operatively coupled to the triggering element <b>124</b> for generating light pulses when receiving the trigger signals. A delaying element <b>126</b> and a dithering element <b>128</b> delay transmission of the trigger signals to the first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b> so that the sample can be alternatively illuminated simultaneously and non-simultaneously with the light coming from the first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b>. The spectrometer <b>110</b> is described in further details in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The triggering element <b>124</b> is a component that can generate the trigger signals. The trigger signals are either electrical signals or optical signals, such as, for example, triggering light pulses. The trigger signals may have any suitable shape. In some embodiments of the invention, the trigger signals are square impulsions of predetermined magnitude and duration. Components that can generate suitable trigger signals are well-known in the art and will not be described in further details herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first laser <b>10</b> is operatively coupled to the triggering element <b>124</b> for receiving the series of trigger signals and emitting toward the sample <b>112</b> a first laser light pulse <b>118</b> having a first wavelength in response to receiving each of the trigger signals from the series of trigger signals. For example, the first laser <b>10</b> and the triggering element <b>124</b> are connected to each other by electrically conductive wires that convey the trigger signals in the form of electrical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first laser light pulses <b>118</b> are each emitted after a corresponding predetermined first laser delay after reception of each of the trigger signals. Typically, the first laser <b>10</b> is wavelength tunable so that the first wavelength is selectively variable. Typically, because of the inner structure of the first laser <b>10</b>, the predetermined first laser delay is dependent on the first wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The second laser <b>114</b> is operatively coupled to the triggering element <b>124</b> for receiving the series of trigger signals and emitting toward the sample <b>112</b> a second laser light pulse <b>120</b> having a second wavelength in response to receiving each of the trigger signals from the series of trigger signals. The second laser light pulses <b>120</b> are each emitted after a corresponding predetermined second laser delay after reception of each of the trigger signals. For example, the second laser <b>114</b> and the triggering element <b>124</b> are connected to each other by electrically conductive wires that convey the trigger signals in the form of electrical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments of the invention, the second laser <b>114</b> is a fixed-wavelength laser, for example a Master-Oscillator Power Amplified (MOPA) laser. However, in other embodiments of the invention, the second laser <b>114</b> is any other suitable laser.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The dithering element <b>128</b> is operable between an active state and an inactive state. In the active state, the dithering element <b>128</b> is operatively coupled to the first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b> and to the triggering element <b>124</b> for selectively retarding transmission of the trigger signals to at least one of the first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b> such that the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> are received at the sample <b>112</b> substantially non-simultaneously. In the inactive state, the trigger signals are transmitted to the first and second lasers such that the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> are received at the sample <b>112</b> substantially simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The delaying element <b>126</b> is operatively coupled to the first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b> and to the triggering element <b>124</b> for retarding transmission of the trigger signals to at least one of the first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b> in a manner such that the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> are received at the sample <b>112</b> substantially simultaneously when the dithering element <b>128</b> is in the inactive state.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the trigger signals are electrical impulsions, the dithering and delaying elements <b>128</b> and <b>126</b> are operative for delaying transmission of the electrical impulsions to the first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b>. If the trigger signals are triggering light pulses, the dithering and delaying elements <b>128</b> and <b>126</b> are operative for delaying transmission of the triggering light pulses to the first and second lasers <b>10</b> and <b>114</b>. Suitable electrically conductive wires or optical fibers, among other possibilities, connect the dithering and delaying elements <b>128</b> and <b>126</b> to the other components of the spectrometer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The dithering and delaying elements <b>128</b> and <b>126</b> can be implemented in a single physical component or in disjoint physical components. Typically, the dithering element <b>128</b> and the delaying element <b>126</b> are both provided in series between the triggering element <b>124</b> and the second laser <b>114</b> so that one of the dithering element <b>128</b> and the delaying element <b>126</b> delays the trigger pulses before releasing the trigger pulses to the other one of the dithering element <b>128</b> and the delaying element <b>126</b>, which in turns delays the trigger pulses before releasing them to the second laser <b>114</b>. The dithering and delaying elements <b>128</b> and <b>126</b> can be, for example, implemented in a single or in more than one integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A conventional light detector <b>116</b> is provided for detecting light from the sample <b>112</b> produced in response to illumination with the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The delaying element <b>126</b> compensates for variations in the first laser delay as a function of the first wavelength to maintain substantially simultaneous illumination of the sample <b>112</b> with the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> with the dithering element <b>128</b> in the inactive state. The dithering element <b>128</b> selectively delays the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> with respect to each other to allow alternatively simultaneous and non-simultaneous illumination of the sample <b>112</b> with the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b>. Therefore, the spectrometer allows for characterization of the sample <b>112</b> both with substantially simultaneous and substantially non-simultaneous illumination with the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b>, and therefore characterizes non-linear interactions between the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> in the sample <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Examples of the first laser <b>10</b> are described in further details in the following paragraphs. The embodiments of the invention that incorporate the lasers described hereinbelow benefit from a synergy between the structure of the first laser <b>10</b> and the overall structure of the spectrometer <b>110</b> that create a very efficient, yet relatively low cost, spectrometer. More details about the spectrometer <b>110</b> are given hereinbelow, after description of various embodiments of the first laser <b>10</b>. These details will illustrate how the above-mentioned synergy is created.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown the first laser <b>10</b> in the form of a tunable laser <b>10</b> for selectively emitting laser light <b>12</b> having a first wavelength and a third wavelength. While in some embodiments the tunable laser <b>10</b> is able emit laser light <b>12</b> having two different, discretely spaced apart, wavelengths, it is also within the scope of the invention to have a tunable laser <b>10</b> that is able to emit laser light <b>12</b> having more than two different wavelengths and laser light having a wavelength contained within a substantially continuous spectrum of wavelengths included in a predetermined wavelength interval.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The tunable laser <b>10</b> includes a pump light source <b>14</b> for emitting a pump light (not shown in the drawings). The tunable laser <b>10</b> also includes an optical resonator <b>16</b>. The optical resonator <b>16</b> has a configuration, optical properties and dimensions such that a first round trip time of the laser light <b>12</b> having the first wavelength in the optical resonator <b>16</b> differs from a second round trip time of the laser light <b>12</b> having the third wavelength in the optical resonator <b>16</b>. A gain medium <b>18</b> is inserted in the optical resonator <b>16</b> and is optically coupled to the pump light source <b>14</b>. The gain medium <b>18</b> defines a gain medium first end <b>26</b> and a substantially opposed gain medium second end <b>28</b>. The reader skilled in the art will understand that the terminology &#x201c;gain medium first and second ends <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>&#x201d; does not imply that the gain medium <b>18</b> is necessarily rectilinear. For example, the gain medium may be formed by a rolled optical fiber. The gain medium <b>18</b> is responsive to the pump light for converting the pump light into the laser light <b>12</b>. For example, the tunable laser <b>10</b> includes a pump light input port <b>20</b>, also referred to as a pump coupler, optically coupled to the gain medium <b>18</b> for receiving the pump light and conveying the pump light to the gain medium <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> is inserted in the optical resonator <b>16</b> for selectively absorbing a portion of the laser light <b>12</b> as the laser light <b>12</b> propagates back and forth in the optical resonator <b>16</b>. The optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> has a light absorption coefficient that is modulated with a modulation period. The modulation period is selectively adjustable between a first modulation period value and a second modulation period value. The first and second round trip times are substantially equal to a respective integer multiple of respectively the first and second modulation period values.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The reader skilled in the art will readily appreciate the terminology &#x201c;absorption coefficient&#x201d; used herein does not imply that light is necessarily physically absorbed in the optical intensity modulator. Instead, this terminology only refers to the portion of the light incoming at the optical intensity modulator that is not transmitted to the remainder of the tunable laser. In some embodiments, the light is simply modulated in intensity through interference.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The tunable laser <b>10</b> further also includes an output port <b>24</b> for releasing the laser light <b>12</b> from the optical resonator <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the gain medium <b>18</b> is pumped with the pump light, modulating the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> with the first modulation period value produces laser light having the first wavelength. Also, modulating the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> with the second modulation period value produces laser light having the third wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Indeed, when the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> is modulated, there will be periodic time intervals during which the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> absorbs more light than at subsequent or previous moments. Since the laser light <b>12</b> is preferentially transmitted through the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> at predetermined periodic time intervals, there will be a preference for the tunable laser <b>10</b> to operate with laser light pulses circulating within the optical resonator <b>16</b> in a manner such that these laser light pulses have a round trip time that is equal to the modulation period with which the optical intensity modulator is modulated, or a multiple of this modulation period. The configuration of the optical resonator <b>16</b> will therefore favor laser light pulses within the optical resonator <b>16</b> that have a round trip time corresponding respectively to the first and third wavelengths when the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> is respectively modulated with the first and second modulation period values. The pulse duration of the pulses is governed by many factors, among which are the power provided by the pump light source <b>14</b>, the dispersion in the whole tunable laser <b>10</b> and the exact wave shape of the modulation provided by the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It has been found particularly advantageous in some embodiments to change the modulation period in steps instead of continuously. Indeed, lasers have a tendency to be locked at a predetermined wavelength when operating. Changing the modulation period in a substantially continuous manner from the first to the second modulation period values may then cause instabilities and, in turn, promote difficult mode locking at the third wavelength. By changing the modulation periods in discreet steps, tuning occurs faster using commonly available components.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, modulating the absorption coefficient of the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> with a signal that is the sum of many single-frequency signals helps in modulating the output laser light <b>12</b>. For example, by modulating the absorption coefficient with a signal that is the sum of two sinusoidal signals having frequencies that are close to each other, the laser light <b>12</b> has an output that varies sinusoidally with a frequency that is equal to the beat frequency of the two sinusoidal signals.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the optical resonator <b>16</b> includes a first reflector <b>30</b> and a second reflector <b>32</b>. The first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> are each reflective at about the first and third wavelengths. The first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> are optically coupled to the gain medium <b>18</b> respectively through the gain medium first and second ends <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. It should be noted that, in some embodiments, other optical components are present between either of the reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> and the gain medium <b>18</b>. Therefore, the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> need not be directly physically coupled to the gain medium <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The first reflector <b>30</b> includes a first reflector first portion <b>34</b> and a first reflector second portion <b>36</b> for reflecting respectively the laser light <b>12</b> having the first and third wavelengths. The first reflector first and second portions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are respectively spaced apart from the gain medium first end <b>26</b> by a first reflector first portion-to-gain medium distance and a first reflector second portion-to-gain medium distance. The first reflector first portion-to-gain medium distance is smaller than the first reflector second portion-to-gain medium distance. Therefore, the first reflector first portion <b>34</b> must be transmitting the third wavelength so that laser light having the third wavelength can reach the first reflector second portion <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Similarly, the second reflector <b>32</b> includes a second reflector first portion <b>38</b> and a second reflector second portion <b>40</b> for reflecting respectively the laser light <b>12</b> having the first and third wavelengths. The second reflector first and second portions <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> are respectively spaced apart from the gain medium second end <b>28</b> by a second reflector first portion-to-gain medium distance and a second reflector second portion-to-gain medium distance. The second reflector first portion-to-gain medium distance is smaller than the second reflector second portion-to-gain medium distance. Therefore, the second reflector first portion <b>38</b> must be transmitting the third wavelength so that laser light having the third wavelength can reach the second reflector second portion <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first and second reflector first portions <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> are thus distanced from each other by a smaller distance than the first and second reflector second portions <b>36</b> and <b>40</b>. This will cause the laser light <b>12</b> having the first wavelength to have a smaller first round trip time between the first and second reflector first portions <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> than the round trip time of the laser light <b>12</b> having the third wavelength between the first and second reflector second portions <b>36</b> and <b>40</b>. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> each include a respective fiber Bragg grating. For example, the first reflector first and second portions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> include respectively a first and a second fiber Bragg grating segment. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the first reflector first and second portions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> each include a respective chirped fiber Bragg grating segment, which may be formed by having a single chirped fiber Bragg grating that defines both the first reflector first and second portions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. In some specific embodiment of this latter construction, a tunable laser <b>10</b> having continuous wavelength selection is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the first wavelength is larger than the third wavelength and the chirped fiber Bragg gratings included in the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> also provides dispersion compensation. However, in alternative embodiments of the invention, the first wavelength is smaller than the third wavelength, which may be useful in embodiments in which other components of the proposed tunable laser <b>10</b> have anomalous dispersion properties.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the first reflector <b>30</b> includes a relatively highly reflective chirped fiber Bragg grating. In these embodiments, substantially all the light incoming at the first reflector <b>30</b> is reflected back towards the gain medium <b>18</b>. The second reflector <b>32</b> is an output chirped fiber Bragg grating and is not perfectly reflective so that some of the laser light <b>12</b> can be transmitted through the second reflector <b>32</b>, which therefore provides the output port <b>24</b>. Other manners of outputting the laser light <b>12</b> from the tunable laser <b>10</b> are within the scope of the invention and some of them are described in further details hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the gain medium <b>18</b> has a first gain at the first wavelength and a second gain at the third wavelength. The first and second gains differ from each other. In these embodiments, to facilitate the production of laser light <b>12</b> having substantially similar powers at the two wavelengths, the first and second fiber Bragg grating segments included in the first reflector first and second portions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> have respectively a first segment reflectivity and a second segment reflectivity. The first and second segment reflectivities are such that the tunable laser <b>10</b> has substantially constant gain at the first and third wavelengths. Therefore, it is possible to select the reflectivity of the first reflector first and second portions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> so that the reflection of the laser light <b>12</b> at these first reflector first and second portions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> compensates for the non-flat gain curve of the gain medium <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, one or both the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> are each made from a chirped fiber Bragg grating defining a variable group delay therealong. Therefore, the fiber Bragg grating segments included in different portions along the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> have different group delay characteristics, which affects the duration of laser light pulses produced using the tunable laser <b>10</b>. Also, pulse characteristics other than the duration of the laser light pulses can be modified by selecting suitable group delays for fiber Bragg grating segments included in the first reflector first and second portions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In yet other embodiments of the invention, the position of the second reflector first and second portions <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> is reversed with respect to the gain medium <b>18</b> while the first reflector first and second portions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> remain in the same position. In these embodiments, wavelength selection of the laser light <b>12</b> is permitted by spacing apart the second reflector first and second portions <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> from each other by a greater distance than the distance by which the first reflector first and second portions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are spaced apart from each other. When chirped fiber Bragg gratings are used in the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, different group delay slopes are produced, and the laser operates with a group velocity dispersion that is the difference between the two group delay slopes. A mix between a soliton laser and a normal dispersion laser is thus formed that reduces or eliminates Kelly's side bands.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the gain medium <b>18</b> includes a doped gain fiber. Such doped gain fibers are well known in the art and will therefore not be described in further details. It is also within the scope of the invention to manufacture tunable lasers <b>10</b> using any other suitable gain medium <b>18</b>. Also, the pump light source <b>14</b> is any suitable pump light source <b>14</b> that can emit pump light that allows the gain medium <b>18</b> to produce the laser light <b>12</b> having both the first and third wavelengths. For example, the pump light source <b>14</b> includes a light emitting diode.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The pump light input port <b>20</b> is also any suitable pump light input port <b>20</b>. For example, the pump light input port <b>20</b> includes a wave division multiplexer (WDM) that allows light having the first and third wavelengths to be freely transmitted, or substantially freely transmitted therethrough but which, through optical isolators or any other suitable means, substantially prevents light, and especially the laser light <b>12</b>, from being transmitted back towards the pump light source <b>14</b>. The WDM also allows for receiving pump light emitted by the pump light source <b>14</b> and transmitting this pump light into the optical resonator <b>16</b> and, more specifically, into the gain medium <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> is any suitable component allowing variations in the transmission of the laser light <b>12</b> having the first and third wavelengths therethrough. Typically, the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> takes the form of a component that is optically coupled to and inserted between the chirped fiber Bragg grating forming the first reflector <b>30</b> and the WDM multiplexer forming the pump light input port <b>20</b>. However, any other physical configurations of the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> are within the scope of the invention. In some embodiments, the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> includes an electro-optic modulator.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> is a component that allows the laser light <b>12</b> to pass therethrough with two different absorption levels. For example, one level allows substantially all the light incoming at the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> to pass therethrough. At a second level, a predetermined fraction of the light incoming at the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> is not transmitted. In these embodiments, periodically changing the absorption coefficient of the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> between the first level and the second level preferentially selects a laser light pulse that travels through the optical resonator <b>16</b> as described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The reader skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> need not absorb all or a large fraction of the light circulating within the tunable laser <b>10</b> for the mode locking effect provided by the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> to be provided. Indeed, only relatively small variations in the absorption coefficient are sufficient in some embodiments to produce the desired effect.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> includes a variable attenuation modulator. In opposition to the previously described optical intensity modulator, the variable attenuation modulator allows for a substantially continuous variation in the absorption coefficient of the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> over a predetermined absorption range. In this embodiment, the power of the laser light <b>12</b> may therefore be regulated using the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b>, in addition to being regulated using the power of the pump light source <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in some embodiments, the tunable laser <b>10</b> includes a controller <b>42</b> for controlling the modulation period of the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b>. Typically, fiber Bragg gratings, such as the fiber Bragg gratings usable in the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, do not have ideal, theoretically predictable, reflection spectra at different locations therealong due to manufacturing defects. However, once a fiber Bragg grating has been characterized, it is possible to map the distance from one end of the fiber Bragg grating to each location therealong and to associate with each of these locations a specific wavelength that is reflected. Therefore, by characterizing the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> in this manner, the controller <b>42</b> can be programmed to select precisely the wavelength at which the laser light <b>12</b> will be emitted for a specific tunable laser <b>10</b> as the modulation period can then be selected to achieve this wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, the controller <b>42</b> uses the time interval between successive trigger signals to adjust the wavelength of the first laser light pulses <b>118</b>. In other examples, the controller <b>42</b> is controlled manually or using an external control signal to make changes in the wavelength of the first laser light pulses <b>118</b>. In yet other examples of implementation, the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> is operatively coupled to the triggering element <b>124</b> for receiving the trigger signals, for example through electrically conductive wires or optical fibers. The optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> then absorbs less light for a light transmission duration when the trigger signals are received at the optical intensity modulator than between said trigger signals. Typically, in these implementations, the controller <b>42</b> is either absent or serves to drive the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> using trigger signals that are not powerful enough to do so, or that are not directly suitable for this purpose because of type (for example electrical vs. optical), intensity, voltage, current or other limitations. In these embodiments, the trigger signals each have a respective trigger signal duration, the light transmission duration being typically substantially equal to the trigger signal duration.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Also, the group delay characteristics of chirped fiber Bragg gratings are not perfect. Imperfections create a group delay ripple which may cause unwanted effects in the pulsed laser light <b>12</b>. A ratio between the group delay ripple and the group delay as a function of frequency is herein referred to as the ratio spectrum. The pulses of laser light <b>12</b> produced by the tunable laser <b>10</b> have a pulse spectrum. It is preferable to manufacture the chirped Bragg gratings with sufficient precision that the ratio spectrum is substantially disjoint from the pulse spectrum. In other words, regions of the ratio spectrum in which there is a significant power should be separate from regions of pulse spectrum at which there is a significant power.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an alternative tunable laser <b>10</b>A usable as the first laser <b>10</b> in the spectrometer <b>110</b>. The tunable laser <b>10</b>A has many components that are substantially similar to those of the tunable laser <b>10</b>. These components will therefore not be described in further details.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tunable laser <b>10</b>A differs from the tunable laser <b>10</b> in that it includes two pump light sources <b>14</b>, each coupled to the gain medium <b>18</b> through a respective pump light input port <b>20</b>. Also, it is within the scope of the invention to have more than two pump light sources <b>14</b>. In addition, a tap <b>44</b> is provided, for example at an end of the first reflector <b>30</b> opposed to the gain medium <b>18</b>, so that a photodiode <b>46</b>, or any other suitable light intensity measurement device, can be used to measure the taped light and feed this light intensity to the controller <b>42</b>. The controller <b>42</b> is therefore connected to the photodiode <b>46</b> so that light intensity measurements can be transmitted by the photodiode <b>46</b> to the controller <b>42</b>. The controller <b>42</b> is also operatively coupled to the pump light source <b>14</b> for controlling the intensity of the pump light. The controller <b>42</b> is then used in a feedback loop to control the power provided by the pump light sources <b>14</b> in response to light intensity measurements to obtain a predetermined power for the laser light <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates yet another tunable laser <b>10</b>B usable as the first laser <b>10</b> in the spectrometer <b>110</b>. The tunable laser <b>10</b>B is similar also to the tunable laser <b>10</b>. A difference that occurs in the tunable laser <b>10</b>B is that an alternative first reflector <b>30</b>B is used. The alternative first reflector <b>30</b>B is such that the first reflector <b>30</b>B reflects the laser light <b>12</b> having both the first and third wavelengths at substantially similar first reflector-to-gain medium distances from the gain medium first end <b>26</b>. For example, this is achieved by using a mirror instead of a fiber Bragg grating in the first reflector <b>30</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates yet another tunable laser <b>10</b>C usable as the first laser <b>10</b> in the spectrometer <b>110</b>, in which the optical resonator <b>16</b>, the gain medium <b>18</b> and optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> are all polarization maintaining, as illustrated by the dashed representation of these components. Therefore, the tunable laser <b>10</b>C is able to produce polarized laser light <b>12</b>. To select the polarization, a polarizer <b>47</b> is inserted in the optical resonator <b>16</b>C for polarizing the laser light <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates yet another tunable laser <b>10</b>D usable as the first laser <b>10</b> in the spectrometer <b>110</b>. The tunable laser <b>10</b>D uses only a single reflector <b>30</b> instead of the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>. The resonance in the optical resonator <b>16</b>D is provided by using an optical circulator <b>48</b>. The optical circulator <b>48</b> includes a circulator first port <b>50</b>, a circulator second port <b>52</b> and a circulator third port <b>54</b>. The optical circulator <b>48</b> is configured in a manner such that the laser light incoming at the circulator first port <b>50</b> is emitted at the circulator second port <b>52</b>, laser light incoming at the circulator second port <b>52</b> is emitted at the circulator third port <b>54</b> and laser light incoming at the circulator third port <b>54</b> is emitted at the circulator first port <b>50</b>. The circulator first port <b>50</b> is optically coupled to the gain medium <b>18</b> through the gain medium first end <b>26</b> with the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> inserted between the gain medium first end <b>26</b> and the circulator first port <b>50</b>. The circulator second port <b>52</b> is optically coupled to the reflector <b>30</b> and the circulator third port <b>54</b> is optically coupled to the gain medium <b>18</b> through the gain medium second end <b>28</b> with the pump light input port <b>20</b> inserted between the gain medium second end <b>28</b> and the circulator third port <b>54</b>. The reflector <b>30</b> is a reflector similar to the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> and has a structure and a function substantially similar to that of the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>. In this embodiment, the reflector <b>30</b> allows for the emission of the laser light <b>12</b> by the laser <b>10</b>D by letting a portion of the laser light <b>12</b> to be transmitted through the reflector <b>30</b>. In this embodiment of the invention, a unidirectional loop is created, which reduces losses in the tunable laser <b>10</b>D caused by the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In yet another embodiment of the invention, a tunable laser <b>10</b>E shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is provided as the first laser <b>10</b> in the spectrometer <b>110</b>. The tunable laser <b>10</b>E includes an alternative output port <b>24</b>E inserted between the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> and the circulator first port <b>50</b>. The tunable laser <b>10</b>E has a configuration substantially similar to the configuration of the tunable laser <b>10</b>D, with the exception that the reflector <b>30</b> is highly reflective and, therefore, does not allow for laser light <b>12</b> to be transmitted therethrough. Instead, an output port <b>24</b>E in the form of a fiber coupler or, in other words, a tap, is provided for tapping into the tunable laser <b>10</b>E and therefore releasing the tunable laser light <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates yet another geometry for a tunable laser <b>10</b>F, usable as the first laser <b>10</b> in the spectrometer <b>110</b>, in which the second reflector <b>32</b>F includes an optical circulator <b>48</b> for receiving the laser light <b>12</b> from the gain medium <b>18</b> and returning the laser light <b>12</b> back to the gain medium <b>18</b>. In this embodiment, the circulator first port <b>50</b> is optically coupled to the circulator third port <b>54</b> with an optical switch <b>51</b> and the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> inserted therebetween. The circulator second port <b>52</b> is optically coupled to the first reflector <b>30</b> with the gain medium <b>18</b> and the pump light input port <b>20</b> inserted therebetween. Advantageously, various optical components can be inserted in the loop formed between the circulator first and third ports <b>50</b> and <b>54</b> to allow emission of the laser light <b>12</b>, modulation of the intensity of the laser light <b>12</b> and any other conditioning or characterization of the laser light <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The optical switch <b>51</b> defines the output port <b>24</b>F and is usable for selectively releasing the laser light <b>12</b> from the optical resonator <b>16</b>F and confining the laser light <b>12</b> in the optical resonator <b>16</b>F. More specifically, in one state of the optical switch <b>51</b>, all the light incoming at the switch <b>51</b> is fed back into the optical resonator <b>16</b>F. This allows for build up of laser light power inside the optical resonator <b>16</b>F. When a pulse is to be let out of the optical resonator <b>16</b>F, the switch <b>51</b> is switched to the other state in which a part or all of the light incoming at the switch <b>51</b> is output at another port that forms the output port <b>24</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the above-described tunable lasers <b>10</b> to <b>10</b>F, using suitable components allows for variations in the duration of the laser light pulses by varying the intensity of these laser light pulses. In turn, this intensity is adjustable by varying many controllable variables, such as the duration and time evolution profile of the optical intensity modulation provided by the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> and the power provided by the pump light source <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the first reflector <b>30</b>, the second reflector <b>32</b> or both the first and second reflectors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> have an adjustable dispersion, which is then also usable to change the laser light pulses shape and duration. It should be noted that the variations in the pulse duration is achievable without changing the pulse repetition frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">While some embodiments of a tunable laser have been described hereinabove, it is within the scope of the invention to have many other variants. Also, it is within the scope of the invention to use many concepts associated with lasers to operate the proposed tunable lasers in different operation ranges. For example, the proposed laser may be Q switched and, as described hereinabove in a specific embodiment, cavity dumping may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments of the invention, the trigger signals are used to drive the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> so that when the trigger signals are received, the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> let light circulate in the first laser <b>10</b> substantially freely, and so that otherwise, the optical intensity modulator <b>22</b> is less transparent to light in the first laser <b>10</b>. In these embodiments, the first wavelength is selected by spacing the trigger signals by different delays.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">More specifically, consecutive trigger signals from the series of trigger signals are separated from each other by a respective inter-signal interval. The first wavelength is a predetermined function of the inter-signal interval as the inter-signal interval determines the length of the optical resonator <b>16</b> selected, and therefore the value of the first wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In an example, the inter-signal intervals are substantially identical to each other. In other words, the trigger signals are periodic. This creates a series of first laser light pulses <b>118</b> having the same first wavelength. In another example, wherein the inter-signal intervals differ from each other within the series of trigger signals. This creates a series of first laser light pulses <b>118</b> having varying first wavelength. In this latter case, it is possible to scan a predetermined wavelength interval with the first laser light pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The delay provided by the delaying element <b>126</b> can be selected as a function of the first wavelength in any suitable manner, for example using a look up table, a computer model of the first laser or a curve-fitted function, among other possibilities. The delay can be selected once the behavior of the first laser <b>10</b> when the first wavelength is varied is known, either theoretically or experimentally. Once the laser <b>10</b> is characterized, computation of measurement of suitable delays is made using methods that are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments of the invention, the dithering element <b>128</b> is operatively coupled to the triggering element <b>124</b> for oscillating between the active and inactive states when each of the trigger signals from the series of trigger signals is released by the triggering element <b>124</b>. In other words, the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> are alternatively simultaneously and non-simultaneously arriving at the sample <b>112</b>. This variant is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in which schematic intensity vs time diagrams are provided substantially adjacent to the reference numerals <b>118</b> (for the first laser light pulses <b>118</b>), <b>120</b> (for the second laser light pulses <b>120</b>) and <b>122</b> (for the light detected by the light detector <b>116</b>). In this latter diagram, the presence of non-linear interaction between the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> is indicated by full lines and the absence of such non-linear interaction is indicated by dotted lines.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">This embodiment can be achieved, for example, by having a dithering element <b>128</b> that switches between the active and inactive states each time a triggering signal is received at the dithering element <b>128</b>. In other embodiments, the dithering element <b>128</b> includes a component that delays the triggering signals only when activated, the activation being controlled by a signal that includes half of the trigger signals. There are many other possibilities for achieving this result.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Typically, the first laser light pulses <b>118</b> all have substantially similar powers and duration. Typically, the second laser light pulses <b>120</b> also all have substantially similar powers and duration. However, this is not necessarily the case in all embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">More generally, the spectrometer <b>110</b> is usable to perform a method <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The method starts at step <b>205</b>. At step <b>210</b>, one each of the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> are used to substantially simultaneously illuminate the sample <b>112</b>, which produces in the sample <b>112</b> an optical response to simultaneous illumination from the first and second laser lights pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b>. Then, at step <b>115</b>, the light detector <b>116</b> is used to measure the optical response of the sample <b>112</b> to simultaneous illumination with the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b>. Although step <b>215</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> as being performed after at step <b>210</b>, it is to be understood that in some embodiments of the invention, these two steps are performed substantially simultaneously, as is the case if the decay time constant of the effect produced in the sample <b>112</b> is commensurate in duration with the duration of the first and second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b>. However, in the opposite case, detection using the detector <b>116</b> may be performed once the illumination at step <b>210</b> has ceased.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Afterwards, at step <b>220</b>, the sample <b>112</b> is illuminated with one of the first laser light pulses <b>118</b> only to produce an optical response to the first laser light illumination. The optical response the first laser light illumination is then measured at step <b>225</b> using the light detector <b>116</b>. Subsequently, at step <b>230</b>, the sample <b>112</b> is illuminated with one of the second laser light pulses <b>120</b> only to produce an optical response to the second laser light illumination. The optical response to the second laser light illumination is then measured at step <b>235</b> using the light detector <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Finally, at step <b>240</b>, the optical response to simultaneous and non simultaneous illumination are compared to gain a measure of nonlinear effects in the sample <b>112</b>. For example, this is performed by comparing the addition of the optical response to first and second laser light illuminations, which provides the optical response to non-simultaneous illumination, with the optical response to simultaneous illumination. The method then ends at step <b>245</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The method <b>200</b> can be also described as a method for characterizing the sample <b>112</b> using the first laser <b>10</b> and a second laser <b>114</b>. Using the specific language relating the description of the spectrometer <b>110</b>, the method can be summarized as: generating a series of trigger signals; transmitting each of the trigger signals to the first laser <b>10</b> with a respective first delay; emitting toward the sample <b>112</b> one of the first laser light pulses <b>118</b> with the first laser <b>10</b> when each of the trigger signals is received at the first laser <b>10</b>; transmitting each of the trigger signals to the second laser <b>114</b> with a respective second delay and emitting toward the sample <b>112</b> one of the second laser light pulses <b>120</b> with the second laser <b>114</b> when each of the trigger signals is received at the second laser <b>114</b>. The first and second delays are selected such that for a subset of the trigger signals from the series of trigger signals, the first and second laser light pulses emitted when the trigger signals from the subset of the trigger signals are received at the first and second lasers arrive at the sample substantially simultaneously, and the first and second laser light pulses emitted when the trigger signals other than the trigger signals from the subset of the trigger signals are received at the first and second lasers arrive at the sample substantially non-simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an alternative spectrometer <b>110</b>&#x2032; is illustrated. The spectrometer <b>110</b>&#x2032; is substantially similar to the spectrometer <b>110</b>, except that the triggering element <b>124</b> also provides the triggering signals to the light detector <b>116</b>. In these embodiments, the light detector <b>116</b> may use the trigger signals to synchronize optical detection with the presence of the first and/or second laser light pulses <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> in the sample <b>112</b>. In other words, detection of light is gated by having the light detector <b>116</b> operatively coupled to the triggering element <b>124</b> for receiving the trigger signals and detecting the light from the sample <b>112</b> produced in response to illumination with the first and second laser light pulses (<b>118</b> and <b>120</b>) for only predetermined time intervals relative to the reception of the trigger signals by the light detector <b>116</b>. The predetermined time intervals are such that it is expected that during these time intervals, light will be emitted by the sample <b>112</b>. Also, although not illustrated in the drawings, in some embodiments of the invention, the output of the dithering element <b>128</b> is also, or instead, provided to the light detector <b>116</b> for the same purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The spectrometer <b>110</b>&#x2032; also includes an optical amplifier <b>130</b> inserted between the first laser <b>10</b> and the sample <b>112</b> for amplifying the first laser light pulses <b>118</b>. In some embodiments of the spectrometer <b>110</b>&#x2032;, the optical amplifier <b>130</b> is not provided. Conversely, in some embodiments of the invention, the optical amplifier <b>130</b> is provided in the spectrometer <b>110</b>.</p>
