<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and method for manufacturing the same wherein a semiconductor laser is mounted on a submount via a solder in a junction-down manner, and in particular to a semiconductor device and method for manufacturing the same capable of securing higher dissipation characteristics and improving the yield.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A semiconductor laser is mounted on a submount via a solder in a junction-up manner or a junction-down manner. When the chip width is shrunk for cost saving, the space for wire bonding avoiding contact with the light-emitting stripes is lost if the junction-up manner is used. Therefore, the junction-down manner is generally used (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-110203). In addition, since the junction-down manner has favorable heat dissipation characteristics, the properties of the chip at high power and/or high temperature can be improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to compressing for mounting, the solder spreads outward and runs out to the side of the chip, and builds up along the side surface of the chip. When the junction-up manner is used, since the p-n junction of the semiconductor laser is remote from the mounting surface, the p-n junction is not short-circuited with the solder. However, when the junction-down manner is used, a problem wherein the p-n junction is short-circuited with the solder to lower the yield is caused.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In GaN-based semiconductor lasers, since the crystal growing speed is low, and for reducing the heat damage to the active layer, the total thickness of the upper clad layer on the active layer and the contact layer is generally less than 1 &#x3bc;m. This thickness is thinner than the total thickness of the GaAs-based semiconductor laser and the like of 3 to 5 &#x3bc;m. Therefore, since the distance from the mounting surface to the p-n junction is short in the case of the GaN-based semiconductor laser, the above-described problem is particularly significant.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, it is considered to surround the electrode with an insulating film between the submount and the semiconductor laser so as to prevent the solder to wrap around the side surface of the semiconductor laser. However, since the heat dissipation of the insulating film is low, heat generated in the light-emitting region of the semiconductor laser cannot be sufficiently dissipated into the submount.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above-described problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device and method for manufacturing the same capable of securing higher dissipation characteristics and improving the yield.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, a semiconductor device comprises: a submount; a semiconductor laser mounted on the submount via a solder in a junction-down manner and including a semiconductor substrate, a semiconductor laminated structure containing a p-n junction on the semiconductor substrate, and an electrode on the semiconductor laminated structure and joined to the submount via the solder; and a high-melting-point metal film or a high-melting-point dielectric film placed between the submount and the semiconductor laminated structure and surrounding the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention makes it possible to secure higher dissipation characteristics and improve the yield.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other and further objects, features and advantages of the invention will appear more fully from the following description.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A semiconductor device according to the embodiments of the present invention will be described referring to the drawings. The same components will be denoted by the same symbols, and the repeated descriptions may be omitted.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view showing a semiconductor laser <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment. A semiconductor laminated structure <b>3</b> containing a p-n junction is formed on an n-type GaN substrate <b>2</b> (semiconductor substrate). The semiconductor laminated structure <b>3</b> has an n-type Al.GaN clad layer <b>4</b>, an InGaN active layer <b>5</b>, a p-type AlGaN clad layer <b>6</b>, and a p-type GaN contact layer <b>7</b> sequentially laminated from the n-type GaN substrate <b>2</b> side. An electrode <b>8</b> is formed on the upper surface of the p-type GaN contact layer <b>7</b>, and an electrode <b>9</b> is formed on the lower surface of the n-type GaN substrate <b>2</b>. Gold (Au) is contained in the electrodes <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b> is placed so as to surround the electrode <b>8</b>. The high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b> is composed of platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), nickel chromium alloy (NiCr), tungsten (W), titanium (T), tungsten-titanium (TiW), molybdenum (Mo), tantalum (Ta), or niobium (Nb). In place of the high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b>, a high-melting-point dielectric film composed of an oxide or nitride film of the material of the above-described high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view showing a semiconductor device according to the first embodiment. The semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is mounted on the submount <b>12</b> via a solder <b>11</b> in a junction-down manner. The electrode <b>8</b> of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is joined to the submount <b>12</b> via the solder <b>11</b>. The solder <b>11</b> is composed of a material that forms Au&#x2014;Sn-based, Sn&#x2014;Ag-based, Sn&#x2014;Ag&#x2014;Cu-based, Sn&#x2014;Zn-based, Sn&#x2014;Bi-based, Pb&#x2014;Sn-based, Au&#x2014;Si-based, and Au&#x2014;Ge-based alloys.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described above, in the present embodiment, the high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b> or the high-melting-point dielectric film is placed so as to surround the electrode <b>8</b> between the submount <b>12</b> and the semiconductor laminated structure <b>3</b>. Since the solder <b>11</b> is prevented from wrapping around the side surface of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> to cause the short-circuiting of the p-n junction by the high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b> or the high-melting-point dielectric film, the yield can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, the high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b> and the high-melting-point dielectric film have about 10 times higher thermal conductivity than the insulating film. The thermal conductivity of high-melting-point metals is 50 to 200 W/m&#xb7;K, whereas the thermal conductivity of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and SiN, which are materials for general insulating films, is 10 W/m&#xb7;K or lower and 20 W/m&#xb7;K or lower, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Heat generated in the light-emitting region <b>13</b> of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is dissipated into the submount <b>12</b> via the electrode <b>8</b>, the high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b>, and the solder <b>11</b>. When the electrode <b>8</b> is surrounded by the high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b> or the high-melting-point dielectric film according to the present embodiment, higher dissipation characteristics can be secured comparing to the case wherein the electrode <b>8</b> is surrounded by the insulating film. This is particularly advantageous in semiconductor lasers wherein several hundreds of milliwatts or more high power is required, or semiconductor lasers whose operation current and voltage are high.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Second Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view showing a semiconductor device according to the second embodiment. In a semiconductor laminated structure <b>3</b>, a channel <b>14</b> is formed so as to surround the electrode <b>8</b>. The inside of the channel <b>14</b> is coated with a high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b> or a high-melting-point dielectric film. However, the high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b> is not ohmically joined to the semiconductor laminated structure <b>3</b>. Other configurations are identical to the configurations of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">During mounting, an excessive solder <b>11</b> can be flowed into the channel <b>14</b>. Therefore, since the solder <b>11</b> is prevented from wrapping around the side surface of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> to cause the short-circuiting by the p-n junction, the yield can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The width of the channel <b>14</b> is 30 &#x3bc;m or smaller, preferably, 5 to 20 &#x3bc;m. The depth of the channel <b>14</b> is about 1 to 10 &#x3bc;m deeper than the depth of p-n junction. Thereby, the volume of the channel <b>14</b> where excessive solder <b>11</b> flows in can be enlarged.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The location of the channel <b>14</b> is 5 to 30 &#x3bc;m inside, preferably 5 to 20 &#x3bc;m from the end of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b>. By thus making the channel <b>14</b> close to the end of the chip, the bonding width can be increased and adhesion strength can be secured even when the width of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is shrunk to 150 &#x3bc;m or less, for example, nearly 100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Third Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view showing a semiconductor device according to the third embodiment. In place of the high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b> in the first embodiment, a metal pad <b>15</b> is placed between the submount <b>12</b> and the semiconductor laminated structure <b>3</b> so as to surround the electrode <b>8</b>. The metal pad <b>15</b> contains gold (Au). The solder <b>11</b> is an Au&#x2014;Sn solder composed of 80% by weight of Au and 20% by weight of Sn. The melting point of the solder <b>11</b> is 280&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view for illustrating a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the third embodiment. First, a semiconductor laser <b>1</b> containing a p-n junction is prepared. A metal pad <b>15</b> is formed on the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> so as to surround the electrode <b>8</b> of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b>. A solder <b>11</b> is formed on the submount <b>12</b>. Thereafter, the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is mounted on the submount <b>12</b> by the junction-down manner via the solder <b>11</b>. The mounting temperature when the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is mounted on the submount <b>12</b> is about 300 to 350&#xb0; C. This mounting temperature is higher than the melting point of the solder <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">During this mounting, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, Au, which is a component material of the electrode <b>8</b> is diffused into the solder <b>11</b> to form a first alloy layer <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an Au&#x2014;Sn binary phase diagram. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the larger the Au contents, the higher the melting point of the Au&#x2014;Sn. Therefore, the melting point of the first alloy layer <b>16</b> is higher than the melting point of the solder <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the first alloy layer <b>16</b> reaches the metal pad <b>15</b>, Au, which is a component material of the metal pad <b>15</b>, diffuses into the first alloy layer <b>16</b>, and the second alloy layer <b>17</b> is formed. The second alloy layer <b>17</b> is composed of, for example, 85% by weight of Au and 15% by weight of Sn. The melting point of the second alloy layer <b>17</b> elevates to about 400&#xb0; C. Therefore, since the melting point of the second alloy layer <b>17</b> is higher than the mounting temperature (about 300 to 350&#xb0; C.), when the solder <b>11</b> reaches the metal pad <b>15</b> and becomes the second alloy layer <b>17</b>, the fusion of the solder <b>11</b> is stopped. Therefore, since the solder <b>11</b> is prevented from wrapping around the side surface of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> to cause the short-circuiting of the p-n junction, the yield can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The thickness of the metal pad <b>15</b> is set up so that the volume of the space surrounded by the submount <b>12</b>, the semiconductor laminated structure <b>3</b>, and the metal pad <b>15</b> becomes substantially equal to the volume after the solder <b>11</b> becomes alloyed. Specifically, the thickness of the metal pad <b>15</b> is about several to 30 percent thinned than the thickness of the solder <b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Since the melting point of the Au&#x2014;Sn solder is also elevated when the content of Sn is increased, a metal pad <b>15</b> containing Sn as a component material may also be used. In such a case, for example, the second alloy layer <b>17</b> is composed of 70% by weight of Au and 30% by weight of Sn, the melting point thereof becomes about 390&#xb0; C. Therefore, an equivalent effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The solder <b>11</b> is not limited to the Au&#x2014;Sn solder, but may be composed of materials which form Sn&#x2014;Ag-based, Sn&#x2014;Ag&#x2014;Cu-based, Sn&#x2014;Zn-based, Sn&#x2014;Bi-based, Pb&#x2014;Sn-based, Au&#x2014;Si-based, or Au&#x2014;Ge-based alloys, whose melting point is changed depending on the component ratios. Then, as the material for the metal pad <b>15</b>, a material containing a material that elevates the melting point of the solder <b>11</b> when alloyed with the solder <b>11</b>, or added to the solder <b>11</b> is used. Thereby, an equivalent effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a sectional view for illustrating a modification example of the method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the third embodiment. In the above-described example, although the metal pad <b>15</b> was formed on the semiconductor laser <b>1</b>, in this modification example, the metal pad <b>15</b> is formed so as to surround a joining region <b>18</b> on the submount <b>12</b>. Then, the solder <b>11</b> is formed in the joining region <b>18</b> on the submount <b>12</b>. Thereafter, the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is mounted in the joining region <b>18</b> on the submount <b>12</b> via the solder <b>11</b> by junction-down manner. Other processes are identical to the processes in the above-described example, and the equivalent effects can be obtained.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Fourth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view showing a semiconductor device according to the fourth embodiment. In place of the high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b> in the first embodiment, an Au film <b>19</b> (metal film) is placed on the periphery of the electrode <b>8</b> between the submount <b>12</b> and the electrode <b>8</b>. The solder <b>11</b> is an Au&#x2014;Sn solder composed of 80% by weight of Au and 20% by weight of Sn. The melting point of the solder <b>11</b> is 280&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view for illustrating a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the fourth embodiment. First, a semiconductor laser <b>1</b> containing a p-n junction is prepared. Then, an Au film <b>19</b> is formed on the periphery of the electrode <b>8</b> of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b>. The solder <b>11</b> is vapor-deposited in the region surrounded by the Au film <b>19</b> on the electrode <b>8</b>. Thereafter, the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is mounted on the submount <b>12</b> via the solder <b>11</b> by a junction-down manner. The mounting temperature when the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is mounted on the submount <b>12</b> is about 300 to 350&#xb0; C. This mounting temperature is higher than the melting point of the solder <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, during this mounting, Au, which is the constituting material of the electrode <b>8</b>, is diffused into the solder <b>11</b>, and the first alloy layer <b>16</b> is formed. When the first alloy layer <b>16</b> reaches the Au film <b>19</b>, Au, which is the constituting material of the Au film <b>19</b>, is diffused into the first alloy layer <b>16</b>, and the second alloy layer <b>17</b> is formed. The second alloy layer <b>17</b> is composed of, for example, 85% by weight of Au and 15% by weight of Sn. The melting point of the second alloy layer <b>17</b> is elevated to about 400&#xb0; C. Therefore, since the melting point of the second alloy layer <b>17</b> is higher than the mounting temperature (about 300 to 350&#xb0; C.), the solder <b>11</b> reaches to the Au film <b>19</b> to become the second alloy layer <b>17</b> to stop the fusion of the solder <b>11</b>. Therefore, since the solder <b>11</b> is prevented from wrapping around the side surface of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> to cause the short-circuiting of the p-n junction, the yield can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Here, the thickness of the Au film <b>19</b> is set up so that the volume of the space surrounded by the submount <b>12</b>, the electrode <b>8</b>, and the Au film <b>19</b> becomes substantially equal to the volume of the alloyed solder <b>11</b>. Specifically, the thickness of the Au film <b>19</b> is thinned by about several to 30 percent than the thickness of the solder <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Fifth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a sectional view showing a semiconductor device according to the fifth embodiment. In place of the high-melting-point metal film <b>10</b> in the first embodiment, a channel <b>20</b> is formed in the submount <b>12</b> so as to surround the electrode <b>8</b>. An Au layer <b>21</b> (metal layer) is formed in the channel <b>20</b>. The solder <b>11</b> is an Sn&#x2014;Ag solder. An Au-plated layer <b>22</b> and a Pt/flash Au layer <b>23</b> are formed on the electrode <b>8</b> and the submount <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a sectional view for illustrating a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the fifth embodiment. First, a semiconductor laser <b>1</b> containing a p-n junction is prepared. Next, a channel <b>20</b> is formed so as to surround the joining region <b>18</b> on the submount <b>12</b>, and the Au layer <b>21</b> is formed in the channel <b>20</b>. Then, a solder <b>11</b> is formed in the joining region <b>18</b> on the submount <b>12</b>. Thereafter, the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is mounted in the joining region <b>18</b> on the submount <b>12</b> via the solder <b>11</b> by junction-down manner. The mounting temperature when the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is mounted on the submount <b>12</b> is about 300 to 350&#xb0; C. This mounting temperature is higher than the melting point of the solder <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">During mounting, the solder <b>11</b> flows in the channel <b>20</b> of the submount <b>12</b>. Thereby, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, Au, which is a constituting material of the Au layer <b>21</b>, is diffused into the solder <b>11</b>, and an inter-metal compound <b>24</b> is formed. The inter-metal compound <b>24</b> is composed of AuSn. The melting point of the solder <b>11</b> wherein the inter-metal compound <b>24</b> is contained is elevated to, for example, 380&#xb0; C., which is higher than the mounting temperature (about 300 to 350&#xb0; C.). Thereby, since the fusion of the solder <b>11</b> is stopped, the lateral spreading of the solder <b>11</b> in the channel <b>20</b> can be suppressed. Therefore, since the solder <b>11</b> is prevented from wrapping around the side surface of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> to cause the short-circuiting of the p-n junction, the yield can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is the binary phase diagram of SnAg. The melting point of SnAg is as low as 221&#xb0; C. when the content of Ag is 3.5% (eutectic point), and elevates as the content of Ag is increased. Therefore, even if an Ag layer is placed in the channel <b>20</b> in place of the Au layer <b>21</b>, the equivalent effect can be obtained. Also when an Au&#x2014;Sn solder is used in place of the Sn&#x2014;Ag solder in the same manner as in the third and fourth embodiments, and an Au layer <b>21</b> or Sn layer is placed in the channel <b>20</b>, the equivalent effect can be obtained. Furthermore, if the other impurity material that elevates the melting point of the solder <b>11</b> when mixed in the solder <b>11</b> is placed in the channel <b>20</b> in place of the Au layer <b>21</b>, the equivalent effect can also be obtained.</p>

In this case, the equivalent effect can also be obtained. If Au layers <b>21</b> are placed both in the channel <b>20</b> of the submount <b>12</b> and the side of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b>, further effects can be obtained.</p>

An attractive material <b>25</b> is formed on the side surface in the channel <b>20</b>. The attractive material <b>25</b> is a material for improving the fluidity of the solder <b>11</b>.

The metallic material to lower the melting point when alloyed with the solder <b>11</b> is specifically Ag for the Sn&#x2014;Cu solder, Bi for the Sn&#x2014;Ag&#x2014;Bi&#x2014;Cu solder, In for the Sn&#x2014;Ag solder, and Ag, Al, or Ga for the Sn-9Zn solder. For the Sn-0.75Cu solder (melting point: 227&#xb0; C.), the melting point of Ag-added Sn-3.5Ag-0.75Cu is 217&#xb0; C.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">First, a plurality of semiconductor laser <b>1</b> each having a semiconductor laminated structure <b>3</b> containing a p-n junction and an electrode <b>8</b> on the semiconductor laminated structure <b>3</b> are formed on a wafer-shaped n-type GaN substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, the interface of the adjoining semiconductor lasers <b>1</b> is scribed by laser scribing to form the channels <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> deeper than the p-n junction. Specifically, a photoresist (not shown) is applied before forming the channels <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, and the photoresist on the area where the channels <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are formed is removed by patterning. In addition, since the light-emitting regions <b>13</b> of the semiconductor lasers <b>1</b> must expose the cleavage surfaces, the channels <b>27</b> for cleavage are formed avoiding the light-emitting regions <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a resistance elevating treatment is carried out by a thermal oxidation method, which is a heat treatment for a long time, on the internal surfaces of the channels <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> to form a resistance elevated region <b>28</b>. Thereafter, the photoresist is removed. In the case of a GaN-based material, the internal surfaces of the channels <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> have become a Ga-rich state wherein nitrogen on the GaN surface is escaped due to laser scribing. Therefore, the internal surfaces become GaO by thermal oxidation, and the resistance can be easily elevated. Alternatively, ion implantation wherein ions such as H (proton), F, O, Fe, Zn, and Si are implanted can also be performed as a resistance elevating treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, cleavage or the like is carried out along the channels <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> for separating into individual semiconductor lasers <b>1</b>. Then, the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> is mounted on the submount <b>12</b> via the solder <b>11</b> by a junction-down manner.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described above, since the resistance elevating treatment is carried out on the internal surface of the channels <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, the resistance elevated region <b>28</b> has been formed on the side surface of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b>. Therefore, since the solder <b>11</b> is prevented from wrapping around the side surface of the semiconductor laser <b>1</b> to reach the p-n junction and cause the short-circuiting of the p-n junction, the yield can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Generally, since the cleavage surface is protected by coating, no p-n junction is exposed. Therefore, the above-described resistance elevating treatment is not required. Furthermore, although laser scribing was used to both the channel <b>26</b> for separating and the channel <b>27</b> for cleavage, laser scribing may be used only to the channel <b>26</b> for separating,</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Laser scribing excels in fine processing compared with needle scribing, and working speed is high. Laser scribing also excels in process controllability compared with etching, deep scribing is feasible. Especially, since there is no suitable etchant is available for GaN-based semiconductor laser, and wet etching is difficult, laser scribing or dry etching is required.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is an enlarged sectional view showing a modification example of a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the seventh embodiment. Although a resistance elevating treatment was carried out on the inner surface of the channels <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> in the above-described example, the insulating film <b>29</b> is formed in the channels <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> in the modification example. Thereby, the equivalent effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in the light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.</p>
