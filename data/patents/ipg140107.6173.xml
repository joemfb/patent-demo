<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">For the purpose of evaluating at least one characteristic value of at least one function in the execution of a program, a method uses a graphical representation of the at least one determined characteristic value associated with the functions. The representation is subdivided into a hierarchical structure, dependent on the degree of call depth of the function, and each call of a function in the graphical representation occupies an area whose size is dependent on the associated determined characteristic value in each case. In this context characteristic values can be any variables that are measurable by means of a profiler, as already explained in the introduction. Typically, an execution of a program is initiated via the calling of first functions, also referred to hereinafter as call depth <b>1</b>. Said functions may possibly call further functions, i.e. of call depth <b>2</b>, and so on, until processing of the desired task has been completed. At the same time functions can also be called multiple times and by all means from multiple call depths, a function not being specified in terms of call depth.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority of European Patent Office application No. 07012960.6 EP filed Jul. 2, 2007, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a method for evaluating at least one characteristic value of at least one function in the execution of a program, in particular during the development of software, for example when pinpointing, diagnosing and removing faults and errors in hardware and software.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When developing a program, the developer attempts to avoid anything that is unnecessary so that the program will be sufficiently fast and the full processing of the task can be completed within the given timeframe.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Occasionally, however, the general conditions change even during the development process and the execution of a program previously delivering adequate performance is compromised.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Runtimes of the functions within a program are typically investigated through the use of what is termed a profiler. Profilers are programming tools which analyze the runtime behavior of software. In software development there are different problem areas that are triggered by inefficient programming. A profiler assists the developer in identifying the problem areas by analyzing and comparing executing programs. From this process measures aimed at the structural and algorithmic improvement of the source code can be derived.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The most frequent application of a profiler is counting and measuring the calls and iterations of functions. This enables the programmer to discover where it is worthwhile optimizing the program. Optimizing functions that are not often used is not especially beneficial to the overall performance of the program and generally makes maintaining the source code more difficult. For this reason the main focus of attention is on functions which are called frequently and take up a lot of time among the total number of calls.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further aspect is the tracking of memory usage by a program. The profiler is intended to help here in optimizing the use and consumption of working memory and where necessary in identifying errors in the programming due to which memory areas that are no longer being used are not released. Modern profilers provide the possibility of representing concurrent processes graphically in their lifecycle (as a barchart or reference tree, for example). This visualization is intended to help a programmer to interpret the runtime behavior of concurrent processes more effectively and pinpoint errors due to deadlock.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A table is usually generated by the profiler during the measurement of the functions, exact duration and frequency of execution of the functions in a particular scenario.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This table can include e.g. the following columns:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">

<p id="p-0011" num="0025">The above-listed values do not constitute a definitive listing, and further values can be determined by the profiler. The question as to the further functions called from within the measured function (in other words, functions hierarchically situated at the next call level) by itself also already fills a further table again. Depending on the complexity of the program/function tested by the profiler, this results in a growing volume of data which makes it difficult for the user, tester and/or programmer to find the function that is suitable for optimization in the chaotic mass of data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0026">As an example of a results table of a profiler, let reference be made to the table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which has a total of three values&#x2014;Number, Cumul(ative) Time and Own Time&#x2014;in each case for the five functions A, B, C, D, E, and which represents a snapshot during the measurement process.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0027">In this example, the function D, although running for the longest time overall, is itself only called once and requires only a small part of the time as own time. Function B, in contrast, is called very frequently, i.e. if said function can be successfully optimized, this would have a great impact on the cumulative time. Function B in turn requires only a small part of the time as own time, which suggests that an optimization within the function B will be difficult. Function E, conversely, requires a great deal of own time, so a small optimization in this function will possibly lead to a higher savings effect. It could, however, also be the case that the function is called so often because there is an error in the programming, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0028">The interpretation of the values is already demanding per se, so with a multiplicity of numbers it becomes virtually impossible to maintain an overview here. Filters and sorting of the values in the table are currently available as tools.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0029">An object of the invention is to disclose a method by means of which it is made easier for a user to evaluate the determined characteristic values.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0030">This object is achieved by means of a method as claimed in an independent claim. For the purpose of evaluating at least one characteristic value of at least one function in the execution of a program, the method uses a graphical representation of the at least one determined characteristic value associated with the functions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0031">The representation is subdivided into a hierarchical structure, dependent on the degree of call depth of the function, and each call of a function in the graphical representation occupies an area whose size is dependent on the associated determined characteristic value in each case.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0032">Characteristic values can be any variables that are measurable by means of a profiler, as already explained in the introduction.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0033">Typically, an execution of a program is initiated via the calling of first functions, also referred to hereinafter as call depth <b>1</b>. Said functions possibly call further functions, i.e. of call depth <b>2</b>, and so on, until processing of the desired task has been completed. At the same time functions can also be called multiple times and by all means from multiple call depths, a function not being specified in terms of call depth.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0034">The call depth of the function in question is mapped in what is called a hierarchical subdivision of the graphical representation. Suitable elements here are for example nested areas. It is advantageous in this case to use the already known tree mapping algorithm formulated by Shneiderman, which was originally developed for the purpose of visualizing directory trees.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0035">Advantageous embodiment and developments are set forth in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0036">The hierarchical subdivision can be performed in such a way that the function called the main function, which is called first in the program (call level 0, for example main( )), initially occupies the entire representation area.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0037">The first call level of the functions which are called in succession by the main function then subdivides the available area of the main function in a first manner. The following call level 2 of the functions subdivides the area of the function calling them in each case from the respective previous call level in a defined manner and this step is repeated iteratively as required.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0038">In this case the subdivision of the area in the first and each following step can be performed, for example, horizontally and vertically in alternation. As a result, the areas remain visually clearly separable and labeling is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0039">Advantageously, the represented characteristic value is a value which provides highly pertinent information for the evaluation and discovery of problem areas in program development. Values that should be mentioned first and foremost in this context are the total execution time of the function and also the execution frequency of the function.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0040">In a development of the invention, a three-dimensional form of representation, in particular a cushion shape of the respective representation areas is chosen. In this case the base area of the cushion is determined according to a first characteristic value and the height of the cushion according to a second characteristic value that is different from the first.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0041">Filter options can additionally be advantageously used to reduce the represented volume of data so that it can be more easily evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0042">Since a profiler measures the characteristic values during ongoing program operation, said values also change dynamically at runtime. It is therefore a further advantage of the invention if the areas can be adjusted in size to match the currently determined characteristic variable value in each case. This generates an image which is dynamic along the time axis and which, by means of the changes that can be represented therewith, can provide a further important pointer to problems in the problems in the program execution, for example if an area (which represents a function) grows to an above-average extent or exhibits some other unexpected behavior compared to other functions.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0047">For a detailed description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the reader is referred to the introduction to the description.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a first exemplary call tree on the left-hand side. The program is started with a main function (or top level function) at the call level 0, called function A in this case. This is characterized firstly in that it is not called by any other function. In the graphic on the right, A initially occupies the entire area (dark hatching). The function then calls functions B and E (with no indication initially being given by the graphic as to how the calls are correlated in time, i.e. whether, for example, B and E run in parallel or are processed sequentially. The same then applies to the next call level 1, in which function B calls functions C and D and function E calls functions F and G.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0049">On the right-hand side of the figure in the graphic according to the application, the total area of function A is now initially subdivided into the two vertical blocks B and E (somewhat lighter hatching), which in the present case subdivide the area of A into equal parts. This is pure chance, however, since the area distribution of B and E is dependent on the chosen characteristic variable. In other words, the area of B may also be substantially smaller or substantially greater than that of E.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0050">In the next step in the generation of the representation the next hierarchy level of the calls is created, which again subdivides the representative areas of functions B and E in the same way in each case, as already described. Thus, all call levels (insofar as desired or defined) are processed recursively and the representation depth progressively refined.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> differs from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in that function B in the next call level contains an additional call of itself and function E also contains a call of function B. No distinction is made during the calculation of the representation; the call tree can have all possible forms in this case. As a result of the graphical representation, (undesired) loops can be recognized even more easily therein than in the traditional table presentation. Moreover, it is also clearly recognizable in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that the area of function B within function E is larger than within function B and also that the areas of the individual functions C, B, D and F each have different sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0052">This could also be an image of the representation of the same program at a later point in time, in which function G has been processed to completion and in its place new functions have been called in each case.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0053">An exemplary application is in the development of controls in systems and plant engineering.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0054">A multiplicity of functions and variables can be monitored here, a small number of which are listed in the following by way of example:</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0055">One FB is designed for the use of an inverter for controlling a rotary motion for gearing mechanisms with a fixed pitch. There is only one position switch for switching off from both directions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0056">When accelerating from a defined position, as well as when switching off by means of the position switch, the value (RAMPE_POS) is used (should equal 100 ms). When accelerating from an undefined position (RAMPE_AUF) and when stopping in an undefined position the value (RAMPE_AB) is used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0057">When continuing from an undefined position the speed (V_LANGSAM) is output.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0058">A further FB controls arrival points up to 3 departures</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0059">The module handles the control of arrival points with the associated wait block.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0060">There is one FB for monitoring pressure and flow faults, integration of a timing deviation control</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0061">Visualization, control and troubleshooting for adhesion faults is evaluated by an FB</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0062">The next FB requests the address of internal structures from its instance DB by passing it as INPUT parameter &#x3c;Structur&#x3e;.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0063">The DB, the start (DW) and the length of the structure is returned via the ANY pointer analysis!</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0064">One value can be used for the energy consumption measurement</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0065">Or also for current consumption measurement</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0066">The current consumption is measured by means of an electricity meter. Depending on the setting on the meter, the current pulses can correspond to the following values:
