<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to automated welding, and more particularly, to methods and systems of welding a bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, manual repair of bearings is labor intensive because at least two operators are usually required to weld the upper and lower bearing half inner surfaces individually and separately. Moreover, known manual repair of bearings uses Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) equipment which has a slow deposition rate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To facilitate bearing repair with a faster deposition rate, at least some known bearings are repaired using gas metal arc welding GMAW. GMAW is an arc welding process in which a wire is continuously fed through a welding gun or torch. The wire functions as an electrode during welding. Generally, known GMAW systems include at least a control switch, a contact tip, a wire conduit that also functions as a liner, an exhaust hose and a torch. When the control switch is pressed by an operator, a wire feed mechanism forces the wire through the liner to the contact tip.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Known GMAW methods require proper guidance of the torch with respect to an area being welded. Orientation of the torch with respect to the surface being welded is also important for proper welding. For example, generally, for GMAW methods, the torch should be oriented vertically and at a substantially ninety degree angle to a surface being welded. When moving the torch while welding, the torch should generally remain vertical. As can be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, depending on the component part being welded, it may be difficult to maintain a proper orientation of the torch during the welding operation. It should also be appreciated that when a bearing half having a U-shaped cross-section is stationary and the inner surface of the U-shape opening faces towards the torch, the torch cannot be maintained in a vertical orientation and at the same time provide flat position welding.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a method of welding a bearing is provided. The method includes providing an apparatus including at least one welding torch and a processor, positioning a holding fixture proximate the apparatus, securing a bearing in position in the holding fixture, applying a bead of weld to facilitate repairing a damaged surface of the bearing and incrementally rotating the bearing with the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, a system of automated bearing repair is provided. The system includes an apparatus including a processor and torch. The system also includes a holding fixture positioned proximate the apparatus for securing a bearing position relative to the apparatus. The processor is configured to control the operation of the apparatus to enable a damaged surface of the bearing to be repaired by repeatedly applying a bead of weld to the surface such that all of the bearing surface is repaired.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another aspect, an apparatus for welding a bearing is provided. The apparatus includes a plurality of devices, each device includes at least one welding torch and a processor. The apparatus also includes a plurality of holding fixtures, each holding fixture corresponds to one of the plurality of devices and includes a bearing. A damaged inner surface of each bearing is simultaneously repaired by applying a bead of weld to each bearing and incrementally rotating each bearing.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the exemplary embodiment, liner tube <b>46</b> extends from an electrode wire source <b>48</b> along exhaust vent <b>42</b> to torch <b>18</b>. A feed mechanism <b>50</b> is coupled about liner tube <b>46</b>. Wire source <b>48</b> includes an electrode wire <b>52</b> that is flat wound onto a spool <b>54</b> to facilitate feeding of wire <b>52</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, wire <b>52</b> has a circular cross-sectional area and is fabricated from a babbit metal. In other embodiments, wire <b>52</b> may be fabricated from any material suitable for the lining of journal bearing sleeves, that facilitates automated welding as described herein. Such material includes, but is not limited to, white or soft metal. In the exemplary embodiment, liner tube <b>46</b> is a low friction nylon tube that functions as a conduit for passing wire <b>52</b> from wire source <b>48</b> to torch <b>18</b>. It should be understood that liner tube <b>46</b> facilitates preventing kinking and binding of wire <b>52</b> en route to torch <b>18</b>. In other embodiments, liner tube <b>46</b> may be fabricated from any material that facilitates preventing damaging wire <b>52</b> in any manner.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Any marks impressed on wire <b>52</b>, or other damage to wire <b>52</b>, may effect weld quality and cause jamming of wire <b>52</b> in liner tube <b>46</b> or in a contact tip <b>19</b> of torch <b>18</b>.

In the exemplary embodiment, the wire feed roller and tensioner are specifically adjusted to facilitate passing wire <b>52</b> through liner tube <b>46</b> in such a manner that wire <b>52</b> maintains a circular cross sectional area en route to torch <b>18</b>. Should the wire feed roller and tensioner be improperly adjusted, wire <b>52</b> may develop an elliptical cross-sectional area which may negatively effect electrical contact during welding.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A bearing holding fixture <b>56</b> includes, in the exemplary embodiment, a first plate <b>58</b>, a second plate <b>60</b> that is substantially identical to first plate <b>58</b>, and that is mounted on a support structure <b>62</b>. First plate <b>58</b> includes a first inner surface <b>64</b> and second plate <b>60</b> includes a second inner surface <b>66</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, plates <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are substantially parallel to each other such that first inner surface <b>64</b> and second inner surface <b>66</b> are in a mirrored relationship and are separated by a distance D. Distance D is variably selected based on the bearing being repaired. Moreover, plates <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> translate independently of each other, but may be simultaneously translated in the same or opposite directions, or either plate <b>58</b> or <b>60</b> may be translated while the remaining plate <b>58</b> or <b>60</b> is not translated. More specifically, plates <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are mounted on transition rods <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, and <b>74</b> that are oriented substantially parallel to a surface <b>68</b> of support structure <b>62</b>, to enable plates <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> to translate along a length of rods <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, plates <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are substantially perpendicular to support structure surface <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a portion of an exemplary bearing <b>76</b> to be repaired using apparatus <b>10</b>. It should be understood that bearing <b>76</b> is one half of an entire bearing, and that two bearings <b>76</b> constitute an entire bearing. More specifically, bearing <b>76</b> has a substantially C-shaped cross-sectional profile and includes a first end <b>78</b> and a second end <b>80</b>. Moreover, bearing <b>76</b> has a bore diameter <b>82</b> defined by a damaged inner surface <b>84</b>, and a length L measured between ends <b>78</b> and <b>80</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, bearing <b>76</b> is fabricated from a metallic material. In other embodiments, bearing <b>76</b> may be fabricated from any other material that facilitates automated welding as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It should be understood that in the exemplary embodiment, the processor of apparatus <b>10</b> is programmed based on the bearing <b>76</b> being repaired. Specifically, the processor is programmed based on bore diameter <b>82</b> and a length of a weld pass necessary by torch <b>18</b> to repair each bearing <b>76</b>. After initially programming the processor, bearings <b>76</b> having the programmed bore diameter <b>82</b> and length L are repaired. When all bearings <b>76</b> having the programmed dimensions are repaired, the processor may be reprogrammed to repair differently-sized bearings <b>76</b>. Doing so, increases repair productivity by taking advantage of the uniformity of bearings <b>76</b> being repaired. It should be understood that the length of each weld pass depends on the bearing length L of each bearing <b>76</b> being repaired. It should be understood that the processor is also programmed to incrementally rotate bearing <b>76</b> during welding.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Support structure <b>62</b> and bearing holding fixture <b>56</b> are positioned proximate apparatus <b>10</b> to facilitate torch <b>18</b> repairing inner surface <b>84</b>. More specifically, when secured to fixture <b>56</b>, bearing <b>76</b> inner surface <b>84</b> is oriented to face towards apparatus <b>10</b>. More specifically, during operation, bearing <b>76</b> is positioned between plates <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> such that bearing first end <b>78</b> faces either first inner surface <b>64</b> or second inner surface <b>66</b>, and such that second end <b>80</b> faces the other surface <b>64</b> or <b>66</b>. Plates <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are then translated on rods <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, and <b>74</b> towards bearing <b>76</b>, such that surfaces <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> are pressed against respective ends <b>78</b> or <b>80</b>. More specifically, surfaces <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> are pressed against respective ends <b>78</b> or <b>80</b> with enough compressive force to facilitate securing bearing <b>76</b>, lengthwise, between plates <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>. Thus once bearing <b>76</b> is secured in position within fixture <b>56</b>, the entire inner surface <b>84</b> of bearing <b>76</b> may be repaired using torch <b>18</b>. It should be appreciated that when inner surface <b>84</b> is damaged, a white-metal/babbit finish of surface <b>84</b> is no longer smooth and is unsuitable for service. The damaged white-metal/babbit finish is removed and a new layer is applied as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It should be appreciated that two bearing halves <b>76</b> of the same bearing may be worked simultaneously by abutting ends <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> to corresponding ends <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> of a complementary bearing half <b>76</b>. A bead of weld is then applied during a pass of length 2 L. It should be understood that a copper or other non-consumable insert is positioned between bearing halves <b>76</b> to prevent welding both bearing halves <b>76</b> together. Thus, bearings halves <b>76</b> can be separated.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the exemplary embodiment, apparatus <b>10</b> initially positions torch <b>18</b> intermediate bearing first end <b>78</b> and second end <b>80</b>, and proximate a bottom edge <b>86</b> of bearing <b>76</b>. After initially positioning torch <b>18</b>, torch <b>18</b> is guided back and forth such that torch <b>18</b> may weld inner surface <b>84</b> along bearing length L. While torch <b>18</b> is guided back and forth during welding, apparatus <b>10</b> also maintains torch <b>18</b> in a proper orientation with respect to inner surface <b>84</b>. More specifically, torch <b>18</b> is maintained substantially perpendicular to inner surface <b>84</b> during welding. It should be understood that after torch <b>18</b> applies a bead of weld along a line of length L, bearing holding fixture <b>56</b> incrementally rotates bearing <b>76</b> to enable torch <b>18</b> to weld along a line of length L immediately adjacent to the previous weld applied to bearing inner surface <b>84</b>. Rotating bearing <b>76</b> also facilitates maintaining torch <b>18</b> substantially perpendicular to inner surface <b>84</b>. Consequently, as fixture <b>56</b> incrementally rotates bearing <b>76</b>, torch <b>18</b> repeatedly applies a weld back and forth across inner surface <b>84</b>. Thus, the entire inner surface <b>84</b> of bearing <b>76</b> is facilitated to be repaired.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It should be appreciated that although the exemplary embodiment is described as welding immediately adjacent the previous weld, in other embodiments, bearing <b>76</b> may be rotated at any angle prior to applying a subsequent bead of weld such that the subsequent bead of weld is not immediately adjacent to the previous weld. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that torch <b>18</b> may be initially positioned at any point on inner surface <b>84</b> to start welding.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, to prevent local over heating and subsequent remelting of deposited material, welding may start at point <b>88</b> of inner surface <b>84</b>. After applying a bead of weld along a line of length L starting at point <b>88</b>, bearing <b>76</b> may be rotated such that a bead of weld is applied starting at point <b>90</b>. Subsequently, bearing <b>76</b> may be rotated such that a bead of weld is applied starting at point <b>92</b>. Then a bead of weld may be applied starting at point <b>94</b>. After applying these beads of weld, a bead of weld is applied immediately adjacent and to the left of each weld. That is, a bead of weld is first applied immediately adjacent and to the left of the weld started at point <b>88</b>. Then a bead of weld is applied immediately adjacent and to the left of the weld started at point <b>90</b>. This process is repeated for applying a bead of weld adjacent to the welds started at points <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. This process is repeated until the entire inner surface <b>84</b> is facilitated to be repaired.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be appreciated that although the exemplary embodiment is described as axially rotating bearing <b>76</b> and applying beads of weld axially to inner surface <b>84</b>, in other embodiments, bearing <b>76</b> may be rotated axially while beads of weld are applied circumferentially to facilitate repairing inner surface <b>84</b>. It should be understood that the welding process described in the exemplary embodiment may be used for welding or repairing articles or bearings having at least one axis of symmetry, including spherical articles or bearings. Repairing spherical articles or bearings using the welding process described in the exemplary embodiment, requires varying the rotational speed of the bearing or article depending on the bearing or article diameter perpendicular to the axis of symmetry.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In each embodiment, the above-described robotic manipulator facilitates using a GMAW torch to weld bearings of many sizes. Moreover, because welding is performed in a flat position, the deposition rate is facilitated to be increased as compared to GTAW processes. It should be appreciated that although GMAW is faster than GTAW as a process, the vertical orientation of torch <b>18</b> stabilizes the molten pool of material. More specifically, automated processing enables only one operator to operate several such devices to repair several bearings simultaneously. As a result, the apparatus and methods described herein, facilitate reducing costs and improving throughput, and reducing waste by continuously feeding wire, as compared to GTAW processes wherein the end (stub) of each piece of filler metal must be discarded. Accordingly, welding performance and component useful life are each facilitated to be enhanced in a cost effective and reliable manner while maintenance costs are facilitated to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Exemplary embodiments for methods of automated bearing welding are described above in detail. The methods are not limited to use with the specific method described herein, but rather, the methods can be utilized independently and separately from other methods described herein. Moreover, the invention is not limited to the embodiment of the method for automated bearing welding described above in detail. Rather, other variations of automated bearing welding may be utilized within the spirit and scope of the claims.</p>
