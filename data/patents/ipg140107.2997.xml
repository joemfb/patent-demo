<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Quorum sensing (QS) is a process by which bacteria assess their population density through a language of low molecular weight signalling molecules (autoinducers). Gram-negative bacteria commonly use N-acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) as their primary autoinducers and their respective receptors (R proteins) for QS. Assessing population density allows for the modulation of gene expression levels required for group behaviour. Genes regulated by QS in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>include virulence factor production and biofilm production. [Geske, G. D.; O'Neill, J. C.; Miller, D. M.; Mattmann, M. E.; Blackwell, H. E., Modulation of Bacterial Quorum Sensing: Systematic Evaluation of N-Acylated Homoserine Lactones in Multiple Species and New Insights into Their Mechanism of Action. <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>2007, 129, 13613-13625.]</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">At high cell densities, bacteria use this chemical signaling process to switch from a nomadic existence to that of multicellular community. This lifestyle switch is significant, as numerous pathogenic bacteria use quorum sensing to turn on virulence pathways and form drug-impervious communities called biofilms that are the basis of myriad chronic infections. Over 80% of bacterial infections in humans involve the formation of biofilms, as exemplified in lung infections by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, which is the primary cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis patients. The treatment of infections by pathogens that form biofilms costs over $1 billion/year in the US alone. Biofilms are dense extracellular polymeric matrices in which the bacteria embed themselves. Biofilms allow bacteria to create a microenviroment that attaches the bacteria to the host surface and which contains excreted enzymes and other factors allowing the bacteria to evade host immune responses including antibodies and cellular immune responses. Such biofilms can also exclude antibiotics. Further, biofilms can be extremely resistant to removal and disinfection. For individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis, the formation of biofilms by <i>P. aeruginosa </i>is eventually fatal. Other bacteria also respond to quorum sensing signals by producing biofilms. Biofilms are inherent in dental plaques, and are found on surgical instruments, food processing and agriculture equipment and water treatment and power generating machinery and equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Gram-negative bacteria represent numerous relevant pathogens using quorum-sensing pathways. Besides <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, other quorum sensing bacteria include: <i>Aeromonas hydrophila, A. salmonicida, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Burkholderia cepacia, Chromobacterium violaceum, Enterobacter agglomeran, Erwinia carotovora, E. chrysanthemi, Escherichia coli, Nitrosomas europaea, Obesumbacterium proteus, Pantoea stewartii, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, P. syringae, Ralstonia solanacearum, Rhisobium etli, R. leguminosarum, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Serratia liguefaciens, S. marcescens, Vibrio anguillarum, V. fischeri, V. cholerae, Xenorhabdus nematophilus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Y. medievalis</i>, and <i>Y. ruckeri</i>. Studies on the above listed bacteria indicate that, while the Al is generally an AHL compound, the genes affected as well as the phenotypes resulting from induction of the promoter differ according to the particular life cycle of each bacterium. Further, quorum sensing stimulation typically results in altered expression of multiple genes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><i>P. aeruginosa </i>is an opportunistic pathogen that causes severe, often fatal, infections in burn victims and cystic fibrosis patients and is therefore of direct and profound biomedical importance. <i>P. aeruginosa </i>uses 3-oxo-dodecanoyal homoserine lactone (OdDHL) as its autoinducer (Compound A):</p>

</chemistry>
<br/>
While successful modifications to the acyl tail region of autoinducers have been made, modifications to the AHL head group have met limited success. Modifications to the head group are important because the lactone ring is prone to hydrolysis at pH 7 and higher. [Glansdorp, F. G.; Thomas, G. L.; Lee, J. K.; Dutton, J. M.; Salmond, G. P. C.; Welch, M.; Spring, D. R., Synthesis and stability of small molecule probes for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>quorum sensing modulation. <i>Org. Biomol. Chem. </i>2004, 2, 3329-3336.] This work relates to non-homoserine lactone-based autoinducer analogs for QS modulation and provides a better understanding of the structural and electronic requirements of the autoinducer's head group. Certain of the compounds of this invention are designed as autoinducer analogs for QS modulation in <i>P. aeruginosa. </i>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Previous work in the field of <i>P. aeruginosa </i>QS modulators showed that many active non-lactone structures are highly conjugated and retain some form of the acyl chain, suggesting that a region of hydrophobicity in the acyl tail region is critical.

Drugability is assessed in various ways in the art. For example, the &#x201c;Lipinski Rule of 5&#x201d; for determining drug-like characteristics in a molecule related to in vivo absorption and permeability can be applied (C. A. Lipinski, F. Lombardo, B. W. Dominy, P. J. Feeney, Experimental and computational approaches to estimate solubility and permeability in drug discovery and development settings, Adv. Drug Del. Rev., 2001, 46, 3-26 and Arup K. Ghose, Vellarkad N. Viswanadhan, and John J. Wendoloski, A Knowledge-Based Approach in Designing Combinatorial or Medicinal Chemistry Libraries for Drug Discovery, J. Combin. Chem., 1999, 1, 55-68.) In general a preferred drug for oral administration exhibits no more than one violation of the following rules:</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0150">(1) Not more than 5 hydrogen bond donors (e.g., nitrogen or oxygen atoms with one or more hydrogens);</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0151">(2) Not more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (e.g., nitrogen or oxygen atoms);</p>

<p id="p-0176" num="0177">Heterocycles and carbocycles were chosen as head groups for a library (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in order to probe the orientation and electronics necessary for a positive binding interaction with Trp60, shown to be an important residue in the N-terminal domain of the LasR crystal structure. Fluorine was chosen as a lactone carbonyl mimic due to its ability to accept hydrogen bonds. Multiple fluorine aromatic substitutions were examined to determine if Trp60 could hydrogen bond to multiple atoms given the correct spatial orientation. Non-hydrogen bonding oxygen-containing moieties were chosen to examine the effects of non-hydrogen bonding electrostatic interactions. The library also contained carbocycles to explore the necessity of the Trp60 binding interaction. A thiolactone analog shown to be active in previous experiments was chosen to serve as a control compound for our bacterial strains. [Passador, L.; Tucker, K. D.; Guertin, K. R.; Journet, M. P.; Kende, A. S.; Iglewski, B. H., Functional analysis of the <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>Autoinducer PAI. J. Bacteriol. 1996, 178, 5995-6000.] The glycine ethyl ester and the alanine methyl ester were chosen to explore the effects of variations on synthetic ring-opened forms of the lactone unavailable to nature.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0178">Based upon this design strategy, a 17 member non-lactone based library (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) was synthesized using solution-phase chemistry. To facilitate the ease of synthesis, a Meldrum's Acid derivative was used as a common intermediate. Reacting Meldrum's Acid with decanoyl chloride afforded the Meldrum's Acid derivative, which was refluxed with the desired amines to form the initial library (Scheme 1).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0179">Scheme 1 is a general synthetic method for producing 3-oxo-dodecanoyal derivatives of the natural autoinducer for <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. DMAP=dimethyl amino pyridine. TEA=triethyl amine. R can, for example, be a unsubstituted or substituted heterocycle or carbocycle:</p>

<p id="p-0180" num="0181">The initial library was tested for LasR agonistic and antagonistic activity in two strains: <i>Escherichia coli </i>DH5&#x3b1; (pJN105L+pSC11) [Lee, J. H.; Lequette, Y.; Greenberg, E. P., Activity of purified QscR, a <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>orphan quorum-sensing transcription factor. Mol. Microbiol. 2006, 59 (2), 602-609] and <i>P. aeruginosa </i>PA01 MW1 (pUM15) [Muh, U.; Schuster, M.; Heim, R.; Singh, A.; Olson, E.; Greenberg, E. P., Novel <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>Quorum-Sensing Inhibitors Identified in an Ultra-High-Throughput Screen. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006, 50, 3674-3679] (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>). Both strains allow for synthetic autoinducer mimic evaluation and contain a reporter gene that allows for a quantitative readout of QS activity. DH5&#x3b1; (pJN105L+pSC11) is a heterologous &#x3b2;-galactosidase <i>E. coli </i>reporter strain containing a plasmid for the <i>P. aeruginosa </i>LasR gene. The PA01 MW1 (pUM15) strain uses the natural <i>P. aeruginosa </i>background containing a LasI deletion and the gene for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) under the control of the LasI promoter to evaluate the LasI/R activity. Since the PA01 MW1 (pUM15) strain evaluates LasR in the natural <i>P. aeruginosa </i>background, in contrast to the heterologous <i>E. coli </i>strain, an improved idea of the interplay between the isolated LasI/R system and the combination of LasI/R with other QS subsystems such as QscR can be determined. Furthermore, additional nuances of the natural system such as compound permeability are incorporated in assays using the PA01 MW1 (pUM15) strain.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0182">The initial library was also tested in <i>Vibrio fischeri </i>ESI 114 (&#x394;-LuxI) [Lupp, C.; Urbanowski, M.; Greenberg, E. P.; Ruby, E. G., The <i>Vibrio fischeri </i>quorum-sensing systems ain and lux sequentially induce luminescence gene expression and are important for persistence in the squid host. Mol. Microbiol. 2003, 50 (1), 319-331] and <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </i>WCF (pCF372). [Zhu, J.; Beaber, J. W.; More, M. I.; Fuqua, C.; Eberhard, A.; Winans, S. C., Analogs of the autoinducer 3-oxooctanoyl-homoserine lactone strongly inhibit activity of the TraR protein of <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>. J. Bacteriol. 1998, 180 (20), 5398-5405.] However, activities were low to modest in these species, except for compound 1, which is a good antagonist in both strains. The general lack of activity in the <i>V. fischeri </i>and <i>A. tumefaciens </i>strains is to be expected considering that the library was designed for the <i>P. aeruginosa </i>LasR protein and reinforces previous work demonstrating that the length of the acyl tail is highly species dependent. [Geske, G. D.; O'Neill, J. C.; Miller, D. M.; Mattmann, M. E.; Blackwell, H. E., Modulation of Bacterial Quorum Sensing: Systematic Evaluation of N-Acylated Homoserine Lactones in Multiple Species and New Insights into Their Mechanism of Action. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 13613-13625.]</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0183">This set of screening data provides several noteworthy discoveries. First, the thiolactone derivative of the <i>P. aeruginosa </i>natural ligand (1) is highly active in all strains tested&#x2014;either as an agonist in the strains examining LasR activity [94% agonist in DH5&#x3b1; (pJN105L+pSC11) and 88% agonist in PA01 MW1 (pUM15)] or as an antagonist in the <i>V. fischeri </i>(LuxR; 92% inhibition) and <i>A. tumefaciens </i>(TraR; 65% inhibition) strains. The high degree of activity across these four strains suggests that the sulfur substitution in the lactone ring does not sufficiently alter the binding of 1 from the natural ligand and suggests that the electronics at that position are not critical for binding. Second, the cyclopentyl amine derivative (3) is an agonist in both strains testing for LasR activity and a modest antagonist in the <i>V. fischeri </i>strain. This is remarkable because the cyclopentyl amine head group lacks functionality for hydrogen bond acceptance, which has been proposed as critical for neutral ligand binding based on the LasR crystal structure. This suggests that either the lactone carbonyl's hydrogen bonds are not as crucial as originally thought, or that 3 binds in an alternative manner. Third, compound 2 is of interest for its antagonism capabilities in both strains evaluating the LasI/R system, even though there are no hydrogen bond acceptor substitutions, further questioning the proposed critical nature of the lactone carbonyl. Fourth, compound 14 provides some insight into the differences between the isolated LasI/R system in <i>E. coli </i>and the LasI/R system in the natural <i>P. aeruginosa </i>background. LasR appears to be strongly agonized by 14 in the <i>E. coli </i>strain, while assays using the natural <i>P. aeruginosa </i>background show slight antagonism rather than an agonistic effect. Compound 14 represented an excellent candidate for further testing in additional heterologous strains containing isolated QS subsystems like QscR and RhII/R.</p>

<p id="p-0190" num="0191">The racemic thiolactone library was tested in the same LasR reporter strains as the initial library (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>). Differences between the isolated LasR reporter system and LasR reporter system in the natural <i>P. aeruginosa </i>background have been uncovered in this second generation library. All of the library members were active in the heterologous LasI/R system while inactive in the intact <i>P. aeruginosa </i>QS system. One possibility is that library members are regulating multiple competing QS pathways, resulting in net inactivity in the natural background. For this reason it is crucial to examine the LasI/R system in the natural <i>P. aeruginosa </i>background where additional QS subsystems are also present and not simply as an isolated system in the <i>E. coli </i>background. Differences in cell permeability, especially since <i>P. aeruginosa </i>is known to be less permeable than <i>E. coli</i>, could also account for the discrepancy in activity between the two strains.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Focused Libraries&#x2014;Enantiopure Thiolactone Library</heading>
<p id="p-0191" num="0192">After finding several active compounds in the racemic thiolactone library in the heterologous <i>E. coli </i>LasI/R strain and the <i>V. Fischeri </i>strain, a third generation library was designed containing the enantiopure thiolactone along with additional acyl chain mimics to further explore the structure-activity relationship of the thiolactone head group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The L enantiomer of the thiolactone was chosen based on previous studies that found the L enantiomer of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>'s natural autoinducer to be active and the D enantiomer to be inactive. [Geske, G. D.; O'Neill, J. C.; Miller, D. M.; Mattmann, M. E.; Blackwell, H. E., Modulation of Bacterial Quorum Sensing: Systematic Evaluation of N-Acylated Homoserine Lactones in Multiple Species and New Insights into Their Mechanism of Action. <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>2007, 129, 13613-13625; Glansdorp, F. G.; Thomas, G. L.; Lee, J. K.; Dutton, J. M.; Salmond, G. P. C.; Welch, M.; Spring, D. R., Synthesis and stability of small molecule probes for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>quorum sensing modulation. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004, 2, 3329-3336.]</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> provides structures (with reference numbers) of compounds of the enantiopure thiolactone library synthesized from a combination of Meldrum's acid precursors and EDC couplings.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0194">The third generation thiolactone compounds were similarly tested in bacterial assays beside the racemic version, if synthesized, to determine the effect of stereochemistry on activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9H</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9H</figref> provide a comparison between racemic and enantiopure thiolactone analogs. All synthetic ligands were tested at 10 &#x3bc;M using standard methods described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. Compounds 24-30 of the enantiopure library were not compared to a racemic counterpart. If stereochemistry played a large role in binding, the enantiopure compounds were expected to have approximately twice the activity of the racemic compounds when screened at 10 &#x3bc;M total synthetic ligand in each case. In both strains testing for LasR activity, it appeared, however, that stereochemistry was not important for activity of the non-native thiolactones in contrast to the lactones. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, we presently believe that binding is likely less specific for the thiolactones compared to the natural lactone ligand, where it is known that the L enantiomer is far more active than the D enantiomer.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0195">Dose response analysis for the active enantiopure thiolactone compounds was conducted to quantify the activity of the synthetic ligands (Table 2). The activity of the thiolactone head group alone became evident through compound 21E in the heterologous LasR strain, whose AHL analogue was found to have little activity. [Geske, G. D.; O'Neill, J. C.; Miller, D. M.; Mattmann, M. E.; Blackwell, H. E., Modulation of Bacterial Quorum Sensing: Systematic Evaluation of N-Acylated Homoserine Lactones in Multiple Species and New Insights into Their Mechanism of Action. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 13613-13625.] Based on the results of the enantiopure thiolactone dose response data, it appears that relatively long or electron withdrawing side chains are excellent antagonists of LasR isolated in the <i>E. coli </i>background. However, natural ligand mimics 1E and 25E are strong agonists for the heterologous LasR system. All of the active compounds in PA01 MW1 (PUM15) (<i>P. aeruginosa </i>natural background) were also active in <i>E. coli </i>DH5&#x3b1; (pJN105L+pSC11). However, a significant number of the compounds active in the <i>E. coli </i>DH5&#x3b1; (pJN105L+pSC11) strain were not active in the <i>P. aeruginosa </i>PA01 MW1 (PUM15) strain. These findings corroborate our hypothesis that when LasR is evaluated in the natural <i>P. aeruginosa </i>background a muted effect is may be seen due to the effects of the other QS systems present in intact <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, such as QscR and the PQS system. A variety of other effects could be contributing to the differences seen between the two strains, including differences in cell permeability.</p>

<p id="p-0196" num="0197">Activity differences between the two strains evaluating LasR raise questions about the integrity and degradation of the ligands since the incubation time in the assay for the heterologous strain is shorter than for the native <i>P. aeruginosa </i>strain. It is well known that the homoserine lactone ring, used by all of the bacterial species of interest as their autoinducer head group, is prone to hydrolysis at pH 7 and above. [Eberhard, A.; Widrig, C. A.; MaBath, P.; Schineller, J. B., Analogs of the autoinducer of bioluminescence in <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>. Arch. Microbiol. 1986, 146, 35-40; Schaefer, A. L.; Hanzelka, B. L.; Eberhard, A.; Greenberg, E. P., Quorum sensing in <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>: Probing autoinducer-LuxR interactions with autoinducer analogs. <i>J. Bacteriol. </i>1996, 178, 2897-2901; Byers, J. T.; C., L.; Salmond, G. P. C.; Welch, M., Nonenzymatic turnover of an <i>Erwinia carotovora </i>quorum sensing signaling molecule. <i>J. Bacteriol. </i>2002, 184, 1163-1171.] Previous literature has indicated that the <i>P. aeruginosa </i>natural autoinducer has a half-life of approximately two days in growth media at 37&#xb0; C., while shorter chain AHLs degrade in even shorter periods of time. [Glansdorp, F. G.; Thomas, G. L.; Lee, J. K.; Dutton, J. M.; Salmond, G. P. C.; Welch, M.; Spring, D. R., Synthesis and stability of small molecule probes for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>quorum sensing modulation. <i>Org. Biomol. Chem. </i>2004, 2, 3329-3336; Yates, E.

E.; Goldner, M.; Dessaux, Y.; Camara, M.; Smith, H.; Williams, P., N-Acylhomoserine lactones undergo lactonolysis in a pH-, temperature-, and acyl chain length dependent manner during growth of <i>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis </i>and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infect. Immun. </i>2002, 70, 5635-5646]</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0198">Finding QS antagonists and agonists that are more hydrolytically stable are of considerable interest, since molecules that hydrolyze rapidly are not ideal therapeutic agents or biological probes. While many of the compounds synthesized in the initial library are non-hydrolyzable, the thiolactone derivative of the natural ligand (1E) is hydrolyzable. However, the differences in activities between the thiolactone derivatives and the natural lactone derivatives make the thiolactone derivatives both worthwhile to pursue as a target and for further half-life experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0199">Table 3 provides a summary of data for the antagonism assay for compounds tested having thiolactone head groups against selected bacteria. Compounds exhibiting 50% or higher inhibition in assays with <i>Escherichia coli </i>and <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </i>and those exhibiting 20% or higher inhibition with <i>Vibrio fischeri </i>are preferred for applications for disrupting bacterial quorum sensing, particularly in <i>Escherichia coli, Agrobacterium tumefaciens </i>and <i>Vibrio fischeri </i>strains, and for inhibiting and/or disrupting biofilm formation, particularly in <i>Escherichia coli, Agrobacterium tumefaciens </i>and <i>Vibrio fischeri </i>strains.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 4</heading>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Comparison of Functional Half-Lives of Autoinducers</heading>
<p id="p-0202" num="0203">A biologically based assay was developed to determine the functional half-life of the <i>P. aeruginosa </i>natural ligand, OdDHL, and the corresponding thiolactone analog (1E). This assay does not directly measure hydrolysis, but rather the ability of the degraded ligand to cause a QS response. However, previous experiments have shown that the hydrolysis half-life for the <i>P. aeruginosa </i>natural ligand, OdDHL, is approximately two days, while racemization of the chiral center was found to be less than 5% over the course of a week. [Glansdorp, F. G.; Thomas, G. L.; Lee, J. K.; Dutton, J. M.; Salmond, G. P. C.; Welch, M.; Spring, D. R., Synthesis and stability of small molecule probes for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>quorum sensing modulation. <i>Org. Biomol. Chem. </i>2004, 2, 3329-3336.] This data suggests that most ligand degradation is due to hydrolysis and not epimerization. In these cases the results were determined by NMR experiments conducted in deuterated buffers. Due to problems with the water solubility of OdDHL, a 50% solution of DMSO was used. Unfortunately, the use of high levels of DMSO reduces the biological relevance of the assay because large concentrations of DMSO cannot be tolerated by biological systems. Furthermore, the required concentrations of ligand are lower in a biologically based functional assay than in an NMR experiment because YFP production is much more sensitive than NMR, which requires relatively high concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0204">In this assay, media, ligand, and antibiotics are prepared in Teflon-capped vials and allowed to incubate at 37&#xb0; C. for predetermined times. <i>P. aeruginosa </i>cells from the strain PA01 MW1 (pUM15) were cultured overnight. These cells were then pelleted and washed with LB containing 50 mM MOPS. After washing, the cells were resuspended in a minimal amount of media containing antibiotics and were added to a 96 well plate containing the media, natural ligand, and antibiotic previously prepared and incubated for specific, predetermined times. At this point, the optical density at 600 nm of the cells was comparable to the optical density after subculturing the cells during a traditional assay. The 96 well plate was incubated for 8 hours and then analyzed for optical density and YFP fluorescence. Bacteria were cultured, pelleted, and washed before addition to the assay plate. A traditional PA01 MW1 assay is completed to analyze for ligand degradation. Fluorescence was normalized to cell density and time points were analyzed as a percentage of the ability of the freshly prepared natural ligand to agonize the <i>P. aeruginosa </i>system. Since we predict that the ligand degradation is a product of hydrolysis, we assumed a pseudo first order rate and plotted the natural log of the agonism as a percent of the fresh natural ligand versus time. The slope of the graph can be used to determine the half-life of the ligand according to the formula t&#xbd;=ln(2)/slope (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0205">We found the half-life for the OdDHL natural ligand to be 48.2 hours. This value corresponds closely with the previously found hydrolysis half-life of approximately two days. [Glansdorp, F. G.; Thomas, G. L.; Lee, J. K.; Dutton, J. M.; Salmond, G. P. C.; Welch, M.; Spring, D. R., Synthesis and stability of small molecule probes for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>quorum sensing modulation. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004, 2, 3329-3336.]</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0206">A similar analysis found the half-life of the thiolactone analog of the OdDHL <i>P. aeruginosa </i>natural ligand (1E) to be 82.3 hours. In the case of both the natural ligand and the thiolactone analog, the half-life of the compounds are sufficiently long so that standard in vitro assays on the time scale of 8 hours or less are testing the ligand in its native form. This is important because previous work has shown that the ring open form of the natural ligand is inactive. [Yates, E. A.; Philipp, B.; Buckley, C.; Atkinson, S.; Chhabra, S. R.; Sockett, R. E.; Goldner, M.; Dessaux, Y.; Camara, M.; Smith, H.; Williams, P., N-Acylhomoserine lactones undergo lactonolysis in a pH-, temperature-, and acyl chain length dependent manner during growth of <i>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis </i>and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Infect. Immun. 2002, 70, 5635-5646; Kapadnis, P. B.; Hall, E.; Ramstedt, M.; Galloway, W. R. J. D.; Welch, M.; Spring, D. R., Towards quorum-quenching catalytic antibodies. Chem. Commun. 2009, (5), 538-540.]</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0207">It is interesting to note that the half-life of 1E is slightly less than double the half-life of OdDHL, the natural ligand. This is particularly intriguing because one would expect the sulfur analog to have a faster hydrolysis rate from an electronics argument. Our current hypothesis is that although compound 1E is able to ring open faster than OdDHL, 1E is also able to recyclize at a faster rate than the natural ligand. Previous analysis of lactone hydrolysis has shown that once ring opened, the lactone does not reclose in appreciable quantities until under pH 2 due to differences in the mechanisms for ring opening and closing. [Yates, E. A.; Philipp, B.; Buckley, C.; Atkinson, S.; Chhabra, S. R.; Sockett, R. E.; Goldner, M.; Dessaux, Y.; Camara, M.; Smith, H.; Williams, P., N-Acylhomoserine lactones undergo lactonolysis in a pH-, temperature-, and acyl chain length dependent manner during growth of <i>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis </i>and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Infect. Immun. 2002, 70, 5635-5646.} In order for the lactone ring to close, the pH must first approach the pKa of the carboxyl group so that significant amounts of the acid as opposed to the acid salt are present. The differences in ring opening and closing mechanisms may cause the natural ligand to take longer to ring open, but remain ring opened, while the sulfur analog would ring open faster and close back up again so that it would have a longer hydrolysis half-life than the natural ligand. Conversely, the sulfur's increased nucleophilicity may be able to hold the lactone ring together in aqueous solution better than the corresponding oxygen.</p>

<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Focused Libraries&#x2014;Non-Hydrolyzable Head Groups</heading>
<p id="p-0207" num="0208">While many of the natural ligands for QS systems contain a lactone ring, it would be advantageous to find QS modulators that are not prone to hydrolysis or degradation. To this end focused libraries based on non-hydrolyzable head groups screened in the initial library were designed, synthesized, and screened. Head groups based upon glycine ethyl ester (16), cyclopentyl amine (3), and aniline (2) were chosen as particularly interesting non-hydrolyzable head groups based on activity in the initial library screens.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0209">The glycine ethyl ester head group is particularly interesting because the stereochemistry has been removed from the head group. The glycine ethyl ester head group is derived from the lactone ring when a disconnection is made between the carbons 2 and 3 in the lactone ring. (Scheme 3).</p>

</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0211">While the compounds of this library (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) are non-natural analogs of the lactone ring, it is interesting that some activity can be observed. One characteristic of this library is that the compounds appear to be cooperative agonists because many of the library members show heightened activity in antagonistic assays and minimal activity in agonistic assays (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>). Compound 34 showed excellent antagonistic activity in <i>V. fischeri</i>. While most library members do not seem to fit as traditional agonists or antagonists, further analysis could yield important information about alternative binding sites or methods, or information about dimerization requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0212">Cyclopentyl amine and aniline were used to synthesize libraries to explore the activity of ligands with a lack of hydrogen bonding capabilities on the head group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (cyclopentyl amine library HG=cyclopentyl), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> (analine library, HG=phenyl)). Agonism and antagonism assays, performed as described above, are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, respectively. While these carbocycles were active when appended with the 3-oxo dodecanoyal containing acyl chain, only moderate activities were observed when paired with acyl tail mimics. These studies show that viable agonists and antagonists can be found either by altering the head group of the natural ligand or by creating acyl tail mimics. However, when both the head group and the acyl tail are modified in the same molecule, the molecule doesn't always combine the activities of the two initial modifications. In fact, the dual modifications are frequently deleterious to the activity of the molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0213">Pursuing QS modulators that are either non-hydrolyzable or hydrolyze slowly allows for new biological probes or therapeutics. It is important for therapeutics to remain biologically active for extended periods of time yet be cleared from the body in a time dependent manner. Compounds like the thiolactone derivatives of this invention may serve as excellent therapeutics because they are active for longer periods of time than the natural lactone analogs, yet do lose activity in a time dependent fashion.</p>
