<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-014663, filed on Jan. 26, 2009. The entire subject matter of the application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the present invention relate to an image forming device to which a replacement having a non-contact type IC tag transmitting and receiving a radio signal conveying information concerning the replacement can be detachably attachable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Image forming devices configured to be able to manage replacements to be attached thereto by performing wireless communication with non-contact type IC tags held on the replacements have been widely used. Regarding such an image forming device, in order to prevent erroneously performing reading/writing information with respect to a non-contact type IC tag of a replacement which is not attached to the image forming device (e.g., a non-contact type IC tag placed outside the image forming device), the image forming device is required to distinguish a replacement attached to the image forming device from a replacement which is not attached to the image forming device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is possible to distinguish a replacement attached to the image forming device from a replacement not attached to the image forming device by configuring the image forming device to have attachment terminals which are electrically connected to detection contacts of the replacement in the state where the replacement is attached to the image forming device. However, even if such a configuration is adopted, a possibility remains that a contact failure occurs between the attachment terminals of the image forming device and the detection contacts of the replacement</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aspects of the present invention are advantageous in that at least one of an image forming device and a replacement configured to reliably identify the replacement attached to the image forming device is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided an image forming device to which a replacement is detachably attachable. The replacement comprises: a non-contact type IC tag that stores data concerning the replacement and is able to transmit the data through a radio signal; a holding member that holds the non-contact type IC tag; and a shielding member formed to alter a state of the non-contact type IC tag between an exposed state where the non-contact type IC tag is exposed and a detection unit of the image forming device is able to detect the non-contact type IC tag, and a shielded state where the detection unit is not able to detect the non-contact type IC tag, by changing relatively a positional relationship with the holding member. The image forming device comprises: the detection unit configured to detect the non-contact types IC tag by receiving the radio signal transmitted from the non-contact type IC tag; a driving unit configured to drive at least one of the holding member and the shielding member to change the state of the non-contact type IC tag between the exposed state and the shielded state; and a controller that identifies the non-contact type IC tag detected by the detection unit as that provided in the replacement being attached to the image forming device in response to a fact that the non-contact type IC tag is intermittently detected by the detection unit while the driving unit is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is noted that various connections are set forth between elements in the following description. It is noted that these connections in general and unless specified otherwise, may be direct or indirect and that this specification is not intended to be limiting in this respect. Aspects of the invention may be implemented in computer software as programs storable on computer-readable media including but not limited to RAMs, ROMs, flash memory, EEPROMs, CD-media, DVD-media, temporary storage, hard disk drives, floppy drives, permanent storage, and the like.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Hereafter, an embodiment according to the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a printer <b>1</b> according to an embodiment includes a control unit <b>11</b>, a non-volatile memory <b>12</b>, an operation unit <b>13</b>, a display panel <b>14</b>, a recordation unit <b>15</b>, a wireless communication unit <b>16</b>, and a communication interface <b>17</b> used to communicate with external devices, such as a device on a network or a device locally connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The control unit <b>11</b> is implemented, for example, by a microcomputer chip in which a CPU, a RAM and a ROM are embedded. The control unit <b>11</b> totally controls the printer <b>1</b>. The control unit <b>11</b> executes a print process for printing an image on a recording medium based on print data received, for example, from an information processing device, via the communication interface <b>17</b>. The non-volatile memory <b>12</b> stores programs and various types of data for achieving the functions of the printer <b>1</b>. The operation unit <b>13</b> includes a plurality of keys to be operated by a user. The display panel <b>14</b> is, for example, a liquid crystal panel on which various types of information is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The recordation unit <b>15</b> forms an image on a recording medium, such as a sheet of paper. The recordation unit <b>15</b> is configured such that image formation units can be detachably attachable to the recordation unit <b>15</b>. The image formation units (i.e., replacements) detachably attachable to the recordation unit <b>15</b> include, for example, a paper supply cartridge which accommodates sheets of paper, a drum cartridge which transfers developer (e.g., toner) to a sheet of paper, and a developer cartridge which accommodates developer (e.g., toner). It should be noted that although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> only one replacement <b>21</b> (which is detachably attachable to the recordation unit <b>15</b>) is illustrated, practically more than one cartridge type replacement can be detachably attachable to the recordation unit <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">If the replacement <b>21</b> to be attached to the recordation unit <b>15</b> is the paper supply cartridge, the replacement <b>21</b> has a paper supply roller. If the replacement <b>21</b> is the drum cartridge, the replacement <b>21</b> has a photosensitive drum or a transfer roller. If the replacement <b>21</b> is the developer cartridge, the replacement <b>21</b> has a developer supply roller. That is, each type of replacement has a rotational member for achieving the function of each replacement. Accordingly, the recordation unit <b>15</b> has a driving unit <b>151</b> which rotates each rotational member of the replacement <b>21</b> with a motor driven by an on/off signal output by the control unit <b>11</b>. That is, in the state where the replacement <b>21</b> is attached to the recordation unit <b>15</b>, the driving force of the driving unit <b>151</b> of the recordation unit <b>15</b> is transmitted to the rotational member of the replacement <b>21</b> (see arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">On the other hand, the replacement <b>21</b> is provided with a non-contact type IC tag (RFID tag) <b>31</b>, a holding member <b>22</b> which holds the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>, a shielding member <b>23</b> which alters a state of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> between an exposed state where the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is exposed to be read by the wireless communication unit <b>16</b> and a shielded state where the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is shielded by the shielding member <b>23</b> not to be read by the wireless communication unit <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> stores identification information (ID) and specifications of the replacement <b>21</b>, and is able to transmit such information stored therein through wireless communication with the wireless communication unit <b>16</b>. Furthermore, the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is able to stored information received from the wireless communication unit <b>16</b> of the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">One of the shielding member <b>23</b> and the holding member <b>22</b> holding the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is formed integrally with a rotation shaft of each roller of the replacement <b>21</b> or is configured to be rotatable in conjunction with the rotation shaft of the replacement <b>21</b>. In this configuration, when the roller of the replacement <b>21</b> is rotated by the driving unit <b>151</b>, a positional relationship between the holding member <b>22</b> and the shielding member <b>23</b> changes in response to rotation of the roller, and therefore the state of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> alternately alters between the exposed state and the shielded state. Details (e.g., motions and shapes) of the holding member <b>22</b> and the shielding member <b>23</b> will be explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The wireless communication unit <b>16</b> is configured as an IC reader and writer which, under control of the control unit <b>11</b>, reads data from and writes data to the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> provided in the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the recordation unit <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described in detail below, the printer <b>1</b> is configured such that based on the ID and the specifications read from the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> provided in the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b>, the printer <b>1</b> manages the replacement <b>21</b>. When a plurality of types of replacements are attached to the printer <b>1</b>, the printer <b>1</b> identifies each replacement by detecting ID of each replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is required to prevent erroneously detecting a non-contact type IC tag of a replacement which is placed within a wireless communication range but is not attached to the printer <b>1</b>, and thereby erroneously judging that the replacement including such a non-contact type IC is attached to the printer <b>1</b>. For this reason, the printer <b>1</b> according to the embodiment is configured to be able to reliably distinguish a replacement attached to the printer <b>1</b> from a replacement not attached to the printer <b>1</b> as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hereafter, the holding member <b>22</b> and the shielding member <b>23</b> are explained in detail by providing four types of examples (1<sup>st </sup>to 4<sup>th </sup>Examples) of the holding member <b>22</b> and the shielding member <b>23</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">1<sup>st </sup>Example</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the 1<sup>st </sup>example, the holding member <b>22</b> is configured to rotate, and the shielding member <b>23</b> is fixed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, on a side surface of the replacement <b>21</b>, a roller shaft is protruded, and a rotatable holding member (holding member <b>22</b>) is formed by an end portion of the roller shaft. On an outer circumferential surface of a cylindrical shape of the holding member <b>22</b>, the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is held. The holding member <b>22</b> rotates about a rotation axis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> in accordance with rotation of the roller of the replacement <b>21</b>. Therefore, the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> held on the outer circumferential surface of the holding member <b>22</b> rotates about the rotation axis with rotation of the holding member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The holding member <b>22</b> is made of material (e.g., metal) which shields a radio wave transmitted and received by the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>. Therefore, the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> has such directivity that the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is able to communicate only on the front side of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The shielding member <b>23</b> has a cylindrical shape having an inner diameter which is slightly larger than an outer diameter of the cylindrical shape of the holding member <b>22</b>. Further, the shielding member <b>23</b> is formed such that a part of the cylindrical shape is removed along an axis of the cylindrical shape. That is, the shielding member <b>23</b> has a cross sectional shape having a form of a letter &#x201c;C&#x201d;. The shielding member <b>23</b> is fixed to a casing of the replacement <b>21</b> such that a center axis of the cylindrical shape of the shielding member <b>23</b> coincides with the rotation axis of the holding member <b>22</b>, and that a cylindrical inner surface of the shielding member <b>23</b> surrounds an outer circumferential surface of the holding member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The shielding member <b>23</b> is made of material (e.g., metal) which shields a radio wave transmitted and received by the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>. Therefore, by covering the front side of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> held on the holding member <b>22</b> with a part of the shielding member <b>23</b> other than the removed part, it is possible to move the wireless condition to a state where the wireless communication unit <b>16</b> is unable to detect the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the above described configuration regarding the holding member <b>22</b> and the shielding member <b>23</b>, when the holding member <b>22</b> (provided to be rotatable) is rotated to move the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> relative to the shielding member <b>23</b>, the positional relationship of the holding member <b>22</b> and the shielding member <b>23</b> repeatedly alters between the state where the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is covered by the shielding member <b>23</b> and the state where the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is exposed through the removed part of the shielding member <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, when the front side of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is situated at the removed part of the shielding member <b>23</b>, the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is in an exposed state where the wireless communication unit <b>16</b> of the printer <b>1</b> is able to detect and read the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>. On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, when the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is covered by the shielding member <b>23</b>, the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is in a shielded state where the wireless communication <b>16</b> of the printer <b>1</b> is unable to detect and read the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> because in this case a radio wave is shielded by the shielding member <b>23</b> and the holding member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the above described configuration, by rotating the holding member <b>22</b> at a constant speed by the driving unit <b>151</b>, a detection pattern of a radio signal of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> by the wireless communication unit <b>16</b> becomes a pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, during a time period where the driving unit <b>151</b> is activated, the radio wave of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected each time the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> makes one rotation together with the holding member <b>22</b>. By continuing rotations of the holding member <b>22</b>, the detection pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> where a short time of detection appears repeatedly is obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">2<sup>nd </sup>Example</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the 2<sup>nd </sup>example, the holding member <b>22</b> is fixed, and the shielding member <b>23</b> is rotatable (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, on a side surface of the replacement <b>21</b>, a roller shaft is protruded, and a rotatable shielding member (the shielding member <b>23</b>) is formed by an end portion of the roller shaft. The shielding member <b>23</b> has a cylindrical shape having an inner diameter which is slightly larger than an outer diameter of a cylindrical shape of the holding member <b>22</b>. Further, the shielding member <b>23</b> is formed such that a part of a cylindrical shape is removed along an axis of the cylindrical shape. That is, the shielding member <b>23</b> has a cross sectional shape having a form of a letter &#x201c;C&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, the shielding member <b>23</b> is located such that an inner circumferential surface thereof surrounds the circumferential surface of the cylindrical holding member <b>22</b>. The shielding member <b>23</b> is provided to rotate about a rotation axis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> in accordance with rotation of the roller of the replacement <b>21</b>. That is, the shielding member <b>23</b> rotates around the holding member <b>22</b>. The shielding member <b>23</b> is made of material (e.g. metal) which is able to shield a radio wave transmitted and received by the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>. Therefore, by covering the front side of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> held on the holding member <b>22</b> with a part of the shielding member <b>23</b> other than the removed part, it is possible to move the wireless condition to a state where the wireless communication unit <b>16</b> is unable to detect the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the other hand, the holding member <b>22</b> holds the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> on the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical shape thereof.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, when the removed part of the shielding member <b>23</b> is moved to the position at which the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is held and thereby the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is brought to the exposed state where the front side of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is exposed through the removed part of the shielding member <b>23</b>, the wireless communication unit <b>16</b> of the printer <b>1</b> becomes able to detect and read the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">3<sup>rd </sup>Example</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the following, the 3<sup>rd </sup>example of the configurations of the holding member <b>22</b> and the shielding member <b>23</b> is explained. In the 3<sup>nd </sup>example which is different from the first and second examples, the holding member <b>22</b> is rotatable and the shielding member <b>23</b> is fixed, and in this configuration the state of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> alters between the exposed state and the shielded state (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, on a side surface of the replacement <b>21</b>, a roller shaft is protruded, and a rotatable holding member (holding member <b>22</b>) is formed by an end portion of the roller shaft. The holding member <b>22</b> hold the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> on an end face of a cylindrical part thereof, and rotates about a rotation axis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> with rotation of a roller in the replacement <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">More specifically, the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is located on the end face of the cylindrical part at a position shifted from the rotation axis toward the periphery side, so that the non-contact type IC <b>31</b> rotates about the rotation axis in accordance with rotation of the holding member <b>22</b>. The holding member <b>22</b> is made of material (e.g., metal) which is able to shield a radio wave transmitted and received by the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>. Therefore, the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> held on the holding member <b>22</b> has such directivity that the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is able to communicate only on the front side of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">On the other hand, the shielding member <b>23</b> has a cylindrical shape whose inner diameter is slightly larger than the outer diameter of the holding member <b>22</b>.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, a hole (a detection window <b>231</b>) is formed in the lid plate of the shielding member <b>23</b>.

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">4<sup>th </sup>Example</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the following, the 4<sup>th </sup>example of the configurations of the holding member <b>22</b> and the shielding member <b>23</b> is explained. The 4<sup>th </sup>example is a variation of the 3<sup>rd </sup>example. In the 4<sup>th </sup>example, a plurality of detection windows <b>231</b> are formed in the lid plate of the shielding member <b>23</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, two holes (detection widows <b>231</b>) are formed in the lid plate of the shielding member <b>23</b> which covers the rotatable holding member <b>22</b>. The two detection windows <b>231</b> are formed along a track of rotation of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the holding member <b>22</b> is rotated at a constant speed by the driving unit <b>151</b> in this configuration of the replacement <b>21</b>, a detection pattern of a radio signal of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> by the wireless communication unit <b>16</b> becomes a pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, during a time period where the driving unit <b>151</b> is activated, the radio wave of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected two times for one rotation of the holding member <b>22</b> and the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>. By continuing rotations of the holding member <b>22</b>, the detection pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> where two-time detection per one rotation cycle appears repeatedly is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It is understood that by increasing the number of detection windows <b>231</b> of the shielding member <b>23</b>, it becomes possible to increase counts of detection for one rotation cycle. It is also possible to change timing of detection of a radio signal within one rotation cycle by changing a positional relationship between the detection windows <b>231</b>. In other words, by varying the number of detection windows and positions of detection windows, it becomes possible to provide a unique detection pattern for each replacement <b>21</b>. It is also possible to configure the printer <b>1</b> to be able to identify the type of the replacement <b>21</b> by differentiating the detection patterns among the replacements as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Hereafter, four examples (detection processes (<b>1</b>) to (<b>4</b>)) of a detection process for identifying the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> are explained. The detection processes (<b>1</b>) to (<b>4</b>) are executed under control of the control unit <b>11</b> with the above described 1st to 4th examples of the configuration of the holding member <b>22</b> and the shielding member <b>23</b>, respectively. In the following, an expression like &#x201c;rotate the driving unit <b>151</b>&#x201d; means that one of the holding member <b>22</b> and the shielding member <b>23</b> provided to be rotatable is rotated by rotating the driving unit <b>151</b> so that the state of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is altered between the exposed state and the shielded state.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The detection process (<b>1</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is executed at predetermined timing when identification of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> is required. For example, the predetermined timing includes timing when the printer <b>1</b> is turned on, and timing when an opening or closing operation for a cover used to replace the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">First, the control unit <b>11</b> operates to detect identification of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> through the wireless communication unit <b>16</b> for a predetermined time period in a state where the driving unit <b>151</b> is stopped (step S<b>101</b>). Detection of the identification of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is executed by continuously transmitting, from the wireless communication unit <b>16</b>, a request signal for requesting a replay to non-contact type IC tags <b>31</b> existing within a communication range, and by receiving identification transmitted from the non-contact type IC tags existing within the communication range. It should be noted that the non-contact type IC tags within the communication range include the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> in the inside of the printer <b>1</b> and the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> in another printer.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In step S<b>101</b>, when an ID equal to one of IDs registered in a detection exception list is detected, such an ID is neglected. That is, even when such an ID in the detection exception list is detected, the control unit <b>11</b> judges that no ID is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, in step S<b>102</b>, the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether an ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected based on a result of the detection for the predetermined time period in step S<b>101</b>. When the control unit <b>11</b> judges that an ID is detected (S<b>102</b>: YES), control proceeds to step S<b>103</b> where the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether a detection pattern of the ID is a periodic pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">If the ID is periodically detected even when the driving unit <b>151</b> is stopped, it can be judged that an ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>, whose alternating state between the exposed state and the shielded state is being detected in another printer existing around the printer <b>1</b>, is detected in the printer <b>1</b>. Therefore, in this case (S<b>103</b>: YES), the control unit <b>11</b> judges that the replacement <b>21</b> corresponding to the periodically detected ID is not a replacement attached to the printer <b>1</b>, and registers such an ID in the detection exception list (step S<b>104</b>). Then, control returns to step S<b>101</b>. The detection exception list is a list of IDs of replacements <b>21</b> which are regarded as not being attached to the printer <b>1</b>. IDs registered in the detection exception list are treated as targets to be excepted from detection results by the wireless communication unit <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When the control unit <b>11</b> judges that no ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected (S<b>102</b>: NO), or the control unit <b>11</b> judges that the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is not periodically detected but is detected continuously (S<b>103</b>: NO), control proceeds to step S<b>105</b> where the control unit <b>11</b> outputs a signal for turning on the driving unit <b>151</b> to start rotation (step S<b>105</b>). By starting to rotate the driving unit <b>151</b>, the state of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> starts to alter between the exposed state and the shielded state.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Then, the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether an ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> being rotated by the driving unit <b>151</b> is detected (step S<b>106</b>). It should be noted that when an ID equal to an ID registered in the detection exception list is detected, the control unit <b>11</b> neglects such an ID registered in the detection exception list. On the other hand, when the control unit <b>11</b> judges that no ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected (S<b>106</b>: NO), the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether a predetermined time has elapsed (i.e., whether timeout occurs) (step S<b>108</b>). When the predetermined time has not elapsed (S<b>108</b>: NO), control returns to step S<b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When the control unit <b>11</b> judges that an ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected (S<b>106</b>: YES), control proceeds to step S<b>107</b> where the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether a detection pattern of the ID is periodic.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When the control unit <b>11</b> judges that the detection patter is not periodic but is continuous (S<b>107</b>: NO), control proceeds to step S<b>108</b> to make a judgment regarding a lapse of the timeout as described above.</p>

More specifically, in step S<b>109</b>, when the printer <b>1</b> is configured such that a plurality of replacements <b>21</b> can be attached at the same time, the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether a plurality of IDs are detected, and further judges whether the detected plurality of IDs indicate the same type of replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When a plurality of IDs are not detected or when all the detected plurality of IDs indicate different types of replacements, the judgment result in step S<b>109</b> becomes &#x201c;NO&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If it is judged in step S<b>109</b> that the control unit <b>11</b> detects a single ID periodically, but not the plurality of non-contact types IC tags (S<b>109</b>: NO), the control unit <b>11</b> judges that the detected ID is the ID of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> (step S<b>110</b>). Then, the control unit <b>11</b> outputs a signal for turning off to the driving unit <b>151</b> to stop the rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> (step S<b>111</b>). Then, the detection process (<b>1</b>) terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It should be noted that when the control unit <b>11</b> stops the driving unit <b>151</b>, the control unit <b>11</b> controls the rotation angle of the motor so the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> is brought to the shielded state. As a result, a possibility, that the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> is detected when the detection is made next in a state where the driving unit <b>151</b> is stopped, becomes low, and thereby it becomes easier to identify the replacement <b>21</b> not attached to the printer <b>1</b>, with exception of the case where power of the printer <b>1</b> is accidentally cut off while the driving unit <b>151</b> is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">On the other hand, when it is judged in step S<b>108</b> that the timeout occurs in a state where no ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> has been detected from the beginning of rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> in step S<b>105</b> (S<b>106</b>: NO) or when it is judged in step S<b>108</b> that the occurs in a state where an ID is detected continuously (S<b>107</b>: NO), control proceeds to step S<b>112</b>.

If an ID has been detected in step S<b>112</b>, the control unit <b>11</b> may register such an ID in the detection exception list. After step S<b>112</b> is processed, the control unit <b>11</b> outputs a power off signal to the driving unit <b>151</b> to stop rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> (step S<b>111</b>).

In this case, the control unit <b>11</b> controls the motor of the replacement <b>21</b> so that the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement is brought to the shielded state.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Detecting periodically the IDs of the plurality of non-contact type IC tags <b>31</b> during rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> means that the control unit <b>11</b> has detected not only the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> but also the non-contact type IC tag provided in another printer in which the ID is detected while rotating the driving unit.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">For this reason, first, the control unit <b>11</b> stops the driving unit <b>151</b> of the printer <b>1</b> (i.e., its own driving unit <b>151</b>) (step S<b>113</b>), and sets a randomly selected detection time (step S<b>114</b>). Then, control returns to step S<b>101</b> to try to detect the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> during the detection time set in step S<b>114</b> while stopping the driving unit <b>151</b>. If the ID is periodically detected during the detection time (S<b>103</b>: YES), the control unit <b>11</b> judges that the replacement <b>21</b> corresponding to the detected ID is a replacement not attached to the printer <b>1</b>, and in this case the control unit <b>11</b> registers the detected ID in the detection exception list (step S<b>104</b>). As a result, the wireless condition moves to a state where non-contact IC tags <b>31</b> of the replacements <b>21</b> attached to other printers are not detected.

The retry is executed, for example, three times, and if it is judged that the changed number is not minus one after the third retry, the control unit <b>11</b> judges that a detection error occurs, and the detection process (<b>3</b>) terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">On the other hand, when the control unit <b>11</b> judges that the changed number is minus one (S<b>320</b>: YES), the control unit <b>11</b> judges the only one ID, which the control unit <b>11</b> becomes unable to detect, to be an ID of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> (step S<b>321</b>). Then, the detection process (<b>3</b>) terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Detection Process (<b>4</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The detection process (<b>4</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is executed at predetermined timing when identification of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> is required. For example, the predetermined timing includes timing when the printer <b>1</b> is turned on, and timing when an opening or closing operation for a cover used to replace the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">First, the control unit <b>11</b> sets a randomly selected value as a rotation speed of the rotatable holding member <b>22</b> or the rotatable shielding member <b>23</b> to be rotated by the driving unit <b>151</b> (step S<b>401</b>). In this case, the randomly selected rotation speed may be determined based on random numbers or may be determined as a value unique to a product based on a serial number of the product. Then, the control unit <b>11</b> outputs a power-on signal for turning on the driving unit <b>151</b> to start rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> so that the driving unit <b>151</b> rotates at the randomly selected rotation speed set in step S<b>401</b> (step S<b>402</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">By starting rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b>, the state of the non-contact IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> alters between the exposed state and the shielded state. Next, the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether an ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected as a continuous detection pattern during rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> (step S<b>403</b>). In this case, when an ID equal to one of IDs registered in the detection exception list is detected, such an ID is neglected. That is, even when such an ID in the detection exception list is detected, the control unit <b>11</b> judges that no ID is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">If it is judged in step S<b>403</b> that the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected continuously, it can be judged that the control unit <b>11</b> does not detect the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b>, but detects the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> which lies around the printer <b>1</b> and is in a stopped state. Therefore, in this case, the control unit <b>11</b> judges the continuously detected ID to be an ID of the replacement which is not attached to the printer <b>1</b>, and registers the detected ID in the detection exception list (step S<b>404</b>). Then, the control proceeds to step S<b>405</b>. The detection exception list is a list of IDs of replacements <b>21</b> which are regarded as not being attached to the printer <b>1</b>. IDs registered in the detection exception list are treated as targets to be excepted from detection results by the wireless communication unit <b>16</b>. When the control unit <b>11</b> judges that the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is not detected in the continuous detection pattern (S<b>403</b>: NO), control proceeds to step S<b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In step S<b>405</b>, the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected in a periodic pattern. In this case, when an ID equal to an ID stored in the detection exception list is detected, the control unit <b>11</b> neglects such an ID. When the control unit <b>11</b> judges that the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is not detected (S<b>405</b>: NO), control proceeds to step S<b>406</b> where the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether a predetermined time has elapsed from the beginning of rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> (step S<b>406</b>). That is, the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether a timeout occurs (step S<b>406</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">If the timeout does not occur (S<b>406</b>: NO), control returns to step S<b>403</b>. On the other hand, if the predetermined time has elapsed from the beginning of rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> in the state where the periodic detection pattern of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is not detected (S<b>405</b>: NO and S<b>406</b>: YES), the control unit <b>11</b> stops rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> (step S<b>407</b>). Then, the control unit <b>11</b> judges that no replacement <b>21</b> is attached to the printer <b>1</b> (step S<b>408</b>). Then, the detection process (<b>4</b>) terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">On the other hand, when the control unit <b>11</b> judges that the periodic detection pattern of the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected during rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b>, control proceeds to step S<b>409</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Detecting periodically the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> during rotation of the during unit <b>151</b> means that there are possibilities including a possibility that the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> is detected and a possibility that the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to another printer in which the ID is being detected while rotating the driving unit is detected. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the control unit <b>11</b> detects the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> and the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement attached to another printer. Therefore, in this case, it is required to identify whether the periodically detected ID is an ID of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> or an ID of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to another printer.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">For this reason, in step S<b>409</b>, the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether a detection cycle of the ID which is periodically detected is in synchronization with the rotation speed of the driving unit <b>151</b> (i.e., the randomly selected rotation speed set in step S<b>401</b>) (step S<b>409</b>). That is, the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected in a cycle in synchronization with a cycle of rotation of the rotatable holding member <b>22</b> or the rotatable shielding member <b>23</b> which is rotated by the driving unit <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">When the control unit <b>11</b> judges that the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected in the detection cycle which is not in synchronization with the rotation speed of the driving unit <b>151</b> (S<b>409</b>: NO), the control unit <b>11</b> registers such an ID of which detection cycle is not in synchronization with the rotation speed of the driving unit <b>151</b>, in the detection exception list (step S<b>410</b>). As a result, the wireless condition of the printer <b>1</b> is brought to the state where the non-contact type ID tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to another printer is not detected. In other words, when the detection cycle of the ID of the non-contact type I tag <b>31</b> is not in synchronization with the randomly selected rotation speed, it can be judged that such an ID is an ID of the replacement attached to another printer in which the driving unit <b>151</b> is rotated at a different speed (which is different from the randomly selected rotation speed of the driving unit <b>151</b> in the printer <b>1</b>). It should be understood that the control unit <b>11</b> sets a randomly selected rotation speed so as to intentionally shift the rotation speed of the driving unit <b>151</b> with respect to the rotation speed of the driving unit rotated in another printer.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">On the other hand, when the control unit <b>11</b> judges that the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is detected in the detection cycle which is in synchronization with the rotation speed of the driving unit <b>151</b> (S<b>409</b>: YES), the control unit <b>11</b> stops rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> (step S<b>411</b>). Then, the control unit <b>11</b> judges whether the number of IDs whose detection cycle is in synchronization with the rotation speed of the driving unit <b>151</b> is one (step S<b>412</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">When the number of IDs whose detection cycle is in synchronization with the rotation speed of the driving unit <b>151</b> is larger than one (i.e., a plurality of IDs whose detection cycle is in synchronization with the rotation speed of the driving unit <b>151</b> are detected) (S<b>412</b>: NO), control returns to step S<b>401</b> to retry the detection process. The retry is executed, for example, three times, and if it is judged that a plurality of IDs whose detection cycle is in synchronization with the rotation speed of the driving unit <b>151</b>, the control unit <b>11</b> judges that a detection error occurs, and the detection process (<b>4</b>) terminates.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Hereafter, a deletion process for deleting the detection exception list stored in the above described detection processes (<b>1</b>) to (<b>4</b>) is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As described above, the non-contact type IC tags <b>31</b> corresponding to the IDs registered in the detection exception list are excepted from detection results by the wireless communication unit <b>16</b>. Therefore, if the ID of the replacement <b>21</b> to be newly connected to the printer <b>1</b> has not been removed from the detection exception list, the printer <b>1</b> is not able to detect the replacement <b>21</b> when the replacement <b>21</b> is attached to the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">For this reason, the control unit <b>11</b> deletes the contents of the detection exception list when a predetermined condition where there is a possibility that a certain replacement <b>21</b> is attached to the printer <b>1</b> is satisfied. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the control unit <b>11</b> deletes the contents of the detection exception list when power of the printer <b>1</b> is tuned from OFF to ON (step S<b>501</b>). With this configuration, it becomes possible to detect the replacement <b>21</b> when the replacement <b>21</b> is attached to the printer <b>1</b> during the power off state of the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the contents of the detection exception list may be deleted when attaching or detaching of the replacement <b>21</b> is detected (step S<b>601</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Hereafter, advantages of the above described embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">(a) As described above, the printer <b>1</b> operates to change the state of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> between the exposed state and the shielded state, and judges the replacement <b>21</b> having the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>, which has been periodically detected in synchronization with the control by the control unit <b>11</b>, to be an attachment attached to the printer <b>1</b>. With this configuration, it becomes possible to securely distinguish the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> from the replacement placed around the printer <b>1</b> or the replacement <b>21</b> attached to another printer installed around the printer <b>1</b>. In this case, by periodically detecting the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> during the ON state of the motor of the control unit <b>151</b>, it becomes possible to securely identify the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b>. According to the embodiment, a structure where a non-contact type IC tag attached to a holding member of a replacement is mechanically or electrically connected to the printer <b>1</b> is not adopted. Such a configuration is able to eliminate the concern of contacting failure between the replacement <b>21</b> and the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">(b) Since the rotation structure such as a roller provided in the replacement <b>21</b> is utilized as the rotating holding member <b>22</b> or the rotating shielding member <b>23</b>, there is no need for providing a dedicated structure for rotating the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b>. Such a configuration is advantageous in regard to manufacturing cost and downsizing. Furthermore, in the printer <b>1</b>, the driving unit <b>151</b> provided for driving the rotation structure (i.e., the roller) is used also as a driving unit for driving the rotating holding member or the rotating shielding member. That is, a dedicated driving unit for driving the rotating holding member or the rotating shielding member is not required. Such a configuration is advantages in regard to the manufacturing cost and downsizing.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">(c) Detecting periodically the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> regardless of the fact that the driving unit <b>151</b> in the printer <b>1</b> is not rotated means that the printer <b>1</b> has detected the non-contact type IC tag in another printer in which the driving unit is rotated while the state of the non-contact IC tag <b>31</b> is altered between the exposed state and the shielded state. Therefore, the printer <b>1</b> is able to identify that such an non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> detected periodically in such a situation is the non-contact type IC tag of the replacement <b>21</b> not attached to the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">(d) By registering the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> periodically detected in the state where the driving unit <b>151</b> is not detected, and by removing the non-contact type IC tag <b>21</b> corresponding to the ID registered in the detection exception list, it becomes possible to distinguish easily the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> from the replacement <b>21</b> attached to another printer.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">(e) When the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is not periodically detected in the state where the driving unit <b>151</b> is not rotated, the printer <b>1</b> operates to detect the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> after starting rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b>. That is, the situation where the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is not periodically detected in the state where the driving unit <b>151</b> is not rotated corresponds to the case where no non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> is detected or the case where at least one of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> and the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> existing around the printer <b>1</b> is detected. By detecting the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> by starting rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> from such a situation, it becomes possible to securely identify the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">(f) Detecting periodically each of a plurality of non-contact type IC tags <b>31</b> during rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> means that the printer <b>1</b> simultaneously detects the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> and the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> provided in another printer in which the state of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is altered between the exposed state and the shielded state. Therefore, in such a situation, the printer <b>1</b> operates to detect the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> after stopping once the rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b>, and when the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is periodically detected, the printer <b>1</b> judges that the replacement <b>21</b> corresponding to the detected non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> to be a replacement attached to the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">(g) When each of the plurality of non-contact type IC tags <b>31</b> is detected in the state where the driving unit <b>151</b> is rotated, it is possible to intentionally shift the operation timing of the printer <b>1</b> from the operation timing of another printer by setting a randomly selected detection time and then executing the detection while stopping the rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> for the detection time.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">(h) When each of the plurality of non-contact type IC tags <b>31</b> is detected in the state where the driving unit <b>151</b> is rotated, it is possible to intentionally shift the operation timing of the printer <b>1</b> from the operation timing of another printer by setting a randomly selected detection time and then continuously executing the detection while keeping the rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b> for the detection time.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">(i) When the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is periodically detected in the state where the driving unit <b>151</b> is rotated, it is possible to intentionally shift the stop timing of the driving unit <b>151</b> of the printer <b>1</b> from the stop timing of the driving unit of another printer installed near to the printer <b>1</b> by setting a randomly selected value for the rotation time of the driving unit <b>151</b>. Furthermore, by judging the ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> whose wireless condition moves to the state of being not detected, to be the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b>, it becomes possible to identify the replacement <b>21</b> among a plurality of printers.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">(j) The printer <b>1</b> is configured to detect the ID at a unique cycle corresponding to the rotation speed of the driving unit <b>151</b> set as a randomly selected value by the printer <b>1</b>. With this configuration, even when a plurality of IDs of the non-contact type IC tags <b>31</b> are simultaneously detected or even when the detection is performed in the state where the driving units of two printers are rotated in the situation where the replacement <b>21</b> is attached to only one of the two printers, it is possible to securely identify the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">(k) When the control unit <b>11</b> stops the rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b>, the control unit <b>11</b> operates such that the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> is in the shielded state. With this configuration, it becomes possible to decrease the possibility that, at the next execution of detection, the control unit <b>11</b> detects the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to the printer <b>1</b> in the state where the driving unit <b>151</b> is not rotated. Therefore, it becomes possible to easily identify the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> not connected to the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">(l) When the printer <b>1</b> is turned ON or when a predetermined operation concerning attaching or detaching of the replacement <b>21</b> is detected, the printer <b>1</b> deletes the contents of the detection exception list. Therefore, when the replacement <b>21</b> which was registered in the detection exception list and has already been removed from the detection exception list is newly attached to the printer <b>1</b>, the printer <b>1</b> becomes able to judge such a replacement <b>21</b> to be a replacement attached to the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, other embodiments are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In the above described embodiment, the state of the non-contact type IC tag is altered between the exposed state and the shielded state by rotating one of the holding member and the shielding member of the replacement. However, various types of motion of members can be adopted to alter the state of the non-contact type IC tag between the exposed state and the shielded state.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">For example, by reciprocating or opening or closing a shielding member (e.g., a shutter type shielding member) to cover or expose the non-contact IC tag, it is possible to alter the state of the non-contact type IC tag between the exposed state and the shielded state.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Alternatively, by reciprocating the holding member holding the non-contact type IC tag relative to the shielding member, the state of the non-contact type IC tag may be altered between the exposed state and the shielded state.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In the above described embodiment, the periodic detection pattern is utilized for detection of the non-contact type IC tag. However, various types of detection patterns based on an intermittent basis may be adopted for detection of the non-contact type IC tag. For example, a random detection pattern may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In the above described embodiment, the rotation structure (e.g., a roller) of the replacement is utilized to rotate one of the holding member and the shielding member of the replacement. However, if the replacement does not have such a rotation structure, the replacement may be provided with a dedicated structure for detecting the non-contact type IC tag. In this case, the printer <b>1</b> may have a dedicated driving unit for detection of the non-contact type IC tag.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The above described detection processes (<b>1</b>) to (<b>4</b>) may be applied to a printer provided with a sensor for detecting presence/absence of the replacement. In this case, it becomes possible to further securely detect the replacement attached to the printer <b>1</b> by using the detection result of the sensor for detecting presence/absence of the replacement as well as the detection processes (<b>1</b>) to (<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In each of the detection processes (<b>3</b>) and (<b>4</b>), before the detection of IDs of the non-contact type IC tags <b>31</b> may be performed by starting rotation of the driving unit <b>151</b>, the printer <b>1</b> may perform the detection while stopping the driving unit and register the periodically detected ID in the detection exception list. More specifically, before step S<b>301</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) of the detection process (<b>3</b>) or before step S<b>401</b> of the detection process (<b>4</b>), the control unit <b>11</b> may execute steps corresponding to S<b>101</b> to S<b>104</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the detection process (<b>1</b>). With this configuration, it becomes possible to decrease the possibility that the printer <b>1</b> periodically detect he ID of the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> of the replacement <b>21</b> attached to another printer during the detection for the non-contact type IC tag <b>31</b> while rotating the driving unit <b>151</b> of the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
