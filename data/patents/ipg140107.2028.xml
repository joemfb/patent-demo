<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, a filtering and condensing apparatus of a suction type has been adopted in order to condense agglomerated sludge generated at a water purification plan, for instance. One example of such an apparatus is disclosed by Japanese Patent Publication HEI03-23203.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This filtering and condensing apparatus comprises a sludge tank for containing sludge which is to be filtered and condensed, and a plurality of filtering plates disposed to be adjacent to each other so as to be aligned with each other in the sludge tank, each of which extends in a vertical direction of the sludge tank. Each of the filtering plates includes a supporting plate and a filtering cloth in a bag form which is integrally sewed on the supporting plate and houses the supporting plate to form a filtering chamber therein. A fixing frame is provided so as to surround each of the filtering plates. A filtrate discharging tube is communicated with the filtering chamber in order for the filtrate to be discharged through the filtering chamber. In addition, a suction portion for sucking the filtering cloth through the filtering chamber and an expansion portion for expanding the filtering cloth through the filtering chamber are provided, and coil springs for constantly exerting a tension force on each of the plurality of the filtering plates is disposed to be around the periphery of each of the filtering plate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the above structure of the filtering and condensing apparatus, in case of filtering, a sludge in the sludge tank is sucked and thus filtered by the filtering cloths, so that the condensed sludge is deposited on the outer surfaces of the filtering cloths, while the filtrate which has passed through the filtering cloths and thus guided into the filtering chambers can be recovered outside of the sludge tank through the filtrate discharging tube.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, in a case where the condensed sludge is recovered, the filtering cloths are expanded by supplying a compressed air to inner surfaces of the filtering cloths through the filtering chambers, whereby the condensed sludge deposited on the outer surfaces of the filtering cloths is separated, so that the condensed sludge deposited on the bottom of the sludge tank is discharged, and as a result, it can be incinerated or reclaimed as a cake by mechanically hydrating the discharged condensed sludge. It is possible to alleviate the load of the energy needed for the mechanical hydrating treatment such as pressurizing or depressurizing, etc. by said filtering and condensing of sludge.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a case where the sludge is filtered or where the filtering cloth is expanded, since a tension force is constantly applied to each of the filtering plates by the coil springs provided on the periphery thereof, each of the filtering plates is maintained to be stable, even if each of the filtering plates flutters or swings to contact the adjacent filtering plate due to the suction force upon the filtering, or the air fed into the filtering chamber upon the expansion of the filtering cloth, whereby technical problems in which the filtering area is substantially reduced, or the condensed sludge deposited on the outer surface of the filtering cloth is separated can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the following technical problems are caused in relation to a case where such a conventional filtering and condensing apparatus of suction type is made large-sized.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Firstly, in a case where the total filtering area of the filtering plates disposed within the sludge tank including a limited space is obtained when the filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type is made large-sized, it is desired to increase the number of the filtering plates within the sludge tank as many as possible, while at the same time to maximize the filtering area of a single filtering plate. In order to do that, it is necessary to increase the filtering area by making the filtering cloth large, while to make the distance between the adjacent filtering plates as short as possible. However, even if the filtering plate can be maintained to be stable by the coil spring, the bigger the filtering cloth becomes, the larger the amount of the protrusion of the filtering plate toward the adjacent filtering plate becomes, whereby a risk that the filtering plate can contact the adjacent filtering plate is increased. On the other hand, in a case where the amount of the protrusion is limited, there occurs a risk that the filtering cloth is caused to be unduly tensioned due to the expansion of the filtering cloth, so that the normal filtering function cannot be attained, or the filtering cloth can be broken or torn, due to the fact that the fine holes of the filtering cloth are forced to be enlarged.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Secondly, in a case where the filtering cloth is integrally sewed on the corresponding supporting plate, when the filtering cloth is expanded in order to separate the condensed sludge therefrom, the supporting plate is forced to be contracted in the lateral direction (the direction substantially perpendicular to the vertical direction in which the sludge tank extends) upon the expansion of the filtering cloth, whereby the coil springs provided on both sides of the corresponding filtering plate are caused to be extended, so that the tension force by the coil springs is increased. If the coil springs are selected in accordance with such an increase of the tension force, the coil springs are caused to be contracted upon the filtering, on the contrary, whereby the tension force is caused to be decreased, so that there occurs a risk that the adjacent filtering plates can contact each other, while each of the filtering plate can flutter. The amount of such contraction of the supporting plate becomes inevitably large as the filtering plate becomes large.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thirdly, in a case where the filtering cloth is immersed into the sludge for a long time, the filtering cloth made of a chemical fiber is caused to be swollen, whereby the corresponding supporting plate is caused to be extended, and as a result, the coil springs provided on both side of the filtering plate are caused to be contracted, causing the tension force by the coil springs to be decreased to generate the slackening of the filtering cloth. The amount of such an extension of the supporting plate becomes inevitably large, as the filtering plate becomes large.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Such being the case, even if the constant tension force is tried to be applied to the filtering plate by means of the coil springs based on the case of the filtering, the tension force is caused to be decreased due to the expansion of the filtering cloth, On the other hand, the tension force is caused to be increased due to the swelling of the filtering cloth, and such a fluctuation of the tension force becomes inevitably large, as the filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type becomes large. The length of the coil spring may be lengthened in order to absorb such fluctuation of the tension force, however, the decrease of the filtering area in a limited space within the sludge tank is caused. In addition, the rigidity of the coil spring may be enhanced, however, the contraction of the supporting plate due to the expansion of the filtering cloth is restricted, whereby the filtering cloth is not fully expanded, so that the degree of the separation of the condensed sludge deposited on the filtering cloth is worsened, or the tension force is lost due to the fact that the coil spring remains fully extended because of the plastic deformation of the coil spring which is caused by the tension force being overcome by the expanding force of the filtering cloth.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this respect, the coil springs used in the sludge for a long time may be preferably made of steel use stainless (SUS) which is an expensive and good corrosion resistant material, and may be standard products, not made-to-order products in a case where the filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type is made large-sized, in view of the fact that tens of the coil springs are provide around the periphery of the filtering plate, and tens of the filtering plates are used.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In view of the above technical problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type which is capable of improving the filtering efficiency by securing the filtering area, while at the same time keeping an integrity of the filtering cloth.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of the above technical problems, another object of the present invention is to provide a filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type which is capable of maintaining a tension force applied to a filtering plate to be substantially constant, while at the same time adopting standard coil springs made of steel use stainless (SUS), in a case where said filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type is made large-sized.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In view of the above technical problems, according to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a filtering and condensing apparatus of a suction type comprises a sludge tank for containing sludge to be filtered and condensed, and a plurality of filtering plates aligned with each other so as to be disposed to be adjacent to each other in the sludge tank, each plane portion of which extends in the vertical direction, each of the filtering plates includes a supporting plate in the form of a net, and a filtering cloth in a bag form so as to be integrally sewed on the supporting plate and to house said supporting plate, whereby a filtering chamber is formed inside the filtering cloth, and said apparatus further includes a means for sucking said filtering cloth through said filtering chamber, a means for expanding said filtering cloth through said filtering chamber, and a means for constantly applying a tension force to each of the filtering plates which is disposed to be over the periphery of each of the plurality of the filtering plates, characterized in that each of said filtering cloths are divided in the lateral direction of the corresponding filtering plate by a plurality of vertically extending seams to form said filtering chamber at every divided zone, the lateral length of a portion of each of said filtering cloths divided by the adjacent seams is set to be longer than the lateral length of a portion of the supporting plate corresponding to the corresponding zone over the entire vertical direction, whereby each of said zones includes an expanding margin upon the expansion of the corresponding filtering cloth.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the above filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type, by sucking and thus filtering the sludge contained in the sludge tank through the filtering cloths, water contained in the sludge passes through the filtering cloths, and thus guided into the filtering chambers, while the sludge is filtered and thus condensed by the dehydrated sludge being deposited on the outer surface of the filtering cloths. In this case, since a tension force is always applied to each of the plurality of the filtering plates from its periphery by a means for applying a tension force, each of the filtering plates is maintained to be stable, ands thus, in case of suction, for instance, the condensed sludge deposited on the filtering cloths can be prevented from being naturally separated by the fluttering of the filtering plate, or the formation of the condensed sludge can be prevented from being blocked or the effective filtering area can be prevented from being decreased by the contact of the adjacent filtering plates.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to separate the condensed sludge from the filtering cloth, in a case where the filtering cloth is expanded, since the filtering cloth is divided in the lateral direction of the filtering plate, the amount of the protrusion of the expanding portion toward the adjacent filtering plate can be restricted due to the fact that the filtering cloth is expanded at each divided zone, whereby, as compared with the case where the filtering cloth is not divided, the adjacent filtering plates can be disposed to be closer to each other, and as a result, the total filtering area constituted by the plurality of the filtering plates can be maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In such a case, since the expanding margin is provided at every divided zone, in a case where the filtering cloth is expanded, the normal filtering function can be prevented from being lost, or the filtering cloth can be prevented from being broken or torn due to the fact that the filtering cloth is unduly tensioned to enlarge fine holes of the filtering cloth. As such, the filtering efficiency can be improved, while at the same time an integrity of the filtering cloth can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a preferred configuration, said means for constantly applying a tension force to each of the filtering plates from its both sides consists of an elastic member extending in its lateral direction, said supporting plate is made of a rigid material which causes substantially no extension in its plane due to the immersion of the filtering cloth into the sludge and substantially no contraction in its plane due to the expansion of the filtering cloth, and causes no substantial deformation so as to deteriorate a flatness of the supporting plate due to said immersion and said expansion of the filtering cloth.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type of the present invention, since the filtering cloth is integrally sewed on the corresponding supporting plate, a compressive force in the lateral direction of the supporting plate is applied to the supporting plate when the filtering cloth is expanded. However, since the supporting plate is made of a rigid material which causes substantially no contraction in its plane, and substantially no deformation so as to deteriorate its flatness due to the expansion of the filtering cloth, the length of the supporting plate can be maintained to be substantially constant without causing the lateral contraction due to such a compressive force. Accordingly, since the length of the elastic member also remains unchanged, the tension force by the elastic member can be maintained to be substantially constant, so that the contact of the adjacent filtering plates or the fluttering of the filtering plate due to the decrease of the tension force caused by the extension of the elastic member can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">On the other hand, in a case where the filtering cloth is swollen due to the fact that the filtering cloth is immersed into the sludge for a long time, a tension force is applied to the supporting plate in its lateral direction due to the expansion of the filtering cloth. However, since the supporting plate is made of a rigid material which causes substantially no extension in its plane, and substantially no deformation so as to deteriorate its flatness due to the immersion of the filtering cloth into the sludge, the length of the supporting plate can be maintained to be substantially constant without causing the lateral extension due to such a compressive force. Accordingly, since the length of the elastic member also remains unchanged, the tension force by the elastic member can be maintained to be substantially constant, so that the enlarging of the fine holes of the filtering cloth or the break of the filtering cloth due to the increase of the tension force caused by the contraction of the elastic member can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In particular, in a case where the filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type is made large-sized, the fluctuation of the tension force applied to the supporting plate upon the filtering is inevitably increased. However, by utilizing cheap standard elastic members without a need to prepare for expensive made-to-order elastic members, the plurality of filtering plates can be disposed to be as close as possible to each other, while the filtering area of each of the filtering plates can be maximized and the fluctuation of the tension force applied to the filtering plate upon the filtering can be restricted, whereby the above technical problems caused by the expansion of the filtering cloth or the immersion of the filtering cloth for a long time can be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to a preferred configuration, the negative pressure caused by said sucking means is set to be less than the predetermined value in such a way that a wrinkled portion of the filtering cloth which is not adhered to the filtering cloth and is formed based on said expanding margin upon filtering does not deteriorate an integrity of the filtering cloth.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a preferred configuration, a filtering frame is provided around the outer periphery of the corresponding filtering plate so as to surround the filtering plate, and an upper portion of each of the filtering cloths are suspended and supported from an upper portion of the corresponding filtering frame.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to a preferred configuration, a weight member is provided on a lower portion of each of the filtering cloths so as to apply a tension force in the downward direction thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a preferred configuration, the lateral length of said divided zone of each of the filtering cloths is determined in accordance with the amount of the protrusion of the filtering plate toward the adjacent filtering plate upon the expansion of the filtering cloth, and the distance between the adjacent filtering plates.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a preferred configuration, said supporting plate is made of polyethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a preferred configuration, said supporting plate is made of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to a preferred configuration, said elastic member consists of a coil spring made of steel use stainless (SUS).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In view of the above technical problems, according to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a filtering and condensing apparatus of a suction type comprising a filtering and condensing tank for containing a liquid including material to be filtered and condensed, and a plurality of filtering plates aligned with each other so as to be disposed to be adjacent to each other in the filtering and condensing tank, each plane portion of which extends in the vertical direction, each of the filtering plates includes a supporting plate in the form of a net, and a filtering cloth in a bag form so as to be integrally sewed on the supporting plate and to house said supporting plate, whereby a filtering chamber is formed inside the filtering cloth, and said apparatus further includes a means for sucking said filtering cloth through said filtering chamber, a means for expanding said filtering cloth through said filtering chamber, and a means for constantly applying a tension force to each of the filtering plate which is disposed to be over the periphery of each of the plurality of the filtering plates, characterized in that each of said filtering cloths are divided in the lateral direction of the corresponding filtering plate by a plurality of vertically extending seams to form said filtering chamber at every divided zone, the lateral length of a portion of each of said filtering cloths divided by the adjacent seams is set to be longer than the lateral length of a portion of the supporting plate corresponding to the corresponding zone over the entire vertical direction, whereby each of said zones includes an expanding margin upon the expansion of the corresponding filtering cloth.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the filtering and condensing apparatus of a suction type of the present invention, in a case where the material to be treated contained in the liquid is filtered and condensed via the filtering cloth integrally sewed on each of the supporting plates disposed in the filtering and condensing tank, the filtering cloth can be prevented from being broken or torn due to the fact that the filtering cloth is unduly tensioned to enlarge fine holes of the filtering cloth, since the filtering cloth is divided in the lateral direction of the filtering plate by the plurality of vertically extending seams on the filtering cloth and the expanding margin is provided at every divided zone in order to separate the condensed sludge from the filtering cloth, while at the same time, the adjacent filtering plates can be disposed to be closer to each other, since the amount of the protrusion of the expanding portion toward the adjacent filtering plate can be restricted, whereby the filtering efficiency can be improved, while at the same time an integrity of the filtering cloth can be maintained.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first embodiment in which sludge generated at a sewage disposal plant or a water purification plant is to be filtered and condensed will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a filtering and condensing apparatus <b>10</b> generally comprises a sludge tank <b>12</b> for containing sludge which is to be filtered and condensed, a plurality of filtering plates <b>14</b> disposed to be within the sludge tank <b>12</b>, a suction portion <b>16</b> for sucking the sludge, and an expanding portion <b>20</b> for expanding a filtering cloth <b>18</b> provided on each of the filtering plates <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sludge tank <b>12</b> is a container including a bottom with a rectangular cross section and includes a volume so as to house the plurality of the filtering plates <b>14</b> which are described below. One end of a sludge supply/discharge tube <b>24</b>, which supplies the sludge to the sludge tank <b>12</b>, is communicated with a sidewall <b>22</b> of the sludge tank <b>12</b>, and a sludge supply/discharge pump <b>28</b> which can be reversibly operated is provided via a sludge supply/discharge valve <b>26</b> provided on an intermediate part of the sludge supply/discharge tube <b>24</b>. This causes the sludge to be supplied to the sludge tank <b>12</b> by opening the sludge supply/discharge valve <b>26</b> and operating a sludge supply/discharge pump <b>28</b>, while causes the non-condensed sludge to be discharged from the sludge tank <b>12</b> by reversibly operating the sludge supply/discharge pump <b>28</b>. In addition, one end of a condensed sludge discharge tube <b>30</b>, which discharges the condensed sludge deposited on the bottom of the sludge tank <b>12</b>, is communicated with the bottom portion of the sludge tank <b>12</b> and a condensed sludge discharge valve <b>32</b> is provided on an intermediate part of the condensed sludge discharge tube <b>30</b>. The condensed sludge deposited on the bottom of the sludge tank <b>12</b> is discharged outside due to the force of gravity via the condensed sludge discharge tube <b>30</b> by opening the condensed sludge discharge valve <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the plurality of the filtering plates <b>14</b>(<b>14</b>A to <b>14</b> E) are aligned with each other in the sludge tank <b>12</b> in such a way that their plane portions <b>13</b> extend in the vertical direction and the adjacent filtering plates <b>14</b> are spaced apart from each other with a predetermined distance D. The smaller the distance D between the adjacent filtering plates <b>14</b> becomes, the higher the number of the filtering plates <b>14</b> which can be housed within the sludge tank <b>12</b> becomes, whereby the total filtering area can be increased accordingly. However, as described below, it is necessary to expand the filtering cloth <b>18</b> in order to separate the condensed sludge deposited on the filtering cloth <b>18</b> from the corresponding filtering plate <b>14</b>. Since the filtering cloth <b>18</b> protrudes toward the adjacent filtering plate <b>14</b> due to the expansion of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, there is a risk that the filtering cloth <b>18</b> can contact the adjacent filtering plate <b>14</b>, so that the filtering area cannot be effectively utilized. Such being the case, the distance between the adjacent filtering plates <b>14</b> may be determined, in view of the condition that the adjacent filtering plates <b>14</b> remain in non-contact, while the total filtering area is maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each of the plurality of the filtering plates <b>14</b> is connected at its upper portion to a filtrate reservoir <b>36</b> disposed to be outside of the sludge tank <b>12</b> via a distribution tube <b>34</b>. One end of a filtrate discharge tube <b>38</b> is connected to the filtrate reservoir <b>36</b> and a filtrate discharge valve <b>40</b> is provided on an intermediate part of the filtrate discharge tube <b>38</b> extending downwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each of the distribution tubes <b>34</b> and the filtrate discharge tube <b>38</b> are connected in a U-shaped manner via the filtrate reservoir <b>36</b>, so that the filtrate which has been filtered within the sludge tank <b>12</b> is discharged outside based on siphon-age. In addition, a suction tube <b>31</b> is branched from each of the distribution tubes <b>34</b> and a vacuum pump <b>35</b> is connected to the suction tube <b>31</b> via a suction valve <b>33</b> provided on an intermediate part thereof. This causes the liquid within the sludge tank <b>12</b> to be treated to be sucked to the distribution tubes <b>34</b> by operating the vacuum pumps <b>35</b> while the suction valves are open, whereby a preparation for discharging the filtrate outside via the filtrate discharge tube <b>38</b> based on the siphon-age can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">On the other hand, one end of an air supply tube <b>42</b> is connected to the filtrate reservoir <b>36</b> and a compressor <b>46</b> is connected to the air supply tube <b>42</b> via an air supply valve <b>44</b> provided on an intermediated part thereof. This causes compressed air to be supplied to a filtering chamber <b>76</b> of each of the filtering plates <b>14</b> via the air supply tube <b>42</b>, the filtrate reservoir <b>36</b> and the corresponding distribution tube <b>34</b> by operating the compressor <b>46</b> while the air supply valve <b>44</b> is open, whereby the corresponding filtering cloth <b>18</b> can be expanded in a case where the condensed sludge which is described below is separated from said filtering cloth <b>18</b>. In this connection, one end of each of the distribution tubes <b>34</b> is connected to a horizontal tube <b>15</b> provided on the upper portion of the corresponding filtering plate <b>14</b>, and an outlet opening (not shown) is provided on the lower portion of the horizontal tube <b>15</b> at every zone of the corresponding filtering cloth <b>18</b> which is divided by seams <b>74</b> adjacent to each other which is described below. This causes the compressed air to be fed to every zone of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> by the compressor <b>46</b> via the corresponding outlet opening or causes the siphoning type suction to be effected by the vacuum pump <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Since the structures of the plurality of the filtering plates <b>14</b> are the same, the structure of one of the filtering plates will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the filtering plate <b>14</b> generally comprises a filtering frame <b>48</b>, a supporting plate <b>50</b> disposed to be inside of the filtering frame <b>48</b>, the filtering cloth <b>18</b> in a bag form inside of which the supporting plate <b>50</b> is housed, a plurality of coil springs <b>54</b> provided between the filtering frame <b>48</b> and the supporting plate <b>50</b>. The filtering frame <b>48</b> is shaped to be hollow and rectangular and includes an upper side <b>56</b>, a lower side <b>58</b> and lateral sides <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> between the upper side <b>56</b> and the lower side <b>58</b>. The filtering plate <b>14</b> is suspended and supported from an inner side surface <b>68</b> of the sludge tank <b>12</b> by both end portions of the upper side <b>56</b>. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an extension <b>64</b> is provided on each of both end portions of the upper side <b>56</b>, while a pair of guide plates <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, each of which protrudes towards inside, are provided on the inner side surface <b>68</b> of the sludge tank <b>12</b>, so that an engaging plate <b>66</b> fixed on the upper surface of the extension <b>64</b> is adapted to rest on the upper surface of the pair of the guide plates <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> by disposing the end portion of the extension <b>64</b> to be between the pair of guide plates <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. This causes each of the filtering plates <b>14</b> to be suspended from the sludge tank <b>12</b>. The distance between the adjacent filtering plates <b>14</b> is determined by selecting the pair of guide plates <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> from which the filtering plates <b>14</b> are suspended. Such a distance may be varied by selecting the pair of guide plates <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> in accordance with the amount of condensed sludge deposited on the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, the value of the negative pressure caused by the suction, and the lateral length of the zone of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> which is described below, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The supporting plate <b>50</b> is in the form of a net or mesh and is rectangular-shaped. Innumerable fine holes are provided on the supporting plate <b>50</b>. A plurality of flow paths of the filtrate, each of which extends in the vertical direction of the supporting plate <b>50</b> are formed between the concave portion of the supporting plate <b>50</b> and the inner surface of the corresponding filtering cloth <b>18</b> by the fact that concave and convex portions (not shown) vertically extending are provided on the surface of the supporting plate <b>50</b>. The supporting plate <b>50</b> is made of resin, and in particular, it is preferable that the supporting plate <b>50</b> has characteristics such that it neither extends in a plane of the supporting plate <b>50</b>, nor is deformed to deteriorate a flatness of the supporting plate <b>50</b> due to the fact that the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is immersed into the sludge, and furthermore, it neither contracts in a plane of the supporting plate <b>50</b> nor is deformed to deteriorate the flatness of the supporting plate <b>50</b> due to the fact that the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is expanded. More specifically, the supporting plate <b>50</b> is preferably made of polyethylene or ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). In a case where the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is immersed into the sludge for a long time, or the filtering cloth is expanded, a tension force applied to the filtering plate <b>14</b> by the coil spring <b>54</b> which is described below can be maintained to be substantially constant by adopting such material.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The filtering cloth <b>18</b> is preferably made of chemical fiber, more preferably, nylon. The filtering cloth <b>18</b> may be formed into a bag form by overlapping a pair of rectangular cloth to sew the overlapped peripheral edge portions, or bending a single rectangular cloth so as to overlap the opposed edge portions to sew the peripheral edge portions. A plurality of eyelets <b>78</b> are provided on the periphery of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> so that one end of the coil spring <b>54</b> which is described below can be hooked by the corresponding eyelet <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A plurality of seams <b>74</b>, each of which vertically extends, are provided on the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, and the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is integrally sewed on the supporting plate <b>50</b> which is housed in the filtering cloth <b>18</b>. This causes the filtering cloth <b>18</b> to be divided along the lateral direction (the direction perpendicular to the vertical direction of the sludge tank <b>12</b>), thereby causing the filtering chamber <b>76</b> to be formed between the inner surface of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> and the supporting plate <b>50</b> at each divided zone (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The distances between the adjacent seams <b>74</b> do not have to be the same, however, it is preferable that such a distance be determined in view of the fact that the total filtering area of the whole filtering plates <b>14</b> is maximized by disposing the filtering plates <b>14</b> to be as close as possible, while causing no risk of contact of the adjacent filtering plates <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref>, in order to separate the condensed sludge from the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, by feeding a compressed air into the corresponding filtering chamber <b>76</b> by the compressor <b>46</b>, in a case where the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is expanded, the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is caused to protrude toward the adjacent filtering plate. However, such a protrusion P can be decreased by dividing the filtering cloth <b>18</b> in the lateral direction and expanding each divided zone, whereby the distance D can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, the lateral length of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is set to be longer than that of the corresponding supporting plate <b>50</b> at every zone which is divided by the adjacent seams <b>74</b> of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> over the entire vertical length of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>. This causes an expanding margin to be provided at every zone in a case where the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is expanded. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> (B), in case of filtering, most of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is adhered to the surface of the corresponding supporting plate <b>50</b> by the fact that the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is sucked by the filtering chamber <b>76</b>, a wrinkled portion <b>71</b> which is not adhered to the supporting plate <b>50</b> is formed along the vertical direction of the supporting plate <b>50</b>. On the other hand, in a case where the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is expanded, the forfeit of the normal filtering function of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> or the break or the tearing of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> due to the fact that the fine holes of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> are enlarged can be prevented in advance without the filtering cloth <b>18</b> being excessively tensioned.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a plurality of coil springs <b>54</b> are provided between the lateral side <b>60</b> of the filtering frame <b>48</b> and the lateral side <b>61</b> of the corresponding filtering cloth <b>18</b>, the lateral side <b>62</b> of the filtering frame <b>48</b> and the lateral side <b>63</b> of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, and the lower side <b>58</b> of the filtering frame <b>48</b> and the lower side <b>59</b> of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>. A distance between the adjacent coil springs <b>54</b> provided on both side portions and the lower side of the filtering frame <b>48</b> may be appropriately determined in accordance with the size of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, the amount of the condensed sludge deposited on the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, etc. More specifically, one end portion of each of the coil springs <b>54</b> is hooked by the eyelets <b>78</b> of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, while the other end thereof is fixed to the lateral sides <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> or the lower side <b>58</b> of the filtering frame <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">On the other hand, a plurality of connecting members <b>65</b> are provided between the upper side <b>56</b> of the filtering frame <b>48</b> and the upper side <b>57</b> of the corresponding filtering cloth <b>18</b>. One end of each of the connecting members <b>65</b> is hooked by the eyelet <b>78</b> of the corresponding filtering cloth <b>18</b>, while the other end thereof is fixed on the upper side <b>56</b> of the filtering frame <b>48</b>. The connecting members <b>65</b> may preferably consist of suspending metal fittings such as shackles. According to the above structure, a tension force is always applied to the entire periphery including the upper, the lower, and the both lateral sides of each of the filtering plates <b>14</b> to keep the filtering plate <b>14</b> stable, and as a result, in a case where the filtering in a suction manner is conducted, for instance, the condensed sludge deposited on the filtering cloth <b>18</b> can be prevented from being spontaneously separated from the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, or the filtering plate <b>14</b> can be prevented from contacting the adjacent filtering plate <b>14</b> due to the fact that the filtering plate <b>14</b> can flutter or shake, whereby the situation in which the filtering area cannot be effectively utilized can be prevented. A plurality of coil springs <b>54</b> may preferably be made of SUS, from the corrosion resistant point of view, and may preferably be standard products, not made-to-order products, since tens of coil springs are disposed to be around the periphery of the filtering plate <b>14</b>, and tens of filtering plates <b>14</b> are used.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Now, the operation of the filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type <b>10</b> including the above structure will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Firstly, the sludge is fed to the sludge tank <b>12</b>. More specifically, the sludge supply/discharge valve <b>26</b> is opened while the sludge discharge valve <b>32</b> is closed, and then the sludge supply/discharge pump <b>28</b> is actuated, so that the sludge which is to be filtered and condensed is fed into the sludge tank <b>12</b> up to a level which corresponds to a top portion of the filtering plate <b>14</b> via the sludge supply/discharge tube <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, the preparation for filtering and condensing the sludge in the sludge tank <b>12</b> in a siphoned manner is carried out. More specifically, the suction valve <b>33</b> is opened and the vacuum pump <b>35</b> is actuated, so that the liquid in the filtering cloths <b>18</b> is sucked into the filtrate reservoir <b>36</b> via the distribution tubes <b>34</b>. The filtrate guided into the filtering chambers <b>76</b> can be discharged outside via the sludge discharge tube <b>38</b> by the siphon-age in accordance with the difference between the level of the end portion at the side of the filtering plate <b>14</b> of each of the distribution tubes <b>34</b> and the level of the filtrate reservoir <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Then, the sludge in the sludge tank <b>12</b> is filtered and condensed. More specifically, the sludge in the sludge tank <b>12</b> is sucked toward the outer surface of each of the filtering cloths <b>18</b> by the siphon-age. At this stage, water contained in the sludge passes through the filtering cloths <b>18</b> and is guided into the filtering chambers <b>76</b> as filtrate, while the sludge is dehydrated, so that the condensed sludge is deposited on the outer surfaces of the filtering cloths <b>18</b>. Since the margin for expanding the filtering cloth is provided at every zone of each of the filtering clothes <b>18</b>, most of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> in every zone is caused to be adhered to the corresponding supporting plate <b>50</b> due to the fact that the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is sucked, while the portion <b>71</b> which is not adhered to the supporting plate <b>50</b> is formed into a wrinkle extending in the vertical direction of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>. Since this wrinkled portion <b>71</b> is formed at every divided zone at every time the sludge is filtered, there is a small tendency that this can badly influence on an integrity of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, however, a kind of tendency is formed on the filtering cloth <b>18</b> by using the filtering cloth <b>18</b> for a long time, so that the wrinkled portion <b>71</b> can be formed on the same position every time the sludge is filtered. In such a case, it is possible to prevent such a bad influence on the filtering cloth <b>18</b> due to the formation of the wrinkled portion <b>71</b> by regulating the negative pressure generated in the filtering chamber <b>76</b>, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Since a tension force is constantly applied to each of the filtering plates <b>14</b> from its periphery, each of the filtering plates <b>14</b> is maintained to be stable. This causes the condensed sludge deposited on the outer surfaces of the filtering cloths <b>18</b> to be prevented from being separated from the outer surfaces of the filtering cloths <b>18</b> due to the fluttering or the shaking of the filtering plates <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Then, non-condensed sludge in the sludge tank <b>12</b> is discharged outside from the sludge tank <b>12</b>. More specifically, the sludge supply/discharge valve <b>26</b> is opened and the sludge supply/discharge pump <b>28</b> is reversely actuated with respect to the case where the sludge is fed, so that the non-condensed sludge in the sludge tank <b>12</b> can be discharged outside via the sludge supply/discharge tube <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Then, the condensed sludge deposited on the filtering cloths <b>18</b> can be separated from the filtering cloths <b>18</b> by expanding the filtering cloths <b>18</b>. More specifically, the air supply valve <b>44</b> is opened and the compressed air is fed into the filtering chamber <b>76</b> of each of the filtering plates <b>14</b> from the compressor <b>46</b> through the air supply tube <b>42</b>, the filtrate reservoir <b>36</b>, the corresponding distribution tube <b>34</b> and the corresponding horizontal tube <b>15</b>. This causes each of the filtering cloths <b>18</b> whose innumerable fine holes are closed by the condensed sludge to be expanded in the direction in which each of the filtering cloths <b>18</b> is away from the corresponding supporting plate <b>50</b>. In such a case, since the expanding margin is provided on every divided zone of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, the filtering cloth <b>18</b> can be prevented from being excessively tensioned in such a way that the fine holes are forced to be enlarged, or that the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is caused to be broken. Further, the supporting plate <b>50</b> integrally sewed on the corresponding filtering cloth <b>18</b> is subjected to the compressive force due to the expansion of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, so that it is forced to be laterally contracted (the lateral direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). However, the lateral length of the supporting plate <b>50</b> can be maintained to be substantially constant due to the rigid supporting plate <b>50</b>, whereby the tension force by the coil springs <b>54</b> transmitted from the side of the supporting plate <b>50</b> can be maintained to be substantially constant.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Then, the separated condensed sludge is discharged outside from the sludge tank <b>12</b>. More specifically, the sludge discharge valve <b>32</b> is opened, and then the condensed sludge deposited on the bottom of the sludge tank <b>12</b> is discharged outside of the sludge tank <b>12</b> via the condensed sludge discharge tube <b>30</b> due to the gravity force. The above processes complete the filtering and condensing operation of the sludge.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The filtering cloth <b>18</b> tends to swell due to the fact that it is immersed into the sludge for a long time, whereby the corresponding supporting plate <b>50</b> is forced to be laterally extended, too (the lateral direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), however, the lateral length of the supporting plate <b>50</b> can be maintained to be substantially constant due to the rigid supporting plate <b>50</b>, whereby the tension force by the coil springs <b>54</b> transmitted from the side of the supporting plate <b>50</b> can be maintained to be substantially constant.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The condensed sludge which is discharged outside from the sludge tank <b>12</b> is further condensed by another hydrator to be formed into a cake, and then, incinerated or reclaimed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to the above filtering and condensing apparatus <b>10</b> of the suction type, by sucking and thus filtering the sludge contained in the sludge tank <b>12</b> through the filtering cloths <b>18</b>, water contained in the sludge passes through the filtering cloths <b>18</b>, and thus guided into the filtering chambers <b>76</b>, while the sludge is filtered and thus condensed by the dehydrated sludge being deposited on the outer surface of the filtering cloths <b>18</b>. In this case, since a tension force is always applied to each of the plurality of the filtering plates <b>14</b> from its periphery by a means for applying a tension force, each of the filtering plates <b>14</b> is maintained to be stable, and thus, in case of suction, for instance, the condensed sludge deposited on the filtering cloths <b>18</b> can be prevented from being spontaneously separated by the fluttering of the filtering plate <b>14</b>, or the formation of the condensed sludge can be prevented from being blocked or the effective filtering area can be prevented from being decreased by the contact of the adjacent filtering plates <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In order to separate the condensed sludge from the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, in a case where the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is expanded, since the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is divided in the lateral direction of the filtering plate <b>14</b>, the amount of the protrusion of the expanding portion toward the adjacent filtering plate <b>14</b> can be restricted due to the fact that the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is expanded at each divided zone, whereby, as compared with the case where the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is not divided, the adjacent filtering plates <b>14</b> can be disposed to be closer to each other, and as a result, the total filtering area constituted by the plurality of the filtering plates <b>14</b> can be maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In such a case, since the expanding margin is provided at every divided zone, in a case where the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is expanded, the normal filtering function can be prevented from being lost, or the filtering cloth <b>18</b> can be prevented from being broken or torn due to the fact that the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is unduly tensioned to enlarge fine holes of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>. As such, the filtering efficiency can be improved, while at the same time an integrity of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, since the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is integrally sewed on the corresponding supporting plate <b>50</b>, a compressive force in the lateral direction of the supporting plate <b>50</b> is applied to the supporting plate <b>50</b> when the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is expanded. However, since the supporting plate <b>50</b> is made of a rigid material which causes substantially no contraction in its plane, and substantially no deformation so as to deteriorate its flatness due to the expansion of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>, the length of the supporting plate <b>50</b> can be maintained to be substantially constant without causing the lateral contraction due to such a compressive force. Accordingly, since the length of the elastic member also remains unchanged, the tension force by the elastic member can be maintained to be substantially constant, so that the contact of the adjacent filtering plates <b>14</b> or the fluttering of the filtering plate <b>14</b> due to the decrease of the tension force caused by the extension of the elastic member can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">On the other hand, in a case where the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is swollen due to the fact that the filtering cloth <b>18</b> is immersed into the sludge for a long time, a tension force is applied to the supporting plate <b>50</b> in its lateral direction due to the expansion of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>. However, since the supporting plate <b>50</b> is made of a rigid material which causes substantially no extension in its plane, and substantially no deformation so as to deteriorate its flatness due to the immersion of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> into the sludge, the length of the supporting plate <b>50</b> can be maintained to be substantially constant without causing the lateral extension due to such a compressive force. Accordingly, since the length of the elastic member also remains unchanged, the tension force by the elastic member can be maintained to be substantially constant, so that the enlarging of the fine holes of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> or the break of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> due to the increase of the tension force caused by the contraction of the elastic member can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In particular, in a case where the filtering and condensing apparatus <b>10</b> of the suction type is made large-sized, the fluctuation of the tension force applied to the supporting plate <b>50</b> upon the filtering is inevitably increased. However, by utilizing cheap standard elastic members without a need to prepare for expensive made-to-order elastic members, the plurality of filtering plates <b>14</b> can be disposed to be as close as possible to each other, while the filtering area of each of the filtering plates <b>14</b> can be maximized and the fluctuation of the tension force applied to the filtering plate <b>14</b> upon the filtering can be restricted, whereby the above technical problems caused by the expansion of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> or the immersion of the filtering cloth <b>18</b> for a long time can be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Now, the second embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the following description, the explanation of elements the same as those in the first embodiment is omitted by attaching the same reference numbers to said elements, and the technical feature of this embodiment will be described in detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an illustration in the filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type in the second embodiment the same as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (A), the technical feature of this embodiment lies in the fact that, in each of the filtering plate <b>14</b>, a weight member <b>80</b> is provided on its lower portion. More specifically, the weight member <b>80</b> with a predetermined weight including a laterally elongated prism shape, is suspended from the lower portion of each of the filtering plates <b>14</b> via a plurality of suspending metal fittings <b>82</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (B), each of the suspending metal fittings <b>82</b> includes a U-shaped body <b>86</b> including a pair of extensions <b>84</b> parallel to each other and a connecting rod <b>88</b> which connects tip ends of the pair of the extensions <b>84</b>. The weight member <b>80</b> is suspended from the corresponding body <b>86</b> via a coil spring <b>90</b>. The plurality of suspending metal fittings <b>82</b> are disposed in such a way that the corresponding filtering frame <b>48</b> is interposed between the pair of the extensions <b>84</b>, and connected to the corresponding filtering cloth <b>18</b> by introducing the connecting rod <b>88</b> into the eyelet <b>78</b> of the corresponding filtering cloth <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If the coil springs are disposed to be the lower portion of the filtering plate <b>14</b> like the first embodiment, the coil springs are forced to be unduly compressed due to the weight of the condensed sludge gradually deposited on the surface of the filtering cloth <b>18</b>. However, according to the structure of this embodiment, since the filtering cloth <b>18</b> can be always downwardly tensioned by means of the weigh member, the filtering cloth <b>18</b> can be prevented from being slackened due to the deposition of the condensed sludge on the filtering cloth <b>18</b>. Further, since the filtering frame <b>48</b> is disposed to be interposed between the pair of extensions <b>84</b>, the corresponding filtering plate <b>14</b> can be prevented from excessively being swung toward the adjacent filtering plate <b>14</b> due to the fact that said filtering plate <b>14</b> contacts the pair of the extensions <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As stated above, the preferred embodiments of the present invention were described in detail, however, it is evident that those skilled in the art could modify or change the embodiments in various manners without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For instance, in the first embodiment, the sludge was described to be the object to be filtered and condensed, however, the filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type of the present invention can be applicable to incineration ash contained in the alkali solution, foreign objects contained in the beverages such as milk, juice, foreign objects in a high turbidity solution, etc., so long as the conditions such as the kind of the filtering cloth, the size of diameter of the fine holes, the suction force, etc. are appropriately set in accordance with the object to be filtered and condensed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, in the first embodiment, the filtering and condensing apparatus of the siphon type was described, however, the filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type utilizing a suction pump can be adopted, so long as the negative pressure is appropriately set, taking an influence on the filtering cloth <b>18</b> into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Still further, in the first embodiment, the coil springs <b>54</b> were adopted as elastic members, however, rubber plates, etc. can be adopted, so long as the desired tension force can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Industrial Applicability</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type of the present invention can be applicable not only to the technical field of the water treatment, but also to that of the food or chemical industry, and, in particular, it is advantageous in a case where the filtering and condensing apparatus of the suction type, which is to be applied to a condensing process of sludge generated during the water treatment at a water purification plant or a sewage disposal plant, is made large.</p>
