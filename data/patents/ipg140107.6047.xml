<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cyclic redundancy check circuit, and a semiconductor device having the cyclic redundancy check circuit. The present invention further relates to an electronic apparatus having the semiconductor device, and a wireless communication system using the semiconductor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is a semiconductor device for transmitting/receiving a data signal by wireless communication such as a wireless tag (also called an IC tag, an IC chip, an RF (Radio Frequency) tag, an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tag, an electronic tag, or a transponder). In a device for transmitting/receiving a data signal, cyclic redundancy checking (CRC) is performed for checking whether the data signal is transmitted accurately. In the cyclic redundancy checking, a polynomial (called a code polynomial) in which each bit of a received data signal is set as a coefficient is divided by a predetermined generator polynomial, and a coefficient of a remainder polynomial (hereinafter called a CRC code) is calculated. The CRC code is compared to a predetermined signal so that it is determined whether the received data signal is correct.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As for a circuit for performing cyclic redundancy checking (a cyclic redundancy check circuit), a structure having a plurality of delay elements and a plurality of exclusive OR circuits is proposed (Reference 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 10-107650).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The structure of the cyclic redundancy check circuit is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a cyclic redundancy check circuit includes delay elements S<b>0</b> to S<b>15</b> and exclusive OR circuits EXOR <b>0</b> to EXOR <b>2</b> which calculate an exclusive OR of two inputted signals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The delay elements S<b>0</b> to S<b>4</b> sequentially output a signal which is shifted, in synchronization with a clock signal <b>181</b>. That is, the delay elements S<b>0</b> to S<b>4</b> form a first shift register (denoted by SR <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). The delay elements S<b>5</b> to S<b>11</b> sequentially output a signal which is shifted, in synchronization with the clock signal <b>181</b>. That is, the delay elements S<b>5</b> to S<b>11</b> form a second shift register (denoted by SR <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). The delay elements S<b>12</b> to S<b>15</b> also sequentially output a signal which is shifted, in synchronization with the clock signal <b>181</b>. That is, the delay elements S<b>12</b> to S<b>15</b> form a third shift register (denoted by SR <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). An output of the exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>0</b> is inputted to the delay element S<b>0</b> of the first shift register SR <b>1</b>. An output of S<b>4</b> of the first shift register and the output of the exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>0</b> are inputted to the exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>1</b>. An output of the exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>1</b> is inputted to S<b>5</b> of the second shift register. An output of S<b>11</b> of the second shift register and the output of the exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>0</b> are inputted to the exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>2</b>. An output of the exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>2</b> is inputted to S<b>12</b> of the third shift register. A data signal <b>182</b> and an output of S<b>15</b> of the third shift register are inputted to the exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The cyclic redundancy check circuit having the aforementioned structure calculates a 16-bit CRC code corresponding to the inputted data signal <b>182</b>, and outputs the CRC code from out_<b>1</b> to out_<b>16</b> in parallel.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the case of receiving a data signal, a CRC code corresponding to the data signal is calculated, the CRC code is outputted in parallel, and the CRC code is compared to a predetermined signal so that it may be determined whether the received data signal is correct. On the other hand, in the case of transmitting a data signal, it is required that a CRC code corresponding to the data signal be calculated and the CRC code be added to the data signal in serial.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in a conventional cyclic redundancy check circuit, a CRC code can be outputted only in parallel, not in serial. This is because, since a signal is changed when a signal is transmitted from a shift register to a next shift register through an exclusive OR circuit, not all of signals stored in respective delay elements of all shift registers can be shifted and outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the conventional cyclic redundancy check circuit, in order to output the CRC code stored in each delay element of the shift register in serial, a circuit which once holds the CRC codes outputted in parallel and sequentially outputs the CRC codes is required. For example, in addition to a shift register for calculating the CRC code, another shift register or the like is required. Therefore, a structure of the cyclic redundancy check circuit is complicated, which results in a larger circuit. Further, in accordance with the larger circuit, power consumption is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In view of the aforementioned conditions, an object of the present invention is to provide a cyclic redundancy check circuit in which a CRC code corresponding to a data signal can be calculated, the CRC code can be outputted in parallel, and the CRC code can be compared to a predetermined signal in the case of receiving the data signal, and a CRC code corresponding to a data signal can be calculated, and the CRC code can be sequentially outputted in serial in the case of transmitting the data signal, with more simple structure and low power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to solve the aforementioned problems, the present invention has the following structure.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A cyclic redundancy check circuit includes a first shift register to a p-th (p is a natural number greater than 1) shift register, a first exclusive OR circuit to a (p&#x2212;1)th exclusive OR circuit, and a switching circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Each of the first to p-th shift registers has one stage or a plurality of stages connected in cascade, and outputs an inputted signal having been delayed in synchronization with a clock signal from each stage. That is, each shift register of the first to p-th shift registers has one stage or a plurality of stages connected in cascade. An inputted signal is delayed and then outputted from the one stage or each stage of the plurality of stages. The output of signal from the one stage or the plurality of stages is performed in synchronization with a clock signal. The first to (p&#x2212;1)th exclusive OR circuits calculate an exclusive OR of two inputted signals. A data signal, a select signal, and an output of a last stage of the p-th shift register are inputted to the switching circuit, and one of a first signal or a second signal is switched in response to the select signal to be outputted. An output of the switching circuit is inputted to a first stage of the first shift register. An output of a last stage of an r-th (r is a natural number smaller than p) shift register and the output of the switching circuit are inputted to an r-th exclusive OR circuit. An output of the r-th exclusive OR circuit is inputted to a first stage of a (r+1)th shift register.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first signal is an exclusive OR of the data signal and an output of the last stage of the p-th shift register. The second signal is &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Here, &#x201c;0&#x201d; shows that a digital signal is a logical value of &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Note that the second signal may be a signal for equalizing an output of the r-th exclusive OR circuit with the output of the last stage of the r-th shift register when the second signal is inputted to the r-th exclusive OR circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, the cyclic redundancy check circuit may include a determination circuit and a first memory circuit. The first to p-th shift registers have a structure including s (s is a natural number equal to or greater than p) second memory circuits for storing a 1-bit signal. Signals stored in the s second memory circuits are inputted to the determination circuit as an s-bit output in parallel. The determination circuit outputs a different signal in response to whether the s-bit output matches a predetermined signal stored in the first memory circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The cyclic redundancy check circuit having the aforementioned structure includes the switching circuit, so that, without adding a new shift register or the like, the cyclic redundancy check circuit can switch between the case where a CRC code corresponding to a data signal is calculated and the CRC code is outputted in parallel, and the case where a CRC code corresponding to a data signal is calculated and the CRC code is outputted sequentially in serial. Accordingly, a cyclic redundancy check circuit with more simple structure and low power consumption can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Therefore, a semiconductor device using the cyclic redundancy check circuit can be downsized and power consumption thereof can be decreased. Further, an electronic apparatus using the semiconductor device can be downsized and power consumption thereof can be decreased. In particular, in the case where the semiconductor device is a wireless chip, since the chip can be downsized and power consumption thereof can be decreased, the kind of objects to which the chip is provided can be increased and the application scope of a wireless communication system using the chip can be extended.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In Embodiment Mode 1, a structure of a cyclic redundancy check circuit of the present invention and an operation thereof are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a structure of a cyclic redundancy check circuit. The cyclic redundancy check circuit includes a first shift register (denoted by SR <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to a p-th (p is a natural number greater than 1) shift register (denoted by SR p in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a first exclusive OR circuit (denoted by EXOR <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to a (p&#x2212;1)th exclusive OR circuit (denoted by EXOR (p&#x2212;1) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and a switching circuit <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Each of the first shift register SR <b>1</b> to the p-th shift register SR p has one stage or a plurality of stages connected in cascade, and outputs an inputted signal having been delayed in synchronization with a clock signal from each stage. That is, each shift register of the first shift register SR <b>1</b> to p-th shift register SR p has one stage or a plurality of stages connected in cascade. An inputted signal is delayed and then outputted from the one stage or each stage of the plurality of stages. The output of signal from the one stage or the plurality of stages is performed in synchronization with a clock signal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Here, a structural example of each of the first shift register SR <b>1</b> to the p-th shift register SR p is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a diagram showing a structure of an arbitrary shift register (denoted by SR in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) from among the first shift register SR <b>1</b> to the p-th shift register SR p. The shift register SR includes a first stage to a u-th (u is a natural number) stage, and an input signal <b>153</b> and a clock signal <b>152</b> are inputted to the shift register SR. The input signal <b>153</b> is inputted to the first stage, and an output of a preceding stage is inputted to a subsequent stage. Each stage is connected such that an output of a preceding stage is inputted to a subsequent stage, which is called cascade connection. Each of the first stage to the u-th stage can be formed using a delay element including a 1-bit memory circuit. A D-type flip-flop circuit or the like can be used as the delay element.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Note that although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows the shift register SR including the plurality of stages, a shift register including only one stage may be used. That is, a shift register in which at least one shift register among the first shift register SR <b>1</b> to the p-th shift register SR p may be a shift register including only one stage.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates a timing chart showing a driving method of the shift register having the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the input signal <b>153</b> is delayed in synchronization with the clock signal <b>152</b> and the shift register SR outputs the delayed input signal sequentially from each stage of the first stage to the u-th stage. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, outputs from respective stages are denoted by out_<b>1</b> to out_u. The out_<b>1</b> to the out_u are an output <b>151</b> of the shift register SR. In the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, in an arbitrary stage, an example in which a signal outputted to the subsequent stage and a signal to be an output of the shift register SR are equal to each other is shown; however, the present invention is not limited to this. In an arbitrary stage, a signal to be the output of the shift register SR may be a signal inverted with respect to a signal to be outputted to the subsequent stage.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is referred to again. The first exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>1</b> to the (p&#x2212;1)th exclusive OR circuit EXOR (p&#x2212;1) calculate an exclusive OR of two inputted signals. A data signal <b>131</b>, a select signal <b>132</b>, and an output <b>103</b> of the last stage of the p-th shift register SR p are inputted to the switching circuit <b>101</b>, and one of a first signal or a second signal is switched in response to the select signal <b>132</b> to be outputted as an output <b>102</b>. The output <b>102</b> of the switching circuit <b>101</b> is inputted to a first stage of the first shift register SR <b>1</b>. An output of a last stage of an r-th (r is a natural number smaller than p) shift register SR r and the output <b>102</b> of the switching circuit <b>101</b> are inputted to an r-th exclusive OR circuit EXOR r. An output of the r-th exclusive OR circuit EXOR r, is inputted to a first stage of a (r+1)th shift register SR (r+1).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first signal is an exclusive OR of the data signal <b>131</b> and the output <b>103</b> of the last stage of the p-th shift register SR p. The second signal is &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Here, &#x201c;0&#x201d; shows that a digital signal is a logical value of &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Note that the second signal may be a signal for equalizing the output of the r-th exclusive OR circuit EXOR r with the output of the last stage of the r-th shift register SR r when the second signal is inputted to the r-th exclusive OR circuit EXOR r.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While the first signal is outputted from the output <b>102</b> of the switching circuit <b>101</b>, the cyclic redundancy check circuit outputs an s-bit CRC code in parallel (an s-bit output <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). On the other hand, while the second signal is outputted from the output <b>102</b> of the switching circuit <b>101</b>, the first shift register SR <b>1</b> to the p-th shift register SR p are operated as one shift register on the whole, and the cyclic redundancy check circuit outputs the s-bit CRC code as the output <b>103</b> in serial.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A specific structural example of the switching circuit <b>101</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The switching circuit <b>101</b> includes an exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>111</b> and a selector <b>112</b>. The output <b>103</b> and the data signal <b>131</b> are inputted to the exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>111</b>, and an exclusive OR of the output <b>103</b> and the data signal <b>131</b> is calculated and inputted to the selector <b>112</b>. The selector <b>112</b> switches between an output of the exclusive OR circuit EXOR <b>111</b> and the data signal <b>131</b> in response to the select signal <b>132</b> to be outputted as the output <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The data signal <b>131</b> and the select signal <b>132</b> are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are also referred to in the description. In addition, the selector <b>112</b> outputs a signal inputted to IN<b>1</b> from Y when the select signal <b>132</b> inputted to S is a logical value of &#x201c;1&#x201d;, and the selector <b>112</b> outputs a signal inputted to IN<b>2</b> from Y when the select signal <b>132</b> is &#x201c;0&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The data signal <b>131</b> is formed of a received data signal, a transmitted data signal, and a &#x201c;0&#x201d; signal when there is neither a received data signal nor a transmitted data signal.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, after the received data signal in serial is inputted as the data signal <b>131</b>, the cyclic redundancy check circuit (the CRC circuit) calculates a CRC code corresponding to the received data signal (during a period denoted by TC<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). When the calculation of the CRC code is terminated, a calculation result, that is, an obtained CRC code is outputted in parallel (during a period denoted by TO<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). By using the CRC code outputted in parallel, an error of the received data signal is checked. In TC<b>1</b> and T<b>01</b>, the select signal <b>132</b> is &#x201c;1&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, after the transmitted data signal in serial is inputted as the data signal, the cyclic redundancy check circuit (the CRC circuit) calculates a CRC code corresponding to the transmitted data signal (during a period denoted by TC<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). When the calculation of the CRC code is terminated, a calculation result, that is, an obtained CRC code is outputted in serial (during a period denoted by TO<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The CRC code outputted in serial is added to the transmitted data signal. In TO<b>2</b>, the select signal <b>132</b> is &#x201c;0&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the select signal <b>132</b> is &#x201c;1&#x201d; in all periods other than TO<b>2</b>; however, the present invention is not limited to this. As long as the select signal <b>132</b> is &#x201c;1&#x201d; in TC<b>1</b> and TO<b>1</b>, and is &#x201c;0&#x201d; in TO<b>2</b>, the select signal <b>132</b> may be either &#x201c;1&#x201d; or &#x201c;0&#x201d; in the other period.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Accordingly, the cyclic redundancy check circuit (the CRC circuit) can switch between the case where the CRC code corresponding to the received data signal is calculated and the CRC code is outputted in parallel and the case where the CRC code corresponding to the transmitted data signal is calculated and the CRC code is sequentially outputted in serial.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cyclic redundancy check circuit can have a structure including a determination circuit <b>105</b>. The first shift register SR <b>1</b> to the p-th shift register SR p have a structure including s (s is a natural number equal to or greater than p) memory circuits storing a 1-bit signal. Here, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the total number of stages included in the first shift register SR <b>1</b> to the p-th shift register SR p corresponds to s. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, signals stored in the s memory circuits are inputted to the determination circuit <b>105</b> as the s-bit output <b>104</b> in parallel. The s-bit output <b>104</b> is a CRC code corresponding to the received data signal. The determination circuit <b>105</b> outputs a different signal as an output <b>106</b>, in response to whether the s-bit output matches a predetermined s-bit signal <b>144</b>. The predetermined s-bit signal <b>144</b> is stored in a memory circuit other than the s memory circuits. For example, the predetermined s-bit signal <b>144</b> is stored in a mask ROM or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Accordingly, the cyclic redundancy check circuit (the CRC circuit) can calculate the CRC code corresponding to the received data signal, output the CRC code in parallel, and determine whether the CRC code matches the predetermined signal.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The first signal is an exclusive OR of the data signal <b>131</b> and the output of the fourth stage of the third shift register SR <b>3</b>, and the second signal is &#x201c;0&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a structural example in which a set-type D-type flip-flop circuit (denoted by DFS in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is used for each of plural stages included in the first shift register SR <b>1</b> to the third shift register SR <b>3</b>. One set-type D-type flip-flop circuit DFS is a memory circuit for storing a 1-bit signal and corresponds to one stage. Outputs of 16 set-type D-type flip-flop circuits DFSs are a 16-bit CRC code. A shift register reset signal <b>154</b> is inputted to set terminals (each denoted by XS in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the 16 set-type D-type flip-flop circuits DFSs. With the shift register reset signal <b>154</b>, before starting calculation of the CRC code, information stored in the 16 set-type D-type flip-flop circuits DFSs can be initialized.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Since a structure of the switching circuit <b>101</b> and an operation thereof are the same as those of described in Embodiment Mode 1 with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, description thereof is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Thus, in response to the standard of CRC16-CCITT, the cyclic redundancy check circuit (the CRC circuit) can switch between the case where the CRC code corresponding to the received data signal is calculated and the CRC code is outputted in parallel and the case where the CRC code corresponding to the transmitted data signal is calculated and the CRC code is sequentially outputted in serial.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In addition, the cyclic redundancy check circuit may have a determination circuit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Signals stored in the first shift register SR <b>1</b> to the third shift register SR <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are inputted to the determination circuit as the 16-bit output <b>104</b> in parallel. The determination circuit outputs a different signal in response to whether the 16-bit output <b>104</b> matches the predetermined 16-bit signal <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Here, the receive data signal is considered as data including its CRC code, and it is known that when the CRC code is calculated, an obtained CRC code is a predetermined signal regardless of the received data signal. It is known that in the case of the standard of CRC16CCITT, a predetermined signal is &#x201c;FOB8&#x201d; in hexadecimal notation, that is, &#x201c;1111 0000 1011 1000&#x201d; (described in order from a sixteenth bit to a first bit.) in binary notation. Then, similarly to the structure of the determination circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>, signals inverted with respect to only signals of the first bit to the third bit, a seventh bit, and a ninth bit to a twelfth bit of the calculated CRC code are inputted to the first NAND <b>149</b><i>a </i>and the second NAND <b>149</b><i>b </i>as the s-bit output <b>104</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the first shift register SR <b>1</b> to the third shift register SR <b>3</b>, an inverted output (QB) of the DFS is an output in stages corresponding to the signals of the first bit to the third bit, the seventh bit, and the ninth bit to the twelfth bit of the calculated CRC code, while a non-inverted output (Q) of the DFS is an output in the other stages. Thus, in the case where each bit of the calculated CRC code and each bit of the predetermined s-bit signal <b>144</b> match, &#x201c;1&#x201d; is outputted, and in the case where each bit of the calculated CRC code and each bit of the predetermined s-bit signal <b>144</b> do not match, &#x201c;0&#x201d; is outputted. Therefore, an error of the received data signal can be determined.</p>

When the transistor is driven with a voltage of 3 V or lower, an insulating layer which is oxidized or nitrided by the plasma treatment can be used as the gate insulating layer <b>4408</b>. If the driving voltage of the transistor is 3 V or higher, the gate insulating layer <b>4408</b> can be formed by combining an insulating layer formed over the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>4405</b> by the plasma treatment and an insulating layer deposited by a CVD method (a plasma CVD method or a thermal CVD method). In addition, the insulating layer may also be used as a dielectric layer of the capacitor <b>2004</b>. In this case, the insulating layer formed by the plasma treatment is a dense film with a thickness of 1 to 10 nm; therefore, the capacitor <b>2004</b> with large charge capacity can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 to 21E</figref>, the elements with various structures can be formed by combining conductive layers with different thicknesses. A region where only the first conductive layer is formed and a region where the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer are stacked can be formed using a photomask or a reticle provided with a diffraction grating pattern or an auxiliary pattern having an optical intensity reducing function formed of a semitransparent film. That is, in a photolithography process, the quantity of transmitting light of the photomask is controlled in exposing the photoresist so that the thickness of a resist mask to be developed is changed. In this case, a slit at the resolution limit or less may be provided in the photomask or the reticle to form the above-described resist having the complex shape. In addition, by baking at about 200&#xb0; C. after developing, a mask pattern made from a photoresist material can be changed in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In addition, by using the photomask or the reticle which is provided with a diffraction grating pattern or an auxiliary pattern having an optical intensity reducing function formed of a semitransparent film, the region where only the first conductive layer is formed and the region where the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer are stacked can be formed in succession. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, the region where only the first conductive layer is formed can be formed selectively over the semiconductor layer. Such a region is effective over the semiconductor layer, but is not required in the other region (a wire region which is successive to the gate electrode). Since the region where only the first conductive layer is formed is not required to be formed in the wire portion by using this photomask or reticle, wire density can be improved substantially.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 to 21E</figref>, the first conductive layer is formed to have a thickness of 30 to 50 nm using a high melting point metal such as tungsten (W), chromium (Cr), tantalum (Ta), tantalum nitride, or molybdenum (Mo), or an alloy or a compound containing the high melting point metal as its main component. In addition, the second conductive layer is formed to have a thickness of 300 to 600 nm using a high melting point metal such as tungsten (W), chromium (Cr), tantalum (Ta), tantalum nitride, or molybdenum (Mo), or an alloy or a compound containing the high melting point metal as its main component. For example, the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer are made of different conductive materials so as to have a difference in etching rate in the subsequent etching step. The first conductive layer and the second conductive layer may be made of, for example, tantalum nitride and tungsten, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">According to the description of this embodiment, transistors having different electrode structures, a capacitor, and a resistor can be formed separately with the same process by using the photomask or the reticle which is provided with a diffraction grating pattern or an auxiliary pattern having an optical intensity reducing function formed of a semitransparent film. Accordingly, in response to circuit characteristics, elements having different modes can be formed without increasing the number of steps and integrated.</p>

<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In this embodiment, an example of a static RAM (an SRAM) which can be used as a memory (the memory circuit <b>305</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, and the like) of the semiconductor device of the present invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A to 24B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">A semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and a semiconductor layer <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> are preferably made of silicon or a crystalline semiconductor containing silicon. For example, the semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>11</b> are made of polycrystalline silicon, single crystalline silicon, or the like which is obtained by crystallizing a silicon film by laser annealing or the like. Furthermore, a metal oxide semiconductor, amorphous silicon, or an organic semiconductor, which has semiconductor characteristics, may also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In any case, a semiconductor layer formed first is provided over the entire surface or a part (region with a larger area than that determined as a semiconductor region of a transistor) of a substrate having an insulating surface. Then, a mask pattern is formed over the semiconductor layer by photolithography. The mask pattern is used for etching the semiconductor layer, thereby forming the semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>11</b> having specific island shapes, which include a source region, a drain region, and a channel forming region of a transistor. The shapes of the semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>11</b> are determined, considering the adequacy of layout.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The photomask for forming the semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> has a mask pattern <b>2000</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>. The mask pattern <b>2000</b> is different depending on whether a resist used in a photolithography process is a positive type or a negative type. In the case of using the positive type resist, the mask pattern <b>2000</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> is manufactured as a light shielding portion. The mask pattern <b>2000</b> has a shape in which a convex portion A of a polygon is chamfered. In addition, a concave portion B is bent so as not to be right angles.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The shape of the mask pattern <b>2000</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> is reflected in the semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>. In that case, the shape similar to the mask pattern <b>2000</b> may be transferred, and the transfer may be conducted so that the corner (convex portion or concave portion) of the mask pattern <b>2000</b> is further rounded. In other words, a round portion in which the pattern shape is smoother than the mask pattern <b>2000</b> may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">An insulating layer which contains silicon oxide or silicon nitride at least partially is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>11</b>. One of the objects for forming this insulating layer is a gate insulating layer. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, a gate wire <b>12</b>, a gate wire <b>13</b>, and a gate wire <b>14</b> are formed so as to overlap the semiconductor layer partially. The gate wire <b>12</b> is formed corresponding to the semiconductor layer <b>10</b>, the gate wire <b>13</b> is formed corresponding to the semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, and the gate wire <b>14</b> is formed corresponding to the semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>11</b>. In order to obtain the gate wires, a metal layer or a semiconductor layer having high conductivity is deposited over the insulating layer and processed into a desired shape by photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The photomask for forming the gate wires has a mask pattern <b>2100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>. The corner of the mask pattern <b>2100</b> is bent so as not to be right angles. The shape of the mask pattern <b>2100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref> is reflected in the gate wire <b>12</b>, the gate wire <b>13</b>, and the gate wire <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>. In that case, the shape similar to the mask pattern <b>2100</b> may be transferred, and the transfer may be conducted so that the corner of the mask pattern <b>2100</b> is further rounded. In other words, a round portion in which the pattern shape is smoother than the mask pattern <b>2100</b> may be provided. The corner is rounded, so that the bent convex portion has an effect that the generation of fine powder due to abnormal discharge can be suppressed in dry etching using plasma, and the bend concave portion has an effect that even if fine powder which easily gathers in the corner is generated, it can be washed away in cleaning. As a result, improvement in yield can be greatly expected.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">An interlayer insulating layer is formed after the gate wire <b>12</b>, the gate wire <b>13</b>, and the gate wire <b>14</b>. The interlayer insulating layer is made of an inorganic insulating material such as silicon oxide, or an organic insulating material using polyimide, an acrylic resin, or the like. An insulating layer made of silicon nitride, silicon nitride oxide, or the like may be formed between the interlayer insulating layer and the gate wire <b>12</b>, the gate wire <b>13</b>, and the gate wire <b>14</b>. In addition, an insulating layer made of silicon nitride, silicon nitride oxide, or the like may be formed over the interlayer insulating layer. Such an insulating layer can prevent the semiconductor layer and the gate insulating layer from being contaminated with impurities such as extrinsic metal ion and moisture, which may adversely affect a transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In the interlayer insulating layer, an opening is formed at a predetermined position. For example, the opening is provided corresponding to the gate wire or semiconductor layer in the lower layer. A wire layer formed of one layer or a plurality of layers of metal or a metal compound is processed into a predetermined pattern by etching using a mask pattern which is formed by photolithography. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>, a wire <b>15</b>, a wire <b>16</b>, a wire <b>17</b>, a wire <b>18</b>, a wire <b>19</b>, and a wire <b>20</b> are formed so as to partially overlap the semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>11</b>. Each of the wires connects particular elements. Each of the wires connects particular elements not with a straight line but with a line including a bend portion because of layout limitations. In addition, the wire width changes in a contact portion or in other regions. The wire width increases in a contact portion if the size of a contact hole is equal to or larger than the wire width.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">A photomask for forming the wires <b>15</b> to <b>20</b> has a mask pattern <b>2200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>. This mast pattern <b>2200</b> is bent so as not to be right angles. In this manner, the corner may be rounded. The bent convex portion of such a wire has an effect that the generation of fine powder due to abnormal discharge can be suppressed in dry etching using plasma, and the bend concave portion of the wire has an effect that even if fine powder which easily gathers in the corner is generated, it can be washed away in cleaning. As a result, improvement in the yield can be expected. Furthermore, the wire with a rounded corner allows electrical conduction of wires. In addition, in the case where a plurality of wires including a portion of which bent portion or width changes are provided in parallel, the use of a wire with a rounded corner is highly advantageous since dust or the like are easily gathered particular when the corner of the wire has right angles.</p>
