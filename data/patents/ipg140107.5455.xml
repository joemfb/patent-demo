<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The use of electronic calendaring systems has helped ease the burden of maintaining personal, as well as group, activities, including keeping track of daily schedules and meetings. Electronic calendaring systems may also provide access to lists of facilities available for holding meetings, such as, rooms, projectors, computer equipment, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">On occasion, meetings may be related or tied to other meetings, in some fashion. For example a worker may be preparing for a status meeting with his/her manager. Thus, there may be pre- and post-status meetings, for example, to obtain information for the meeting and to disseminate information after the meeting. Sometimes meetings with too many people or with too much information to cover need to be split into multiple meetings.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In such situations, multiple meetings (possibly before as well as after) may need to be rescheduled if the meeting they depend upon is rescheduled. Currently, the procedure for rescheduling meetings is to manually reschedule each of the meetings.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method of creating a relationship between scheduled events in an electronic calendaring application is provided. A first event is scheduled on the electronic calendaring application. At least a second event is scheduled at a user designated time interval relative to the first event. The at least a second event is automatically changed when the user initiates a change to the first event, wherein a user designated time interval is automatically maintained between the first event and the at least a second event.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a system for creating a relationship between scheduled events in an electronic calendaring application is provided. The system comprises a processor and memory connected to the processor. Instructions are provided for scheduling a first event on the electronic calendaring application. Instructions are provided for scheduling at least a second event based upon a user designated time interval relative to the first event. The at least a second event is automatically changed when the user initiates a change to the first event, wherein a user designated time interval is automatically maintained between the first event and the at least a second event.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a computer program product for creating a relationship between scheduled events in an electronic calendaring application is provided. The computer program product comprises a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code embodied therewith. The computer readable program code is configured to schedule a first event on the electronic calendaring application.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The descriptions of the various embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration, but are not intended to be exhaustive or limited to the embodiments disclosed. Many modifications and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the described embodiments. The terminology used herein was chosen to best explain the principles of the embodiments, the practical application or technical improvement over technologies found in the marketplace, or to enable others of ordinary skill in the art to understand the embodiments disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a &#x201c;circuit,&#x201d; &#x201c;module&#x201d; or &#x201c;system.&#x201d; Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Any combination of one or more computer readable media (memory or device) may be utilized. The computer readable medium may be a computer readable signal medium or a computer readable storage medium. A computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing.

In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Aspects of the of the present invention are described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable medium that can direct a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, a &#x201c;followed meeting&#x201d; is defined to be the meeting upon which others depend. &#x201c;Following meeting(s)&#x201d; are defined as meetings dependent upon a followed meeting. Following meetings can be scheduled to occur before or after a followed meeting. Thus, the use of following to describe a meeting is not limited to being after another meeting but rather in the sense of being dependent upon another meeting. &#x201c;Related meetings&#x201d; is used to designate any group of meetings that have a followed meeting and at least one following meeting.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One embodiment of the present invention provides a way to create following meetings, even if not by the owner of the followed meeting. The following meetings can take place before or after the followed meeting by a designated period of time, for example, one hour after or at a certain time specified, for example, 2:00 PM the day after. Any time the followed meeting is rescheduled, all the following meetings will also be automatically rescheduled.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The related meetings can be viewed in a tabular calendar view with lines connecting the meetings, or in a tree view that places the followed meeting in the center with the before following meetings arranged above (in order of occurrence) and the after following meetings arranged below (in order of occurrence). It is also possible to designate one or more of the following meetings as a followed meeting in order to create other following meetings, therefrom. Thus, creation of cascading meetings is provided. Meetings may be manually rescheduled by dragging and dropping a meeting over a &#x201c;separator line&#x201d; to change a following meeting from a before following meeting to an after following meeting and vice versa, which can automatically reschedule the following meeting in the first available time slot in the region to which it is dropped.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">One embodiment of the present invention will now be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref> and the following example. An &#x201c;All Hands&#x201d; meeting/event has been scheduled on an electronic calendar <b>200</b> by a Lab Director for all employees reporting to him/her as All Hands Meeting Session 1 designated by reference numeral <b>202</b> at 9:00 AM on Jun. 23, 20XX.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Since it is not always possible to actually have all hands attend one meeting at one scheduled time, the Lab Director decides to schedule a repeat of the meeting <b>202</b> two hours after the start of the meeting <b>202</b>. The Lab Director selects, by clicking on, the meeting <b>202</b> and a drop down menu <b>204</b> appears.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Upon selection of &#x201c;Follow . . . &#x201d; <b>206</b>, the Lab Director is presented with a dialog <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Using the dialog <b>300</b>, options can be selected as to how the meeting <b>202</b> is to be followed. For example, the new (following) meeting can be selected to start, by selecting &#x201c;Starts&#x201d; <b>302</b>, a certain number of &#x201c;Days&#x201d; <b>304</b> and/or &#x201c;Hours&#x201d; (Hrs.) <b>306</b> &#x201c;Before&#x201d; <b>308</b> or &#x201c;After&#x201d; <b>310</b> the selected (followed) meeting <b>202</b>. Alternatively, the new (following) meeting can end, by selecting &#x201c;Ends&#x201d; <b>312</b>, a certain number of &#x201c;Days&#x201d; <b>314</b> and/or &#x201c;Hours&#x201d; (Hrs.) <b>316</b> &#x201c;Before&#x201d; <b>318</b> or &#x201c;After&#x201d; <b>320</b> the selected (followed) meeting <b>202</b>. This allows great flexibility in the creation of related meetings, as they can happen before, after, or even concurrently (by picking starts before with 0 days and 0 hrs). The following meeting is to start 2 hours after the start of the Followed Meeting <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and, therefore, the Lab Director selects Starts <b>302</b>, enters 2 into Hrs. <b>306</b> and selects After <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although not shown, it is possible to have the scheduling application place the two meetings in nearby meeting rooms (or the same), to ensure the rooms have the right facilities, capacity, etc., by adding more choices to the dialog <b>300</b>. In addition, all invitees to the followed meeting will be notified of the following meeting, unless changed by the Lab Director. After entering the desired choices, &#x201c;OK&#x201d; <b>322</b> (or &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; <b>324</b>, if desired) is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If OK <b>322</b> is selected, a second (following) meeting &#x201c;All Hands Meeting Session 2 (After)&#x201d; designated by reference numeral <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) will be scheduled to start two hours after the start of Followed Meeting <b>202</b>. The relationship between the Followed Meeting <b>202</b> and the following meeting <b>400</b> is indicated by a connecting line <b>402</b>. If the chair (Lab Director) of the Followed Meeting <b>200</b> reschedules, the present invention will automatically reschedule the following meeting <b>400</b> (and other related meetings, if any) using the same parameters selected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the results of changing the Followed Meeting <b>202</b> from starting at 9:00 AM to starting at 2:00 PM, on the same day, are shown. The present invention will automatically reschedule the following meeting <b>400</b> to start at 4:00 PM in order to start 2 hours after the start of the Followed Meeting <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, additional related meetings are illustrated. Six following meetings are scheduled on a calendar <b>601</b> around a Followed Meeting <b>600</b>, which is highlighted, such as by making it bold, hashed, a different font, or a different color. After the Followed Meeting <b>600</b> is scheduled, a user, who may be other than the chair of meeting <b>600</b>, can schedule following meetings before or after. For example, a first non-chair user wants to schedule a meeting before the Followed Meeting <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first non-chair user clicks on the Followed Meeting <b>600</b> and a drop down menu, such as at <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, appears. The first non-chair user then selects &#x201c;Follow . . . &#x201d; <b>206</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and the dialog <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) appears. The first non-chair user wants to schedule a following meeting to start three days and three hours before the start of the Followed Meeting <b>600</b>. Thus, the first non-chair user will select Starts <b>302</b>, enter &#x201c;3&#x201d; into Days <b>304</b>, and &#x201c;3&#x201d; into Hours <b>306</b>, and selects Before <b>308</b> (all references to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Thus, a &#x201c;Following Meeting 1 (Before)&#x201d; <b>602</b> is scheduled for 7:00 AM three days before the Followed Meeting <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, the first non-chair user wants to schedule another following meeting at 9:00 AM two days before the Followed Meeting <b>600</b>. The first non-chair user follows the same procedures as for the &#x201c;Following Meeting 1 (Before)&#x201d; <b>602</b> making the appropriate settings in the dialog <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and a second meeting, &#x201c;Following Meeting 2 (Before)&#x201d; <b>604</b>, is scheduled and shown on the calendar <b>601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Additionally, a second non-chair user wants to add two meetings, one before and one after the Followed Meeting <b>600</b>. The same procedure above is followed and a Following Meeting 3 (Before) <b>606</b> and a Following Meeting 4 (After) <b>608</b> are scheduled, according to the desired times selected by the second non-chair user.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, a third non-chair user wants to add two meetings after the Followed Meeting <b>600</b>. As a result, a &#x201c;Following Meeting 5 (After)&#x201d; <b>610</b> and a &#x201c;Following Meeting 6 (After)&#x201d; <b>612</b> are scheduled, according to the times selected by the third non-chair user. All of the following meetings' (Following Meeting 1 (Before) <b>602</b>, Following Meeting 2 (Before) <b>604</b>, Following Meeting 3 (Before) <b>606</b>, Following Meeting 4 (After) <b>608</b>, Following Meeting 5 (After) <b>610</b>, and Following Meeting 6 (After) <b>612</b>) relationships with the Followed Meeting <b>600</b> are shown by connecting lines <b>614</b>. Any change to the Followed Meeting <b>600</b> will automatically result in appropriate changes to all of the following meetings.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the present invention can also be used to produce a tree view <b>700</b> to show any related meetings. A Followed Meeting <b>702</b> (shown in bold or with any other distinguishing characteristic) is positioned with any following meetings drawn on either side and/or above or below. In the tree view, selection of a followed meeting, for example, the Followed Meeting <b>702</b>, produces an imaginary horizontal line <b>720</b> which shows any meetings before the Followed Meeting <b>702</b> positioned above the line <b>720</b> in a &#x201c;Before Zone <b>721</b>.&#x201d; Similarly, any meetings after the Followed Meeting <b>702</b> are positioned below the line <b>720</b> in an &#x201c;After Zone <b>723</b>.&#x201d; Therefore, the Meeting <b>704</b>, Meeting <b>706</b>, and Meeting <b>708</b> are all before the Followed Meeting <b>702</b>, as they are shown above the line <b>720</b>. Similarly, the Meeting <b>710</b> and the Meeting <b>712</b> are both after the Followed Meeting <b>702</b>, as they are shown below the line <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The meetings <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>, and <b>712</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, do not have the clutter of a background calendar nor any unrelated meetings to overshadow the relationships, therebetween. For the purpose of illustration, the meetings <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>, and <b>712</b> are all related through the Followed Meeting <b>702</b>, and, therefore, all are connected by a line <b>718</b>. Thus, it is possible to more easily view the relationship between the following meetings and the followed meeting without any background clutter. Although not shown, it is to be understood that each meeting in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> could have its date and time displayed with the title to the meeting. For example, the Meeting <b>704</b> could appear as:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0047">Following Meeting 1 (Before)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0048">7:00 AM EST Sep. 15, 20XX.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (the same tree <b>700</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), an additional graphical interface feature in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. By selecting a meeting already scheduled, it is possible to drag-and-drop the meeting anywhere on the tree view (although not shown, it is to be understood that it is also possible to make a drag-and-drop schedule change in a calendar view). For example, the Following Meeting 1 (Before) <b>704</b>A needs to be rescheduled to after the Followed Meeting <b>702</b>. The user selects the Meeting <b>704</b>A and &#x201c;drags&#x201d; it (as shown by the dashed sequential views of Following Meeting 1 (Before) <b>704</b>A-<b>1</b>, <b>704</b>A-<b>2</b>, <b>704</b>A-<b>3</b>, <b>704</b>A-<b>4</b>, and <b>704</b>A-<b>5</b>) to any position below the imaginary horizontal line <b>720</b>, where it is dropped. Upon release of the Meeting <b>704</b>A, an alert message (not shown) would query the user if that new position and time is want the user really wants. The meeting's description would change to: Following Meeting 1 (After), as indicated by reference numeral <b>704</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">Dragging the Meeting <b>704</b>A below the line <b>720</b> from the Before Zone <b>721</b> to the After Zone <b>723</b>, reschedules the meeting to any available slot after the Followed Meeting <b>702</b>. The properties of the Meeting <b>704</b>A are adjusted to &#x201c;After&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;Before&#x201d; while trying to maintain the same gap (time difference between the following meeting and the followed meeting). Obviously, the time difference would become after rather than before, for example, instead of 4 hours before, the meeting would be 4 hours after. Additionally, conflict checking may be added in order to prevent the moved meeting from being placed into an already booked slot. A warning message, for example, as a pop-up message, would allow the user to avoid double booking the slot, look for the first available slot, or cancel the drop.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">Automatic rescheduling, of a meeting that is dependent upon another meeting, is one advantage of the present invention. The graphical display of any relationship between meetings is another advantage of the present invention. A graphical display of the following meetings around the followed meeting to show before meetings and after meetings is also an advantage of the present invention.</p>
