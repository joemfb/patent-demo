<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image pickup apparatus, a radiation image pickup apparatus, more particularly an image pickup apparatus and a radiation image pickup apparatus that are capable of reading a signal from a flat panel detector as digital output using a plurality of analog-to-digital (A/D).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, a radiation image pickup apparatus employing a flat panel detector (hereinafter abbreviated as FPD) made of a semiconductor material has been becoming practical as an imaging apparatus for use in medical image diagnosis and nondestructive inspection using X rays. Such a radiation image pickup apparatus employing an FPD is an apparatus that can perform digital imaging of converting radiation, for example, an X ray that transmitted through an object (e.g., patient) into an analog electric signal using the FPD and converting the analog electric signal into a digital image signal. FPDs used in such a radiation image pickup apparatus can be broadly classified into the direct conversion type and the indirect conversion type. A direct-conversion radiation image pickup apparatus is an apparatus that includes an FPD having a plurality of pixels two-dimensionally arranged, each pixel including a conversion element made of a semiconductor material that can directly convert radiation into an electrical charge (e.g., a-Se). An indirect-conversion radiation image pickup apparatus is an apparatus that includes an FPD having a plurality of pixels two-dimensionally arranged, each pixel including a conversion element that has a wavelength conversion member that can convert radiation into light (e.g., fluorescent member) and that has a photoelectric conversion element made of a semiconductor material that can convert light into an electrical charge (e.g., a-Si). Such radiation image pickup apparatuses employing FPDs are used as digital image pickup apparatuses capable of radiographic imaging, like still imaging, and movie imaging, like fluoroscopy imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to an image signal in image capturing based on radiation that transmitted through an object, a correction image signal for use in correction of the image signal in image capturing, such as a correction image signal for use in offset correction or a correction image signal for use in sensitivity correction, is obtained from a radiation image pickup apparatus. A correction signal for use in offset correction is based on output obtained in a state where no light or radiation is applied to a detector (dark output). A correction signal for use in sensitivity correction is based on output obtained in a state where light or radiation is applied to a detector in a substantially uniform manner (bright output). Correcting an image signal in image capturing using such a correction image signal enables the image signal to have low noise and high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The radiation image pickup apparatus includes the above-described detector, a driving circuit for driving the detector, a readout circuit for reading an analog electric signal from the detector, and an A/D converter for converting the analog electric signal into a digital signal. The A/D converter outputs a digitized image signal in image capturing and a correction image signal. To output an image signal in a shorter time from the image pickup apparatus, the image pickup apparatus includes a plurality of A/D converters.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, a conversion characteristic between an input analog electric signal and an output digital signal in an A/D converter (A/D conversion characteristic) may have nonlinearity that does not exhibit ideal linearity. In particular, for an image pickup apparatus including a plurality of A/D converters, the A/D converters may have different nonlinearities, and an image formed from a digital signal may have artifact, such as a step. In such a case, where artifact, such as a step, occurs, the nonlinearities should be reduced or effects caused by nonlinearities should be compensated for.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-210480 discloses an A/D converter circuit that stores, at an address specified by an output from an A/D conversion unit, a reference signal synchronized using an output signal from the A/D conversion unit as address data and that corrects the output signal from the A/D conversion unit in accordance with the reference signal. The patent document discloses the capability to reduce artifact in image caused by nonlinearity of the A/D conversion unit and to achieve high image quality by use of the above configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-210396 discloses an A/D converter circuit that includes a correcting unit configured to correct output signals from a plurality of A/D conversion units in accordance with an output signal from either one of the plurality of A/D conversion units. The patent document discloses the capability to reduce artifact in image caused by difference between nonlinearities of the plurality of A/D conversion units and to achieve high image quality by use of the above configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The techniques described in the above patent documents can reduce artifact resulting from nonlinearity of an A/D converter by correcting digital output from the A/D converter, as described above. However, there may be an issue in that, for correction described in the above patent documents, a significantly large circuit for correcting digital output is used. There may be also an issue in that the step of previously obtaining conversion data for use in correcting nonlinearity of each A/D converter and the step of performing digital correction for every digital output results in complication of the system.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Information regarding nonlinearity of an A/D converter will be described below. This nonlinearity indicates how much the relationship between actual analog input and digital output (A/D conversion value) deviates from an ideal line and is specifically represented by differential nonlinearity (DNL) or integral nonlinearity (INL). INL means a deviation of, when an input-output characteristic of an A/D converter is viewed as a whole, an actual input-output characteristic from an ideal input-output line. DNL means a deviation of, when input-output stages are individually viewed, each stage from its ideal stage.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Effects caused by difference between A/D conversion characteristics of the first and second A/D converters will be described below using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. First, nonlinearity of each of the first and second A/D converters <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>is illustrated using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Here, the case is illustrated in which the first A/D converter <b>104</b><i>a </i>has an ideal A/D conversion characteristic, whereas the second A/D converter <b>104</b><i>b </i>exhibits nonlinearity deviating from an ideal characteristic. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the horizontal axis indicates an input voltage input into an A/D converter, and the vertical axis indicates a digital value (code) output from the A/D converter. For the sake of simplification of description, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is an illustration with the assumption that the A/D converter has a resolution of 8 bits.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates a difference between digital values with respect to input voltages of the first and second A/D converters <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, when input voltages of the first and second A/D converters <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>are converted into digital values and output without being processed, a maximum output difference between the digital values of the A/D converters is approximately 30 LSB. Therefore, a maximum difference in an image of approximately 30 LSB may occur between the first and second pixel groups <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b </i>associated with the first and second A/D converters <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>, respectively. In particular, like the present embodiment, for the form in which the first and second pixel groups divide all the region of the detector <b>101</b>, it results in a visually highly noticeable difference occurring in the border between the first and second pixel groups, so the quality of an obtained image significantly decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To address this, in the embodiment of the present invention, the controller <b>110</b> performs processing of altering an analog electric signal capable of being input into at least one of the first and second A/D converters or altering an A/D conversion characteristic of at least one of the first and second A/D converters. In the present embodiment, for example, the controller <b>110</b> performs processing on an analog electric signal from the pixels in odd-numbered columns among the plurality of pixels included in the first or second pixel group, the processing being different from alteration of an analog electric signal from the pixels in even-numbered columns. In other words, in a plurality of pixels arranged in the row direction among a plurality of pixels included in the first or second pixel group, an analog electric signal from a predetermined pixel is subjected to processing different from alteration of an analog electric signal from another pixel different from the predetermined pixel. Alternatively, within a period of time for which analog electric signals from a plurality of pixels arranged in the row direction among a plurality of pixels included in the detector are processed, a reference voltage to be supplied to each of the first and second A/D converters is subjected to alteration processing. Such processing causes variations in analog electric signal in the row direction, and the variations produce an output difference in digital output value within pixel groups. The output difference within pixel groups makes the output difference at the border between pixel groups less noticeable, so the difference is less noticeable than that occurring when the processing is not performed. This depends on visual features of a person who observes an image. Because of visual filtering effects, a step between pixel groups is identified more easily than a difference between analog electric signals between unit pixel columns, so the benefit of improving an image quality is high. In the present embodiment, to perform the above processing, the controller <b>110</b> performs at least one of processing described below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As first processing, the controller <b>110</b> may have to control the first reference supply <b>107</b><i>a</i>. The first reference supply <b>107</b><i>a </i>alters at least one of the reference voltage Vref<b>1</b><i>a </i>to be supplied to an amplifier circuit associated with a predetermined pixel column and the reference voltage Vref<b>1</b><i>b </i>to be supplied to another amplifier circuit associated with a different pixel column different from the predetermined pixel column such that the reference voltages Vref<b>1</b><i>a </i>and Vref<b>1</b><i>b </i>have different voltage values. For example, an odd-numbered pixel column can be adopted as the predetermined pixel column, whereas an even-numbered pixel column can be adopted as the different pixel column.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As second processing, the controller <b>110</b> may have to control the second reference supply <b>107</b><i>b</i>. The second reference supply <b>107</b><i>b </i>alters at least one of the reference voltage Vref<b>2</b><i>a </i>to be supplied to the first variable amplifier <b>205</b><i>a </i>and the reference voltage Vref<b>2</b><i>b </i>to be supplied to the second variable amplifier <b>205</b><i>b </i>such that the reference voltages Vref<b>2</b><i>a </i>and Vref<b>2</b><i>b </i>have different voltage values. This alteration is performed in synchronization with an operation of converting parallel signals into serial signals and outputting them as image signals, the operation being carried out by the first and second multiplexers. For example, in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is performed in synchronization with an operation of selecting the switches MS<b>1</b> to MS<b>4</b> and MS<b>5</b> to MS<b>8</b> included in the first and second multiplexers corresponding to the signal wiring Sig<sub>1 </sub>to Sig<sub>8</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As third processing, the controller <b>110</b> alters at least one of an amplification factor of an amplifier circuit associated with a predetermined pixel column and an amplification factor of an amplifier circuit associated with a different pixel column different from the predetermined pixel column such that the amplification factors are different, as needed. For example, the controller <b>110</b> controls the amplification factors by supplying the gain adjusting signal <b>116</b><i>a </i>to a switch group of an amplifier circuit associated with an odd-numbered pixel column and supplying the gain adjusting signal <b>116</b><i>b </i>to a switch group of an amplifier circuit associated with an even-numbered pixel column.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As fourth processing, the controller <b>110</b> alters at least one of an amplification factor of the first variable amplifier <b>205</b><i>a </i>and an amplification factor of the second variable amplifier <b>205</b><i>b </i>such that the amplification factors are different, as needed. This alteration is also performed in synchronization with an operation carried out by the first and second multiplexers, as in the second processing.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As fifth processing, the controller <b>110</b> controls the third reference supply <b>107</b><i>c </i>as needed in order to shift at least one of the levels of the A/D conversion characteristics of the first and second A/D converters <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>. The third reference supply <b>107</b><i>c </i>alters at least one of the reference voltage Vref<b>3</b><i>a </i>to be supplied to the first A/D converter <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the reference voltage Vref<b>3</b><i>b </i>to be supplied to the second A/D converter <b>104</b><i>b </i>such that the reference voltages Vref<b>3</b><i>a </i>and Vref<b>3</b><i>b </i>have different voltage values. This alteration is also performed in synchronization with an operation carried out by the first and second multiplexers, as in the second processing.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is useful that the controller <b>110</b> perform the above-described processing on the basis of information regarding nonlinearity of each of the first and second A/D converters <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>stored in the storage unit <b>109</b>. In this case, the processing can be performed such that, on the basis of that information, a difference between a mean value of digital signals output from the first A/D converter <b>104</b><i>a </i>and a mean value of digital signals output from the second A/D converter <b>104</b><i>b </i>is reduced. This enables processing of reducing a difference with higher precision.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is to be noted that, if the above-described processing is performed on only an image signal in image capturing, an unnecessary signal component is added to an image signal to be obtained, so accuracy of the obtained image signal may decrease. To address this, in the embodiment of the present invention, an image signal in image capturing and a correction image signal for use in correction of the image signal in image capturing, such as an image signal for offset correction or an image signal for sensitivity correction, are obtained by substantially the same processing. Then, the digital signal processor <b>105</b> performs correction using the obtained correction image signal and the obtained image signal in image capturing and outputs the corrected image signal. Such processing enables an image whose added unnecessary signal component is removed or reduced, artifact, such as a step, is reduced, and image quality is good to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Specific processing will be described in detail below using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a timing chart for use in describing an operation of the image pickup apparatus when the second processing is used in obtainment of an image signal in image capturing and in obtainment of an offset correction image signal.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After a pulse of radiation is applied to the image pickup apparatus, electric signals are read from a plurality of pixels on a row-by-row basis in order to obtain an image signal in image capturing. Signals read in parallel from the first pixel group <b>101</b><i>a </i>to the first readout circuit <b>103</b><i>a </i>on a row-by-row basis are converted into serial signals by sequential selection of the switches MS<b>1</b> to MS<b>4</b> of the first multiplexer <b>204</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, signals read in parallel from the second pixel group <b>101</b><i>b </i>to the second readout circuit <b>103</b><i>b </i>on a row-by-row basis are converted into serial signals by sequential selection of the switches MS<b>5</b> to MS<b>8</b> of the second multiplexer <b>204</b><i>b</i>. In the present embodiment, the switch MS<b>1</b> of the first multiplexer <b>204</b><i>a </i>and the switch MS<b>5</b> of the second multiplexer <b>204</b><i>b </i>are selected at substantially the same timing. Similarly, the switches MS<b>2</b> and MS<b>6</b>, the switches MS<b>3</b> and MS<b>7</b>, and the switches MS<b>4</b> and MS<b>8</b> are selected at substantially the same respective timings. Such selection enables signals to be read in parallel from the first and second pixel groups <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b</i>, so the speed of reading can be enhanced. For the processing illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a reference voltage to be supplied to each of the first and second variable amplifiers is controlled using the second reference voltage adjusting signal <b>118</b><i>b </i>in synchronization with an operation of selecting a switch included in the first and second multiplexers. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the control is performed such that when a switch in an odd-numbered column is selected, the reference voltage is set higher than a preset reference voltage; when a switch in an even-numbered column is selected, the preset reference voltage is used.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Then, after an image signal in image capturing is obtained, in a period of time substantially the same as the period of time of the application of the previous pulse of radiation, a dark-time output based on an electrical charge generated by a conversion element when no radiation is applied to the image pickup apparatus is obtained, i.e., an offset correction image signal is obtained. Also in obtaining such an offset correction image signal, substantially the same processing is performed as in obtaining an image signal in image capturing. An offset correction is carried out by subtracting the offset correction image signal from the obtained image signal in image capturing, so the corrected image signal is obtained. In the present specific example, the amount of change in reference voltage supplied to each variable amplifier may be determined in real time by the controller <b>110</b> using calculation based on information stored in the storage unit <b>109</b>, or it may be determined in advance based on information regarding nonlinearity of each of the first and second A/D converters.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the present specific example, an offset correction image signal is obtained after an image signal in image capturing is obtained. However, the embodiment of the present invention is not limited to this example. For example, an offset correction image signal may be obtained in advance through processing, and an image signal in image capturing may be obtained through substantially the same processing.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the present embodiment, A/D conversion is carried out using two different ways of alteration processing, in which one corresponds to an even-numbered column and the other corresponds to an odd-numbered column. It is useful that more than two ways, for example, four ways be adopted. In addition, it is useful that the embodiment of the present invention be applied to an A/D converter whose structure tends to cause nonlinear error, such as a pipeline A/D converter.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the present embodiment, two A/D converters are used. Of course, the embodiment of the present invention may be applied to the case where more than two A/D converters are used. Although it is useful that all A/D converters be subjected to alteration processing, only part of the plurality of A/D converters can be subjected to alteration processing.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As each reference supply used in the present embodiment, a publicly known variable power supply, such as one capable of simply outputting two voltage values or one including a D/A converter and capable of achieving finer adjustment, can be suitably used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A second embodiment of the present invention will now be described below using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a conceptual diagram of an image pickup system, the conceptual diagram containing an equivalent circuit diagram of an image pickup apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The same reference numerals are used in components having the same configurations as ones described in the first embodiment, and the detailed description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the first embodiment, in a plurality of pixels arranged in the row direction among a plurality of pixels included in the first or second pixel group, an analog electric signal from a predetermined pixel is subjected to processing different from alteration of an analog electric signal from a different pixel from the predetermined pixel. Alternatively, within a period of time for which analog electric signals from a plurality of pixels arranged in the row direction among a plurality of pixels included in the first or second pixel group are processed, a reference voltage to be supplied to each of the first and second A/D converters is subjected to alteration processing. In contrast to this, in the second embodiment, processing different from alteration of an analog electric signal from a pixel included in the second pixel group is performed on an analog electric signal from a pixel included in the first pixel group. Alternatively, processing different from alteration of an A/D conversion characteristic of the second A/D converter is performed on the first A/D converter. That is, this processing reduces a difference being the difference between a mean value of image signals obtained from the first pixel group and a mean value of image signals obtained from the second pixel group, as compared with the case in which no such processing is performed. That is, the processing is performed for each readout circuit or each A/D converter associated with each pixel group so as to reduce an output difference between a plurality of A/D converters. The above-described processing is performed so as to reduce a difference being the difference between a mean value of digital signals output from the first A/D converter and a mean value of digital signals output from the second A/D converter. It is to be noted that, in the present embodiment, for control for each readout circuit, the controller <b>110</b> supplies the first amplifier circuit section <b>202</b><i>a </i>with a gain adjusting signal <b>116</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; and supplies the second amplifier circuit section <b>202</b><i>b </i>with a gain adjusting signal <b>116</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;. The first reference supply <b>107</b><i>a </i>supplies the first amplifier circuit section <b>202</b><i>a </i>with the reference voltage Vref<b>1</b><i>a </i>and supplies the second amplifier circuit section <b>202</b><i>b </i>with the reference voltage Vref<b>1</b><i>b</i>. Such processing reduces the difference between mean values of image signals associated with pixel groups and results in a reduction in difference, as compared with the case in which no such processing is performed. In the present embodiment, to perform the above-described processing, the controller <b>110</b> carries out at least one of processing described below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As first processing, the controller <b>110</b> controls the first reference supply <b>107</b><i>a </i>as needed. The first reference supply <b>107</b><i>a </i>alters at least one of the reference voltage Vref<b>1</b><i>a </i>to be supplied to the first amplifier circuit section <b>202</b><i>a </i>and the reference voltage Vref<b>1</b><i>b </i>to be supplied to the second amplifier circuit section <b>202</b><i>b </i>such that the reference voltages Vref<b>1</b><i>a </i>and Vref<b>1</b><i>b </i>have different voltage values.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As second processing, the controller <b>110</b> controls the second reference supply <b>107</b><i>b </i>as needed.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As third processing, the controller <b>110</b> alters at least one of an amplification factor of the first amplifier circuit section <b>202</b><i>a </i>and an amplification factor of the second amplifier circuit section <b>202</b><i>b </i>such that the amplification factors are different, as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As fourth processing, the controller <b>110</b> alters at least one of an amplification factor of the first variable amplifier <b>205</b><i>a </i>and an amplification factor of the second variable amplifier <b>205</b><i>b </i>such that the amplification factors are different, as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As fifth processing, the controller <b>110</b> controls the third reference supply <b>107</b><i>c </i>as needed in order to shift at least one of the levels of the A/D conversion characteristics of the first and second A/D converters <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>. The third reference supply <b>107</b><i>c </i>alters at least one of the reference voltage Vref<b>3</b><i>a </i>to be supplied to the first A/D converter <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the reference voltage Vref<b>3</b><i>b </i>to be supplied to the second A/D converter <b>104</b><i>b </i>such that the reference voltages Vref<b>3</b><i>a </i>and Vref<b>3</b><i>b </i>have different voltage values.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is useful that the controller <b>110</b> perform the above-described processing on the basis of information regarding nonlinearity of each of the first and second A/D converters <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>stored in the storage unit <b>109</b>. The above-described processing is performed so as to reduce a difference being the difference between a mean value of digital signals output from the first A/D converter and a mean value of digital signals output from the second A/D converter, as compared with the case in which no such processing is performed. This enables reduction in difference with higher precision. For example, the case is described below in which the above second processing is performed in obtaining a correction image signal for offset correction using the first and second A/D converters <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>having the characteristics illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. A case is discussed where a predetermined reference voltage is supplied to each of the first and second variable amplifiers <b>205</b><i>a </i>and <b>205</b><i>b </i>and, for example, offset correction image signals having a mean value of approximately 0.2 (V) are output from the first and second variable amplifiers. In contrast, processing is performed such that a reference voltage to be supplied to the second variable amplifier <b>205</b><i>b </i>is lower than a predetermined reference voltage and offset correction image signals having a mean value of approximately 0.1 (V) are output from the second variable amplifier <b>205</b><i>b</i>. This enables reduction in difference between mean values of digital signals output from the first and second A/D converters. It is to be noted that, when information regarding nonlinearity of each of the first and second A/D converters is obtained in advance, the processing may be set in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Also in the present embodiment, an image signal in image capturing and a correction image signal for use in correction of the image signal in image capturing, such as an offset correction image signal or a sensitivity correction image signal, are obtained by substantially the same processing such that they have substantially the amount of change, as in the case of the first embodiment. Then, the digital signal processor <b>105</b> performs correction using the obtained correction image signal and the obtained image signal in image capturing and outputs the corrected image signal. Such processing enables an image whose added unnecessary signal component is removed or reduced, artifact, such as a step, is reduced, and image quality is good to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the present embodiment, it is useful that at least one of the above-described processing be performed in synchronization with scanning on the first and second pixel groups <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b </i>by the driving circuit <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a timing chart when the second processing in the present embodiment is performed in synchronization with scanning of the detector by the driving circuit. As compared with the first embodiment, in which the processing is performed in synchronization with an operation carried out by the multiplexers, each alteration processing can be performed in synchronization with scanning by the driving circuit at a lower speed, and noise can also be reduced to a low level. Therefore, difficulty in alteration processing can be relieved, and effects caused by noise can be reduced.</p>
