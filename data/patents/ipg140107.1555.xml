<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An orthodontic brace system includes brackets having a diamond-shaped tie-wing configuration that defines two parallel, horizontal slots, each of which is adapted to receive an archwire. Each slot is angled with respect to the base of the bracket to produce a specific, maximum torque value, and generally, the maximum torque value of the gingival slot is less than the maximum torque value of the incisal slot. The brackets provide multiple force vectors in different directions simultaneously, which decreases the amount of time required for a patient to wear braces, reduces the number of costly and time consuming visits to an orthodontist, and reduces time and effort required of an orthodontist for installation and adjustment of the braces on a per visit basis. A self-ligating bracket with a sliding door is disclosed in another embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/967,445, filed on Dec. 14, 2010.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to orthodontic braces and orthodontic brace systems used to straighten a patient's teeth. More specifically, the present invention includes a brace system wherein the brackets that are affixed to a patient's teeth are configured with multiple slots for receiving an archwire, so that an orthodontist may have increased flexibility in routing the archwire throughout brackets aligned along a row of teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Heretofore, many different types of orthodontic braces have been developed and commercialized. Orthodontic treatment of teeth is accomplished by applying force to the teeth with archwires positioned in the channels or slots positioned on attachments on the teeth which are called brackets. Generally, these brackets are applied to the front of a patient's teeth, and include a single slot for receiving an archwire, which is oftentimes held in place within the slots by using small elastic bands (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;elastic ligatures,&#x201d; or &#x201c;elastic modules&#x201d;) that fit over the front of the archwire and are secured around tie-wings positioned on the bracket. Archwires are bent, shaped, and tightened frequently to achieve the desired results. Inter-arch elastics (often referred to as &#x201c;rubber bands&#x201d;) are attached from one bracket to another or from one archwire to another in order to move teeth and improve the bite relationship. The placement and configuration of the inter-arch elastics will depend on the course of treatment and the individual patient. Inter-arch elastics are made in different diameters, colors, sizes, and strengths. Modern orthodontics makes frequent use of nickel-titanium archwires and temperature-sensitive materials. When cold, the heat-activated archwire is limp and flexible, easily threaded between brackets of any configuration. Once heated to body temperature, the archwire will stiffen and seek to retain its original shape, creating constant light force on the teeth. Other types of archwires are not heat activated, and have what is referred to as &#x201c;memory,&#x201d; meaning that they may be bent in any direction but seek to retain their original straight configuration, without regard to any temperature differential.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Every few months, the braces must be adjusted. This adjustment helps shift the teeth into the correct position. When the braces are adjusted, the elastic ligatures keeping the wire in place are removed. The wire is then taken out, and may be replaced or modified. Sometimes, as the teeth have shifted due to the pressure from the archwire, adjustments require that the archwire be removed, and then often require that one or more brackets be removed and repositioned on that particular tooth. Brackets are repositioned in order to obtain the optimal site on the teeth to provide the necessary leverage and torque to continue moving the teeth along the path to proper alignment. Removing and repositioning a bracket is a costly, time consuming process. Additionally, brackets are manufactured to include a specific amount of maximum torque by providing a slot that is disposed at a particular angle with respect to the teeth. Thus, orthodontists must keep a large inventory of a variety of different brackets, in order to have brackets with proper torque levels on hand for orthodontic procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, it would be desirable to provide an orthodontic bracket and system that is configured to reduce time spent adjusting the archwire, and which is designed to reduce instances where a bracket must be removed and repositioned on a particular tooth. There exists a need for a novel, flexible bracket system, wherein the bracket includes multiple slots that are capable of receiving the archwire. Additionally, it would be desirable to provide a bracket that includes a diamond-shaped tie-wing configuration that allows the archwire to be threaded through in multiple directions and orientations, depending on the direction, torque and pressure required to align a specific tooth. Further, it would be desirable to provide a bracket with multiple archwire slots, wherein each horizontal slot is configured to include a different level of maximum torque (otherwise known as inclination), thereby reducing the amount of brackets that an orthodontist must maintain in inventory. Additionally, it would be desirable to provide a bracket with multiple archwire slots, further including a self-ligating element in the form of a hinged or sliding door that may be easily opened and closed by an orthodontist for inserting, adjusting and securing the archwire therein.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, an orthodontic bracket includes four tie-wings, wherein a single upper tie wing is provided together with a single lower tie wing, and a pair of opposed side tie wings are disposed therebetween, one on the left hand side, and one on the right hand side. This configuration defines two parallel horizontal slots, one upper slot being positioned between the upper tie wing and the two side tie-wings, and a lower slot, positioned between the lower tie-wing and the two side tie-wings. Each horizontal slot is configured to provide a different, specific amount of maximum torque when the archwire is applied. Additionally, a vertical slot is positioned between the two side tie-wings, beneath the upper tie wing and above the lower tie-wing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment of the present invention, an archwire may be threaded through and secured within the upper slot or the lower slot, depending upon the position of the particular tooth, and further depending on the orientation and pressure requirements of that tooth. Alternatively, the archwire may be threaded through the bracket so that it enters the bracket through the upper slot, and is then threaded downwardly through the vertical slot and through the lower slot on an opposed side of the bracket, creating a wave-shape in the archwire for that particular bracket. Conversely, the archwire may be threaded in the opposite manner through a bracket, so that the archwire enters the lower slot on one side, is threaded upwardly through the vertical slot, and is then threaded through the upper slot on the opposed side. The archwire may be directed through the bracket in any of these configurations, depending on the current orientation and position of the tooth, and further depending on where torque or pressure must be applied in order to align the tooth within the row of teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, the bracket may include a self-ligating element in the form of a hinged or sliding door, which may obviate or reduce the need to use elastics to secure the archwire to the bracket. The self ligating bracket may include a door or doors that may provide access to the bracket slots, when in an open position, and which may be used to secure the archwire to the bracket, when the door is in the closed position. A single door may be used to cover a single slot or multiple slots. Alternatively, multiple doors may be used, each covering a single slot. In yet another embodiment, a bracket having a pair of slots may include a single door to cover a single slot, and elastics may be used to secure the archwire to the slot having no door.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A first embodiment of an orthodontic brace bracket <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The bracket <b>10</b> includes a base member <b>12</b> having four tie-wings in a diamond-shaped configuration. A single upper tie-wing <b>14</b> is provided on an upper portion of the bracket, and a single lower tie-wing <b>16</b> is provided on a lower portion of the bracket <b>10</b>. A left tie-wing <b>18</b> is provided on the left side of the bracket <b>10</b> and a right tie-wing <b>20</b> is provided on the right side thereof. The tie-wings define a pair of horizontal, parallel slots, including an upper slot <b>22</b> and a lower slot <b>24</b>. Each horizontal slot <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> is formed to define a specific angle in order to provide a specific, maximum amount of torque. Each bracket <b>10</b> is also configured to provide a specified angulation for each tooth. Additionally, a vertical slot <b>26</b> is positioned between the two side tie-wings <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, beneath the upper tie-wing <b>14</b> and above the lower tie-wing <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This diamond-shaped configuration of the tie-wings allows an archwire <b>28</b> to be threaded through the bracket <b>10</b> in several paths. The archwire <b>28</b> may be threaded through either the upper slot <b>22</b> or the lower slot <b>24</b>, depending upon how the particular tooth is situated, and further depending on the pressure and torque that must be applied to the tooth in order to achieve proper alignment. Alternatively, the archwire <b>28</b> may be threaded through the lower slot <b>24</b>, then up through the vertical slot <b>26</b>, and then through the upper slot <b>22</b> on the opposed side, creating a wave configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Conversely, the archwire <b>28</b> may be threaded through the upper slot <b>22</b>, then downwardly through the vertical slot <b>26</b>, and finally out through the lower slot <b>24</b> on the opposed side. In some cases, two archwires <b>28</b> may be utilized simultaneously, with one archwire <b>28</b> in the upper slot <b>22</b> and another in the lower slot <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The parallel, horizontal slots <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are configured so that each slot is disposed at a different angle, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The angular configuration of each slot determines the maximum amount of torque that may be applied to the bracket <b>10</b>, and thus, the corresponding tooth. In a preferred embodiment, the gingival slot (closest to the patient's gumline) generally defines a lesser angle, and thus is configured to allow a lower value of maximum torque. The incisal slot (farthest from the gumline) in a preferred embodiment generally defines a greater angle, and thus is configured to allow a greater value of maximum torque. Typically, the gingival slot is configured to allow maximum torque in the range of about &#x2212;33&#xb0; to about 22&#xb0;, and in a more preferred embodiment, the range is &#x2212;22&#xb0; to about 12&#xb0;. The incisal slot is configured to allow maximum torque in the range of about &#x2212;22&#xb0; to about 33&#xb0;, and in a more preferred embodiment, the range is about &#x2212;15&#xb0; to about 22&#xb0;. The most preferred torque values for individual teeth are set forth in Table 1:</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For purposes of clarity, for maxillary brackets (adhered to upper teeth), the gingival slot is the upper slot <b>22</b> and the incisal slot is the lower slot <b>24</b>. Conversely, for mandibular brackets (adhered to lower teeth), the gingival slot is the lower slot <b>24</b> and the incisal slot is the upper slot <b>22</b>. Optionally, a small indention <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or triangular marker <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10D</figref>) may be placed on the gingival tie-wing to show how the bracket <b>10</b> should be oriented on a patient's tooth. The triangular marker <b>32</b> points left to indicate that the bracket <b>10</b> is designed for the right side of the dental arch. Conversely, the triangular marker <b>32</b> points right to indicate that the bracket is designed for the left side of the dental arch. Maxillary brackets are designated by two triangular markers <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>) while the mandibular brackets are designated by one triangular marker <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10C and 10D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The brackets <b>10</b> may be specifically configured for particular teeth. For instance, the brackets <b>10</b> used for mandibular central incisors and mandibular lateral incisors may be interchangeable, with maximum torque for the gingival slot configured to be &#x2212;11&#xb0; and maximum torque for the incisal slot configured to be &#x2212;1&#xb0;, for instance, with 0&#xb0; angulation. The brackets <b>10</b> for the first maxillary premolar and the second maxillary premolar on the right side may be interchangeable with one another, and the brackets <b>10</b> for first maxillary premolar and second maxillary premolar on the left side may also be interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With respect to corresponding contralateral brackets, some brackets <b>10</b> are designed to be mirror images of each other, largely due to the angulation factor (or, more simply stated, angulation). The angulation factor, for purposes of clarity, means that certain teeth <b>36</b>, when properly aligned, are slightly angled toward a central point (such as the midline between the central incisors). For instance, the maxillary left lateral incisor bracket <b>10</b> may be configured to include a maximum torque of 8&#xb0; in the gingival slot and a maximum torque of 14&#xb0; in the incisal slot, with 9&#xb0; angulation, while the maxillary right lateral incisor bracket is simply the mirror image of the left, thus including a &#x2212;9&#xb0; angulation factor. The maxillary left central incisor bracket <b>10</b> may be configured so that the gingival slot is configured to include maximum torque of 12&#xb0; and the incisal slot is configured to include a maximum torque of 22&#xb0;, with an angulation factor of 5&#xb0;, while the maxillary right central incisor bracket is a mirror image thereof, with an angulation factor of &#x2212;5&#xb0;. It should be understood that the maximum torque of each slot and the angulation factor may be varied during the manufacturing process, as desired, and the above numerical values assigned for torque and angulation are merely examples of a preferred embodiment. Additionally, as described herein, torque values are the maximum torque values for a specific slot, and it is common to place a lower gauge archwire <b>28</b> through a slot so that the amount of torque applied to the tooth <b>36</b> is less than the maximum torque available for that slot.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Overall, the brackets may be manufactured to account for several variables, including the size of the bracket <b>10</b> (which should be proportional to the size of the tooth), the angulation of the bracket and the maximum torque of each slot. Typically, each rectangular slot has an opening or either approximately 0.022 inches or approximately 0.018 inches, although it is contemplated that larger or smaller slots may be used within the scope of the invention. A single bracket <b>10</b> may include two 0.022 inch slots, two 0.018 inch slots, or one 0.022 inch slot and one 0.018 inch slot.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The diamond shaped tie-wing configuration of the brackets <b>10</b> allows the present orthodontic brace system to be more flexible than other types of systems. Orthodontists may elect to use the gingival slots for non-extraction cases (requiring less torque), and for Dolichofacial patients, and may use the incisal slot for extraction cases (requiring more torque) and for Brachyfacial patients. The present system is also particularly useful for deep bite correction and open bite correction. Advantageously, the present system may be used to address all of these situations.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally, the present system provides increased flexibility in the use and configuration of elastic ligatures. Typical orthodontic brackets require that the elastic ligatures be secured around all four tie-wings, in order to secure the archwire to the bracket. However, the present system allows an orthodontist to choose between using two tie-wings, three tie-wings or four tie-wings, depending upon how the tooth is situated and what force vectors are required for proper alignment. For instance, if a particular tooth <b>36</b> is rotated in a mesial-in direction, an orthodontist may attach the elastic ligature <b>40</b> to the upper tie-wing <b>14</b>, the lower tie-wing <b>16</b> and the mesial tie-wing to de-rotate the tooth <b>36</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The diamond-shaped tie-wing configuration on the brackets <b>10</b> allows multiple vectors of force to be applied to a tooth simultaneously. Prior orthodontic brace systems often apply force in only one direction or vector at a time. For instance, an orthodontist may employ a small to mid-sized archwire <b>28</b> with an elastic power chain <b>38</b> immediately upon installation of the braces on a patient in order to close a gap between adjacent teeth <b>36</b> by moving the crowns of the adjacent teeth together, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. Then, in a later orthodontic appointment, the orthodontist may remove the mid-sized archwire <b>28</b> and replace it with sequential heavier gauge (stiffer) archwires <b>28</b> to move the roots of the teeth <b>36</b> into a more desirable position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>. The diamond-shaped tie-wing configuration, however, provides a means for imposing force vectors in multiple directions, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Thus, the two-step operation described above, in many cases, is unnecessary, and the correction and alignment of teeth using brackets with the diamond-shaped tie-wing configuration (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9D and 9E</figref>) is much faster. In other words, the present configuration addresses teeth adjustments of the first order (in toward the tongue or out toward the cheek), second order (up or down, also known as gingival or incisal), the third order (torque), rotation, and angulation to be addressed simultaneously, which means the teeth can be straightened up and aligned more quickly, and potentially with fewer expensive and time-consuming visits to the orthodontist. Indeed, one major advantage to the present system is that patients are required to wear braces for a much shorter time period, because the simultaneous multi-vector approach reduces the steps and phases required by more conventional brace systems. Due to the fact that the present system is so versatile, it allows an orthodontist to maintain a much smaller inventory of brackets, which can result in significant cost savings for orthodontic practices.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Another advantage to the present system is that providing multiple archwire slots for each bracket drastically reduces the number of instances when an orthodontist must remove a bracket <b>10</b> from a tooth <b>36</b> and reattach it in a new position. There are many situations where, using the present system, the archwire <b>28</b> may simply be removed from one slot and replaced in the second slot without having to detach the bracket <b>10</b> from the tooth <b>36</b>, thus saving time and expense. Also, if a diamond-shaped tie-wing bracket <b>10</b> is improperly placed on a tooth <b>36</b>, an orthodontist may simply choose to use the most convenient slot, thus obviating the need to remove and reposition the bracket. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> illustrate such a situation, where a bracket <b>10</b> on the center tooth <b>36</b> is slightly misplaced, because it was bonded to the tooth <b>36</b> before the tooth was fully erupted. In such a case, having the two parallel slots allows the orthodontist to use the more convenient gingival slot, rather than the incisal slot, thus saving time and effort for the orthodontist. Also, another advantage to the system is the need for fewer wires. Traditional braces may require as many as 9 archwires <b>28</b> during a progression whereas this new system would require merely 1 or 2 archwires <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, in some cases, it is advantageous to use two archwires <b>28</b> simultaneously. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a row of five teeth <b>36</b>, wherein the middle tooth <b>36</b> is out of alignment, while the outer four teeth are properly aligned. Using brackets <b>10</b> having the diamond-shaped tie-wing configuration, a heavier gauge archwire <b>28</b> may be positioned within the incisal slots of the four outer teeth, in order to maintain proper alignment of those teeth. A secondary, smaller gauge archwire <b>28</b> may be positioned in the gingival slots of the outer four teeth, as shown, and through the incisal slot of the middle tooth bracket <b>10</b>, in order to bring that tooth <b>36</b> into proper alignment without disrupting the alignment of the other four teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Additionally, there are other circumstances and situations where it is advantageous to provide an orthodontic bracket system capable of utilizing two archwires simultaneously. For example, if one tooth is impacted (which means it is stuck in the bone, and has not penetrated the gum), an oral surgeon may uncover the crown of the impacted tooth, and then may bond a button with a gold chain to the impacted tooth. In that situation, a primary archwire may be applied to the brackets of the other teeth, excluding the impacted tooth, and a secondary archwire may be positioned through the second (typically incisal) slot of the other teeth, and may be connected to the impacted tooth to act as an eruption appliance (more commonly referred to as a traction loop). The traction loop is designed to pull the impacted tooth downwardly and outwardly. The advantage of this arrangement, of course, is that the primary archwire may maintain alignment of the other teeth, while the secondary archwire is used to properly guide and align the impacted tooth.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should be understood that other features commonly associated with prior art orthodontic brace systems may be incorporated into the present invention, including ball hooks for elastics, which are typically available on the canine and premolar brackets. Power chains <b>38</b> may be used with the present invention as well, which work particularly well with the present invention, because the power chain <b>38</b> used with prior art brackets tends to rest on the archwire <b>28</b>, causing friction and resistance to the desired force, while power chains <b>38</b> used in connection with the present invention do not come into contact (or are in minimal contact) with the archwire <b>28</b>, thus eliminating the problem of undesirable friction therebetween, and by extension resulting in faster tooth movement.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows another embodiment of an orthodontic bracket <b>10</b> having the diamond-shaped tie-wing configuration, further including a pair of sliding doors <b>50</b> that may be used to slide over the slots <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> in order to secure an archwire (not shown) therein. In this embodiment, an upper door <b>50</b> is positioned within a channel <b>52</b> disposed on a front surface of the upper tie wing <b>14</b>, and a lower door <b>50</b> is positioned within a channel <b>52</b> disposed on a front surface of the lower tie wing <b>16</b>. Each door <b>50</b> includes a snap-fit mechanism including a pair of small round bulges <b>54</b>, which are used to engage corresponding small divots <b>56</b> positioned on the left and right tie-wings <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, so that each sliding door <b>50</b> may be snapped and secured into a closed position. Corresponding divots <b>56</b> are also positioned within the channel <b>52</b> of the upper and lower tie-wings <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, so that the sliding doors <b>50</b> may be snap-fit into an open position, as well, for purposes of archwire insertion, adjustment, or replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Such brackets <b>10</b> are called &#x201c;self-ligating&#x201d; brackets, because they do not require elastics or other means to secure the archwires within the slots <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the bracket <b>10</b>. The lower portions of the left and right tie-wings <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are slightly recessed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, in order to accommodate the angle of the lower slot <b>24</b>, so that the sliding door <b>50</b> may properly slide into a closed position and the snap-fit mechanism may be engaged. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows the doors <b>50</b> in a closed position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> shows a bottom view of the self-ligating bracket <b>10</b>, wherein the bottom sliding door <b>50</b> is positioned within the channel <b>52</b>, and wherein the snap-fit mechanism is engaged in a closed position. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the sliding door <b>50</b> in a closed position over the slot <b>24</b> with the snap-fit mechanism engaged and secured.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> show yet another embodiment of a self-ligating bracket <b>10</b>, wherein a single sliding door <b>50</b> is disposed in a channel <b>52</b> that extends from a lower tie-wing <b>16</b>, through an inner portion of the left and right tie-wings <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, and ends within the upper tie-wing <b>14</b>. The single sliding door <b>50</b> may be disposed in a closed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, or may be disposed in an open position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, or any position therebetween. In a preferred embodiment, a snap-fit mechanism as described above may be used, wherein the door <b>50</b> includes a pair of small round bulges <b>54</b> that engage divots <b>56</b> positioned on the upper and lower tie-wings <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, as shown. Alternatively, it is contemplated that the round bulges <b>54</b> may be positioned on the tie-wings, while the divots <b>56</b> may be positioned on the sliding door <b>50</b>, on this or any other embodiment described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a self-ligating bracket <b>10</b>, wherein the bracket <b>10</b> includes five tie-wings: a top tie-wing <b>60</b>, upper right and left tie-wings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and lower right and left tie-wings <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>. Parallel horizontal slots <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are disposed between the tie-wings, wherein the upper slot <b>22</b> is disposed between the top tie-wing <b>60</b> and the upper left and right tie-wings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and the lower slot <b>24</b> is disposed between the upper right and left tie wings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> on one side and the lower right and left tie-wings <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> on the other. A sliding door <b>50</b> is positioned within a central channel <b>52</b> that extends between the lower tie wings <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and the upper tie wings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and ending at the top tie-wing <b>60</b>. Again, the snap-fit mechanism described above may be used to secure the sliding door <b>50</b> in an open position or a closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> is an alternate embodiment of a partially self-ligating bracket <b>10</b>, wherein the tie-wing configuration is similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, but wherein the sliding door <b>50</b> is only used in conjunction with the lower slot <b>24</b>, as shown. In this embodiment, the sliding door <b>50</b> is disposed within a channel <b>52</b>, which only extends through the lower tie-wings <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and ends at the upper left and right tie-wings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>. Additionally, if an archwire (not shown) is positioned within the upper slot <b>22</b> of the bracket <b>10</b> of this embodiment, elastics may be used to secure the archwire within the slot <b>22</b>. The elastic may extend between either the top tie-wing <b>60</b> and the upper left tie-wing <b>64</b>, or between the top tie-wing <b>60</b> and the upper right tie-wing <b>62</b>, or may be disposed about all three tie-wings <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, and <b>64</b>, or may be disposed about all five tie-wings <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, and <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13C and 13D</figref> show another alternate embodiment of an orthodontic bracket, wherein the tie-wings are configured similarly to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, but which does not include the sliding door, and thus is not considered to be self-ligating. In this embodiment, elastics are used in the traditional manner, rather than the sliding doors, to secure the archwire within the slots of the bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In order to use any of the self-ligating brackets shown and described herein, an orthodontist may attach the brackets <b>10</b> to a patient's teeth, slide the sliding doors <b>50</b> into an open position, and insert the archwire <b>28</b>. Then, when the archwire <b>28</b> is in the proper position, the sliding doors <b>50</b> may be closed and secured in the closed position with the snap-fit mechanism, or by using any other means for securing the sliding doors <b>50</b> into the closed position. For adjustment or replacement of the archwire, the orthodontist may open the sliding door <b>50</b> to any particular bracket (or multiple brackets), adjust, remove or replace the archwire disposed therein, and then return the sliding door <b>50</b> to the closed position. It is also contemplated that the doors may be hinged, rather than sliding.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">One of the main purposes of the self-ligating brackets is to avoid the use of elastic modules, thereby eliminating the friction from the elastic modules which would result in faster tooth movement. Additionally, the sliding doors <b>50</b> of the self-ligating brackets provide a smoother and sleeker orthodontic look for the patient, and provide a less-plaque-retentive surface than elastics provide resulting in a more hygienic orthodontic appliance.</p>
