<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Playing card games have been popular for many years. However, with the advent of computer games, the more hands-on nature of classic playing card games appears to have taken a backseat. Many of today's computer games do not require an opponent, allowing individuals to play alone with no personal interaction, one-on-one or group competition. Further, many of the old style playing card games are necessarily restricted by the inherent limitations of the standard playing card deck which can lack sophistication, creativity, diversity, complexity and an element of timing. As a consequence, individuals are not typically motivated to collect or trade cards from the standard deck of playing cards, and are therefore less likely to use such standard decks. Thus, an increasing number of individuals appear to be gravitating toward somewhat more anti-social, less hands-on, computer games.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed toward a trading card game for a first player and a second player. The game includes one or more first cards that each has only one immovable section. The game also includes a second card for each player that includes a first section and a second section. The second section can be movable relative to the first section so that the second card moves between a first position and a second position. In the first position, a portion of the second section is unexposed to the players. In the second position, the portion of the second section is exposed to the players, and influences the outcome of at least a portion of the game. In one embodiment, the second section has a first side and an opposing second side. The first side includes a first indicia and the second side includes a second indicia, with each indicia influencing the outcome of at least a portion of the game, depending upon which side is visible to the players.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In another embodiment, the second card includes a third section that is slidable relative to the first section. The third section moves relative to the first section and the second section. The third section also can influence the outcome of at least a portion of the game. In one embodiment, the unexposed indicia on the second section and/or the third section is known to one of the players before the indicia is exposed, e.g., before the game commences.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In still another embodiment, the second card includes a first surface, a second surface and a third surface. The third surface moves relative to the first and second surfaces between (i) a first position wherein a portion of the third surface is substantially unexposed to the players, and (ii) a second position wherein the portion of the third surface is exposed to the players. In this embodiment, the surfaces remain substantially parallel to one another when the third surface is in the first and second positions. Additionally, the third surface includes an indicia that influences the outcome of at least a portion of the trading card game.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is also directed toward a method for playing a trading card game between a first player and a second player.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as an overview, the present invention is directed toward a trading card game <b>10</b> (also referred to herein simply as &#x201c;game&#x201d;) that can be played by two or more players (not shown). The rules and visual appearance of the game can vary. However, the embodiments of the game provided herein each includes at least two structurally different types of trading cards (sometimes referred to herein simply as &#x201c;cards&#x201d;) including one or more first cards <b>12</b> and one or more second cards <b>14</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the game <b>10</b> also includes one or more play mats <b>16</b> upon which the cards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are placed during play.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the description which follows, at least one embodiment of a set of rules for the game <b>10</b> is provided. It should be recognized, however, that the rules herein provide one or more representations of literally countless possible sets of rules that can be used without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The rules to be followed for the game <b>10</b> can be decided by the players, or other versions of the rules can be used. Additionally, various indicia that can be included on one or more of the cards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in the game <b>10</b> are provided herein. However, each of the cards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> does not need to include all, or even some of the indicia described. Moreover, the description of the indicia and their respective effects on the game <b>10</b> is not intended to exclude additional possible indicia and their consequential effects. Stated another way, any inclusion or omission of a discussion regarding certain potential indicia that can be included on the cards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> is not intended to mandate or limit the scope of such indicia, or the types of possible effects on the outcome of part or all of the game <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In embodiments that use the play mat <b>16</b>, various predetermined positions can be included on the play mat <b>16</b> to assist the players. For more advanced players, a play mat <b>16</b> may not be necessary. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the game includes a first player region <b>18</b> and a second player region <b>20</b>. A portion of the regions <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> can overlap. In one embodiment, the overlapped area is referred to as an advantage region <b>22</b>. One embodiment of a layout of the game mat <b>16</b> will now be described with respect to the first player, recognizing that the layout of the game mat <b>16</b> is substantially similar from the perspective of the second player.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first player region <b>18</b> can include a plurality of zones. For example, in this embodiment, the first player region <b>18</b> includes a first zone <b>24</b>A, a second zone <b>24</b>B and a third zone <b>24</b>C, although any number of zones can be included in the present invention. The zones <b>24</b>A-C can be designated by different colors, numerical values, geometric shapes or any other suitable designation. Each zone <b>24</b>A-C can be energized to varying degrees depending upon the number of cards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> positioned within each zone <b>24</b>A-C. In one embodiment, the greater number of cards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> within a particular zone <b>24</b>A-C, the higher the energy of that zone <b>24</b>A-C. For example, at the outset of the game <b>10</b>, two first cards <b>12</b> can be placed in each zone <b>24</b>A-C, but this total typically changes as the game <b>10</b> progresses. Whenever energy is added, a first card <b>12</b> is placed facedown in the appropriate zone <b>24</b>A-C.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first zone <b>24</b>A is a player's first line of defense, followed by the second zone <b>24</b>B and the third zone <b>24</b>C. The zones <b>24</b>A-C can be positioned in any order on the play mat <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, if a player fails to defend in the third zone <b>24</b>C, the opponent player can score a point, as provided in detail below. The first player to score a predetermined number of points wins the game.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, each player uses a plurality of first cards <b>12</b> and only one second card <b>14</b>. Alternatively, greater than one second card <b>12</b> can be used by each player. The first player region <b>18</b> can include a plurality of substantially horizontal rows and a plurality of substantially vertical columns. The number of rows and/or columns can vary. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first player region <b>18</b> includes a top row <b>26</b>A, a middle row <b>26</b>B and a bottom row <b>26</b>C. Further, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first player region <b>18</b> includes a first column <b>28</b>A, a second column <b>28</b>B and a third column <b>28</b>C in addition to the zones <b>24</b>A-C described above.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The second card <b>14</b> can be positioned in the top row <b>26</b>A of the first column <b>28</b>A as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, while the remaining cards can be first cards <b>12</b> that are positioned in various other locations throughout the first player region <b>18</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a deck <b>30</b> of first cards <b>12</b> used by the first player can be positioned in the middle row <b>26</b>B in the first column <b>28</b>A. Additionally, a discard pile <b>32</b> can be positioned in the bottom row <b>26</b>C of the first column <b>28</b>A. However, it is recognized that the positioning of the cards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Moreover, the orientation of the cards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in each row <b>26</b>A-C of the first column <b>28</b>A can be altered in order to &#x201c;charge&#x201d; the row <b>26</b>A-C. In one embodiment, the rows <b>26</b>A-C are charged when the cards in the first column <b>28</b>A are turned approximately 90 degrees, as shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the first row <b>26</b>A becomes charged when the second card <b>14</b> is turned sideways <b>14</b>X. The second row <b>26</b>B becomes charged when the deck <b>30</b> is turned sideways <b>30</b>X, and the third row <b>26</b>C becomes charged when the discard pile <b>32</b> is turned sideways <b>32</b>X. In one embodiment, once the three rows <b>26</b>A-C are charged, the second card <b>14</b> can be used by the player, as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The second column <b>28</b>B and the third column <b>28</b>C can be used during the course of the game <b>10</b> when the player turns over cards one-at-a-time from that player's deck <b>30</b>, as explained herein. For ease of discussion, a portion of the description of the Figures below may refer back to the overall game <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a top view of one embodiment of the first card <b>212</b>. In this embodiment, the first card <b>212</b> includes only a substantially flat, non-movable section <b>234</b>. Thus, in this embodiment, the first card <b>212</b> is constructed to form a single piece of card material, and therefore, does not move relative to itself. Stated another way, the first card <b>212</b> has no moving sections. In this embodiment, the first card <b>212</b> can have a similar size and/or form factor to a standard playing card such as that found in a standard 52-card deck. Alternatively, the first card <b>212</b> can have dimensions that are greater or smaller than the form factor of a standard playing card.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As non-exclusive examples, each first card <b>212</b> can include one or more indicia, such as a card name <b>236</b>, a trait requirement <b>238</b>, one or more energy costs <b>240</b>A-C, a card type <b>241</b>, an intercept value <b>242</b>, a force value <b>244</b>, graphics or other aesthetic images <b>246</b>, rules text <b>248</b>, and/or a card version <b>250</b>. Each first card <b>212</b> can be unique, or a player may have more than one first card <b>212</b> with the same name <b>236</b> in play at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The card namer <b>236</b> can be a descriptive name or some other suitable designation. The trait requirement <b>238</b> can be a symbol, a number, or any other type of suitable image. The trait requirement <b>238</b> can be used by a player during construction of that player's deck. For example, in one embodiment, in order to use one of the first cards <b>212</b> having a specific trait requirement <b>238</b>, there must be a similar trait requirement symbol on one or more of the second cards <b>14</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) also used by that player. Therefore, from a strategic standpoint, the player can construct a deck <b>30</b> having first cards <b>212</b> with trait requirements <b>238</b> that match the trait requirement <b>238</b> of the second card <b>14</b> used by that player.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The energy costs <b>240</b>A-C represent the amount of energy that must be spent by the player to use a particular first card <b>212</b>. The number of different energy costs <b>240</b>A-C can vary depending upon a number of zones <b>24</b>A-C (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) being used in the game <b>10</b>. For example, if the game <b>10</b> includes three zones <b>24</b>A-C, each first card <b>212</b> can potentially include up to three energy costs <b>240</b>A-C that must be paid by the player in order to use the first card <b>212</b>. Each energy cost <b>240</b>A-C can be represented by a number or other graphic that is associated with each zone <b>24</b>A-C. In one embodiment, for instance, if a first card <b>212</b> costs one energy for the first zone <b>24</b>A, one first card <b>212</b> is removed from the first zone <b>24</b>A, and is placed face-up in that player's discard pile <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As an example, a particular first card <b>212</b> may have an energy cost <b>240</b>A of one card in the first zone <b>24</b>A and a further energy cost <b>240</b>C of one first card <b>212</b> in the third zone <b>24</b>C. The player wishing to play this strike would therefore take one first card <b>212</b> from the first zone <b>24</b>A, and one first card <b>212</b> from the third zone <b>24</b>C, and put them face-up in that player's discard pile <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, an energy cost <b>240</b>A from the first zone <b>24</b>A can also be paid with a first card <b>212</b> from either the second zone <b>24</b>B or the third zone <b>24</b>C. Further, any energy cost <b>240</b>B from the second zone <b>24</b>B can also be paid with a first card <b>212</b> from the third zone <b>24</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The card type <b>241</b> indicates the type of first card <b>212</b>. The card type <b>241</b> can provide the type of card using text or some other suitable means. The types of first cards <b>212</b> that can be included in the trading card game <b>10</b> can vary. In one embodiment, the inclusion or exclusion of certain indicia can distinguish one first card <b>212</b> from another first card <b>212</b>. Further, as non-exclusive examples, the first card <b>212</b> can be a strike card, a teamwork card or an advantage card, as explained in greater detail below. Each of these types of first cards <b>212</b> can perform different functions during the course of the game <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The strike card allows players to take turns attacking the opponent player while simultaneously defending against the opponent player's attacks. As an overview, in one embodiment of the rules of the game <b>10</b>, the objective is to score a predetermined number of strikes against the opponent player. For example, in one such embodiment, the objective is to score three strikes against the opponent player. However, the number of strikes required to win the game <b>10</b> can be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">If a player fails to stop a strike in each of that player's zones <b>24</b>A-C, the opposing player scores a point. The first player to gain a predetermined number of points wins the game <b>10</b>. The method of scoring a strike is provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Teamwork cards represent friends and allies that assist the player in combat. In one embodiment, teamwork cards can be played by turning the teamwork card face up in the third column <b>28</b>C. The teamwork card may be played by paying its cost <b>240</b>A-C. A teamwork card can remain in play until the conclusion of the game <b>10</b> unless it is eliminated by the effects of other cards <b>212</b>, <b>14</b>. The teamwork card only affects other cards flipped in the row <b>26</b>A-C in which the teamwork card is located. In one embodiment, only one teamwork card can remain in play in each row <b>26</b>A-C. When one player scores a point, that player may add an energy card into each of the zones <b>24</b>A-C in which that player is currently playing a teamwork card.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Advantage cards can be used to enhance a player's strike card, or to alter any other aspect of the game, including adding or eliminating energy, teamwork, or even allow searching through the player's deck <b>30</b>. The advantage card can be played by paying the cost <b>240</b>A-C indicated on the card. When played, advantage cards are placed into the advantage area <b>22</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In one embodiment, advantage cards can affect all the cards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> that are played. Further, in one embodiment, there is no limit to the number of advantage cards that a player can play in a row <b>26</b>A-C without moving to the next row.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the intercept value <b>242</b> represents the ability of the first card <b>212</b> to stop a strike by an opponent player. In order to play one of the strike cards, the strike card must have an intercept value <b>242</b> that is greater than or equal to the force value <b>244</b> of the incoming attack.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The force value <b>244</b> is the attack value of the strike card. Once a player counterattacks with a strike card, the opponent player cannot play a strike card unless the intercept value <b>242</b> is equal or greater to the force value <b>244</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first card <b>212</b> can also include a graphics region <b>246</b> to provide aesthetics to the first card <b>212</b>. The graphics region <b>246</b> can include animations of a character represented by the first card <b>212</b>, or any other suitable graphics.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The rules text <b>248</b> can provide rules regarding the specific requirements of using the card <b>212</b> or the particular effects of using the card <b>212</b>. For example, any additional information or explanatory data can be included in the rules text <b>248</b>, which may or may not have an impact on any portion of the game <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The version <b>250</b> of the card <b>212</b> can change the attributes of the card <b>212</b> even though the name of the card <b>212</b> may be the same as another card. Different versions <b>250</b> of cards <b>212</b> by the same name can have different requirements for use and/or different effects on the game <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a perspective view of the second card <b>314</b> shown in a first position. In contrast to the first card <b>212</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the second card <b>314</b> is movable relative to itself. For example, the second card <b>314</b> can include a first section <b>352</b> and a second section <b>354</b> that selectively move relative to one another. It is recognized that either section <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> can be the first section <b>352</b> or the second section <b>354</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, in one embodiment, the first section <b>352</b> is colored or opaque so that the majority of the second section <b>354</b> cannot be seen when the second card <b>314</b> is in the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a perspective view of the second card <b>314</b> illustrated in a second position. In the second position, a greater portion of the second section <b>354</b> is exposed. In other words, when the second card <b>314</b> is in the second position, the players can view a greater portion or all of the second section <b>354</b> of the card <b>314</b>. In this embodiment, the second section <b>354</b> is slidingly movable relative to the first section <b>352</b>. The second section <b>354</b> can also include a thickened grip region <b>356</b> that the player can use to grip the second section <b>354</b> to expose at least a portion of the second section <b>354</b> during the game <b>10</b>. In alternative embodiments, the second section <b>354</b> of the second card <b>314</b> can be revealed to the players by other means such as unfolding, use of transparent colorless or colored windows, scratch off coverings, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The second card <b>314</b> is selectively moved from the first position to the second position by the player that controls the second card <b>314</b> at a strategic time during the game <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, each player knows only what is included on the second section <b>354</b> of that player's second card <b>314</b>. With this knowledge, one player can, under certain circumstances, reveal the second section <b>354</b> to the opponent player, and can utilize one or more of the indicia included on the second section <b>354</b> as appropriate.</p>

In this embodiment, the first section <b>352</b> includes a first layer <b>358</b> and a spaced apart second layer <b>360</b>. Between the layers <b>358</b>, <b>360</b> is a gap <b>362</b> that houses the second section <b>354</b> when the second card <b>314</b> is in the first position. The first layer <b>358</b> includes a first surface <b>364</b> that is exposed to the players. The second layer <b>360</b> includes a second surface <b>366</b> that is substantially opposite the first surface <b>364</b> so that the second surface <b>366</b> can also be exposed to the players. Further, in this embodiment, the second section <b>354</b> includes a third surface <b>368</b> and a substantially opposite-facing fourth surface <b>370</b>. In this embodiment, all of the surfaces <b>364</b>, <b>366</b>, <b>368</b>, <b>370</b> are substantially parallel to one another. Alternatively, not all surfaces <b>364</b>, <b>366</b>, <b>368</b>, <b>370</b> are substantially parallel to one another.</p>

In this embodiment, the first section <b>452</b> can include a first surface <b>464</b> having one or more indicia previously described relative to the first card <b>212</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). For example, the first section <b>452</b> can include a card name <b>436</b>, one or more trait requirements <b>438</b>, and/or graphics or other aesthetic images <b>446</b>, as non-exclusive examples.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second section <b>454</b> of the second card <b>414</b> can also include some or all of the indicia previously described with respect to the first card <b>212</b>.

In this embodiment, the first section <b>552</b> includes an opening <b>571</b> through which a portion of the second section <b>554</b> slides. Further, the second section <b>554</b> includes one or more flanges <b>572</b> positioned at or near a bottom edge <b>574</b> of the second section <b>554</b>. The flanges <b>572</b> make the second section <b>554</b> wider at or near the bottom edge <b>574</b> to inhibit the second section <b>554</b> from being completely removed from the first section <b>552</b>. Stated another way, a width <b>576</b> of the second section <b>554</b> at or near the bottom edge <b>574</b> is greater than a width <b>578</b> of the opening <b>571</b> formed in the first section <b>552</b> in which the second section <b>554</b> slides. With this design, a particular second section <b>554</b> can be permanently associated with a respective first section <b>552</b>, and the potential for a player losing either the first section <b>552</b> or the second section <b>554</b> is decreased.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Playing the Game</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment of the game <b>10</b> will now be described in greater detail. A player's deck <b>30</b> can be constructed by the player around that player's favorite second card <b>14</b>, for example. Rules can be applied to deck construction such as: (1) the deck may have no fewer than 30, or alternatively, 60 cards, (2) the deck may have no more than four copies of any specific card, or (3) the deck can include a plurality of first cards, and only one second card, as non-exclusive examples. In an alternative embodiment, for instance, the deck <b>30</b> can include a plurality of second cards <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Some cards may have the same card name <b>222</b>, but actually have different version names <b>238</b> and/or different game text <b>236</b>, for example. In this case, four of each version could be played, since these may actually be different cards having different effects.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each player can place two first cards <b>12</b> face down from their deck <b>30</b> without looking at them into the first zone <b>24</b>A. Each player can then place two cards from the deck <b>30</b> facedown in both the second zone <b>24</b>B and third zone <b>24</b>C. Each player places the top four first cards <b>12</b> from their deck <b>30</b> face-up into their discard pile <b>32</b>. Each player adds up the total force value <b>244</b> of the four first cards <b>12</b> in their discard pile <b>32</b>. The player with the highest total force value <b>244</b> will decide who defends first. If the players tie, each flips an additional card from their deck <b>30</b> into their discard pile <b>32</b> until the tie is broken.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Players defend first in the first row <b>26</b>A, then, if necessary, the second row <b>26</b>B, and finally, the third row <b>26</b>C. Cards are flipped face-up into the second column <b>28</b>B in the row being defended. Once a card is flipped, it can be played by paying its energy cost <b>240</b>A-C. If the card is not played, the card may be &#x201c;focused&#x201d; and be added face down to the energy stack in that row. If this occurs, the player is now defending in the next row down. Because of card effects, sometimes the player will not be able to either play or focus a card. When this happens, the player must instead discard the card into the discard pile <b>32</b>. The player may voluntarily discard a card instead of playing or focusing it. The player then defends in the next row down.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Whenever a strike is played, it is referred to as a counterattack. When counterattacks occur with a strike card, the strike card is turned sideways in the second column <b>28</b>B. This indicates that the player's turn is over. The opponent player must now defend against the force of that strike.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The first action the defending player takes on his or her turn is to cleanup his or her region <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. The defending player removes all of the cards he or she played when last defending and puts them into the discard pile <b>32</b>. Normally this includes the last strike that he or she played and/or any advantages in his or her advantage area <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, the energy cards as well as any teamwork cards that are in play are never cleaned up, and remain in play even after someone scores a point.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After cleanup, the defending player now has a chance to replenish his or her energy. Replenishing is one of the main ways in which each player gains energy. The deeper the row from which one player was forced to counterattack, the more energy the other player will gain. In one embodiment, the row from which the opposing player counterattacked is determined, and one energy card is added to the zone for that row and each row above that row.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Before the defending player starts defending in the appropriate row, the defending player has a chance to play his or her second card <b>14</b>. As indicated above, the player may only play that player's second card <b>14</b> if all of that player's rows <b>26</b>A-C are charged. Playing the advantage card is one method of charging zones. In one embodiment, whenever an advantage card is played, the row in which the advantage card was played can be charged. Charging all three rows <b>26</b>A-C is the only way to use the second section <b>354</b> of the second card <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Once charged, a row can stay charged until the second section <b>354</b> of the second card <b>14</b> is exposed to the opponent and is used to affect the outcome of at least a portion of the game <b>10</b>. Once all these conditions are met, the second section of the second card can be revealed and played against the opponent player. To do so, the player can uncharge all of that player's charged zones. The second section is then revealed to the opponent player, and the energy cost is paid, if required.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">If the player cannot or decides not to play the second card <b>14</b>, the player begins defending as normal in the first row <b>26</b>A. The defending player continues defending in each of the three rows <b>26</b>A-C until that player either counterattacks or is unable to counterattack, in which case the opponent player scores a point. Once one player scores three points, that player is declared the winner. If no one has won after a point is scored, the process is repeated until a winner is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The second card <b>14</b> cleans up differently than the first card <b>12</b>. Regardless of whether the opponent player has succeeded in counterattacking, or whether a point is scored, the second section <b>354</b> is again concealed by moving the second section <b>354</b> to the first position, and the second card <b>14</b> is flipped over so that the second surface <b>366</b> is face up.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The next time the player charges up that player's rows, the player will now be able to reveal and play the fourth surface <b>370</b> of the second section <b>354</b> to reveal the indicia on the fourth surface <b>370</b>. If the fourth surface <b>370</b> of the second section <b>354</b> has just been revealed and played, the player can flip the second card <b>14</b> back over to show the first surface <b>364</b> of the first section <b>352</b>, and start all over again.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">While the particular trading card game <b>10</b> as herein shown and disclosed in detail is fully capable of obtaining the objects and providing the advantages herein before stated, it is to be understood that it is merely illustrative of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention and that no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design herein shown other than as described in the appended claims.</p>
