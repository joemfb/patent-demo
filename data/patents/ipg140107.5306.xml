<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a work vehicle such as a tractor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">[1] In a work vehicle, a setting screen selected by a setting information processing unit provided to an information displaying device thereof from among a plurality of set screens corresponding to a plurality of information items is displayed on a display, and the set information corresponding to the selected setting screen is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 2009-143456 (JP 2009-143456 A) discloses a configuration comprising a display (a display unit in JP 2009-143456 A) for displaying various different information items of a vehicle body, a switch operational tool for switching the screen displayed on the display, and a setting operational tool for performing various different settings.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In JP 2009-143456 A, a plurality of basic screens can be switched by a switch operational tool and the display of the basic screen makes it possible to understand needed information from the screen. When, in a situation where a basic screen is being displayed, a setting button is operated, the selected screen corresponding to the basic screen is thereby displayed, and the display is made to display an operation guide for guiding the selection of a setting item being displayed on the selection screen. In a situation where both the selection screen and the operation guide are being displayed in this manner, it is possible to select a setting item and perform a setting by following the operation guide, and operating a change operational tool after such a setting makes it possible to complete the setting processing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 2010-013060 (JP 2010-013060 A) discloses a configuration (an information display system for a vehicle) in which a meter includes a display and with an operation input unit which can be operated by being pressed. In such a configuration, the display content is switched sequentially in a fixed sequence each time the operation input unit is pressed briefly (for example, for less than five seconds), and, when the operation input unit is pressed for a long time (for example, for at least five seconds), a sub-menu for selecting a desired change input screen from a plurality of change input screens is displayed. Within the sub-menu, when the operation input unit is pressed briefly, a cursor for indicating a change input menu is thereby sequentially moved, it being then possible to select a change input menu; when the operation input unit is pressed for a long time, an underlying sub-menu is thereby displayed and the setting content can be changed. The inputted content is confirmed and the sub-menu screen is restored when a operation-free state continues beyond an input confirmation interval (for example, for five seconds) after a change setting is inputted by the operation of the operation input unit in the change input screen.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In JP 2010-013060 A, when a single operation input unit constituted of the press-operated type is press-operated for only a short period of time, the display content of a display is thereby sequentially switched, and when the operation input unit is press-operated for a long period of time, the setting content is thereby changed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As disclosed in JP 2009-143456 A and JP 2010-013060 A, the operation of switching the display content of the display by an operation performed by a worker makes it possible to understand the work situation from the display of the display, and to check a setting value, the operating situation of various machines, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The ability to change a setting by an operation involving a specific switch, as disclosed in JP 2009-143456 A, also sometimes leads to a false setting when the switch is operated mistakenly, for example, when the worker is unaware that the setting is being changed. In particular, setting the unit when fuel consumption is displayed, setting an operating mode when various machines are operated, clearing the value(s) of a trip meter, and other such operations are not very frequently performed, and setting by a service technician is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In view whereof, changing the mode of operation, as disclosed in JP 2010-013060 A, presumably renders it more difficult for a setting to be changed; however, as in JP 2010-013060 A, the screen is switched when the operation input unit is press-operated briefly, and a move is made to a screen making it possible to change a setting when the operation input unit is press-operated for a long time; even though the inputted content is confirmed by the elapsing of a period of time thereafter, it is impossible to avoid a false setting, and there remains room for improvement.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One object of the present invention is to provide a reasonable configuration for an information displaying device for suppressing the defect where set information corresponding to a setting screen displayed on a display is mistakenly changed while permitting an operation for switching to and displaying on a display a single one of a plurality of set screens.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">[2] In a work vehicle, there is sometimes provided an authentication processing unit for allowing an engine to be started only when memory authentication information, which is pre-stored, and inputted authentication information, which is inputted, are identical to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For example, in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 2008-162337 (JP 2008-162337 A), a configuration is such that a plurality of operation switches arranged on an operation panel can be used for password input switching; after an engine is started, when the plurality of operation switches is operated in a set sequence, the inputted sequence is understood to be a password, and continuous driving of the engine becomes possible when the password is identical to a previously set password.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In JP 2008-162337 A, the plurality of operation switches is to be used during work, and there is provided a controller (corresponding to an authentication processing unit) for acquiring information on the operation switches. A password (corresponding to authentication information) is set in a memory of the controller, and, when the inputted password (the sequence of operation of the plurality of operation switches) is identical to a previously set password, then, as described above, continuous driving of the engine is rendered possible, while when the passwords are not identical, then the controller performs a control for stopping the engine to prevent theft.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 2005-255134 (JP 2005-255134 A), the number of iterations where an engine key switch for starting an engine is operated to a start position is inputted as a cipher number, it being rendered possible to send power to a starter motor and start the engine only when the inputted cipher number is identical to a pre-set number of iterations.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">JP 2005-255134 A discloses a configuration in which a signal system into which a signal from the engine key switch is inputted is provided to a theft prevention device (corresponding to the authentication processing unit) having a central processing unit (CPU), the cipher number (corresponding to the authentication information) being stored in an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) of the theft prevention device. Thereby, it becomes possible to start the engine when the number of iterations where the engine key switch is operated to the start position is identical to the authentication number, and it becomes impossible to start the engine when the numbers are not identical, thus preventing theft.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 2008-162337 (JP 2008-162337 A) discloses a configuration in which, when a pre-existing plurality of operation switches is operated, an authentication is thereby executed; when the number of operation switches used in the authentication is increased in order to enhance the precision of the authentication, more effort and time are needed, because the hands are moved more when the plurality of operation switches is operated. In contrast thereto, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 2005-255134 (JP 2005-255134 A) discloses a configuration in which the precision of the authentication is enhanced even while only a single engine key switch is to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, performing the authentication based on the number of iterations where a single switch is operated, as in the configuration of JP 2005-255134 A, also has limitations on enhancing the precision of the authentication, and there remains room for improvement.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One object of the present invention is to provide a reasonable configuration for a work vehicle for enhancing the precision of an authentication when an engine is to be started, while using a smaller number of switches.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In particular, the above object noted in previous section [1] is fulfilled by one aspect of a work vehicle according to the invention, as under:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A work vehicle comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">a display; and</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">an information displaying device, the information displaying device including: a setting information processing unit for displaying, on the display, a setting screen selected from among a plurality of set screens corresponding to a plurality of information items, and for changing the set information corresponding to the selected setting screen; and operation information discriminating means for determining a first operation information item and a second operation information item inputted by a manual operation;</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">wherein the setting information processing unit includes:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">

        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0027">setting information changing means for allowing changing of the set information when the setting screen is displayed on the display;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">wherein when the operation information discriminating means determines that the first operation information item is inputted, the setting screen displaying means performs display processing in a transition display mode for sequentially switching to, and displaying one of the plurality of set screens on the display each time an input is determined; and</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">wherein when the operation information discriminating means determines that the second operation information item is inputted during display in the transition display mode, the setting information changing means performs a process for moving to an information change mode for allowing changing of the set information corresponding to the setting screen being displayed on the display; and when the operation information discriminating means determines that the second operation information item is inputted during the information change mode, the setting information changing means performs a process for restoring the transition display mode from the information change mode.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">According to such a configuration, the display processing in the transition display mode for switching to, and displaying on the display, the one among the plurality of set screens each time the setting screen displaying means determines an input is performed when the operation information discriminating means determines that the first operation information has been inputted, and the setting information changing means moves on to the information change mode for allowing changing of the set information corresponding to the setting screen already having been displayed on the display when the operation information discriminating means determines that the second operation information item has been inputted. After the set information has been changed in the information change mode, the transition display mode is restored when the operation information discriminating means determines that the second operation information item has been inputted.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">In other words, the setting screen is switched by the input by the first operation information item, and the input of the second operation information item renders it possible to change the set information corresponding to the setting screen. This makes it possible to eliminate the defect in which the set information is changed by a mistaken operation, because when the set information is to be changed by the setting screen, a worker consciously inputs the second operation information item, a move being thereby made to the information change mode, and after having changed the set information in the information change mode, the worker then consciously inputs the second operation information item.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">Consequently, there is configured an information displaying device for suppressing the defect where set information corresponding to a setting screen displayed on a display is mistakenly changed, while permitting an operation for switching, and displaying on a display, a single one of a plurality of set screens.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">According to a preferred aspect, when the operation information discriminating means determines that the first operation information item is inputted during the information change mode, the setting information changing means changes the set information corresponding to the setting screen each time an input is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">With the above configuration, because the set information is changed by the inputting of the first operation information item after a move has been made to the information change mode, the set information is changed by an operation that is simpler than, for example, an operation configuration for inputting numerical information or character information from a keyboard.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">According to a preferred aspect, the work vehicle further comprises: storage means, wherein when the operation information discriminating means determines that the second operation information item is inputted during the information change mode, the set information changed during the information change mode is stored into the storage means.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">With the above configuration, after the second operation information item has been inputted, the transition display mode is restored after the set information having been changed is stored in the storage means, thus obviating the need for specially performing an operation for storing the set information in the storage means.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">According to a preferred aspect, the work vehicle further comprises a push switch, wherein the operation information discriminating means determines if the first operation information item is inputted or not when a period of time of operation by the push switch is less than a set of period of time, and determines if the second operation information item is inputted or not when the period of time of operation by the push switch is the set of period of time or longer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">With the above configuration, adjusting the length of press-operation time of the push switch makes it possible to input the first operation information item and the second operation information item, thus rendering it possible to input two different kinds of operation information without needing to provide two switches.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">According to a preferred aspect, the work vehicle further comprises a first switch and a second switch, wherein the operation information discriminating means determines if the first operation information item is inputted or not when the first switch has been operated, and determines if the second operation information item is inputted or not when the second switch has been operated.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">With the above configuration, it is possible to use the two switches to separately input the first operation information item and the second operation information item, thus rendering it possible to input two different kinds of operation information with a simple operation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">According to a preferred aspect, the work vehicle further comprises a first switch, a second switch and a single operational tool for operating the first switch and the second switch, wherein the operation information discriminating means determines if the first operation information item is inputted or not when the first switch is operated by the operational tool, and determines if the second operation information item is inputted or not when the second switch is operated by the operational tool.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">With the above configuration, it becomes possible to select and operate the first switch and the second switch without bringing the hand from the single operational tool, and a worker can readily perform an operation without needing to substantially move the hand while operating, in comparison to when the first switch and the second switch are arranged at separated positions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">In particular, the above object noted in previous section [2] is fulfilled by one aspect of a work vehicle according to the invention, as under:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">A work vehicle, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">an engine;</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">an authentication processing unit for permitting the engine to be started only when stored authentication information and authentication information inputted by a manual operation are identical to each other;</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">storage means for pre-storing the stored authentication information; and</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">a first switch and a second switch for performing the manual operation,</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">wherein the stored authentication information is the number of operation iterations of the first switch and the number of operation iterations of the second switch, at least one of the number of operation iterations of the first switch and the number of operation iterations of the second switch being set to at least two, and the authentication processing unit being configured to acquire, as the inputted authentication information, the number of operation iterations of the first switch and the number of operation iterations of the second switch;</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">authentication information identifying means for comparing the inputted authentication information acquired by the authentication processing unit with the stored authentication information; and</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">power controlling means for allowing power to be supplied to a starter motor of the engine when the inputted authentication information is identical to the stored authentication information at the authentication information identifying means.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">According to such a configuration, the number of combinations of operations of the two switches is increased, because the stored authentication information is constituted of the combination of the number of operation iterations of the first switch and the number of operation iterations of the second switch, and at least one of the number of operation iterations of the first switch and the number of operation iterations of the second switch is at least twice. For this reason, it becomes difficult for a person attempting to start up the engine in order to steal the work vehicle to perform an operation identical to the stored authentication information, even by operating the two switches at random. Further, when the first switch and the second switch are operated only the appropriate number of iterations, the authentication information identifying means acquires the number of operation iterations of the first switch and the number of operation iterations of the second switch as the inputted authentication information and confirms the conformity thereof with the stored authentication information having been stored in the storage means, and the power controlling means allows power to be supplied to the starter motor of the engine, it being thereby rendered possible to start up the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">With the above configuration, provided is a work vehicle in which the precision of the authentication when the engine is to be started up is enhanced even while a small number of switches is being used, and in which an inappropriate start of the engine can be suppressed and theft can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">According to a preferred aspect, the work vehicle further comprises: operation iteration number displaying means for displaying, on a display, the number of operation iterations of the first switch and the number of operation iterations of the second switch.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">With the above configuration, the number of operation iterations can be accurately understood from the display, whereby a false operation can be eliminated even in a situation where, as the stored authentication information, the number of operation iterations of the first switch and the number of operation iterations of the second switch are set so as to be numerous.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">According to a preferred aspect, the first switch and the second switch are configured to be operable by a single operational tool.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">With the above configuration, when the first switch and the second switch are to be operated, there is no need to remove a finger from the single operational tool, allowing for more rapid input of the authentication information than in a configuration for operating by bringing a finger into contact with two switches separately.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">According to a preferred aspect, the work vehicle further comprises: authentication restricting means for not allowing the authentication processing unit to provide authentication when the authentication information identifying means determines, for a set number of times of consecutive iterations, that the inputted authentication information is not identical to the stored authentication information, until a set period of time elapses thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">With the above configuration, when it is decided at the authentication information identifying means for a set number of times of consecutive iterations that the inputted authentication information and the stored authentication information are not identical, the authentication restricting means does not allow the authentication information identifying means to provide authentication; even when, for example, a person attempting to steal the work vehicle has inputted authentication information (the inputted authentication information) at random, since the number of input iterations of the authentication information (inputted authentication information) is restricted, it is rendered difficult to input authentication information (inputted authentication information) identical to the stored authentication information, thus enhancing the precision of the authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">Other features as well as advantageous effects arising from such features will be apparent upon reading the detailed description as under, with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">There follows a description of embodiments of the work vehicle, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which a tractor serves as an example of the work vehicle.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">[First Embodiment]</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Overall Configuration)</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the tractor is configured to comprise a pair of right/left front vehicle wheels <b>1</b> and a pair of right/left rear vehicle wheels <b>2</b>, each acting as a travel device for a travel vehicle body A; a diesel engine <b>4</b> housed within an engine hood <b>3</b> of a front part of the travel vehicle body A; an operation seat <b>6</b> arranged at a middle position between right and left rear wheel fenders <b>5</b> for constituting an operation unit; and a cabin B for surrounding the operation unit.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">In the tractor, a clutch housing <b>7</b>, a hydrostatic stepless speed change device (HST) <b>8</b> and a transmission case <b>9</b> are connected one after another in the stated sequence toward a rear side of the engine <b>4</b>. The transmission case <b>9</b> is arranged under the operation seat <b>6</b>. These components form a transmission system for transmitting drive force from the transmission case <b>9</b> to the right/left front vehicle wheels <b>1</b> and the right/left rear vehicle wheels <b>2</b>, to thereby form a four-wheel-driven type tractor.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">A rear PTO shaft <b>11</b> is provided at a rear end of the transmission case <b>9</b>. A mid PTO shaft <b>12</b> is provided on a bottom of the transmission case <b>9</b>. A hydraulic lift cylinder <b>13</b> is provided at an upper position of the transmission case <b>9</b>. A pair of right/left lift arms <b>14</b> are provided at a rear end of the transmission case <b>9</b> to be vertically pivotal by the lift cylinder <b>13</b>. Though not depicted in the drawings, the tractor is configured such that a rotary tiller device, a plow or other ground working implement may be connected to the rear end of the travel vehicle body A via a three-point link mechanism, whereby the ground working implement can be vertically moved by the lift cylinder <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">When a rotary tiller device is connected, tilling work is performed by driving rotary claws of the rotary tiller device which claws are driven under the drive force from the rear PTO shaft <b>11</b>. When a lawn-mowing device or other mid-mount ground working implement is connected to a middle position between the front vehicle wheels <b>1</b> and the rear vehicle wheels <b>2</b>, the ground work by the ground working implement is performed under the drive force from the mid PTO shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Operation Unit)</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">The cabin B has a typical structure including: a roof on an upper part thereof; a front glass on a front part thereof; doors formed of transparent glass or transparent resin on the right/left sides thereof to be openable and closable; and a rear glass on a rear part thereof. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a steering wheel <b>21</b> is arranged at a front position of the operation seat <b>6</b> within the cabin B for performing a steering operation. A clutch pedal <b>22</b> is arranged on the left side of a lower position of the steering wheel <b>21</b>. Two brake pedals <b>23</b> are arranged on the right side, as well as a speed change pedal <b>24</b>. A forward/reverse switching lever <b>25</b> and a forcible lift lever <b>26</b> are provided in the vicinity of the steering wheel <b>21</b>, the forward/reverse switching lever <b>25</b> performing selection between the forward travel and the reverse travel of the travel vehicle body A, and the forcible lift lever <b>26</b> performing selection of states of the ground working implement, which is connected to the rear end of the travel vehicle body A, between a lowered working level and a raised set level.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">A main speed change lever <b>27</b>, an auxiliary speed change lever <b>28</b>, and a cruise switch CS are arranged on a left side of the operation seat <b>6</b>. A position control lever <b>30</b> for setting a swing angle each of the lift arms <b>14</b> relative to the vehicle body; a PTO switch <b>31</b> for selecting the drive between the rear PTO shaft <b>11</b> and the mid PTO shaft <b>12</b>; and a plurality of operation switches <b>32</b> are arranged on a right side of the operation seat <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the cruise switch CS is configured such that a single operational tool <b>45</b> can be used for a manual operation each of the first switch <b>46</b> and the second switch <b>47</b>. The operational tool <b>45</b> is supported to be pivotable around an axis X. The operational tool <b>45</b> is supported to be swingable in a seesaw manner so as to maintain a neutral posture in non-operational state, to swing to one side when one end part (toward the first switch <b>46</b>) is operated and to swing to the other side when another end part (toward the second switch <b>47</b>) is operated. A first operation body <b>46</b>A, which is urged so as to protrude, is provided to the first switch <b>46</b>, and a second operation body <b>47</b>A, which is urged so as to protrude, is provided to the second switch <b>47</b>; the first operation body <b>46</b>A and the second operation body <b>47</b>A come into contact with a rear surface side of the operational tool <b>45</b>, and the operational tool <b>45</b> is thereby maintained at the neutral posture. A spring for urging the operational tool <b>45</b> to a neutral position may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">The cruise switch CS is configured such that a light (shallow) operation of each of the end parts brings a first-stage switch part of either the first switch <b>46</b> or the second switch <b>47</b> into an ON state, and a strong (deep) operation brings a second-stage switch part into an ON state. Such a configuration makes it possible to operate the first-stage switch part and second-stage switch part of the first switch <b>46</b> to be on by adjusting the force of the press-operation on one end part of the operational tool <b>45</b>, and possible to operate the first-stage switch part and second-stage switch part of the second switch <b>47</b> to be on by adjusting the force of the press-operation on the other end part of the operational tool <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">Although the control configuration is not depicted in the drawings, the stepless speed change device <b>8</b> includes a speed change actuator for rotating a speed change operation shaft of the stepless speed change device <b>8</b>, and a speed change amount sensor for measuring the amount of the rotation operation of the speed change operation shaft. A cruise control unit <b>59</b> (e.g. a speed change ECU) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is configured such that a signal from the speed change amount sensor is fed back and an actuator is controlled. The cruise control unit <b>59</b> has an output system for controlling the aforesaid speed change actuator, the signal of the speed change amount sensor is fed back, and a signal from the first switch <b>46</b>, a signal from the second switch <b>47</b> and a control signal from an information displaying device <b>50</b> are inputted.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">When the travel vehicle body A is made to travel, a control mode is set such that a strong (deep) operation of the end part of the operational tool <b>45</b> of the cruise switch CS, the end side being marked &#x201c;UP,&#x201d; moves to a cruise control, and such that a strong (deep) operation of an end side of the operational tool <b>45</b> marked &#x201c;DOWN&#x201d; stops the cruise control. When the move to cruise control is first made, travel is performed at a pre-set cruise speed (a speed corresponding to a set cruise value stored in storage means <b>51</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and a control mode of a cruise control device is set such that, during the cruise control, a light (shallow) operation of the end side of the operational tool <b>45</b> marked &#x201c;UP&#x201d; boosts the cruise speed only by a set value at each operation, and a light (shallow) operation of the end side of the operational tool <b>45</b> marked &#x201c;DOWN&#x201d; lowers the cruise speed only by a set value at each operation.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a meter panel MP is arranged at a front position of the steering wheel <b>21</b>; on the meter panel MP, an engine rotation rate meter <b>33</b> is arranged on the left side, a cooling water temperature meter <b>34</b> and a remaining fuel amount meter <b>35</b> are arranged on the right side, a liquid crystal display <b>36</b> for displaying information is arranged in the middle, and an information announcing unit <b>37</b> for announcing the situations of various different machines by lighting a lamp is formed below the display <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">A hazard switch <b>38</b>, a lamp switch <b>39</b> for lighting headlights and the like, and a push-switch style display switching switch <b>40</b> are arranged to the left side below the meter panel MP; and a key switch <b>41</b> is arranged to the right side below the meter panel MP. The key switch <b>41</b> has a typical configuration of being rotated to reach an ON position and supply power to an electrical system, and reach a start position with further rotation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the display <b>36</b> has a basic information display region <b>36</b>A formed at an upper part, and a set information display region <b>36</b>B formed at a lower part. Speed change information indicative of the setting position of the main speed change lever <b>27</b> and the travel speed of the travel vehicle body A are displayed in the basic information display region <b>36</b>A, and set information is displayed in the set information display region <b>36</b>B. The set information includes a unit of information displayed on the display <b>36</b> or alternatively, a parameter of the speed change control or the like. When the aforesaid display switching switch <b>40</b> is briefly pressed (for example, pressed only for a period of time less than five seconds), the display (the display of a plurality of screens shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is performed in a transition display mode such that set screens corresponding to a plurality of set information items are displayed in sequence on the set information display region <b>36</b>B of the display <b>36</b> at each brief press. When the display switching switch <b>40</b> is pressed for a long time (for example, a period of time of at least five seconds) in the transition display mode, then a move is made to an information change mode, allowing changing of the set information. A description of the control mode for changing the set information will be made later.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(Information Displaying Device)</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the main points of a configuration of the information displaying device <b>50</b> for displaying information on the display <b>36</b>. The information displaying device <b>50</b> has a control system having a microprocessor or the like. The control system includes storage means <b>51</b> comprising electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) or other non-volatile memory. The control system further includes a timer <b>52</b> also functioning as a calendar; operation information discriminating means <b>53</b>; setting screen displaying means <b>54</b>; setting information changing means <b>55</b>; and setting screen generating means <b>56</b>. A setting information processing unit P is constituted by the setting screen display means <b>54</b> and the setting information changing means <b>55</b>. The information displaying device <b>50</b> acquires information of the display switching switch <b>40</b>, outputs display information to the display <b>36</b>, acquires information via an information acquisition system S, and outputs a control signal to a diesel particulate filter (DPF) control unit <b>57</b>, a speed change control unit <b>58</b> and the cruise control unit <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0096">Incidentally, the operation information discriminating means <b>53</b>, the setting screen displaying means <b>54</b>, the setting information changing means <b>55</b> and the setting screen generating means <b>56</b> as described above are assumed to be constituted of software. However, these may be constituted of hardware alone or may be constituted of a combination of hardware and software.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097">The storage means <b>51</b> stores a plurality of information items, including: trip value information; fuel consumption unit information; information on the oil change data when the engine oil was changed; PTO display subject information for setting which to be displayed between the rear PTO shaft <b>11</b> and the mid PTO shaft <b>12</b>; speed change response information for determining the amount of control of the stepless speed change device <b>8</b> relative to the amount of depression on the speed change pedal <b>24</b>; DPF setting information about a particulate matter (PM) removal device diesel particulate filter (DPF, not shown) for removing particulate matter contained in the exhaust gas of the engine <b>4</b>; speed change mode information for setting the speed change state of the stepless speed change device <b>8</b>; speed change pedal display information for determining whether or not to display the operated amount of the speed change pedal <b>24</b>; cruise setting information during the cruise control; and setting information.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">The operation information discriminating means <b>53</b> decides the press-operation time length when the display switching switch <b>40</b> is press-operated. Specifically, a decision is made as to whether a press is brief (e.g., less than five seconds; an example of a first operation information item) or a press is long (e.g., at least five seconds; an example of a second operation information item), and then sent to the setting information processing unit P. Description of the display processing in the setting screen displaying means <b>54</b> and in the setting information changing means <b>55</b> will be made later.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">The setting screen generating means <b>56</b> generates a setting screen (a screen image) to be displayed on the display <b>36</b> by the setting screen displaying means <b>54</b>.

<p id="p-0133" num="0134">Incidentally, when the display switching switch <b>40</b> is pressed for a long time while the DPF setting screen is being displayed, the control moves to the information change mode, but pressing the display switching switch <b>40</b> for a long time in this information change mode merely executes the cleaning, and the set information is not changed.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0135">As described above, in the present invention, not only changing in the operation time of the single display switching switch <b>40</b> allows selection between the transition display mode and the information change mode without the need to provide two switches, but also, when the set information is changed in the information change mode too, the set information can be stored in the storage means <b>51</b> and the transition display mode can be restored by the display switching switch <b>40</b>, thus changing the set information with a simple configuration in a simple operational state.</p>

Specifically, as with the cruise switch CS, a single operational tool <b>45</b> includes a first switch <b>46</b> and a second switch <b>47</b>. In such a configuration, when the operational tool <b>45</b> is in the neutral posture, the first switch <b>46</b> and the second switch <b>47</b> are maintained in the non-operational state (the OFF state), and operating one end part of the operational tool <b>45</b> turns the first switch <b>460</b>N and inputs the first operation information item, while operating the other end part turns the second switch <b>470</b>N and inputs the second operation information item.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0140">In this manner, the first switch <b>46</b> and the second switch <b>47</b> can be operated by the single operational tool <b>45</b>, the operation being easier than a configuration for operating two switches that are positioned apart, and two types of operation information items can be inputted.
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0141">(c) In operation of the setting information changing means <b>55</b>, any desired display aspect for the information on the display <b>36</b> in the information change mode can be set. For example, when determination is made that the second operation information item has been inputted, a screen for setting is displayed anew on the display <b>36</b> (the window is opened anew), it being then possible to change the set information in the screen for setting.

<p id="p-0138" num="0142">A second embodiment of a work vehicle will be described next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 18</figref>. In this embodiment as well, description will be made with reference to a tractor as an example of the work vehicle.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(Overall Configuration)</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0143">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the tractor is configured to comprise a pair of right/left front vehicle wheels <b>101</b> and a pair of right/left rear vehicle wheels <b>102</b>, each acting as a travel device for a travel vehicle body A; a diesel engine <b>104</b> housed within an engine hood <b>103</b> of a front part of the travel vehicle body A; an operation seat <b>106</b> arranged at a middle position between right and left rear wheel fenders <b>105</b> for constituting an operation unit; and a cabin B for surrounding the operation unit.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0144">In the tractor, a clutch housing <b>107</b>, a hydrostatic stepless speed change device (HST) <b>108</b> and a transmission case <b>109</b> are connected one after another in the stated sequence toward a rear side of the engine <b>104</b>. The transmission case <b>109</b> is arranged under the operation seat <b>106</b>. These components form a transmission system for transmitting drive force from the transmission case <b>109</b> to the right/left front vehicle wheels <b>101</b> and the right/left rear vehicle wheels <b>102</b>, to thereby form a four-wheel-driven type tractor.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0145">A rear PTO shaft <b>111</b> is provided at a rear end of the transmission case <b>109</b>. A mid PTO shaft <b>112</b> is provided on a bottom of the transmission case <b>109</b>. A hydraulic lift cylinder <b>113</b> is provided at an upper position of the transmission case <b>109</b>. A pair of right/left lift arms <b>114</b> are provided at a rear end of the transmission case <b>109</b> to be vertically pivotal by the lift cylinder <b>113</b>. Though not depicted in the drawings, the tractor is configured such that a rotary tiller device, a plow or other ground working implement may be connected to the rear end of the travel vehicle body A via a three-point link mechanism, whereby the ground working implement can be vertically moved by the lift cylinder <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0146">When a rotary tiller device is connected, tilling work is performed by driving rotary claws of the rotary tiller device which claws are driven under the drive force from the rear PTO shaft <b>111</b>. When a lawn-mowing device or other mid-mount ground working implement is connected to a middle position between the front vehicle wheels <b>101</b> and the rear vehicle wheels <b>102</b>, the ground work by the ground working implement is performed under the drive force from the mid PTO shaft <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(Operation Unit)</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0147">The cabin B has a typical structure including: a roof on an upper part thereof; a front glass on a front part thereof; doors formed of transparent glass or transparent resin on the right/left sides thereof to be openable and closable; and a rear glass on a rear part thereof. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a steering wheel <b>121</b> is arranged at a front position of the operation seat <b>106</b> within the cabin B for performing a steering operation. A clutch pedal <b>122</b> is arranged on the left side of a lower position of the steering wheel <b>121</b>. Two brake pedals <b>123</b> are arranged on the right side, as well as a speed change pedal <b>124</b>. A forward/reverse switching lever <b>125</b> and a forcible lift lever <b>126</b> are provided in the vicinity of the steering wheel <b>121</b>, the forward/reverse switching lever <b>125</b> performing selection between the forward travel and the reverse travel of the travel vehicle body A, and the forcible lift lever <b>126</b> performing selection of states of the ground working implement, which is connected to the rear end of the travel vehicle body A, between a lowered working level and a raised set level.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0148">A main speed change lever <b>127</b>, an auxiliary speed change lever <b>128</b>, and a cruise switch CS are arranged on a left side of the operation seat <b>106</b>. A position control lever <b>130</b> for setting a swing angle each of the lift arms <b>114</b> relative to the vehicle body; a PTO switch <b>131</b> for selecting the drive between the rear PTO shaft <b>111</b> and the mid PTO shaft <b>112</b>; and a plurality of operation switches <b>132</b> are arranged on a right side of the operation seat <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0149">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the cruise switch CS is configured such that a single operational tool <b>145</b> can be used for a manual operation each of the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b>. The operational tool <b>145</b> is supported to be pivotable around an axis X. The operational tool <b>145</b> is supported to be swingable in a seesaw manner so as to maintain a neutral posture in non-operational state, to swing to one side when one end part (toward the first switch <b>146</b>) is operated and to swing to the other side when another end part (toward the second switch <b>147</b>) is operated. A first operation body <b>146</b>A, which is urged so as to protrude, is provided to the first switch <b>146</b>, and a second operation body <b>147</b>A, which is urged so as to protrude, is provided to the second switch <b>147</b>; the first operation body <b>146</b>A and the second operation body <b>147</b>A come into contact with a rear surface side of the operational tool <b>145</b>, and the operational tool <b>145</b> is thereby maintained at the neutral posture. A spring for urging the operational tool <b>145</b> to a neutral position may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0150">The cruise switch CS is configured such that a light (shallow) operation of each of the end parts brings a first-stage switch part of either the first switch <b>146</b> or the second switch <b>147</b> into an ON state, and a strong (deep) operation brings a second-stage switch part into an ON state. Such a configuration makes it possible to operate the first-stage switch part and second-stage switch part of the first switch <b>146</b> to be on by adjusting the force of the press-operation on one end part of the operational tool <b>145</b>, and possible to operate the first-stage switch part and second-stage switch part of the second switch <b>147</b> to be on by adjusting the force of the press-operation on the other end part of the operational tool <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0151">Although the control configuration is not depicted in the drawings, the stepless speed change device <b>108</b> includes an actuator for rotating a speed change operation shaft of the stepless speed change device <b>108</b>, and a speed change amount sensor for measuring the amount of the rotation of the speed change operation shaft. A cruise control device (e.g. a speed change ECU) is configured such that the actuator is controlled with a signal from the speed change amount sensor being fed back thereto. A signal from the first switch <b>146</b> and a signal from the second switch <b>147</b> are inputted to the cruise control device.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0152">When the travel vehicle body A travels, a control mode is set such that a strong (deep) operation of one end part, marked &#x201c;UP&#x201d;, of the operational tool <b>145</b> of the cruise switch CS as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> transits to a cruise control, and such that a strong (deep) operation of the other end part, marked &#x201c;DOWN&#x201d;, of the operational tool <b>145</b> stops the cruise control. When the transition to the cruise control is first made, travel is performed at a pre-set cruise speed, and a control mode of a cruise control device is set such that, during the cruise control, a light (shallow) operation of the end side of the operational tool <b>145</b> marked &#x201c;UP&#x201d; boosts the cruise speed by a set value at each operation, and a light (shallow) operation of the end side of the operational tool <b>145</b> marked &#x201c;DOWN&#x201d; lowers the cruise speed by a set value at each operation.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0153">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a meter panel MP is arranged at a front position of the steering wheel <b>121</b>; on the meter panel MP, an engine rotation rate meter <b>133</b> is arranged on the left side, a cooling water temperature meter <b>134</b> and a remaining fuel amount meter <b>135</b> are arranged on the right side, a liquid crystal display <b>136</b> for displaying information is arranged in the middle, and an information announcing unit <b>137</b> for announcing the situations of various different machines by lighting a lamp is formed below the display <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0154">A hazard switch <b>138</b>, a lamp switch <b>139</b> for lighting headlights and the like, and a push-switch style display switching switch <b>140</b> are arranged to the left side below the meter panel MP; and a key switch <b>141</b> is arranged to the right side below the meter panel MP. The key switch <b>141</b> has a typical configuration of being rotated to reach an ON position and supply power to an electrical system, and reach a start position with further rotation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0155">The display <b>136</b> displays the travelling speed of the travel vehicle body A and the speed change stage of the main speed change lever <b>127</b>. The display <b>136</b> is configured such that an operation of the display switching switch <b>140</b> switches over the screen to display such as the fuel consumption, the rotation rates of the rear/mid PTO shaft <b>111</b> or <b>112</b>. In particular, this tractor has a theft prevention function authentication when the engine <b>104</b> is started up; and the cruise switch CS functions also as a device for inputting the authentication information.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">(Authentication Control Device)</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0156">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an authentication processing device <b>150</b> acts as an authentication processing unit for receiving a signal inputted from each of the key switch <b>141</b>, the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b>, and outputting a control signal to the display <b>136</b> and to a power control unit <b>148</b> acting as power controlling means. The authentication processing device <b>150</b> has a microprocessor or other processing system; and includes: an EEPROM or other non-volatile memory (an example of the storage means) <b>151</b>; counting means <b>153</b>; display controlling means <b>154</b>; authentication information identifying means <b>155</b>; authentication restricting means <b>156</b>; and operation iteration number displaying means <b>157</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0157">Incidentally, the display controlling means <b>154</b>, the authentication information identifying means <b>155</b>, the authentication restricting means <b>156</b> and the operation iteration number displaying means <b>157</b> are typically constituted of software, but these may be constituted of hardware alone or may be constituted of a combination of hardware and software.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0158">The power control unit <b>148</b> is constituted of a relay, a power control element and the like which are incorporated in an electrical system for supplying power from a power source to a starter motor <b>149</b>. The power control unit <b>148</b> is configured to be switched over between a power supplying state to the starter motor <b>149</b> when the key switch <b>141</b> is operated to a start position, and a power cutoff state of the starter motor <b>149</b>, according to a control signal sent from the authentication processing device <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0159">The flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows the main points of the control of the authentication processing device <b>150</b>. Specifically, the operator uses a key (not shown) to turn the key switch <b>141</b> to an ON position, whereby power is supplied to the authentication processing device <b>150</b> and the control is started.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0160">During the control after the initial setting, when a target switch (either the first switch <b>146</b> or the second switch <b>147</b>) is lightly (shallowly) operated, the counting means <b>153</b> counts up the number of operation iterations, and the operation iteration number displaying means <b>157</b> displays the count value on the display <b>136</b> (see steps #<b>101</b> to #<b>104</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0161">When the counting means <b>153</b> counts the number of operation iterations, the number of operation iterations each of the first stage switch parts of the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> is counted, and the number of operation iterations is acquired as inputted authentication information. In the following description, it is supposed, as the inputted authentication information, that the number of operation iterations (C<b>1</b>) is the number of iterations of the first switch <b>146</b> and the number of operation iterations (C<b>2</b>) is the number of iterations of the second switch <b>147</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0162">At the initial setting, the stored authentication information (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>) is programmed to be set and &#x201c;0&#x201d; is set (programmed) to an erroneous operation iteration number value (N), and these are stored in a memory <b>151</b>. The value of R<b>1</b> and the value of R<b>2</b> in the stored authentication information (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>) are positive integers, at least one of the value of R<b>1</b> or the value of R<b>2</b> being set to &#x201c;2&#x201d; or more; and the stored authentication information (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>) also includes the sequence of the operations of the switches. Accordingly, if the value of R<b>1</b> is &#x201c;2&#x201d; and the value of R<b>2</b> is &#x201c;3&#x201d;, for example, then, even when the value of the number of operation iterations (C<b>1</b>) is &#x201c;2&#x201d; and the value of the number of operation iterations (C<b>2</b>) is &#x201c;3&#x201d;, no authentication is made if the second switch <b>147</b> is operated first and the first switch <b>146</b> is operated later (that is, if the inputted sequence is in reverse).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0163">In step #<b>104</b>, the counting means <b>153</b> counts the number of operation iterations (C<b>1</b>) of the first switch <b>146</b> and the number of operation iterations (C<b>2</b>) of the second switch <b>147</b>, and stores these numbers into a buffer or the like. When the numbers of operation iterations (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>) are counted, the sequence of the operations of the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> is also stored. In case of this control mode, no authentication is made if the input sequence of the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> is in reverse. Instead thereof, authentication may be made even if the input sequence is in reverse.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0164">The count values (the number of operation iterations C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>) of the counting means <b>153</b> are sent to the display controlling means <b>154</b>, and when the number of operation iterations (C<b>1</b>) of the first switch <b>146</b> is counted by the counting means <b>153</b>, the display controlling means <b>154</b> displays the count screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> on the display <b>136</b>. The count screen corresponding to the first switch <b>146</b> has an upper stage thereof defining a message region <b>136</b>M for displaying a message to prompt an operator's input; and a lower stage thereof defining a bar display region <b>136</b>P in which a plurality of display points are lined up in the lateral direction in the form of a progress bar to be displayed in solid white when no input has yet been made, and also defining a numeric value display region <b>136</b>Q for displaying the number of operation iterations (count value C<b>1</b>) in a numeric figure.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0165">When the first switch <b>146</b> is operated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(</figref><i>a</i>), each time an operation is made, the display point of the number corresponding to the number of operation iterations (count value C<b>1</b>) is changed to be displayed in solid black in the direction of an arrow indicated by &#x201c;U&#x201d; in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(</figref><i>a</i>), i.e. from left toward right, on the bar display region <b>136</b>P. At the same time, the number of operation iterations (count value C<b>1</b>) is displayed in a digital number on the numeric value display region <b>136</b>Q.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0166">When the number of operation iterations (C<b>2</b>) of the second switch <b>147</b> is counted, the display controlling means <b>154</b> displays the count screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> on the display <b>136</b>. The count screen corresponding to the second switch <b>147</b> has an upper stage thereof defining a message region <b>136</b>M for displaying a message to prompt an operator's input; and a lower stage thereof defining a bar display region <b>136</b>P in which a plurality of display points are lined up in the lateral direction in the form of a progress bar to be displayed in solid black when no input has yet been made, and also defining a numeric value display region <b>136</b>Q for displaying the number of operation iterations (count value C<b>2</b>) in a numeric figure.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0167">When the second switch <b>147</b> has been operated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(</figref><i>b</i>), each time an operation is made, the display point of the number corresponding to the number of operation iterations (count value C<b>2</b>) is changed to be displayed in a solid white in the direction of an arrow indicated by &#x201c;D&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(</figref><i>b</i>), i.e. from right toward left, on the bar display region <b>136</b>P. At the same time, the number of operation iterations (count value C<b>2</b>) is displayed in a digital number on the numeric value display region <b>136</b>Q.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0168">In other words, when the first switch <b>146</b> is operated, the display points of the bar display region <b>136</b>P are switched one by one to a solid black display from the left side with each operation; and the number of display points in a solid black display increases together with the number of operation iterations (C<b>1</b>), and the numeric value on the numeric value display region <b>136</b>Q also increases. On the other hand, when the second switch <b>147</b> is operated, the display points of the bar display region <b>136</b>P are switched one by one to a solid white display from the right side with each operation; and the number of display points in a solid white display increases (the solid black display decreases) together with the number of operation iterations (C<b>2</b>), and the numeric value on the numeric value display region <b>136</b>Q also increases. This makes it possible for the operator to visually understand the number of operation iterations (C<b>1</b>) of the first switch and the number of operation iterations (C<b>2</b>) of the second switch <b>147</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0169">Incidentally, the count screen is not limited to a progress bar display and a digital numeric value display in combination as described above. Instead thereof, the count screen may display a character or word indicative of a numeric value. In particular, in such control, the count screen may be displayed even when the operation sequence between the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> is in reverse, such that it is impossible to analyze the correctness of the operation sequence from presence/absence of the display on the count screen.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0170">In step #<b>105</b>, the authentication information identifying means <b>155</b> compares the inputted authentication information (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>) which includes the number of operation iterations (C<b>1</b>) of the first switch <b>146</b> and the number of operation iterations (C<b>2</b>) of the second switch (C<b>2</b>), with the stored authentication information (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>). When the comparison determined that the stored authentication information (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>) and the inputted authentication information (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>) are identical, then power supply to the starter motor <b>149</b> is permitted from the power control unit <b>148</b> (steps #<b>106</b>, #<b>107</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0171">When the conformity is determined in this manner, the display <b>136</b> is switched to a standard display mode suitable for working, and when the key switch <b>141</b> is operated to the start position, the power control unit <b>148</b> permits power supply to the starter motor <b>149</b> and starts up the engine <b>104</b>. In the standard display mode, a basic information display region <b>136</b>A indicative of the speed change stage of the main speed change lever <b>127</b>, the travel speed and the current point in time is displayed on the upper stage of the display <b>136</b>, and a set information display region <b>136</b>B indicative of the set information is displayed on the lower stage of the display <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0172">On the other hand, if the control determined that a switch other than a target switch (the first switch <b>146</b> or the second switch <b>147</b>) has been operated, or if the authentication processing determined that there is no conformity between the stored authentication information (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>) and the inputted authentication information (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>), then the number of erroneous operations (N) is incremented by one; and if the number of erroneous operations (N) reaches &#x201c;3,&#x201d; then the authentication restricting means <b>156</b> performs the wait processing for a set period of time, such that no authentication processing is performed during the period of time of the wait processing (steps #<b>106</b>, and #<b>108</b> through #<b>111</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0173">In other words, when the authentication information identifying means <b>155</b> has determined, for a set number of times of consecutive iterations, that the inputted authentication information (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>) is not identical to the stored authentication information (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>), then a restriction mode is produced in which the authentication restricting means <b>156</b> allows no authentication to be performed in the authentication processing device <b>150</b> until the set period of time elapses thereafter. Specifically, if a switch other than a target switch (the first switch <b>146</b> or the second switch <b>147</b>) has been operated, or if the number of operation iterations (C<b>1</b>) of the first switch <b>146</b> and the number of operation iterations (C<b>2</b>) of the second switch <b>147</b> are not identical to the stored authentication information (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>) even if the target switches have been operated, or if the operation sequences of the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> are different, then, at a point in time where the number of such erroneous operations reaches three (3), the authentication restricting means <b>156</b> restricts processing by the authentication information identifying means <b>155</b> until the set period of time has elapsed, whereby authentication by frequently performing operations at random is prevented.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">(Functions and Effects of the Embodiments)</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0174">As described above, in the present invention, since the authentication is performed by operating the two switches i.e. the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b>, for a set number of operation iterations in a set sequence, the precision of the authentication is enhanced thanks to increase in the number of combinations of numbers of operation iterations, so that even though only two switches are used, high precision of authentication is achieved, thus preventing theft. Further, when the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> have been operated, the number of operation iterations can be visually checked by the display <b>136</b>. Therefore, the number of erroneous operations is reduced. Moreover, when the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> are operated, the screen is switched, and the display aspect of the number of operation iterations also is switched, and therefore erroneous operations can be favorably eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0175">As described above, in the present invention, when the numbers of operation iterations (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>) of the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> are correct, it is also possible to set the control mode such that the operation sequence of the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> is not set. When the control mode has been set in this manner, there is no need for the operator to store the operation sequence of the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b>, and it becomes possible to perform authentication without greatly lowering the precision of the authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0176">Further, the single operational tool <b>145</b> is used to operate the two switches. Thus, one end part of the operational tool <b>145</b> is operated and thereafter the other end part is operated when an authentication is to be performed. This allows for rapid operation of the switches and for a curtailed operation time for the authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0177">In particular, if an incorrect switch has been operated, if the number of operation iterations (C<b>1</b>) of the first switch <b>146</b> or the number of operation iterations (C<b>2</b>) of the second switch <b>147</b> is incorrect, or if the sequence of operation of the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> is incorrect, and if such cases occur three times, then authentication is temporarily stopped. Therefore, even when a person attempting to steal the work vehicle inputs authentication information (the inputted authentication information) at random, for example, the number of input iterations of the authentication information (the inputted authentication information) is restricted, rendering it difficult to input authentication information (inputted authentication information) which is identical to the stored authentication information, thus enhancing performance in preventing theft.</p>

<p id="p-0174" num="0178">As described above, the present invention can be applied to a device for allowing an engine to be started up after an authentication in a work vehicle provided with two switches.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0179">Other than the foregoing embodiment as described above, the present invention may also be configured as follows.
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0180">(a) The first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> are not limited to those used also for the cruise control. Instead thereof, two switching switches for switching between a high speed and a low speed of the stepless speed change device <b>108</b>, or two switches having entirely different control targets, may also be used.</li>
    <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0181">(b) The operational tool for operating the two switches is not limited to one acting in a seesaw manner. Instead thereof, the operational tool may be a lever pivotable around a predetermined swing axis, or one slidable in a straight line.</li>
    <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0182">(c) The mode of the inputted authentication information is not limited to one described in the foregoing embodiment. Instead of a single input rotation including a set number of input iterations of the first switch <b>146</b> and a set number of subsequent input iterations of the second switch <b>147</b>, at least one of the first switch <b>146</b> and the second switch <b>147</b> may be sufficient, or at least twice such a rotation may be required, for the inputted authentication information. As a further modification, the inputted authentication information may require a set number of input iterations of the first switch <b>146</b>, a set number of input iterations of the second switch <b>147</b> subsequent thereto, and again a set number of input iterations of the first switch <b>146</b>. Setting the operation sequence in this manner dramatically improves the precision of the authentication and also enhances the efficacy of the theft prevent even though only two switches are being used.</li>
    <li id="ul0005-0004" num="0183">(d) An authentication information storing mode and the like for allowing the operator to set the stored authentication information may be provided also. During the control of such an authentication information storing mode, not only the number of operation iterations of the first switch <b>146</b> and the number of operation iterations of the second switch <b>147</b> but also the sequence of the operations of the two switches may be set as desired, for example. This makes it possible to periodically change the stored authentication information, and possible to further enhance the efficacy of the theft prevention.</li>
