<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A layered structure comprising a self-assembled material is formed by a method that includes forming a photochemically, thermally and/or chemically treated patterned photoresist layer disposed on a first surface of a substrate. The treated patterned photoresist layer comprises a non-crosslinked treated photoresist. An orientation control material is cast on the treated patterned photoresist layer, forming a layer containing orientation control material bound to a second surface of the substrate. The treated photoresist and, optionally, any non-bound orientation control material are removed by a development process, resulting in a pre-pattern for self-assembly. A material capable of self-assembly is cast on the pre-pattern. The casted material is allowed to self-assemble with optional heating and/or annealing to produce the layered structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure is related to methods of directed self-assembly, and the layered structures formed therefrom; and more specifically, to self-assembly of microdomains of block copolymers having higher spatial frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The ability to pattern features with smaller critical dimensions allows denser circuitry to be fabricated, thereby enabling more circuit elements within the same area and reducing the overall cost per element. Features having smaller critical dimensions and tighter pitch are needed in each technology generation. Directed self-assembly (DSA) of polymeric materials is a potential candidate to extend current lithography by enhancing the spatial resolution and/or controlling the critical dimension variation of a predefined pattern on a substrate. In particular, DSA of block copolymer (BCP) materials and polymer blends have been explored for this purpose. There are two major approaches to the directed self-assembly of BCP thin films: graphoepitaxy and chemical epitaxy.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the graphoepitaxy method depicted in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the self-organization of block copolymers is guided by topographical features of pre-patterned substrates. A topographically patterned substrate with sidewalls <b>910</b> having a preferential <b>1</b> affinity for one domain <b>914</b> and an underlying orientation control layer <b>912</b> can be used to direct self-assembly (of lamellar domains in this case) within the trench of width L. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> self-aligned lamellar domains <b>914</b> and <b>916</b> of BCPs form parallel line-space patterns in topographical trenches and enhance pattern resolution by subdividing the space (trench) of the lithographically-derived topographical pre-pattern. One domain, for example domain <b>916</b>, can be selectively etched leaving domain <b>914</b>. With a trench of width L and BCP with a periodicity of P<sub>BCP</sub>, frequency multiplication of a factor of L/P<sub>BCP </sub>can be achieved. However, graphoepitaxy has issues which potentially limit its utility as a lithographic technique. For example, in graphoepitaxy, the placement error and line-edge roughness of BCP domains are deteriorated by the imperfect topographical pre-patterns and non-uniform thickness of the BCP polymer layer coated over the topographical substrate. In addition, the mandrels <b>918</b> used to direct the self-assembly process are usually much larger than the BCP domains, and the area occupied by the mandrels is essentially wasted. Also, many graphoepitaxy approaches use topographic features formed by etching into an oxide hard mask layer to provide patterns that are stable to the BCP casting solvent. The additional process steps using the hard mask layer increase the cost and complexity of graphoepitaxy-based DSA processes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Alternatively, in the chemical epitaxy method depicted in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the self-assembly of BCP materials to form domains <b>926</b> and <b>928</b> is directed by dense chemical patterns in a layer <b>920</b>. The pitch of the chemical pattern (P<sub>S</sub>) is roughly equivalent to the pitch of the BCP domain periodicity (P<sub>BCP</sub>). The preferential affinity between at least one of the chemical pattern regions <b>922</b> or <b>924</b> and a corresponding BCP domain <b>926</b> or <b>928</b> directs the self-assembly of the BCP domains in accordance with the underlying chemical pre-pattern. Unlike graphoepitaxy, no area is lost to the features directing self-assembly. In addition, the BCP self-assembly process improves the dimensional control due to the lower critical dimension variation (both mean critical dimension and line-edge roughness (LER) or line-width roughness (LWR)) in the final self-assembled structures compared to that in the underlying chemical pre-pattern. Even though DSA using chemical epitaxy on dense chemical patterns increases critical dimension control, it does not improve resolution or provide an information gain. Current optical lithography tools do not have sufficient resolution to print these 1:1 chemical patterns. Instead, these patterns have been fabricated using lithographic techniques such as e-beam direct write or extreme-ultraviolet (EUV, 13.5 nm) interference lithography which are not suitable for volume manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Chemical epitaxy on sparse chemical patterns, however, can provide critical dimension and orientation control similar to that on dense chemical patterns but also provide enhanced resolution. For example, Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows the directed self-assembly of BCP material to form domains <b>936</b> and <b>938</b> on a sparse chemical pattern layer <b>930</b> comprised of alternating pinning regions <b>934</b> having a width W<sub>P</sub>=0.5*P<sub>BCP </sub>and regions with an orientation control material <b>932</b> having a width W<sub>CA</sub>=P<sub>S</sub>&#x2212;W<sub>P </sub>In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, pinning regions <b>934</b> have a strong affinity for domains <b>938</b>. An orientation control material such as <b>932</b> having operationally equivalent affinity for both domains <b>938</b> and domains <b>936</b> is suitable to support perpendicularly-oriented domains (<b>936</b> and <b>938</b>) as shown. The factor of frequency multiplication is determined by the ratio of the pitch of the sparse chemical patterns stripe (P<sub>S</sub>) and the pitch of BCP (P<sub>BCP</sub>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the depicted ratio P<sub>S</sub>/P<sub>BCP</sub>=2, which would result in frequency doubling. Similarly, spatial frequency tripling could be achieved by using a sparse chemical pattern having a P<sub>S</sub>/P<sub>BCP</sub>=3, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While a wide variety of orientation control materials have been developed including surface-bound self-assembled monolayers, polymer brushes (i.e., the polymer chains attach at one end to an interface and extend away from the interface to form a &#x201c;brush&#x201d; layer), and photo- or thermally-crosslinkable polymer materials, in practice it is quite difficult to fabricate suitable sparse chemical patterns that effectively direct self-assembly of BCPs in a manner that can be integrated with conventional lithographic processes and materials. Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2D</figref> show some of the approaches that have been used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates direct writing of 1:1 dense chemical patterns by e-beam direct write lithography or EUV interference lithography in an orientation control layer <b>940</b> (e.g., a surface-bound polymer brush or self-assembled monolayer). The chemical pattern generated in layer <b>940</b> directs self-assembly of a BCP to form domains <b>942</b> and <b>944</b>. Although e-beam lithography can be used to make sparse chemical patterns in this manner, e-beam direct write lithography is not suitable for volume manufacturing. Alternatively, as shown in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a conventional positive-tone photoresist <b>946</b> can be patterned on top of an orientation control material <b>948</b> to form patterned photoresist features <b>950</b>. The photoresist pattern can protect the underlying surface during an etch process that creates pinning regions (i.e., a region having a particular affinity for one domain of a self-assembled material), either by removing the material to uncover the underlying substrate or by inducing enough damage to the material that it becomes preferential to one of the BCP self-assembled domains <b>954</b> or <b>956</b>. The protecting photoresist layer can then be removed by an organic solvent rinse leaving the etched orientation layer having features <b>952</b>. However, the special orientation control material may interfere with the photoresist patterning by causing reflectivity or photoresist adhesion issues. In addition, this method is quite process intensive and involves etch processes that cannot be done in the lithography track tool. Furthermore, the protective photoresist layer may be damaged sufficiently by the etch process that it cannot be stripped cleanly and completely. Rather than selectively removing or altering an orientation control material, negative-tone photo-patternable orientation control materials <b>958</b> have been developed that can be patterned on top of conventional anti-reflective coatings <b>960</b> (Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). BCP self-assembled domains <b>962</b> and <b>964</b> are also shown in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. In practice, while such negative-tone photo-patternable orientation control materials work well for large area patterns, no such materials have demonstrated sufficient resolution performance. Finally, as shown in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, direct patterning of a crosslinking negative-tone photoresist <b>966</b> on top of an orientation control material <b>968</b> can produce pinning regions. BCP self-assembled domains <b>970</b> and <b>972</b> are also shown in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. Care must be taken so as to not alter the surface properties of the orientation control material in the non-exposed regions during photoresist casting and development. In addition, it is challenging to achieve high resolution patterning using a dark field mask with the limited range of conventional negative-tone photoresists for optical lithography. The best reported efforts have used a hydrogen silsesquioxane negative-tone e-beam photoresist, which is unsuitable for volume manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While patterning a thin positive-tone photoresist on a controlled surface seems to be the most straightforward approach to creating chemical patterns to direct self-assembly, in practice many problems are encountered that make this route unviable. For example, while patterning resists with typical thicknesses of 80 to 200 nm is suitable for the generation of topographical patterns required for graphoepitaxy, patterning high fidelity, low defect images in the thin (e.g., sub-15 nm) layers required for chemical patterns is difficult. In addition, the underlying surface must serve as both a bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC) during photoresist patterning and later as an orientation control layer in the areas cleared during patterning. However, commercially available BARCs (being optimized primarily for their optical properties, etch properties, and photoresist adhesion/profile performance) do not have the appropriate surface properties to act as orientation control materials. In addition, current orientation control materials do not have the thickness or optical properties necessary to provide adequate reflection control (especially for high numerical aperature (high-NA) optical lithography). In practice, it is quite difficult to maintain the surface properties of the underlying orientation control material through the course of conventional lithographic patterning of positive-tone photoresist. The underlying orientation control material in the exposed regions is typically subjected to the imaging radiation (e.g., damaging deep ultraviolet (DUV), extreme ultraviolet (EUV), or electron beam radiation), superacids at elevated temperatures (i.e., photo-generated acid during post-exposure bake), reactive intermediates (e.g., those from photoacid generator (PAG) decomposition, acidolysis of photoresist protecting groups, or photodecomposition of photoresist materials), and strong bases (i.e., aqueous tetramethylammonium hydroxide during photoresist development). Any and all of these can change the surface properties of the underlying orientation control material. And since the specifics and magnitude of the changes are dependent upon the lithographic exposure technique, the photoresist, and the processing conditions, it is not possible to compensate for all of these effects by manipulating the orientation control material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, methods of generating sparse chemical patterns for directing self-assembly of a material are needed that are compatible with conventional tools, processes, and materials.</p>

After patterning a positive-tone photoresist on a substrate, the resulting photoresist pattern is treated to render it insoluble in a casting solvent for an orientation control material. An orientation control material is disposed on the treated photoresist pattern. The orientation control layer is then treated to bind the orientation control material to the substrate. The treated photoresist and any non-bound orientation control material are then removed to generate a chemical pattern. The pre-pattern comprises pinning regions of the substrate surface containing residual or no photoresist surrounded by other regions of the substrate surface containing bound orientation control material. Self-assembly of a SA material is then effectively directed by the chemical pattern.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The methods described herein utilize a non-crosslinkable positive-tone photoresist to form a pre-pattern for DSA. The photoresist can be capable of chemical amplification. Using a conventional lithographic process, a photoresist layer disposed on a substrate is pattern-wise exposed and developed in a first development process, thereby forming an initial patterned photoresist layer (also referred to as the &#x201c;initial layer&#x201d;). The initial layer is then treated photochemically, thermally, and/or chemically, thereby forming a treated patterned photoresist layer (also referred to as the &#x201c;treated layer&#x201d;). The treated layer is insoluble in a casting solvent for an orientation control material. A solution of the orientation control material is then cast on the treated photoresist layer. The orientation control layer is not limited in thickness relative to the photoresist features. More specifically, the orientation control material can be substantially disposed in the trench of the photoresist features, and have a thickness less than or equal to a trench height of the photoresist feature. The layered structure is thermally treated to effect binding of the orientation control material to a substrate surface (e.g., an anti-reflection layer of a substrate). &#x201c;Binding&#x201d; includes covalent and/or non-covalent forms of adhering contact between the orientation control material and the substrate surface. Binding includes, for example, interlayer mixing (e.g., chain entanglement) at the layer boundary, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding between the substrate surface and the orientation control material, and covalent bonding (e.g., grafting). In one embodiment, the treated photoresist and any non-bound orientation control material are removed by an appropriate second development process, thereby forming a layered structure having a chemically patterned surface useful for self-assembly. The chemically patterned surface comprises a first substrate surface comprising residual or no photoresist, and a second substrate surface comprising bound orientation control material. The first substrate surface can also serve as a pinning region. In another embodiment, a portion of the treated photoresist layer and any non-bound orientation control material are removed by an appropriate second development process, thereby forming a layered structure comprising photoresist features of reduced thickness. The surfaces of the photoresist features having reduced thickness, together with the surface comprising non-bound orientation control material can provide a chemical pre-pattern for self-assembly. The photoresist surface can also serve as a pinning region. In yet another embodiment, the treated photoresist and any non-bound orientation control material are not developed before applying a material for self-assembly. In this instance, the surfaces and topography of the treated photoresist and the orientation control material can together form a graphoepitaxial pre-pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">This &#x201c;pattern-first, surface control-second&#x201d; approach has several advantages over alternative methods known in the art. The initial photoresist patterning process is unchanged from a conventional lithographic process, and therefore can utilize the same photomasks, exposure tools, lithographic materials, stacked structures (including topcoats, photoresists, anti-reflective coatings, and underlayers, etc.), and processing conditions. Additionally, the photoresist pattern can be further manipulated prior to application of the orientation control material. For example, a trim process can be used to reduce a critical dimension (CD) of the photoresist features (leaving the overall pitch unchanged), and thereby overcome a resolution limitation of optical lithography tools. Finally, a large number of conventional positive-tone photoresist materials can be used in the disclosed method, with the proviso that they are capable of being rendered insoluble in a suitable casting solvent for an orientation control material.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A &#x201c;pre-pattern&#x201d; is a specific term used herein referring to the collection of surfaces contacted by the casting solution of the SA material. One or more of the surfaces directs self-assembly. The SA material, after removal of the casting solvent, can be disposed on all or some of these surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A &#x201c;graphoepitaxial pre-pattern&#x201d; is a pre-pattern in which topography and surface properties influence self-assembly. A &#x201c;chemical pre-pattern&#x201d; is a pre-pattern in which self-assembly is predominantly influenced by surface properties. No sharp dimensional limits exist between these two pre-pattern categories because the extent of topographical influence on self-assembly is also dependent on the thickness of the SA layer in relation to the underlying relief surface. In general, however, when graphoepitaxial pre-patterns are used, the thickness of the SA layer is less than or equal to the trench height of the underlying pre-pattern. For chemical pre-patterns, the SA thickness is greater than any trench height of the underlying topography.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As indicated above, a material capable of self-assembling into compositionally different, phase-separated domains is referred to as a SA material. The term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to all underlying layers of a structure on which the photoresist layer is disposed. The substrate can have one or more layers arranged in a stack. In a multi-layered substrate, the layer directly below and in contact with the photoresist layer is the top-most layer of the substrate, also referred to as &#x201c;the underlayer&#x201d; to the photoresist layer. The terms &#x201c;surface&#x201d; or &#x201c;underlying surface&#x201d; refer, unless otherwise stated, to the surface of the substrate on which the photoresist layer is disposed. As non-limiting examples, the photoresist layer can be disposed on the surface of a silicon wafer or a metal foil, or more particularly on the surface of an anti-reflection layer (ARC) of a multi-layer substrate, where the ARC layer is the top-most layer. In this example, the ARC layer is also the underlayer of the photoresist layer. In another example, the ARC layer has a polymer brush layer attached to the top surface. In this instance, the polymer brush layer is also the underlayer of the photoresist layer. The term &#x201c;disposed&#x201d; refers to a layer in contact with a surface of another layer. &#x201c;Disposing&#x201d; or &#x201c;applying&#x201d; refer to forming a layer to be in contact with a surface of another layer, without limitation as to the method employed unless otherwise stated, with the proviso that the desirable characteristics of the disposed or applied layer are obtained, such as uniformity and thickness. The term &#x201c;casting&#x201d; refers to forming a layer of a material by disposing on another layer a solution of the material dissolved in a solvent, and removing the solvent. Unless otherwise stated, copolymers are random copolymers, indicated by &#x201c;-co-&#x201d;, or &#x201c;-r-&#x201d; in the name. Block copolymers are indicated by &#x201c;-b-&#x201d; or &#x201c;-block-&#x201d; in the name. Alternating block copolymers are indicated by &#x201c;-alt-&#x201d; in the name.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The term &#x201c;chemical amplification&#x201d; is well known in the art of photoresists, and refers to the catalytic reaction of functional groups of the photoresist as catalyzed by a photogenerated species. The fundamentals of chemical amplification and its application to photoresist chemistry is reviewed by Ito in &#x201c;Chemical Amplification Resists for Microlithography&#x201d; <i>Adv. Polym. Sci</i>., vol. 172, pp. 37-245 (2005). The most common chemically-amplified photoresists utilize photoacid generators (PAGs) and the most commonly employed reaction mechanism is the deprotection of protected polar functional groups. For example, acid-sensitive esters can be catalytically converted to more polar carboxylic acid groups by a photo-released acid. Chemical amplification typically occurs during a post-exposure bake, when one photo-generated acid molecule catalyzes the deprotection of many ester groups in the exposed areas. The chemically amplified photoresist has increased polarity compared to an as-exposed photoresist or the non-exposed photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Herein, a &#x201c;positive-tone photoresist&#x201d; is a photoresist that becomes more soluble in an aqueous alkaline developer when exposed to radiation. The positive-tone photoresist does not crosslink when it is exposed, developed, or when optionally baked before or after development. A &#x201c;negative-tone photoresist&#x201d; becomes less soluble in an aqueous alkaline developer when exposed, typically due to a photo-induced crosslinking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">&#x201c;Negative-tone development&#x201d; means the non-exposed areas of the photoresist layer are removed during development. &#x201c;Positive-tone development&#x201d; means the exposed areas of the photoresist layer are removed during development.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">It is understood that in some cases (e.g., when forming dense, high resolution patterns) all of the photoresist layer can receive some dose of radiation exposure. By &#x201c;non-exposed photoresist&#x201d; is meant the portion of the photoresist layer that has received insufficient dose to switch the solubility of the photoresist, either before or after an optional bake, in a given developer compared to the pre-exposed photoresist. An &#x201c;exposed photoresist&#x201d; has received sufficient exposure to switch the solubility of the photoresist, either before or after an optional bake, in a given developer compared to the pre-exposed photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Casting a solution of orientation control material, or a solution of SA material, on a layer (e.g., the treated layer), is understood to mean that the solution makes contact with all the available surfaces of the layer (i.e., surfaces in contact with the surrounding atmosphere). These can include substrate surfaces, photoresist surfaces, and orientation control material surfaces. When referring to the chemical components, reactivity, solubility and/or surface properties of the initial layer or the treated layer, it is understood that such reference is directed only to the photoresist material and not to the substrate, the substrate surface, or an orientation control material surface, unless otherwise stated. Likewise, when referring to the chemical components, chemical reactivity, solubility and/or surface properties of the substrate surface or a substrate layer, such reference is directed only to the substrate surface or the substrate layer and not to the photoresist material or orientation control material unless otherwise stated. Further, when referring to the chemical components, chemical reactivity, solubility and/or surface properties of the orientation control material or orientation control layer, such reference is directed only to the orientation control material or orientation control layer and not to the photoresist material or substrate material, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">For clarity, it is also understood that the initial layer comprises &#x201c;pre-treated photoresist&#x201d; and the treated layer comprises &#x201c;treated photoresist.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">A &#x201c;polarity change&#x201d; herein implies an altered chemical composition that affects relative solubility without crosslinking. &#x201c;Inducing a polarity change&#x201d; in the initial layer means subjecting the photoresist to a treatment that alters the chemical composition so as to render the treated layer less soluble in a solvent compared to the initial layer. More specifically, the treated photoresist has &#x201c;increased polarity&#x201d; compared to the pre-treated photoresist. The treatment can include and an optional bake before and/or after the treatment, which can induce further increased polarity in the treated photoresist. The extent of the polarity change can be measured by comparing the solubility of the treated and pre-treated photoresist in a non-alkaline developer. The increased polarity renders substantially all of treated photoresist, not just the surface of the treated layer, insoluble in the casting solvent for the SA material, without crosslinking the photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Increased polarity can be achieved, for example, by deprotection of protected polar functional groups. Polar functional groups include carboxylic acid groups, phenols, higher aromatic alcohols, and alcohols. A number of processes exist for deprotecting protected polar functional groups in the initial layer. For example, a second exposure (e.g., a whole area exposure, also termed flood exposure) of the initial layer with second radiation can generate a strong acid from photoacid generator (PAG). During a subsequent post-exposure bake, the photo-released acid can then, for example, catalyze the deprotection of acid-sensitive tertiary carboxylic ester groups in the initial layer. Another method of deprotection involves direct thermolysis of protecting groups at elevated temperature. Alternatively, thermolysis of a thermal acid generator or a photoacid generator can create strong acid molecules that can catalyze the acidolysis of protecting groups. A large number of suitable acid-labile or temperature-labile protecting groups for polar functional groups such as carboxylic acids and phenols are described in Wuts, P. G. M. and Greene, T. W. <i>Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, </i>4<sup>th </sup><i>ed. </i>John Wiley &#x26; Sons; Hoboken, N.J., 2007; and Kocienski, P. J. <i>Protecting Groups, </i>3<sup>rd </sup><i>ed. </i>Georg Thieme Verlag: Stuttgart, Germany, 2005. In particular, the protecting groups include tertiary esters, orthoesters, acetals, ketals, carbonates, silyl ethers and silyl esters.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The extent of deprotection required to induce a change in the solubility of the treated photoresist in the casting solvents used for the orientation control material and the SA material will depend upon the photoresist composition and the casting solvent, among other factors. Notably, the extent of deprotection need not be 100%. In a positive-tone photoresist that is capable of chemical amplification, the solubility of the exposed and baked photoresist in an aqueous alkaline developer is typically non-linear with respect to the percent deprotection, and can change by orders of magnitude over a relatively small percentage change in deprotection. In fact, it is this non-linear response that rectifies the often diffuse sinusoidal aerial image of the exposed photoresist into the desired sharp square pattern profiles in the developed initial layer. In the present method, this phenomenon is advantageously used to render the treated photoresist insoluble in a selected casting solvent for the orientation control material and the SA material. Only a small or moderate extent of deprotection may be required to render the treated photoresist insoluble in a desired solvent. Complete deprotection can, in some cases, be undesirable due to unacceptable pattern distortion induced by the loss of such large quantities of protecting groups.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Advantageously, the glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) of the treated photoresist is higher than the T<sub>g </sub>of the pre-treated photoresist. A higher glass transition temperature prevents photoresist reflow under additional thermal treatment, which can deform topographical features as demonstrated in example 7. Consequently, the deprotection of protected polar groups in the initial layer simplifies the DSA process and provides a wider process window for additional thermal treatment. As an additional benefit, the method provides a simpler route to rework or selectively remove the treated photoresist. For example, the treated photoresist containing deprotected polar groups may be dissolved in an alkaline developer or a significantly more polar solvent for rework. Alternatively, the treated photoresist may be selectively removed from at least one domain of the SA material if there is a sufficiently large polarity difference between the treated photoresist and the SA domain.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Optionally, the geometry of the initial layer <b>30</b> topographical features can be adjusted by a secondary process prior to treating the initial layer. In an embodiment, a dimension of the initial layer is decreased before treating the initial layer. For example, a second lithographic process can be used to cut or trim a dimension of the initial photoresist lines. Alternatively, the critical dimensions of the photoresist lines can be decreased using reactive ion etching. Another suitable trim process comprises casting a layer of an immersion topcoat material (such as JSR TCX-041, a material having strongly acidic groups that can deprotect the outer portion of the photoresist) on top of the photoresist pattern, baking the wafer, and removing the topcoat and a portion of photoresist material using TMAH developer.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Initial layer <b>30</b> is treated photochemically, thermally, chemically, or a combination thereof, to render non-exposed photoresist <b>26</b> insoluble in a first solvent used to cast an orientation control material and/or a second solvent used to cast a SA material, forming treated layer <b>38</b> (i.e., &#x201c;treated patterned photoresist layer&#x201d;, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, structure <b>44</b>). Treated layer <b>38</b> comprises treated photoresist <b>40</b> disposed on first substrate surface <b>34</b>. Treated photoresist <b>40</b> is more polar and has less solubility in the first and/or second solvent compared to non-exposed photoresist <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. Also shown is second substrate surface <b>42</b> of substrate <b>10</b>, having a composition capable of binding an orientation control material.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The term &#x201c;treating&#x201d; with reference to the photoresist refers to methods of rendering the photoresist insoluble in a solvent or a developer without crosslinking the photoresist. The treated layer remains structurally stable when contacted by the casting solution of the orientation control material or the casting solution of the SA material. However, the treatment does not render the treated photoresist <b>40</b> insoluble in all known solvents and/or developers. For example, the treatment does not irreversibly crosslink the treated photoresist such that the treated photoresist cannot be removed by any process short of ashing or aggressive chemical stripping (e.g, using a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide (so-called piranha etch)). In an embodiment, the treated photoresist is not soluble in a low polarity casting solvent (e.g., anisole) suitable for casting the orientation control material. In another embodiment, the treated photoresist is not soluble in a moderately polar casting solvent for the orientation control material, such as a monoalcohol glycol, glycol monoether, or glycol mono ether ester. In an embodiment, the treatment induces a polarity change throughout the thickness of the treated photoresist features, not merely a portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As stated, the treatment can be photochemical, thermal, chemical, or a combination of thereof. In general, the treated photoresist has increased polarity arising from an increased concentration of polar functional groups formed in the photoresist by the treatment. The increased polarity can vary depending on the photoresist material and the treatment conditions. Increased polarity can be achieved, for example, by deprotection of protected polar functional groups. Polar functional groups include carboxylic acid groups, phenols, higher aromatic alcohols, and alcohols. There are a number of processes by which deprotection of protected polar functional groups in the initial layer can be accomplished. In one example, the initial layer is treated photochemically by flood exposing the initial layer with second radiation, generating a strong acid from a photoacid generator (PAG) in the photoresist material. The second radiation can comprise the first radiation used to pattern-wise expose the photoresist layer. Optionally, the flood exposure is followed by a bake to form the treated layer. The flood exposure can be performed with a single wavelength of radiation or a combination of suitable wavelengths (broad band) of radiation, so long as the exposure is effective in inducing the desired polarity change in the treated photoresist. The flood exposure can be from 1 to 200 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, more particularly from 2 to 150 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, or even more particularly from 3 to 100 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. The flood exposure can be a single conventional whole area exposure or a combination of conventional whole area exposures. The photochemical treatment can also be a scanning exposure delivered by digital exposing device such as a laser, light-emitting diode (LED), cathode ray tube (CRT), or spatial light modulator (e.g., DLP chip). E-beam and extreme ultraviolet exposing devices can be also be employed for the photochemical treatment. During a subsequent post-exposure bake, the photo-released acid can catalyze the deprotection of acid-sensitive tertiary carboxylic acid esters and aromatic ethers/acetals and carbonates, chemically amplifying the concentration of carboxylic acid and phenol groups in the treated photoresist. With sufficient polarity change, the treated photoresist can be rendered insoluble in a less polar solvent (e.g., anisole) used to dissolve and cast the orientation control material or the SA material. Alternative methods to accomplish deprotection involve thermolysis of protecting groups at elevated temperature. Thermolysis of a thermal acid generator or a photoacid generator can create strong acid molecules that can catalyze the acidolysis of the protecting groups. A large number of suitable acid-labile or temperature-labile protecting groups for polar functional groups such as carboxylic acids and phenols are described in Wuts, P. G. M. and Greene, T. W. <i>Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, </i>4<sup>th </sup><i>ed. </i>John Wiley &#x26; Sons; Hoboken, N.J., 2007; and Kocienski, P. J. <i>Protecting Groups, </i>3<sup>rd </sup><i>ed. </i>Georg Thieme Verlag: Stuttgart, Germany, 2005. In particular, the protecting groups can include tertiary esters, orthoesters, acetals, ketals, carbonates, silyl ethers and silyl esters. An additional thermal annealing bake may be used to tune the solubility of the treated layer. For example, with additional thermal treatment the treated photoresist can be rendered insoluble in moderately polar solvents such as a glycol mono ether ester (e.g., PGMEA). The thermal treatment can comprise heating the initial layer or the photochemically treated initial layer at a temperature of, for example, from 60&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C., from 80&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C., from 80&#xb0; C. to 220&#xb0; C., from 100&#xb0; C. to 210&#xb0; C., or from 150&#xb0; C. to 210&#xb0; C. Heating at each of the foregoing temperature ranges can be performed, for example, for a period of at least 1 sec, 1 sec to 1 day, 1 sec to 12 hours, 1 sec to 1 hour, 10 sec to 30 minutes, 10 sec to 15 minutes, 30 sec to 15 minutes, 30 sec to 10 minutes, 30 sec to 8 minutes, 30 sec minutes to 6 minutes, or 1 minute to 5 minutes. More particularly, the initial layer or the photochemically treated initial layer can be heated at a temperature of, for example, from 60&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C. for 1 sec to 1 hour, from 80&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C. for 10 sec to 15 minutes, from 150&#xb0; C. to 230&#xb0; C. for 30 sec to 10 minutes, or from 150&#xb0; C. to 210&#xb0; C. for 30 sec to 6 minutes. Even more particularly, the initial layer or the photochemically treated initial layer can be heated at 150&#xb0; C. to 210&#xb0; C. for 1 minute to 5 minutes. The thermal treatment can comprise one or more thermal treatments independently selected from temperatures of from 60&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C. and heating times of at least 1 sec. For example, a first thermal treatment at a lower temperature can be followed by a second thermal treatment at a higher temperature. In some instances, this may advantageously prevent pattern collapse or pattern distortion caused by immediately applying a thermal treatment at a temperature far above the glass transition temperature of the patterned photoresist material.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Alternatively, a negative-tone development process can be used to form an initial patterned photoresist layer. Negative-tone development using a non-alkaline developer (e.g., a low polarity organic solvent) selectively removes the non-exposed photoresist <b>26</b> leaving behind exposed photoresist <b>24</b> (not shown), which is now the &#x201c;pre-treated photoresist.&#x201d; The exposed photoresist <b>24</b> is insoluble in a low polarity casting solvent for the orientation control material. The orientation control material can be applied directly to the exposed photoresist <b>24</b> without further treatment, or after additional optional treatment to further decrease the solubility of the exposed photoresist in suitable casting solvents for the orientation control material and/or the SA material. As before, the treatment can be photochemical, thermal, and/or chemical. In an embodiment, the exposed photoresist is treated by baking or thermally annealing the exposed photoresist, thereby forming the treated patterned photoresist layer. When using a negative-tone development method, one must take into account the tone reversal when designing the initial mask layout. In addition, negative-tone development processes are not well established in the industry for positive-tone photoresists.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Also contemplated are water-developable or alkali-developable negative-tone resists that operate by a polarity change mechanism rather than by a crosslinking mechanism, provided the resulting pattern is or can be treated to become insoluble in a casting solvent for the orientation control material or the SA material. However, few, if any commercial high resolution negative-tone photoresists operate by this mechanism. Therefore, the present method preferentially utilizes high resolution, positive-tone photoresists to make the initial patterned photoresist layer, either by positive-tone or negative-tone development.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A solution of the orientation control material dissolved in a first solvent is then cast on the treated layer <b>38</b>, which is not soluble in the first solvent. Removal of the first solvent provides layer <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>, structure <b>52</b>) comprising photoresist features <b>57</b> comprising treated photoresist <b>40</b> disposed on first substrate surface <b>34</b>, and orientation control layer <b>48</b> comprising orientation control material <b>54</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>, orientation control layer <b>48</b> can be disposed on photoresist surface <b>59</b>, sidewall <b>53</b>, and second substrate surface <b>50</b>. Alternatively, orientation control material <b>54</b> can be wholly or substantially located in the trench <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The orientation control layer <b>48</b> is then thermally treated to bind a portion of the orientation control material <b>54</b> to the second substrate surface <b>50</b>. The bound orientation control material <b>58</b> is not soluble in a solvent utilized in a second development process described further below. The thermal treatment can induce crosslinking in the orientation control material. The thermal treatment can comprise heating the orientation control layer at a temperature, for example, of from 60&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C., from 80&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C., from 80&#xb0; C. to 240&#xb0; C., from 100&#xb0; C. to 230&#xb0; C., from 150&#xb0; C. to 220&#xb0; C., or from 165&#xb0; C. to 220&#xb0; C. The orientation control layer can be heated at each of the foregoing temperatures for a period of time of, for example, at least 1 sec, from 1 sec to 1 day, from 1 sec to 12 hours, from 1 sec to 1 hour, from 10 sec to 30 minutes, from 10 sec to 15 minutes, from 10 sec to 15 minutes, from 10 sec to 10 minutes, from 10 sec to 5 minutes, from 10 sec to 2 minutes, from 10 sec to 1 minute, or from 10 sec to 30 sec. The thermal treatment can comprise a single bake step or two sequential bake steps at different temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The result is structure <b>56</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>) comprising layer <b>60</b> comprising bound orientation control material <b>58</b> and non-bound orientation control material <b>54</b>. The interface between bound orientation control material <b>58</b> and non-bound orientation control material <b>54</b> can be a sharp boundary as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>, or a more graduated boundary. The interface between bound orientation control material <b>58</b> and substrate surface <b>50</b> can also be a sharp boundary as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>, or a more graduated boundary caused by intermixing of the materials at the interface. In an embodiment, there is little or no non-bound orientation control material; that is, the bound orientation control material <b>58</b> can be as thick as layer <b>48</b>. Bound orientation control material <b>58</b> can have a thickness of, for example, from 0.1 to 100 nm, more particularly from 0.5 to 50 nm, and even more particularly from 2 to 30 nm. Treated photoresist <b>64</b> is also indicated, which can have increased polarity compared to treated photoresist <b>40</b> after treating the orientation control layer <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Binding of the orientation control material <b>54</b> to surface <b>50</b> can be achieved through covalent bonding (e.g., grafting), intermixing (e.g., chain entangling) of the two layers, ionic bonding as in a mordant, or by another interaction of the materials of the two layers that renders the bound orientation control material <b>58</b> insoluble or less soluble in a second development process compared to the non-bound orientation control material <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Increased binding contact of the orientation control material <b>54</b> to the treated photoresist <b>64</b> can also occur. The orientation control material can be bound to the sidewalls <b>53</b> and/or top surface <b>59</b> of the photoresist features <b>57</b> during the application and treatment of the orientation control material.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In one embodiment heating the orientation control layer causes the orientation control material to be grafted to the underlying substrate surface <b>50</b>. An acidic catalyst can be utilized to accelerate the grafting reaction. The acidic catalyst can take the form of a free acidic species, a photoacid generator, or thermal acid generator. An additional baking step can also be used to accelerate or complete the grafting process.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Structure <b>56</b> can be submitted to a second development process to remove the treated photoresist <b>64</b> and any non-bound orientation control material <b>54</b>. The second development process can include one or more development steps. The development steps can be performed under different process conditions such as temperature or pH, and can utilize the same solvent or different solvents. In an embodiment, the second development process comprises dissolving at least a portion of the treated photoresist with aqueous alkaline developer, and optionally, dissolving the non-bound orientation control material in the first solvent used to cast the orientation control material, the second solvent used to cast the SA material, or another solvent. The second development process steps can be performed in reverse order if desired. For example, the non-bound, including any non-grafted orientation control material, can be removed prior to removing at least a portion of the treated photoresist. In a further embodiment, the second development process comprises dissolving substantially all of the treated photoresist. In another embodiment, the second development process comprises dissolving the treated photoresist and the non-bound orientation control material simultaneously with a single solvent. The resulting structure <b>66</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref>) comprises a chemically patterned surface <b>68</b> comprising first surface <b>70</b> of residual photoresist <b>73</b>. Chemically patterned surface <b>68</b> also comprises second surface <b>71</b> comprising bound orientation control material <b>58</b>. Any topological differences between first surface <b>70</b> and second surface <b>71</b> have negligible, if any influence, on subsequent self-assembly. First surface <b>70</b> and second surface <b>71</b> together form a chemical pre-pattern for self-assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In this embodiment, the orientation control material should be selected such that, after grafting, it does not prevent the second development process from removing at least a portion of the treated photoresist. For example, orientation control materials which employ crosslinkable groups (e.g., glycidyl or epoxydicyclopentadienyl groups) should be selected such that they do not form a layer (or shell) of orientation control material covering the surfaces of the treated photoresist which are extensively crosslinked and could, thereby, prevent the development of the treated photoresist. Some methods by which this potential problem can be prevented include limiting the thickness of the orientation control material, limiting the amount of crosslinkable groups in the orientation control material, and reducing the molecular weight of the polymers comprising the orientation control material.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the case of a typical 193 nm positive-tone photoresist, the treated photoresist material can comprise a methacrylic acid-rich polymer that can be removed using a TMAH developer. Alternatively, the second developer can comprise a polar solvent such as PGMEA, ethyl lactate, gamma-butyrolactone, and propylene carbonate developer. Depending upon the degree of treatment, the photoresist can be completely removed to reveal the substrate surface <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref>), in which case the chemical pre-pattern would comprise first substrate surface <b>72</b> and second surface <b>71</b>, wherein substrate surface <b>72</b> can be the pinning region (e.g., an ARC surface). Typically, some residual photoresist <b>73</b> remains as shown and the thin layer of highly polar, residual photoresist can serve as a hydrophilic pinning region. The amount of the residual photoresist <b>73</b> can be tuned by manipulation of the photoresist treatment conditions, the choice of the second developer solvent, and the length of the second development process. The chemical pre-pattern can be further tuned by thermally annealing or chemically altering the material in the pinning regions (e.g., the first surface <b>70</b> of residual photoresist <b>73</b>). Chemical alteration can be accomplished by selectively reacting the first surface <b>70</b> with a chemical agent or by adjusting the pH (e.g., controlling the extent of ionization of carboxylic acid groups).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The residual photoresist <b>73</b> is thin enough that its topography does not hinder self-assembly of the SA material or subsequent pattern transfer to the substrate. The residual photoresist can have a thickness of, for example, from 0 to 500 angstroms, more particularly from 1 to 250 angstroms, from 15 to 150 angstroms, or even more particularly from 30 to 100 angstroms. Further, the bound orientation control material <b>58</b> after the second development can have a thickness of, for example, from 1 to 500 angstroms, more particularly 15 to 300 angstroms, and even more particularly 15 to 200 angstroms. Lithographic patterning of such small amounts of a photoresist on a controlled surface is not ordinarily effective in creating a chemical pre-patterns for DSA. Such very thin layers are extremely difficult to form and pattern directly with the required precision and uniformity. The disclosed method overcomes this problem by generating a chemically patterned surface comprising residual photoresist that can be utilized for the pinning region during self-assembly. Non-pinning region (second surface <b>71</b> comprising bound orientation control material) can support, for example, the perpendicular orientation of self-assembled domains.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The amount of residual treated photoresist <b>73</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref>) left behind after the second development is dependent upon the photoresist, the developing solvent, and the processing conditions. This is demonstrated in the graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> (see also Example 1 described further below), which show development contrast curves (thickness versus exposure in mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) obtained using different developer solvents with two typical commercial 193 nm positive-tone photoresists capable of chemical amplification: JSR AR2746J (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), and JSR AR2928JN (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, typical positive-tone development is accomplished using 0.26N TMAH developer, to remove exposed photoresist. While moderately polar solvents, such as PGMEA, dissolve the positive photoresist regardless of the exposure dose, lower polarity solvents like anisole and anisole/PGMEA (9:1) only dissolve the photoresist that has experienced little increase in polarity due to a low exposure dose. The photoresist material that has been exposed to higher radiation doses and/or has undergone further polarity increase during baking is even less soluble in a low polarity solvent (e.g., anisole). This behavior can be utilized to control photoresist solubility without cross-linking the photoresist. By flood exposing and baking the patterned photoresist, a sufficient polarity increase ensures the treated photoresist will not be soluble in a casting solvent, such as anisole, for the orientation control material. The behavior of JSR AR2928JN is slightly different, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. In this case, when PGMEA is used as a developer, a thin layer of residual photoresist is left on the surface at higher exposure doses. As described above, photoresists that display this behavior can be used to form a thin layer of residual photoresist if such a solvent is used for the second development. The thermal history of the photoresist layer, the polarity of the developing solvent, the development conditions, development time, and other parameters can be used to tune the thickness residual photoresist layer.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">A solution is prepared comprising one or more SA materials dissolved in a second solvent. The solution is cast onto chemically patterned surface <b>68</b>, followed by removal of the second solvent, thereby forming SA layer <b>74</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3I</figref>, structure <b>76</b>). The solution of SA material can additionally comprise other materials including polymers, block copolymers, surfactants, photoacid generators, and thermal acid generators. For example, an organosilicate resin can be included that is miscible with the poly(ethylene oxide) domains of poly(ethylene oxide-block-styrene) copolymer. SA material <b>78</b> is allowed to phase separate and the resulting domains align as directed by the underlying chemical pre-pattern to form a domain pattern <b>80</b> of self-assembled material (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref>, structure <b>82</b>). Phase separation and alignment can occur during film formation, during a post-application bake, or during a subsequent annealing process. Suitable annealing processes include thermal annealing, thermal gradient annealing, solvent vapor annealing or annealing by other gradient fields. Domain pattern <b>80</b> comprises a first domain <b>84</b> and second domain <b>86</b> of SA material <b>78</b>. First and second domains <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> comprise different components of SA material <b>78</b>; that is, they are compositionally different. First domain <b>84</b> can, for example, comprise one block of a block copolymer, and second domain <b>86</b> can comprise a different block of a block copolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The SA material self-organizes to form domains on the chemically patterned substrate in order to minimize the interfacial energy between SA material and the pre-patterned substrate (i.e., the chemical pre-pattern). With sparse chemical patterns, SA domain patterns can achieve a frequency multiplication of P<sub>S</sub>/P<sub>BCP</sub>, where P<sub>S </sub>is the periodicity of the chemically patterned surface (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) and P<sub>BCP </sub>is the periodicity of the SA material (e.g., block copolymer (BCP)). For example, a chemical pattern with P<sub>S</sub>=2P<sub>BCP </sub>and W<sub>P</sub>=0.5P<sub>BCP</sub>, where W<sub>P </sub>is the width of the pinning region, can be used to direct block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly to form domains that effectively double the line-space frequency of the chemical pre-pattern. Higher frequency multiplication can be achieved by using chemically patterned substrates with larger P<sub>S</sub>/P<sub>BCP </sub>ratios. Most advantageously, the method can utilize commercially available optical lithography tools, processes, and materials to generate the chemical pattern without any additional etch processes. In addition, the ability to trim the photoresist pattern prior to application of the orientation control material allows the size of the pinning regions to be less than the resolution of the optical lithography tool.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The width (w) of the first substrate surface <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref>) can be larger than the width (w&#x2032;) of the first domain <b>84</b> for which it has preferential affinity due to resolution limits of the lithographic tool. Therefore, more than a single domain can self-assemble on the first surface <b>70</b>; however, the pitch of the chemical pre-pattern should be roughly commensurate with an integral multiple of the pitch of the self-assembled domains. In a preferred embodiment, the width (w) of the first substrate surface <b>70</b> is approximately equivalent to the width (w&#x2032;) of the domain <b>84</b> for which it has preferential affinity.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The width of the second surface <b>71</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref>) can be equivalent to the width of the second domain <b>86</b>. In such an embodiment, the pitch of the chemical pre-pattern <b>68</b> will be equivalent to the pitch of the self-assembled domains. However, given the resolution limitations of optical lithography tools, the width of the second surface <b>71</b> can be significantly larger than the width of the second domain <b>86</b>. Therefore, more than a single domain can self-assemble on the second surface <b>71</b>; however, the pitch of the chemical pre-pattern should be roughly commensurate with an integral multiple of the pitch of the self-assembled domains. For example, multiple domains <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> can self-assemble on top of the second surface <b>71</b> comprising bound orientation control material <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, one of the domains, for example second domain <b>86</b>, can be selectively removed (e.g., ion-etched) or modified in the presence of the first domain <b>84</b>, to generate topographical or chemical contrast, exemplified by structure <b>88</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref>, selective removal of second domain <b>86</b> also removes underlying orientation control material producing a relief pattern <b>92</b> comprising first domain <b>84</b> and, for example, openings <b>90</b>. First domain <b>84</b> can be disposed on first surface <b>70</b> and second surface <b>71</b> as shown. Relief pattern <b>92</b> of openings <b>90</b> can have a spatial frequency greater than that of the chemically patterned surface <b>68</b>. The selective removal process may be carried out by a thermal bake (for thermally decomposable materials), a reactive ion etch process, dissolution in a selective solvent, or a combination thereof. A chemical modification may be accomplished by a variety of known methods. For example, domains may be selectively reacted with silanes or silyl chlorides to introduce silicon content into a domain and thereby increase its plasma etch resistance. Alternatively, chemical agents may be used to bind or chemically couple to functional groups that are exclusively located in one type of self-assembled domain, to effect, for example, increased solubility property differences that can advantageously be used to selectively remove one domain in the presence of the other domain.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Finally, relief pattern <b>92</b> can be transferred to substrate <b>10</b>, thereby forming altered regions <b>96</b> of substrate <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L</figref>, layered structure <b>94</b>). Altered regions <b>96</b> can be a line, hole, pit, or a chemically altered state of substrate material. Altered regions <b>96</b> can extend into one or more layers of substrate <b>10</b>. The pattern transfer can be accomplished, for example, by using a reactive ion etch process. In one embodiment, the pattern transfer to the underlying substrate is carried out at the same time as the selective removal of one of the domains of SA material.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The above described method forms a sparse chemical pre-pattern derived from a positive-tone photoresist and an orientation control material without employing etching techniques prior to self-assembly of the SA material.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">To further illustrate the method using a multi-layered substrate, layered structure <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> is reproduced in structure <b>98</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), with the exception that substrate <b>100</b> of layered structure <b>98</b> has two layers, a bottom layer <b>104</b> and a top layer <b>102</b>. Bottom layer <b>104</b> can be, for example, a silicon wafer. Top layer <b>102</b> can be, for example, an ARC layer, where covered surface <b>34</b> is a surface of the ARC layer. The transferred relief pattern described above can extend through the top layer into the bottom layer of the substrate if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Similar embodiments based on sparse chemical patterns can be used to fabricate arrays of holes or posts. For example, coating a cylinder-forming BCP film of pitch P<sub>BCP </sub>(center-to-center distance between nearest cylinders) on a sparse chemical pattern consisting of hexagonally packed pinning dots of pitch, P<sub>S</sub>, and neutral surface outside the dot areas will allow frequency multiplication of lithographically defined dots.

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The substrate, and more particularly the surface of the substrate, can comprise inorganic or organic materials such as metals, carbon, or polymers. More particularly, the substrate can comprise a semiconducting material including, for example, Si, SiGe, SiGeC, SiC, Ge alloys, GaAs, InAs, InP, as well as other III-V or II-VI compound semiconductors. The substrate can also comprise a layered semiconductor such as Si/SiGe, or a semiconductor-on-insulator (SOT). In particular, the substrate can contain a Si-containing semiconductor material (i.e., a semiconductor material that includes Si). The semiconductor material can be doped, non-doped or contain both doped and non-doped regions therein. A substrate comprising a surface affinity material such as a silicon native oxide, silicon oxide, or silicon nitride can be preferentially wetted by, for example, PMMA block components, but not by PS block components of a PS-b-PMMA block copolymer. Therefore, surfaces comprising these surface affinity materials can direct self-assembly of a PS-b-PMMA block copolymer by chemical epitaxy. The substrate can have a top ARC layer or bottom ARC (BARC) layer to reduce reflectivity of the film stack. Many suitable BARCs are known in the literature including single layer BARCs, dual layer BARCs, graded BARCs, and developable BARCs (DBARCs). The substrate can also comprise a hard mask, a transfer layer (e.g., planarizing layer, spin-on-glass layer, spin-on carbon layer), and other materials as required for the layered device.</p>

The reactive polymers may react as a result of thermal or photochemical treatment either alone or in conjuction with an additional crosslinking agent. In particular, a catalytic species such as a strongly acidic species may be used to facilitate reaction. The strongly acidic species may be directly incorporated into the orientation control material or the solution comprising the orientation control material. Alternatively, a thermal acid generator or photoacid generator molecule may be used to generate an acidic species as a result of thermal or photochemical treatment, respectively. The above materials are particularly suitable for use with an SA material comprising poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) block copolymers. Poly(methyl glutarimide) (PMGI) can be an orientation control material for an SA material comprising poly(styrene-b-ethylene oxide) block copolymer.</p>

More particularly, a solution of the photoresist in a suitable solvent is spin cast onto the surface of the substrate, followed by removal of the solvent to produce the photoresist layer. The photoresist layer can have a thickness of, for example, from 1 nm to 200 nm, more particularly 5 nm to 150 nm, and even more particularly 5 nm to 100 nm. The photoresist layer can be given a post-apply bake at a temperature of, for example, from 50&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C., more particularly 50&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. The post-apply bake can conducted for a period of, for example, a least 1 sec, 1 sec to 1 hour, more particularly 1 sec to 5 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Pattern-wise exposure of the photoresist layer can be accomplished using radiation of various types, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation of wavelengths from 400 nm to 300 nm, deep ultraviolet (DUV) radiation of wavelengths from 300 nm to 150 nm, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation of wavelengths from 120 nm to 4 nm, electron-beam (e-beam) radiation, x-ray radiation, and combinations of the foregoing. DUV and EUV exposures employ a specific mask to generate patterns in the positive tone photoresist layer. E-beam lithography (e.g., projection e-beam lithography, e-beam direct write lithography, parallel e-beam lithography), writes patterns directly to the photoresist. Exemplary radiation sources include single wavelength and/or narrow band radiation sources, specific mercury emission lines, lasers, and particle beam emitters. For less stringent conditions, a broad band multiple wavelength source can be used. More specifically, the radiation wavelength for the pattern-wise exposure can be, for example, 405 nm, 313 nm, 334 nm, 257 nm, 248 nm, 193 nm, 157 nm, 126 nm, or 13.5 nm. Even more particularly, the wavelength of the radiation for the pattern-wise exposure can be less than 250 nm. In an embodiment, the radiation wavelength is selected from the group consisting of 248 nm, 193 nm, 157 nm, and 13.5 nm. In another embodiment, the photoresist is exposed pattern-wise through a photomask using deep ultraviolet radiation with a wavelength less than 250 nm. In particular, the pattern-wise exposure can be accomplished by 193 nm immersion lithography using water as an immersion fluid. In order to accommodate patterning by 193 nm water immersion lithography, a protective topcoat layer can be applied to the surface of the photoresist prior to exposure via immersion lithography. Preferably, the topcoat layer is base-soluble and is removed during the photoresist development step by the alkaline photoresist developer. Alternatively, the photoresist can comprise surface-active components that control the surface properties of the coated photoresist and limit the extraction of photoresist components into the immersion fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The pattern-wise exposed photoresist layer can be developed in an aqueous alkaline developer due to the polarity increase induced by the exposure. An optional post-exposure bake can further amplify the formation of polar functional groups in the exposed areas. In the case of a positive-tone photoresist, development with an aqueous alkaline developer selectively removes the exposed photoresist leaving a patterned photoresist comprising non-exposed photoresist disposed on a first surface of the substrate. A second area of the surface of the substrate has substantially no photoresist disposed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">An optional post-development bake can further tailor the properties of the patterned photoresist. The bake can be conducted at a temperature from 50&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C. for a period of a least 1 sec, more particularly from 1 sec to 1 hour.</p>

The ratio of the polymers, molecular weight of the individual polymers in the blend, and the presence of other additional components in the blend can be used to adjust the compatibility of the polymers in the polymer blend. Temperature, coating conditions, the treated photoresist topography, treated photoresist surface properties, and substrate surface properties can also affect the phase segregation of the polymers. As used herein, an &#x201c;immiscible polymer&#x201d; is a polymer that in a polymer blend composition phase segregates on a properly prepared substrate surface under appropriate process conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Examples of suitable polymers for the two or more immiscible polymers include: cellulose, poly(acrylamide), polyethyleneimine, poly(acrylic acid), poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline), poly(ethyleneoxide), and poly(vinyl alcohol), novolac resins, cresol resins, poly(hydroxystyrene), poly(acrylic acid), poly(styrene sulfonic acid), poly(vinyl phosphoric acid), poly(vinyl sulfonic acid), poly(2-sulfoethyl methacrylate), poly(2-sulfopropyldimethyl-3-methacrylamide), poly(1,1,1-trifluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)-2-hydroxy-pentan-4-yl methacrylate), fluoroalcohol-based polymers, poly(2-ethyl-trifluoromethane sulfonamide methacrylate), acidic sulfonamide polymers, poly(styrene), poly(hydroxyadamantyl methacrylate), poly(isobornyl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(vinyl naphthalene), polysiloxanes, polymethylsilsesquioxanes, polycarbosilanes, poly(vinyl ferrocene), poly(acylonitrile), poly(caprolactone), poly(lactide), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(gamma-butyrolactone methacrylate), poly(tetrahydrofuranyl methacrylate), poly(tetrahydropyranyl methacrylate), poly(allyl amine), poly(4-aminostyrene), poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate), polyethyleneneimine, poly(N-methylvinylamine), poly(vinyl pyridine), poly(isoprene), poly(butadiene), poly(nobornene), poly(ethylene), poly(propylene), poly(1,1,1-trifluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)-2-hydroxy-pentan-4-yl methacrylate), fluoroalcohol-based polymers, poly(2-ethyl-trifluoromethanesulfonamide methacrylate), acidic fluoro sulfonamide polymers, poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate), poly(hexafluoroisopropyl methacrylate), poly(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorostyrene), and substituted derivatives thereof. The two or more immiscible polymers can be selected such that each polymer is immiscible with each other polymer in the blend.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The SA material can comprise a block copolymer, or blends of block copolymers and other polymers. In an embodiment, the block copolymer consists essentially of a first polymeric block component A and a second polymeric block component B that are immiscible with each other. Typically, homopolymers of suitable immiscible block components form a blend that exhibits multiple glass transition temperatures representing each homopolymer phase. Preferably, one of the components A and B is selectively removable without having to remove the other, so as to form isolated and orderly arranged structural units composed of the un-removed component, or a continuous structural layer containing isolated and orderly arranged cavities formed after the removable component has been removed. Alternatively, the components A and B can simply have different electrical, optical, and/or magnetic properties, so that the ordered patterns composed of such components A and B can be used for fabricating different device structures.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The block copolymer can comprise blocks comprising one or more monomers, and at least two blocks in the block copolymer are compositionally, structurally, or both compositionally and structurally non-identical. Suitable block copolymers include di-block copolymers, tri-block copolymers, or multi-block copolymers, any of which can be used in conjunction with DSA to further enhance the resolution. The blocks themselves can be homopolymers, or copolymers, including terpolymers. The SA material can comprise an amphiphilic organic block copolymer, amphiphilic inorganic block copolymer, organic di-block copolymer, organic multi-block copolymer, inorganic-containing di-block copolymer, inorganic-containing multi-block copolymer, linear block copolymer, star block copolymer, dendritic block copolymer, hyperbranched block copolymer, graft block copolymer, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing block copolymers. In an embodiment, the block copolymer is a di-block copolymer. Combining a suitable tri-block copolymer and a chemical pre-pattern can, for example, be used to quadruple the spatial frequency of the chemical pre-pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The block components can in general be any appropriate microdomain-forming block that can be copolymerized with, attached to, or self-organize with another dissimilar block. Blocks can be derived from different polymerizable monomers, where the blocks can include but are not limited to: polyolefins including polydienes, polyethers including poly(alkylene oxides) such as poly(ethylene oxide), poly(propylene oxide), poly(butylene oxide), or random or block copolymers of these; poly((meth)acrylates), polystyrenes, polyesters, polyorganosiloxanes, polyorganogermanes, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In an embodiment, the blocks of the block copolymer comprise repeating units derived from C<sub>2-30 </sub>olefinic monomers, (meth)acrylate monomers derived from C<sub>1-30 </sub>alcohols, inorganic-containing monomers including those based on Fe, Si, Ge, Sn, Al, Ti, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing monomers. In a specific embodiment, exemplary monomers for use in the blocks can include, as the C<sub>2-30 </sub>olefinic monomers, ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, vinyl acetate, dihydropyran, norbornene, maleic anhydride, styrene, 4-hydroxy styrene, 4-acetoxy styrene, 4-methylstyrene, or alpha-methylstyrene; and can include as (meth)acrylate monomers, methyl(meth)acrylate, ethyl(meth)acrylate, n-propyl(meth)acrylate, isopropyl(meth)acrylate, n-butyl(meth)acrylate, isobutyl(meth)acrylate, n-pentyl(meth)acrylate, isopentyl(meth)acrylate, neopentyl(meth)acrylate, n-hexyl(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl(meth)acrylate, isobornyl(meth)acrylate, or hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate. Combinations of two or more of these monomers can be used. Exemplary blocks that are homopolymers include blocks prepared using styrene (i.e., polystyrene blocks), or (meth)acrylate homopolymer blocks such as poly(methyl methacrylate); exemplary random blocks include, for example, blocks of styrene and methyl methacrylate (e.g., poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate)), randomly copolymerized; and an exemplary alternating copolymer block can include blocks of styrene and maleic anhydride which is known to form a styrene-maleic anhydride dyad repeating structure due to the inability of maleic anhydride to homopolymerize under most conditions (e.g., poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride)) where &#x201c;-alt-&#x201d; indicates alternating polymeric blocks. It is understood that such blocks are exemplary and should not be considered to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">More specific di-block or tri-block copolymers include poly(styrene-b-vinyl pyridine) (PS-b-PVP), poly(styrene-b-butadiene) (PS-b-PBD), poly(styrene-b-isoprene) (PS-b-PI), poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA), poly(styrene-b-alkenyl aromatics), poly(isoprene-b-ethylene oxide) (PI-b-PEO), poly(styrene-b-(ethylene-propylene)), poly(ethylene oxide-b-caprolactone), poly(butadiene-b-ethylene oxide) (PBD-b-PEO), poly(styrene-b-t-butyl (meth)acrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate-b-t-butyl methacrylate), poly(ethylene oxide-b-propylene oxide), poly(styrene-b-tetrahydrofuran), poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane) (PS-b-PDMS), poly(styrene-b-ferrocenyldimethylsilane) (PS-b-PFS), poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PI-b-PEO), poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PI-b-PMMA), poly(styrene-b-ferrocenyldimethylsilane-b-isoprene) (PS-b-PFS-b-PI), or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing block copolymers.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The polymer blend or block copolymers can also comprise inorganic constituents, including inorganic-containing homopolymers, copolymers, and block copolymers, and inorganic-containing monomers, molecules, and additives. These include, for example, those based on silicon, germanium, iron, titanium, aluminum, or the like.

<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The block copolymer desirably has an overall molecular weight and polydispersity amenable to further processing. In an embodiment, the block copolymer has a weight-averaged molecular weight (M<sub>w</sub>) of 3,000 to 200,000 g/mol. Similarly, the block copolymer has a number averaged molecular weight (M<sub>n</sub>) of 1,000 to 80,000. The block copolymer can also have a polydispersity (M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub>) of 1.01 to 6, and is not particularly limited thereto. Molecular weight, both M<sub>w </sub>and M<sub>n</sub>, can be determined by, for example, gel permeation chromatography using a universal calibration method, calibrated to polystyrene standards.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The block copolymers can be prepared by methods previously described in the art, including living polymerization techniques such as atom transfer free radical polymerization (ATRP) nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization, ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and living cationic or living anionic polymerizations.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In a particular embodiment, the block copolymer used for forming the self-assembled periodic patterns is PS-b-PMMA. The PS and the PMMA blocks in such a PS-b-PMMA block copolymer can have a total (summed over all blocks) number average molecular weight (M<sub>n</sub>) ranging from about 5 kg/mol to about 300 kg/mol, with a total number average molecular weight from about 10 kg/mol to about 100 kg/mole being more typical. Each block can have a M<sub>n </sub>of 1 to 299 kg/mol, more particularly 1 to 99 kg/mol.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The morphology (shape, dimension, orientation) of the self-assembled domains from block copolymer thin films is a function of composition (material, molecular weight, volume ratio of different blocks), annealing condition (temperature, environment, annealing time), the interface properties (polymer-air interface, polymer substrate interface) as well as the defined geometry (film thickness, topography of the confinement). Therefore, by adjusting one or more parameters, the morphology can be adjusted to the need of specific applications.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In order to form the self-assembled periodic patterns, the block copolymer can be first dissolved in a suitable solvent system to form a block copolymer solution, which can then be applied onto the treated layer, thereby forming a thin block-copolymer layer disposed thereon. Optionally annealing the thin block-copolymer layer can aid in the self-assembly process of the polymeric block components.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In order to form the self-assembled periodic patterns, the block copolymer can be first dissolved in a suitable solvent system to form a block copolymer solution, which can then be applied onto the pre-pattern, thereby forming a thin block-copolymer layer disposed thereon. Optionally annealing the thin block-copolymer layer can aid in the self-assembly process of the polymeric block components.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In an embodiment, the SA material comprises at least one block copolymer. The organic solvent should fully dissolve all SA materials, but should not dissolve the treated photoresist. In an embodiment, the solvent used to develop the exposed photoresist layer is the solvent used to form the solution of the SA material. Non-limiting exemplary solvents for the SA material include substituted or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons, substituted or unsubstituted aromatic ethers, substituted or unsubstituted aromatic alcohols, saturated monoalcohols comprising 5 to 20 carbons, glycols, ketones, glycol mono ethers, and glycol mono ether esters. In an embodiment, the SA solvent is a glycol, glycol mono ether, or glycol mono ether ester, or combinations thereof. More specific solvents for the SA material include but are not limited to toluene, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA), propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME), 4-methyl-2-pentanol, n-butyl acetate, anisole, acetone, and combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the solvent for the SA material is ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA), propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME), 4-methyl-2-pentanol, or combinations thereof. The solution of SA material can have a concentration ranging from about 0.1 weight percent (wt. %) to about 5 wt. % SA material based on total weight of the solution. More particularly, the SA material is dissolved at a concentration ranging from about 0.5 wt. % to about 2.5 wt. %. In an embodiment, the solution of SA material comprises about 0.5 wt. % to about 2.5 wt. % PS-b-PMMA block copolymer dissolved in anisole. The solution of SA material can optionally further comprise additional block copolymers, homopolymers, random copolymers, surfactants, and photoacid generators, photobase generators, thermal acid generators, thermal base generators, acid amplifiers, and photodestrucible bases.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The solution of SA material is cast on the pre-pattern followed by removal of the solvent, thereby forming a thin film of the SA material (i.e., SA layer) disposed on one or more surfaces of the pre-pattern. In an embodiment, the SA material is substantially disposed in the trench of the treated layer. The solution of SA material can be cast by any suitable technique, including, but not limited to: spin coating, roll coating, spraying, ink coating, dip coating, and the like. Additional annealing (including thermal annealing, thermal gradient annealing, solvent vapor annealing or other gradient field) can be optionally employed to remove defects in the SA layer and/or promote self-assembly of the SA material. More particularly, the SA layer comprising a block copolymer is thermally annealed at a temperature that is above the glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) of the block copolymer but below the decomposition or degradation temperature (T<sub>d</sub>) of the block copolymer. The thermal annealing step can be carried out at an annealing temperature of about 100&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C. The thermal annealing can be performed for a period of more than 0 hours to about 100 hours, and more particularly for about 1 hour to about 15 hours. The thermally annealed block copolymer self-assembles to form ordered domains whose orientation can be perpendicular to the underlying surface plane. In general, the SA material can have a thickness of 100 to 10000 angstroms, more particularly 200 to 5000 angstroms, and even more particularly 300 to 3000 angstroms.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The difference in the etch rates between two ordered domain regions of the block copolymer allows the generation of additional patterns. Selectively removing by etching, solvent or other means, at least one self-assembled domain, creates a nano-scale relief pattern comprising, for example, a pattern of holes that can be transferred into the underlying substrate. Types of etching include any common etching applied in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, for example, dry-etching such as plasma etching, or wet-etching using selective solvents. Typically, dry etching processes are employed for etching at sub-50 nm dimensions. Prior to this pattern development/pattern transfer, the self-assembled layer of SA material can be optionally chemically modified to improve properties necessary for pattern transfer, such as etch resistance or mechanical properties.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Also disclosed is the layered structure formed by the above-described method. In an embodiment, the layered structure is a semiconductor device. The method can be used to form layered structures comprising metal wiring lines, holes for contacts or vias, insulation sections (e.g., damascene trenches or shallow trench isolation), and trenches for capacitor structures suitable for the design of integrated circuit devices. The method is especially useful in the context of creating patterned layers of oxides, nitrides or polysilicon.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The above-described methods permit a photoresist feature width of from 1 to 1000 nm, from 1 to 500 nm, from 1 to 300 nm, from 1 to 200 nm, from 1 to 150 nm, or more particularly from 1 to 100 nm. When the SA material is a block copolymer or blend containing a block copolymer, the method advantageously allows domain patterns having reduced feature width and increased periodicity relative to the photoresist feature. In this case, the domain feature width can be from 1 to 50 nm, from 1 to 30 nm, or more particularly from 1 to 20 nm. When the SA material is an immiscible polymer blend, the method permits a photoresist feature size less than 200 nm, more particularly less than 150 nm, and even more particularly less than 100 nm. The domain feature sizes tend to be larger, ranging from 1 to 500 nm, from 1 to 250 nm, or more particularly from 1 to 150 nm. Secondly, the method advantageously utilizes a self-assembled material with reduced feature size and an increased the periodicity relative to the pre-pattern.</p>

<p id="p-0183" num="0182">A two-layer substrate was prepared having a 780 &#x212b; thick anti-reflection layer (ARC-29A, Brewer Science) disposed on a silicon wafer. A 150 nm thick layer of a commercial 193 nm positive-tone photoresist (JSR AR2746J) was disposed on the anti-reflection layer, forming a three-layered structure. The structure was given a post-apply bake (PAB) at 130&#xb0; C. for 60 sec. A 5&#xd7;25 dose array of open field exposures was imaged on the material using a 193 nm mini-stepper (0.6 numerical aperture (NA)). A post-exposure bake (PEB) was performed at 125&#xb0; C. for 60 sec and the thickness measured using a Nanometrics Nanospec 6100. The photoresist pattern was then developed 30 seconds in one of the following developers: anisole, ethylene glycol (EG), 0.26N tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH, OPTIYIELD&#xae; CD from Fuji Film), PGMEA, or anisole: PGMEA (9:1). After development, the wafer was spin dried and the residual thickness was again measured. The selectivity of each developer in dissolving exposed and/or non-exposed photoresist is shown graphically in the contrast development curves of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> (thickness of developed layer plotted against exposure dosage in mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>for each developer). The procedure was repeated for another commercial 193 nm positive-tone chemically-amplified photoresist, JSR AR2928JN. The results are graphically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> (118 nm thickness, PAB: 120&#xb0; C. for 60 sec, PEB: 115&#xb0; C. for 60 sec, 30 sec development). The curve with the small open square in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> is the latent film thickness after exposure and post-exposure bake. In each case, anisole preferentially dissolved the non-exposed photoresist, TMAH dissolved the exposed photoresist, and EG dissolved neither exposed nor non-exposed photoresist.

<p id="p-0184" num="0183">A 50 nm thick layer of a commercial 193 nm positive-tone photoresist (JSR AR2928JN) was disposed on a substrate comprising a silicon wafer bottom layer and a 780 angstrom thick anti-reflection layer of ARC-29A (Brewer Science), as described for Example 1. The photoresist layer was baked at 120&#xb0; C. for 60 sec. The photoresist layer was then exposed using a 193 nm immersion interference tool (IBM NEMO) using water as an immersion fluid, baked at 115&#xb0; C. for 60 sec, and developed for 60 sec using 0.26N TMAH developer (OPTIYIELD&#xae; CD from Fuji FILM). The resulting 90 nm pitch patterned photoresist layer was then flood exposed (100 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) using a 254 nm Hg/Xe arc lamp (Ushio America UXM-5001MA) and baked at 115&#xb0; C. for 60 sec. A SEM micrograph of the resulting treated photoresist layer (brighter lines are the treated photoresist) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. A 1 wt % solution of an orientation control material, based on total weight of the solution, was prepared by dissolving hydroxyl-terminated poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate) random copolymer, P(S-r-MMA), M<sub>n</sub>=9 kg/mol, in anisole. The ratio of styrene: methyl methacrylate in the random copolymer was 58:42 by mole. The solution was spin coated onto the treated photoresist layer, the solvent was removed, and the resulting structure was baked at 200&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes to ensure adequate grafting of the P(S-r-MMA) brush layer to the surface of the anti-reflection layer in the trench areas of the treated photoresist layer. The treated photoresist was then removed using a rinse of 0.26N TMAH developer. Any non-grafted hydroxyl-terminated poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate) was then removed by a rinse with anisole. The SEM micrograph of the resulting chemical pre-pattern after the TMAH and anisole rinse is shown in the upper portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, where the brighter lines are the residual treated photoresist material and the darker regions comprise hydroxyl-terminated poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate) grafted to the underlying ARC. An anisole solution was prepared containing 1.5 wt %, based on total weight of the solution, of a blend of two block copolymers, PS-b-PMMA (37k-37k) and PS-b-PMMA (18k-18k). The dry blend weight ratio of PS-b-PMMA (37k-37k):PS-b-PMMA (18k-18k) was 85:15. The polymer blend solution was spin coated on the chemical pre-pattern and was annealed at 240&#xb0; C. for 5 minutes. Some of the PMMA domains locate on the pinning regions (which are comprised of the residual treated photoresist material) of the chemical pre-pattern, forming a domain pattern of alternating perpendicularly-oriented lamellar PS/PMMA domains aligned to the pinning region. In order to visualize the resulting domain morphology, the self-assembled PMMA domains were selectively removed using an oxygen reactive ion etch process (O<sub>2</sub>-dscum program for 10 sec). A SEM micrograph of the resulting frequency tripling line-space pattern formed by the PS domains is shown in the lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> (brighter lines).

The photoresist layer was given a post-apply bake at 120&#xb0; C. for 60 sec. A layer of JSR TCX-041 topcoat was spun cast on the photoresist and subjected to a post-apply bake at 90&#xb0; C. for 60 sec. The resulting film stack was exposed using an 193 nm immersion stepper (ASML TwinScan1700i) using water as an immersion fluid. The exposed photoresist layer was given a post-expose bake at 115&#xb0; C. for 60 sec. Afterwards, the photoresist was developed for 60 sec using 0.26N TMAH developer (which also removes the topcoat) to produce a 100 nm pitch patterned photoresist. After development, the photoresist was trimmed (e.g., the width of the photoresist lines was decreased). In the trim process, a layer of JSR TCX-041 was applied over the pattern, baked at 130&#xb0; C., and removed using 0.26N TMAH developer. The patterned photoresist was then flood exposed (169 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) using a 254 nm Hg/Xe arc lamp (Ushio America UXM-5001MA), baked at 115&#xb0; C. for 60 sec, and baked at 170&#xb0; C. for 5 minutes, forming a treated patterned photoresist layer.

The solution was spin coated onto the treated photoresist pattern and the resulting structure was baked at 200&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes to ensure adequate grafting of the P(S-r-MMA) to the surface of the anti-reflection layer. The treated photoresist was removed using a rinse of 0.26N TMAH developer to reveal surfaces of the anti-reflection layer. The excess hydroxyl-terminated P(S-r-MMA) was removed by rinsing with anisole, forming a chemical pre-pattern wherein the revealed surfaces of the anti-reflection layer (and any residual photoresist thereon) serve as pinning regions for block copolymer self-assembly. An anisole solution was prepared containing 1.5 wt % PS-b-PMMA (22k-22k) block copolymer, based on total weight of the solution. The block copolymer solution was spin coated on the chemical pre-pattern and annealed at 240&#xb0; C. for 5 minutes.

<p id="p-0187" num="0186">As in Examples 3 and 4, a photoresist pattern having a grating pattern with a pitch of 100 nm was made by pattern-wise exposing a layer of 193 nm photoresist layer (ARX 2928JN from JSR) disposed on an anti-reflection coating (A940 from Shin Etsu) as described for Example 1. The photoresist layer was given a post-apply bake at 120&#xb0; C. for 60 sec. A layer of JSR TCX-041 topcoat was spun cast on the photoresist and subjected to a post-apply bake at 90&#xb0; C. for 60 sec. The resulting film stack was exposed using an 193 nm immersion stepper (ASML TwinScan1700i) using water as an immersion fluid.

In the trim process, a layer of JSR TCX-041 was applied over the pattern, baked at 130&#xb0; C., and removed using 0.26N TMAH developer. Then the initial layer was given a flood exposure of 130 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>using a broad band DUV source (a Hg/Xe 500W short-arc lamp (UXM-501MA) from Ushio America) to deprotect the photoresist, followed by a post-exposure bake at 115&#xb0; C. for 1 minute. An SEM image of the resulting photoresist pattern is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> (brighter lines). The photoresist pattern was then baked at 170&#xb0; C. (one sample for 1 minute, another sample for 5 minutes), followed by a rinse with PGMEA. For the sample baked at 170&#xb0; C. for 1 minute, almost no treated photoresist pattern was observed after the PGMEA rinse (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, SEM image). For the second sample baked for 5 minutes at 170&#xb0; C., the treated photoresist pattern was intact after the PGMEA rinse (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, SEM image), allowing for a subsequent layer of materials to be cast on the treated photoresist. An orientation control layer comprising P(S-r-EDCPMA) random copolymer and thermal acid generator (TAG) (weight ratio of P(S-r-EDCPMA): TAG=10:1), was then cast from PGMEA on the second sample of treated photoresist pattern. The P(S-r-EDCPMA) was cross-linked by baking at 130&#xb0; C. for 1 minute and baking at 200&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes to form a topographical prepattern for graphoepitaxy. A 1.5 wt % anisole solution, was prepared of block copolymer PS-b-PMMA (22k-22k), based on total weight of the solution. The solution was spin coated on the topographical prepattern. The resulting SA layer was baked at 240&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes to generate self-assembled lamellar PMMA domains perpendicularly aligned to the treated photoresist pattern as well as the long axis of the grating, as shown in AFM height image (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>) and AFM phase image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0188" num="0187">This experimental series demonstrates the effect of bake temperature for two different bake times (1 min and 5 min) on the solubility in PGMEA of a flood exposed photoresist layer. A solution comprising a 193 nm photoresist (JSR AR2928JN) was spin coated (3000 rpm for 30 s) onto a substrate having an anti-reflection top layer coating (780 angstroms of ARC-29A, Brewer Science) on silicon. This is designated the &#x201c;As-cast&#x201d; layer. The thickness of the photoresist layer was measured at 125 points across the &#x201c;As-cast&#x201d; wafer. The photoresist layer was given a post-application bake (PAB) for 60 sec at 120&#xb0; C. The photoresist layer was then flood exposed with a deep-UV mercury arc lamp (USHIO UXM-501MA) at a dose of 150 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. The exposed wafer was then given a post-exposure bake (PEB) for 60 sec at 115&#xb0; C. The wafer was then subjected to a thermal gradient heat treatment at temperatures ranging from 50&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. for 1 minute or 5 minutes using a thermal gradient hotplate. The thickness of the photoresist layer was measured at 125 points across the &#x201c;After Bake&#x201d; wafer and each thickness measurement was correlated with the corresponding temperature of the thermal gradient. The photoresist thickness decreases in roughly a linear relationship to the bake temperature likely due to evaporation (i.e., outgas sing) of deprotection fragments and densification of the photoresist film. The results are shown as curves labeled &#x201c;As-cast&#x201d; and &#x201c;After Bake&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>. An &#x201c;After Bake&#x201d; wafer was developed in PGMEA for 60 sec and the remaining photoresist thickness was re-measured in the same manner. The results are shown as &#x201c;PGMEA development&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>. The results show that at a gradient temperature of about 180&#xb0; C. and a heating time of 1 minute, no additional thickness loss in the photoresist layer is observed as a result of the PGMEA development process, which indicates that the film has become fully insoluble in PGMEA. Similarly, the exposed photoresist layer became insoluble in PGMEA at a treatment temperature of about 170&#xb0; C. to 175&#xb0; C. for a heating time of 5 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The above results show that the solubility of the exposed photoresist layer can be significantly reduced using a thermal treatment of 1 and 5 minutes at temperatures ranging from 90&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. Appropriate temperature/time conditions can be determined where no thickness change occurs between the &#x201c;After Bake&#x201d; (circles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>) and &#x201c;PGMEA development&#x201d; curves (triangles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>). The optimal thermal treatment conditions for temperature and heating time can depend on a number of factors including the exposure dosage, the photoresist formulation, and the irradiation type (spectral bandwidth and intensity). In general, a thermal treatment at higher temperature allows for shorter heating times, whereas lower temperatures require longer heating times. These data are for bulk films and actual conditions necessary to render the photoresist insoluble in PGMEA may vary depending upon the size of the features being patterned; however, the thermal treatment results of Example 6 have, in general, been found to be predictive of the PGMEA solubility of a developed photoresist layer which has been given a post-development exposure and/or similar thermal treatment.</p>

The photoresist layer was given a post-apply bake at 120&#xb0; C. for 60 sec. A layer of JSR TCX-041 topcoat was spun cast on the photoresist and subjected to a post-apply bake at 90&#xb0; C. for 60 sec. The resulting film stack was exposed using an 193 nm immersion stepper (ASML TwinScan1700i) using water as an immersion fluid.

After development, the photoresist was trimmed (e.g., the width of the photoresist lines was decreased). In the trim process, a layer of JSR TCX-041 was applied over the pattern, baked at 130&#xb0; C., and removed using 0.26N TMAH developer. The resulting 100 nm pitch patterned photoresist was then flood exposed (50 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) using a 254 nm Hg/Xe arc lamp (Ushio America UXM-5001MA). After exposure, samples were subjected to three different thermal treatments to determine the impact of the thermal treatment conditions on the resulting profiles of hardened photoresist patterns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> shows the SEM plane-view and cross-section images of a sample subjected to a 60 sec bake at 115&#xb0; C.

The averaged line width is 29.5 nm and the line-edge roughness is 3.0 nm. The relatively small difference in lateral dimension as well as vertical dimension among three samples indicates that almost no photoresist reflow is induced by the bake conditions associated with the thermal treatment (185&#xb0; C./120 s) and the formation of the bound orientation control layer (190&#xb0; C./120 s).</p>
