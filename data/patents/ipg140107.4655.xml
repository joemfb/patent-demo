<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter disclosed herein relates to the controlled generation of X-rays and, more specifically, to the generation of X-rays from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In non-invasive imaging systems, X-ray tubes are used in both X-ray systems and computer tomography (CT) systems as a source of X-ray radiation. The radiation is emitted in response to control signals during inspection, examination or imaging sequences. Typically, the X-ray tube includes a cathode and an anode. An emitter within the cathode may emit a stream of electrons in response to heat and electric field resulting from an applied electrical current via the thermionic effect. The anode may include a target that is impacted by the stream of electrons. The target may, as a result, produce X-ray radiation and heat.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In such imaging systems, the radiation spans a subject of interest, such as a patient, baggage, or an article of manufacture, and a portion of the radiation impacts a detector or a photographic plate where the image data is collected. In some X-ray systems the photographic plate is then developed to produce an image which may be used by a quality control technician, security personnel, a radiologist or attending physician for diagnostic purposes. In digital X-ray systems a photodetector produces signals representative of the amount or intensity of radiation impacting discrete elements of a detector surface. The signals may then be processed to generate an image that may be displayed for review. In CT systems a detector array, including a series of detector elements, produces similar signals through various positions as a gantry is rotated about a patient. In certain configurations, a series of these signals may be used to generate a volumetric image. Generally, the quality of the volumetric image is dependent on the ability of the X-ray source and the X-ray detector to quickly generate data as they are rotated on the gantry.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In other systems, such as systems for oncological radiation treatment, a source of X-rays may be used to provide ionizing radiation to a tissue of interest of a patient. In some radiation treatment configurations, the source may also include an X-ray tube. X-ray tubes used for radiation treatment purposes may also include a thermionic emitter and a target anode that generates X-rays, such as described above. Such X-ray tubes or sources may also include one or more collimation features for focusing or limiting emitted X-rays into a beam of a desired size or shape. The X-ray source may be displaced about (e.g., rotated about) the tissue of interest while maintaining the focus of the X-ray beam on the tissue of interest, which allows a substantially constant X-ray flux to be provided to the tissue of interest while minimizing X-ray exposure to outlying tissue.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, an X-ray generating apparatus is provided. The X-ray generating apparatus includes an electron beam source configured to generate an electron beam along an electron beam path, an electron beam target capable of generating X-rays when impacted by the electron beam, and a housing having an electrically conductive material and configured to support the electron beam source and target. The apparatus also includes a magnetic coil disposed outside of the housing capable of being switched between generating at least a first magnetic field and a second magnetic field upon receiving voltage pulses, the first magnetic field having a first magnitude and the second magnetic field having a second magnitude, wherein the first magnetic field and the second magnetic field are configured to manipulate at least one of a size, a shape, or a direction of the electron beam along the electron beam path. The apparatus further includes a controller configured to apply the voltage pulses to the magnetic coil, wherein the voltage pulses include a first pulse configured to cause the coil to switch from generating the first magnetic field to generating the second magnetic field, and a second pulse configured to disrupt an eddy current generated in the electrically conductive material when switching between the first magnetic field and the second magnetic field.</p>

The system also includes an electrically conductive component disposed proximate the coil. The system further includes a controller configured to apply the voltage pulses to the coil. The voltage pulses include a first pulse configured to cause the coil to switch from generating the first magnetic flux to generating the second magnetic flux and a second pulse configured to disrupt an eddy current generated in the electrically conductive component when switching between the first magnetic flux and the second magnetic flux.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the imaging and treatment modalities mentioned above, the quality of the examination/treatment procedures performed using X-ray producing sources may depend at least on the ability of the X-ray source to produce X-rays in a controlled manner. In certain X-ray sources, the electron beam that impacts the target anode to produce X-rays may be steered using a magnetic field applied across the X-ray source. Steering the electron beam may allow the X-ray source to emit X-rays from substantially constant or varying positions on the anode. Additionally or alternatively, the X-ray source may be focused by a quadrupole magnetic field. Such focusing may enable the focusing of variable energy X-ray emission, which can be useful for imaging different types of tissue and for providing varying levels of energy (e.g., in radiation treatment procedures). In configurations where it is desirable to emit the X-rays from varying positions on the anode and/or to focus the electron beam at different energies, the time delay between position changes or focal point maintenance may depend at least partially on the ability of the magnetic field that steers and/or focuses the electron beam to change its magnitude (e.g., orientation) and to interact with the electron beam. Unfortunately, rapidly changing the magnitude of the steering and/or focusing magnetic field may generate an eddy current in housings of X-ray sources that include a conductive material. Such eddy currents may reduce the magnitude of the desired steering magnetic field within the conductive housing of the X-ray tube during the transition between magnitudes, resulting in incorrect focusing of the electron beam on the anode target. In such situations, X-rays may be emitted from an undesired position on the anode, or at an undesired energy.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The approaches described herein provide embodiments for mitigating the effect of eddy currents generated within the conductive housing of X-ray sources when magnetic coils, such as those mentioned above, are pulsed (e.g., by applying a voltage pulse across the coils). The coils may be pulsed to change the magnitude (e.g., orientation) of a generated magnetic field. Therefore, the present embodiments are applicable to any change in magnetic field that results in the generation of an eddy current, such as in dipole magnetic field changes, quadrupole magnetic field changes, and the like. Specifically, certain of the disclosed embodiments provide systems and methods for performing voltage-based eddy current mitigation pulses. The mitigation pulses are applied to one or more magnetic coils to reduce or eliminate the eddy current generated from changing the magnitude (e.g., switching the orientation) of the magnetic field. Therefore, certain of the disclosed embodiments may allow faster magnetic field penetration of the X-ray source housing, faster steering of the electron beam, faster focusing, and, therefore, faster image production/tissue treatment and better image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">During the operation of certain of the X-ray tube embodiments disclosed herein, a first voltage pulse is applied to a magnetic coil. The first pulse changes the magnitude of the magnetic field generated by the coil, for example to change the direction of an electron beam focused towards an anode, or to maintain the focal area on the anode at different electron beam energies. The first pulse produces a first eddy current in the conductive housing of the X-ray tube, which may hinder the ability of the magnetic field to steer the electron beam. That is, the first eddy current reduces the magnetic field strength within the conductive housing during the transition. A second pulse that applies a voltage in an opposite direction compared to the first pulse is then applied to the coil. The second pulse may be different in amplitude and/or duration compared to the first pulse, and generates a second eddy current having an opposite orientation compared to the first eddy current. The second eddy current may reduce or altogether cancel the first eddy current, which enables faster penetration of the desired magnetic field through the housing. Such faster penetration enables faster steering of the electron beam. In certain embodiments, the second pulse may reduce the strength of the steering magnetic field across the housing. Accordingly, a third pulse that applies a voltage in substantially the same direction as the first pulse is then applied to the coil to maintain the magnetic field at a desired strength, or to return the magnetic field to the desired strength. The third pulse may be applied prior to or subsequent to the application of the second pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The approaches described herein may be used in the contexts mentioned above, which can include non-invasive imaging, surgical navigation, radiation treatment, and so on. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> provide non-limiting examples of systems that may include and/or perform the disclosed pulses for mitigating eddy currents. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a general system <b>10</b> that uses an X-ray radiation source <b>12</b> for performing a quality control, security, imaging, surgical, and/or treatment procedure. The X-ray radiation source <b>12</b> may include one or more X-ray tubes each having features for producing X-ray radiation from more than one perspective and/or more than one energy in a controlled manner as noted above. The X-ray source <b>12</b> therefore produces one or more streams of X-ray radiation <b>14</b> that are directed towards a subject of interest <b>16</b>. The subject of interest may be baggage, cargo, an article of manufacture, a tissue of interest, and/or a patient. The X-ray radiation <b>14</b> is directed towards the subject of interest <b>16</b>, where the X-ray radiation is attenuated to produce a beam of attenuated X-rays <b>18</b>. The beam of attenuated X-rays <b>18</b> are captured by a feedback generation system <b>20</b> to produce signals representative of an image, or other information that may be useful for performing the procedure. Again, the data produced at the feedback generation system <b>20</b> may include data produced from receiving X-rays from a variety of positions and/or energies from each X-ray tube of the source <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A system controller <b>22</b> commands operation of the system <b>10</b> to execute examination, treatment and/or calibration protocols and to process the feedback. With respect to the X-ray source <b>12</b>, the system controller <b>22</b> furnishes power, focal spot location, control signals and so forth, for the X-ray examination sequences. For example, the system controller <b>22</b> may furnish focal spot locations with respect to X-ray emissions from various perspectives by the X-ray source <b>12</b>. Additionally, in some embodiments, the feedback generation system <b>20</b> is coupled to the system controller <b>22</b>, which commands acquisition of the feedback. As will be discussed in further detail below, the system controller <b>22</b> may also control operation of a positioning system <b>24</b> that is used to move components of the system <b>10</b> and/or the subject <b>16</b>. The system controller <b>22</b> may include signal processing circuitry and associated memory circuitry. In such embodiments, the memory circuitry may store programs, routines, and/or encoded algorithms executed by the system controller <b>22</b> to operate the system <b>10</b>, including the X-ray source <b>12</b>, and to process the feedback acquired by the generation system <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, the system controller <b>22</b> may be implemented as all or part of a processor-based system such as a general purpose or application-specific computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The source <b>12</b> may be controlled by an X-ray controller <b>26</b> contained within or otherwise connected to the system controller <b>22</b>. The X-ray controller <b>26</b> is configured to provide power and timing signals to the source <b>12</b>. In some embodiments the X-ray controller <b>26</b> may be configured to selectively activate the source <b>12</b> such that tubes or emitters at different locations within the system <b>10</b> may be operated in synchrony with one another or independent of one another. Moreover, in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, the X-ray controller <b>26</b> may provide control signals to magnetic coils proximate the X-ray tubes within the system <b>10</b>. The control signals may cause each tube to emit X-ray radiation from multiple perspectives and/or multiple energies. The control signals may further be configured to mitigate eddy currents that are formed in the X-ray tube housing as a result of the magnetic steering/switching process noted above. According to the approaches described herein, the X-ray controller <b>26</b> may modulate activation or operation of one, two, three, four, or more magnetic coils disposed proximate each X-ray tube of the source <b>12</b>. Therefore, the X-ray controller <b>26</b> may modulate the magnitude of a dipole and/or a quadrupole magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As noted above, the X-ray source <b>12</b>, which is controlled by the X-ray source controller <b>26</b>, is positioned about the subject of interest <b>16</b> by the positioning system <b>24</b>. The positioning system <b>24</b>, as illustrated, is also connected to the feedback generation system <b>20</b>. However, in other embodiments, the positioning system <b>24</b> may not be connected to the feedback generation system <b>20</b>. The positioning system <b>24</b> may displace either or both of the X-ray source <b>12</b> and the feedback generation system <b>20</b> to allow the source <b>12</b> to image or treat the subject of interest <b>16</b> from a variety of positions. As an example, in a radiation treatment procedure, the positioning system <b>24</b> may substantially continuously displace the X-ray source <b>12</b> about the subject of interest <b>16</b>, which may be a tissue of interest, while maintaining the focus of the X-ray radiation <b>14</b> generated from multiple perspectives on the tissue of interest. In this way, the tissue of interest is provided with a substantially continuous flux of X-ray radiation while X-ray exposure to outlying tissues is minimized. Moreover, while some systems may not produce diagnostic images of the patient, the feedback generation system <b>20</b> may generate data relating to the position of the X-ray source <b>12</b> or other features, such as a surgical tool, relative to the tissue of interest, for example as an image and/or map. Such data may enable a clinician or other healthcare provider to ensure that the X-ray radiation <b>14</b> and/or the surgical tool is properly located with respect to the tissue of interest. The feedback generation system <b>20</b> may include a detector, such as a diode array, or a system that monitors the position of the source <b>12</b> and/or surgical tool relative to the subject of interest <b>16</b>. Indeed, in certain embodiments, the feedback generation system <b>20</b> may include a detector and position-monitoring features that also provide feedback to the positioning system <b>24</b> either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To provide feedback to features of the system <b>10</b> that are not directly connected to or associated with the feedback generation system <b>20</b>, the feedback generation system <b>20</b> provides data signals to a feedback acquisition and processing system <b>28</b>. The feedback acquisition and processing system <b>28</b> may include features for receiving feedback from the feedback generation system <b>20</b>, as well as processing features for manipulating the received data. For example, the processing features may include signal converters (e.g., A/D converters), device drivers, processing chips, memory, and so on. In some embodiments, the feedback acquisition and processing system <b>28</b> converts analog signals received from the feedback generation system <b>20</b> into digital signals that can be further processed by one or more processing features (e.g., a computer-based processor) of the system controller <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One embodiment of system <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a block diagram of an embodiment of an X-ray imaging system <b>30</b>, such as a CT or other radiographic imaging system. The system <b>30</b> includes an imaging system controller <b>32</b> for acquiring and processing projection data. The imaging system controller <b>32</b> also includes or is otherwise operatively connected to the X-ray source controller <b>26</b>, which operates as described above. The X-ray source controller <b>26</b>, as noted above, may also be operatively connected to one or more magnetic coils that are disposed proximate an X-ray tube of the source <b>12</b>. The controller <b>26</b> may provide a series of voltage pulses to the magnetic coil to steer an electron beam produced within the X-ray tube, which allows X-rays to be generated from more than one area on a target anode of the X-ray tube.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Generally, the system <b>30</b> situates a patient <b>34</b> such that the X-ray beam <b>14</b> produced by the source <b>12</b> is attenuated by the patient <b>34</b> (e.g., various anatomies of interest) to produce the attenuated X-rays <b>18</b>, which may be received by a photographic plate or a digital detector <b>36</b>. In certain embodiments, the patient <b>34</b> may be situated in this manner using a C-arm or gantry <b>38</b>, which is controllably connected to the imaging system controller <b>32</b>. Generally, the imaging system controller <b>32</b> may synchronize certain imaging sequence parameters, such as emissions from the source <b>12</b> with rotation rates of the source <b>12</b> and detector <b>36</b> about the gantry.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The data that is generated at the detector <b>36</b> upon receiving the attenuated X-rays <b>18</b> is provided, as above, to processing features such as the illustrated data acquisition system (DAS) <b>40</b>. The DAS <b>40</b> generally converts the data received from the detector <b>36</b> into a signal that can be processed at the imaging system controller <b>32</b> (or other computer based processor). As an example, the detector <b>36</b> may generate analog data signals upon receiving the attenuated X-rays <b>18</b>, and the DAS <b>40</b> may convert the analog data signals to digital data signals for processing at the imaging system controller <b>32</b>. The data may be used to generate one or more volumetric images of various anatomies within the patient <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Again, the quality of the produced volumetric images may at least partially depend on the ability of the X-ray source <b>12</b> to emit X-rays in a controlled manner. For example, the ability of the X-ray source <b>12</b> to quickly (e.g., on a milli- or microsecond timescale) change between emitting X-rays from different perspectives may enable the formation of volumetric images having fewer artifacts and higher resolution than images produced when such functionality is not present. Indeed, the imaging system controller <b>32</b> and the X-ray source controller <b>22</b> may be configured to generate multiple sets (e.g., a first set and a second set) of X-rays within about 1 to about 1000 microseconds of one another. In this way, a stereoscopic image may be formed using pairs of images (or pairs of projection data). Indeed, the present embodiments may enable X-ray emission from multiple perspectives within about 1 to about 750 microseconds, about 1 to about 500 microseconds, about 10 to about 250 microseconds, about 10 to about 100 microseconds, or about 20 to about 50 microseconds of one another.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With the foregoing in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrate an embodiment of an X-ray tube <b>50</b> that includes features configured to provide X-ray emission from multiple perspectives and/or multiple energies. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the X-ray tube <b>50</b> as emitting X-ray radiation from a first perspective and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the X-ray tube <b>50</b> as emitting X-ray radiation from a second perspective. However, it should be noted that the acts described herein are also applicable in the context of a quadrupole magnetic field configured to change the size (e.g., diameter) of an electron beam. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, The X-ray tube <b>50</b> includes an anode assembly <b>52</b> and a cathode assembly <b>54</b>. The X-ray tube <b>50</b> is supported by the anode and cathode assemblies within a conductive or non-conductive housing <b>56</b> defining an area of relatively low pressure (e.g., a vacuum) compared to ambient. For example, the housing <b>56</b> may include glass, ceramics, stainless steel, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The anode assembly <b>52</b> generally includes rotational features <b>58</b> for causing rotation of an anode <b>60</b> during operation. The rotational features <b>58</b> may include a rotor and stator <b>59</b> for driving rotation, as well as a bearing <b>62</b> that supports the anode <b>60</b> in rotation. The bearing <b>62</b> may be a ball bearing, spiral groove bearing, or similar bearing. In general, the bearing <b>62</b> includes a stationary portion <b>64</b> and a rotary portion <b>66</b> to which the anode <b>60</b> is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The front portion of the anode <b>60</b> is formed as a target disc having a target or focal surface <b>68</b> formed thereon. In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, the focal surface <b>68</b> is struck by an electron beam <b>70</b> at varying distances from a central area <b>72</b> of the anode <b>60</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the focal surface <b>68</b> may be considered to be struck at a first position <b>74</b>, while being struck in a second position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The anode <b>60</b> may be manufactured of any metal or composite, such as tungsten, molybdenum, copper, or any material that contributes to Bremsstrahlung (i.e., deceleration radiation) when bombarded with electrons. The anode's surface material is typically selected to have a relatively high refractory value so as to withstand the heat generated by electrons impacting the anode <b>60</b>. The space between the cathode assembly <b>54</b> and the anode <b>60</b> may be evacuated in order to minimize electron collisions with other atoms and to maximize an electric potential between the cathode and anode. Moreover, such evacuation may advantageously allow a magnetic flux to quickly interact with (i.e., steer) the electron beam <b>70</b>. In some X-ray tubes, voltages in excess of 20 kV are created between the cathode assembly <b>54</b> and the anode <b>60</b>, causing electrons emitted by the cathode assembly <b>54</b> to become attracted to the anode <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Control signals are conveyed to cathode <b>76</b> via leads <b>78</b> from a controller <b>80</b>, such as the X-ray controller <b>26</b>. The control signals cause a thermionic filament of the cathode <b>76</b> to heat, which produces the electron beam <b>70</b>. The beam <b>70</b> strikes the focal surface <b>68</b> at the first position <b>74</b>, which results in the generation of a first set of X-ray radiation <b>82</b>, which is diverted out of an X-ray aperture <b>84</b> of the X-ray tube <b>50</b>. The first set of X-ray radiation <b>82</b> may be considered to have a respective first direction, or, in other contexts, a respective first energy, as is discussed in detail below. The direction, orientation, and/or energy of the first set of X-ray radiation <b>82</b> may be affected by the angle, placement, focal diameter, and/or energy at which the electron beam <b>70</b> impacts the focal surface <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Some or all of these parameters may be affected and/or controlled by a magnetic field <b>86</b> within the housing <b>56</b>, which is produced outside of the X-ray tube <b>50</b>. For example, first and second magnets <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, which are disposed outside of the X-ray tube housing <b>56</b>, may produce the magnetic field <b>86</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second magnets <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> are connected in series to a controller <b>92</b>. The controller <b>92</b> provides electric current to the first and second magnets <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, and may include or be a part of the system controller <b>22</b> or the X-ray controller <b>26</b> discussed above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. As the electrical current is passed through the first and second magnets <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, respective first and second magnetic fields <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> are produced. The first and second magnetic fields <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> both contribute to the dipole magnetic field <b>86</b> within the housing <b>56</b>. In other embodiments, such as when a magnetic focusing system that uses a quadrupole field is included, the first and second magnetic fields <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> may contribute to the quadrupole field. Indeed, in such embodiments, multiple magnets may be employed that are each capable of generating at least respective first and second magnetic fields. The respective magnetic fields may contribute to the overall quadrupole field.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition to providing the electric current, the controller <b>92</b> may also provide voltage pulses to the magnets <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> to change the magnitude of the magnetic field <b>86</b>. In certain embodiments, voltage pulses may also be provided to the first and second magnets <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> to mitigate eddy currents that may be produced in the housing <b>56</b> when the magnitude of the magnetic field <b>86</b> is changed. The voltage pulses used to mitigate the eddy currents produced within the housing <b>56</b> may enable the production of a desired X-ray flux, X-ray energy, and/or X-ray direction. In the context of the present embodiment, such a mitigation pulse may allow the X-ray radiation to be emitted from a first perspective and/or focused at a first energy.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, the first set of X-ray radiation <b>82</b>, which may form all or a portion of the X-ray beam <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, exits the tube <b>50</b> and is generally directed towards a subject of interest from the first perspective (or at the first energy) during examination and/or treatment procedures. As noted above, switching the magnitude (e.g., strength, orientation) of an externally generated magnetic field that is applied across the tube <b>50</b> may vary the direction or focusing strength at which X-rays are emitted from the X-ray tube <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the X-ray tube <b>50</b> after changing the orientation of the magnetic field <b>86</b>. The embodiment of the X-ray tube <b>50</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes the same features as the X-ray tube <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, the magnetic field <b>86</b> has changed its orientation due to a change in magnitude as a result of a voltage pulse sequence provided to the magnets <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>. Specifically, the voltage pulse sequence has resulted in each of the magnets <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> producing third and fourth magnetic fields <b>97</b>, <b>98</b>, which produces a second magnetic field <b>100</b>. The second magnetic field <b>100</b> steers an electron beam <b>102</b> in a different direction than the electron beam <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Therefore, the electron beam <b>102</b> impacts a second position <b>104</b> of the focal area <b>68</b> to produce a second set of X-rays <b>106</b>. The second set of X-rays <b>106</b> is emitted in a second direction from the X-ray tube <b>50</b>, and may traverse the subject of interest <b>16</b> along a path that is offset from the path of the first set of X-rays <b>82</b>. In some embodiments, respective first and second projection data generated from the first and second sets of X-rays <b>84</b>, <b>94</b> may be used to generate a stereoscopic and/or volumetric image.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In embodiments in which the housing <b>56</b> includes one or more conductive materials, changing the magnitude of the magnetic field may induce an eddy current in the housing <b>56</b>. The eddy current reduces the magnitude of the desired field during the transient between the original magnitude and the desired magnitude. As noted above, such a reduction in the magnetic field can cause a slow and incomplete transition between producing the electron beam <b>70</b> and producing the electron beam <b>102</b>. In embodiments in which the eddy current is not accounted for, an electron beam having an intermediate directionality and/or diameter will be emitted from the cathode assembly <b>54</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> illustrate the process of switching from producing the electron beam <b>70</b> to producing the electron beam <b>102</b>. While the present approaches are described in the context of switching from electron beam <b>70</b> to electron beam <b>102</b>, it should be noted that the embodiments disclosed herein are applicable to any process where a magnetic field is changed from one magnitude to another, such as to change the electron beam from one directionality and/or diameter to another. Therefore, it should be noted that the present discussion is also applicable to a magnitude adjustment of a quadrupole field, or any such adjustment of a magnetic flux.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an X-ray source during the process of producing X-rays is illustrated. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a portion <b>100</b> of the X-ray tube <b>50</b> disposed between the first and second magnets <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> having respective first and second coils <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, which may include one or more superconductive magnetic materials. As illustrated, the combined magnetic field <b>86</b> generated by passing current through the coils <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> is configured to steer an electron beam <b>114</b> produced at a cathode area <b>116</b>. Steering the electron beam <b>114</b> generates the first electron beam <b>70</b>, which is directed towards the first position <b>74</b> of the anode focal area <b>68</b> as noted above.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Proximate the portion <b>100</b> of the X-ray source <b>100</b> is illustrated a series of plots corresponding to a current <b>118</b>, a magnetic field <b>120</b>, and a voltage <b>122</b> corresponding to the operation of the portion <b>100</b> of the source. It should be noted, with regard to the plot of voltage <b>122</b>, that in embodiments where the current and/or field (i.e., plots <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>) is constant, the voltage applied is minimal but not zero. Specifically, the voltage applied may be equal to R*I where R is the parasitic resistance of the coil and electronics connected to the coil, and I is the desired current through the coil. The position of each of the plots will be discussed as they relate to the process performed by the portion <b>100</b> of the source. To produce the first combined magnetic field <b>86</b>, a first current <b>124</b> is passed through the first and second magnetic coils <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. The first and second magnetic coils <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> each generate respective local magnetic fluxes <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, as noted above. The local magnetic fluxes each combine to generate the first combined magnetic field <b>86</b>, which has a first orientation as represented by arrows. The orientation of the first combined magnetic field <b>86</b> defines the direction in which the electron beam <b>114</b> is steered.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To steer the electron beam <b>114</b> in another direction, different parameters are applied to the first and second magnetic coils <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically illustrates the transition between generating electron beam <b>70</b> and electron beam <b>102</b>. To change the magnitude (i.e., orientation) of the combined magnetic field <b>86</b> and steer the electron beam <b>114</b> in a different direction, a first voltage pulse <b>130</b> is applied across the first and second magnetic coils <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>. During the first voltage pulse <b>130</b>, the current is changed from one value to another to adjust the magnitude of the applied magnetic field. In the illustrated embodiment, the first current <b>118</b> is reduced to a second current <b>132</b>. Because the reduction from the first to the second current <b>132</b> results in a sign change of the current, the current is carried in an opposite direction across the coils <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. As a result of the second current <b>132</b>, the first and second magnetic coils <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> produce second respective magnetic fluxes <b>97</b>, <b>98</b>, which combine to form a second combined magnetic field <b>138</b> in the X-ray tube <b>50</b> in a direction opposite from the first magnetic field <b>86</b>. The amplitude and duration of the first voltage pulse <b>130</b> may correspond directly to a desired field strength <b>140</b> (i.e., the field strength corresponding to field <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the second combined magnetic field <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For the purposes of the present discussion, the housing <b>56</b> includes conductive materials. Therefore, an eddy current <b>142</b> may be generated upon applying the first voltage pulse <b>130</b>. The eddy current <b>142</b> may produce a local magnetic field <b>144</b> that acts against and reduces the magnitude of the second combined magnetic field <b>138</b>. This reduction is represented by a curve <b>146</b> in the plot <b>120</b> between the first combined magnetic field <b>86</b> and the desired value <b>140</b> of the second combined magnetic field <b>138</b>. Indeed, the local magnetic field <b>144</b> produced by the eddy current <b>142</b> slows the transition from the first combined magnetic field <b>86</b> to the desired value of the second magnetic field <b>140</b>. Therefore, the actual value of the second magnetic field <b>138</b> is represented as a value falling within the curve <b>146</b> of plot <b>120</b>. Accordingly, rather than steering the electron beam <b>114</b> to generate electron beam <b>102</b>, the electron beam <b>114</b> is steered to produce an electron beam <b>148</b> that impacts an intermediate position <b>150</b> between the first and second positions <b>74</b>, <b>104</b> of the focal area <b>68</b>. As noted above, such inadvertent steering may be undesirable, as X-rays may be emitted from the tube <b>50</b> in an undesired direction, and the target <b>68</b> may overheat.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As the second current <b>132</b> is maintained through the magnetic coils <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, the eddy current <b>142</b> reduces and eventually has substantially no effect on the second magnetic field <b>138</b>. Therefore, the electron beam <b>114</b> is steered by the second combined magnetic field <b>138</b> having the desired field value <b>140</b>, which corresponds to the field <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to generate the electron beam <b>102</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In accordance with presently contemplated embodiments, the reduction of the eddy current <b>142</b> may be accelerated by the application of a second voltage pulse <b>152</b> having an opposite orientation compared to the first voltage pulse <b>130</b>. The amplitude and duration of the second voltage pulse <b>152</b> may depend on the magnitude of the eddy current <b>142</b>, the desired magnetic field value <b>140</b>, and the temperature of the X-ray tube <b>50</b>, among other factors. As illustrated in the plots <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, the steering, focusing, and direction-changing process may be repeated by applying voltage pulses of varying direction across the coils <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Indeed, the steering, focusing, and direction-changing process may be repeated a number of times during an imaging process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a process flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a method <b>160</b> for controlling the directionality and/or focus of an electron beam within an X-ray tube. Therefore, method <b>160</b> may be considered to be a process for changing the direction of an electron beam with a dipole or quadrupole field, or compressing/decompressing an electron beam with a quadrupole field. A suitably configured controller, such as the system controllers <b>22</b>, <b>32</b>, and/or the X-ray source controller <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, and/or controller <b>80</b> may perform the method <b>160</b> in conjunction with the hardware (e.g., X-ray tubes and magnetic coils) discussed herein. The method <b>160</b> begins with the emission of an electron beam (block <b>162</b>), such as the electron beam <b>108</b>. Again, as noted above, control signals may be provided from an X-ray source controller to a cathode assembly. The control signals direct the cathode assembly to produce the electron beam.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In many instances, a magnetic field will already be applied to the X-ray source by one or more magnetic coils prior to the first emission of the electron beam. Therefore, the electron beam will be steered (e.g., in a first direction) or compressed (e.g., to a first section) using such a first magnetic field (block <b>164</b>). As noted above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-7</figref>, the directionality and/or diameter of the electron beam depends at least on the magnitude of the applied magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Once a desired amount of X-rays have been produced by bombardment of the anode <b>60</b> with the electron beam, the direction, energy, and/or compression of the electron beam may be changed. That is, in accordance with the disclosed approaches, a series of pulses are applied to the magnetic coils to change the magnitude of the first magnetic field and to offset the deleterious effects of the eddy current that is generated from changing the magnitude of the magnetic field (block <b>166</b>). The acts represented by block <b>166</b> will be discussed in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Substantially concomitantly and/or subsequent to performing the acts of block <b>166</b>, the electron beam is steered in a second direction using the second magnetic field (block <b>168</b>). The second magnetic field is produced by changing the magnitude of the first magnetic field in block <b>166</b>. Upon generating a desired amount of X-rays in the second direction, a query is performed to determine if the imaging sequence is complete (query <b>170</b>). In embodiments in which the imaging sequence is complete, electron beam emission may cease (block <b>172</b>). However, in embodiments in which the imaging sequence is not complete, it may be desirable to again change the direction and/or compression of the electron beam.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, the magnitude of the magnetic field is changed using a voltage pulse. Additionally, a pulse sequence is performed to account for the eddy current produced by changing the magnitude of the magnetic field (block <b>166</b>). The method then cycles back to the acts represented by block <b>164</b>, and the method <b>160</b> then performs the acts described above. Generally, it may be desirable to perform the method <b>160</b> such that X-rays are generated from the first and second directions and/or energies to generate pairs of projection. However, in certain embodiments, the method <b>160</b> may cease after performing the acts represented by block <b>164</b>. In such embodiments, unpaired sets of projection data may be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</figref> are process flow diagrams illustrating embodiments of the acts represented by block <b>166</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</figref> illustrate methods <b>166</b><i>a </i>and <b>166</b><i>b</i>, respectively, for changing the magnitude of a magnetic field and mitigating the eddy current that results. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> each illustrate a plot <b>176</b> of voltage pulses and a plot <b>178</b> of the current into the magnets (e.g., magnetic coils <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>) as the methods <b>166</b><i>a </i>and <b>166</b><i>b </i>are performed, respectively. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the method <b>166</b><i>a </i>begins with applying a magnetic field adjustment voltage pulse (block <b>180</b>). The magnetic field adjustment voltage pulse changes the magnitude of the current flowing through the magnetic coils, which causes the magnitude of the magnetic field generated by the coils to change. In embodiments where the magnitude change is sufficient to change the direction in which the current is flowed through the magnets, the directional orientation of the field may change. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the plot <b>176</b> of the voltage illustrates the magnetic field adjustment pulse as a first pulse <b>182</b> that is applied at a positive amplitude <b>184</b> and for a certain duration <b>186</b>. As noted above, the amplitude <b>184</b> and the duration <b>186</b> may correspond to the desired field strength of the second magnetic field. More specifically, an area defined by the amplitude <b>184</b> multiplied by the duration <b>186</b> may relate to (e.g., correspond or be proportional to) the desired field strength.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, upon applying the first voltage pulse <b>182</b>, the current applied to the magnets rises beginning with the application of the first voltage pulse. Again, as noted above, a desired field strength may not be reached at the end of the duration <b>186</b> of the first pulse <b>182</b>, even though the current through the magnets is at a desired level <b>188</b>. This time delay may result from the limitations of the hardware (e.g., the response of the magnetic coils), as well as the eddy current <b>142</b> discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, upon applying the magnetic field adjustment pulse (block <b>180</b>), as noted above, an eddy current may be produced. To offset the effects of the eddy current, a reverse pulse technique (block <b>190</b>) is performed. The reverse pulse technique (block <b>190</b>) includes at least a pair of voltage pulses, one of which has a reverse amplitude compared to the other or others. As illustrated, the reverse pulse technique of block <b>190</b> includes the step of applying a compensation pulse (block <b>192</b>) for an eddy current mitigation pulse that will be applied. For example, the eddy current mitigation pulse may act to reduce the field strength of the magnetic field. The compensation pulse temporarily increases the field strength of the magnetic field beyond the desired field strength, and allows the eddy current mitigation pulse to reduce the field strength of the magnetic field down to the desired field strength <b>188</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the compensation pulse may be considered to be a second pulse <b>194</b>, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the voltage plot <b>176</b> illustrates the second pulse <b>194</b> as having a duration <b>198</b> and an amplitude <b>196</b>. In certain embodiments, an area defined by the product of the duration <b>198</b> and the amplitude <b>196</b> of the second pulse <b>194</b> may be substantially the same as an area of a third pulse <b>200</b>, which is the eddy current mitigation pulse. The second pulse <b>194</b> increases the current through the magnets beyond the desired current <b>188</b> to a maximum current <b>202</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the maximum current <b>202</b> is reached at the end of the duration <b>198</b> of the second pulse <b>194</b>. The third pulse <b>200</b> reduces current to the desired current <b>188</b>, which results in the production of the desired magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in the illustrated embodiment, after the compensation pulse has been applied to the magnetic coils (block <b>192</b>), the eddy current mitigation pulse is applied to the magnetic coils (block <b>204</b>). The eddy current mitigation pulse is a voltage pulse applied in an opposite direction across the magnetic coils compared to the magnetic field adjustment pulse and the compensation pulse. The eddy current mitigation pulse, as noted above, produces another eddy current to offset the effects of the eddy current generated by performing the acts represented by block <b>180</b>. Upon application of the eddy current mitigation pulse (block <b>204</b>), the method <b>166</b><i>a </i>is completed and the method <b>160</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is continued.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the end of a duration <b>206</b> of the third pulse corresponds to the reduction of the current level to the desired current level <b>188</b>, which eventually produces the desired magnetic field strength. Because the third pulse <b>200</b> is intended to mitigate the eddy currents generated by changing the magnetic field magnitude, it may be desirable to monitor the eddy currents so produced, or one or more parameters indicative of the eddy currents. Indeed, an area defined by the duration <b>206</b> and an amplitude <b>208</b> of the third pulse <b>200</b> may be determined based upon the eddy currents generated by the acts represented by block <b>180</b>, as well as the temperature of the X-ray tube. Therefore, using various modeling techniques, the duration <b>206</b> and the amplitude <b>208</b> of the third pulse <b>200</b> may be determined using a transfer function, a look-up table, or the like, based upon the measured eddy currents and/or the measured parameters. As noted above, the area defined by the duration <b>206</b> and the amplitude <b>208</b> of the third pulse <b>200</b> determines the area of the second pulse <b>194</b>, which prepares the magnetic field for a reduction in field strength.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Rather than performing a preliminary compensation pulse as discussed above, it may be desirable to compensate the magnetic field strength after it has been reduced by the eddy current mitigation pulse. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a process flow diagram of an embodiment of such a method <b>166</b><i>b </i>for changing the magnetic field magnitude and mitigating produced eddy currents. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates plots of voltage <b>210</b> and current through the magnets <b>212</b> as the method <b>166</b><i>b </i>is performed. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, at the onset of the method <b>166</b><i>b</i>, the magnetic field adjustment pulse is applied (block <b>180</b>). The magnetic field adjustment pulse, as discussed above, may be considered to be the first voltage pulse <b>182</b>, which produces an eddy current.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After performing the acts represented by block <b>180</b>, a reverse pulse technique may be performed (block <b>214</b>) to offset the eddy current that is produced by the rapid change in magnetic field magnitude. The reverse pulse technique <b>214</b> of method <b>166</b><i>b </i>begins with the application of the eddy current mitigation pulse (block <b>216</b>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the eddy current mitigation pulse is a second voltage pulse <b>218</b> that reduces the current to a local minimum value <b>220</b> and, therefore, reduces the magnetic field strength. In this case, the eddy current mitigation pulse has an area defined by an amplitude <b>222</b> and duration <b>224</b> that is related to the eddy current produced by the acts of block <b>180</b> plus additional eddy currents in the reversed direction that may be cancelled by the pulse <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, upon application of the eddy current mitigation pulse (block <b>216</b>), a compensation pulse is applied (block <b>226</b>). The compensation pulse, which is represented as a third pulse <b>228</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, has an area defined by the product of an amplitude <b>230</b> and a duration <b>232</b>. In some embodiments, the area may be proportional to the area of the second pulse <b>218</b>. The third pulse <b>228</b> acts to return the field strength of the magnetic field to the desired field strength by increasing the current to the desired level <b>188</b>. Moreover, the third pulse <b>228</b> cancels the eddy currents created by the second pulse <b>224</b>. Upon application of the compensation pulse (block <b>226</b>) the eddy currents will be completely compensated</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As noted above, the present approaches may enable an electron beam within an X-ray tube to be rapidly steered between directions and/or rapidly compressed/decompressed. Specifically, the strength of a magnetic field may be rapidly changed by increasing the speed of field penetration through the housing of the X-ray tube. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a plot <b>240</b> of experimental data obtained using the reverse pulse methods described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> using different timing as well as data obtained without using such methods.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Specifically, plot <b>240</b> illustrates a plot of magnetic field strength within an X-ray tube versus time as the orientation of the magnetic field is changed upon applying a suitable reversal voltage pulse. A line <b>242</b> may be considered a baseline, where the described reverse pulse methods are not performed. A line <b>244</b> corresponds to experimental data obtained by performing the method <b>166</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> wherein the pulses are performed for a duration of 2 microseconds each, and a line <b>246</b> corresponds to experimental data obtained by performing the same but with a duration of 1.8 microseconds per pulse. As illustrated, the line <b>242</b> shows that the magnetic field increases after the application of the magnetic field reversal pulse (e.g., pulse <b>182</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 12</figref>). As a result of unabated eddy currents, the line <b>242</b> fails to reach a desired field strength <b>248</b> before the beginning of a new pulse sequence. Such insufficient field strength may result in an undesired steering or compression/decompression of an electron beam.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Conversely, the line <b>244</b> surpasses the desired field strength <b>248</b> and is subsequently reduced to the desired field strength <b>248</b>. As noted above, the method <b>166</b><i>a </i>includes the application of a pair of pulses to the steering magnetic coils. The pair of pulses includes a preparation pulse that increases the field strength beyond the desired field strength <b>248</b>, followed by a disruption pulse that reduces the field strength to the desired field strength <b>248</b> and also disrupts eddy currents formed by the reversal pulse, as discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. The effectiveness of the method <b>166</b><i>a </i>is demonstrated in that line <b>244</b> reaches and maintains a level at the desired field strength <b>248</b> approximately 10 microseconds after the magnetic field reverse pulse is initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a similar manner, the line <b>246</b> that corresponds to the method <b>166</b><i>a </i>but with a slightly different duration for each pulse reduces the field strength below the desired field strength <b>248</b>, and subsequently increases the field strength to the desired field strength. The timing shown here, as noted above, includes the application of a pair of pulses to the steering magnetic coils. The effectiveness of one approach described herein is demonstrated in that line <b>246</b> reaches and maintains a level at the desired field strength <b>248</b> approximately 10 microseconds after the magnetic field reverse pulse is initiated. Indeed, the present approaches enable a desired field strength to be reached and maintained within about 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, or 10 microseconds after the onset of a magnetic field reversal pulse.</p>
