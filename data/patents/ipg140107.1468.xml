<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a wave forming apparatus for water rides or water features of the type provided in water-based amusement parks, water features in ornamental gardens, and the like, and is particularly concerned with an apparatus for forming a barreling wave, also known as a tubing or tunneling wave, which can support surfing activities or produce an attractive visual effect in a fountain or the like, including a fastener system therefore.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Naturally occurring waves occur in the ocean and also in rivers. These waves are of various types, such as moving waves which may be of various shapes, including tubular and other breaking waves. Surfers are constantly searching for good surfing waves, such as tubular breaking waves and standing waves. There are only a few locations in the world where such waves are formed naturally on a consistent basis. Thus, there have been many attempts in the past to create artificial waves of various types for surfing in controlled environments such as water parks. In some cases, a sheet flow of water is directed over an inclined surface of the desired wave shape. Therefore, rather than creating a stand-alone wave in the water, the inclined surface defines the wave shape and the rider surfs on a thin sheet of water flowing over the surface. In some cases, the inclined surface is shaped to cause a tubular form wave. Sheet flow wave simulating devices have some disadvantages. For example, since these systems create a fast moving, thin sheet of water, they produce a surfing experience different than a real standing wave.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In other wave forming devices, a wave is actually simulated in the water itself, rather than being defined by a surface over which a thin sheet of water flows. U.S. Pat. No. 6,019,547 to Hill describes a wave forming apparatus which attempts to simulate natural antidune formations in order to create waves. A water-shaping aerofoil is disposed within a flume containing a flow of water, and a wave-forming ramp is positioned downstream of the aerofoil structure. Various apparatus and methods for forming deep water standing waves are described in the following United States patents and applications, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,629,803, 6,932,541 and 7,326,001, as well as U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/550,239 for a Barreling Wave Generating Apparatus and Method, filed Oct. 17, 2006; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/958,785 for a Wave Forming Apparatus and Method, filed Dec. 18, 2007; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/356,666 for an Adjustable Barreling Wave Generating Apparatus and Method, filed Jan. 21, 2009.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Water flowing against a wave foil can tend to backup near the base of the foil, due to the sudden discontinuity in the water flow direction. A smoothly-curved foil that blends tangent to the floor of the flume would tend to minimize the discontinuity in water flow and thus minimize the backup. However, in practice such smoothly-curved foils are typically prohibitively difficult and expensive to form. Also, with water flowing over and around the foil, the fasteners that hold the foil to the flume tend to corrode, making removal and replacement of foils difficult. Such fasteners can also present underwater hazards for users of the devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Among other things, provided is a wave generating apparatus, comprising: a channel having a bottom, the channel adapted to direct a flow of water into contact with a bed form located in the channel, the channel and the bed form together being adapted to generate a barrel-shaped wave capable of supporting a person surfing when the flow of water contacts the bed form, the bed form comprising: a base section adjacent to the bottom of the channel, the base section having a substantially flat first exterior profile defining a first included angle between the first exterior profile and the bottom of the channel; and an upper section above the base section, the upper section having a substantially flat second exterior profile defining a second included angle between the second exterior profile and the bottom of the channel; wherein the second included angle is greater than the first included angle. In various embodiments, the first included angle may be less than forty-five degrees, while the second included angle may be greater than thirty degrees. In various embodiments, the bed form may comprise a barreling wave forming foil, may be substantially symmetrical about a vertical axis, may be located in the channel obliquely to the direction of water flow in the channel, and may be removably attached to the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also provided is a twistlock fastener system for a wave generating apparatus, comprising: a channel having a bottom, the channel adapted to direct a flow of water into contact with a bed form located at least partially adjacent the bottom of the channel, the channel and the bed form together being adapted to generate a barrel-shaped wave capable of supporting a person surfing when the flow of water contacts the bed form; the channel defining a first non-round through-hole through the bottom of the channel; the bed form defining a second non-round through-hole through the portion of the bed form adjacent the bottom of the channel, the first and second non-round through-holes being adapted to be substantially the same size, shape, orientation, and axially aligned with each other when the bed form is located at least partially adjacent the bottom of the channel. As part of the twistlock fastener system, provided is a twistlock fastener comprising: a longitudinally-extending main body having a top portion and a bottom portion and a non-round cross-section adapted to fit into, but not be able to rotate within, the first and second non-round through-holes when the bed form is located at least partially adjacent the bottom of the channel; a top locking member rotationally attached to the top portion of the main body; a bottom locking member rotationally attached to the bottom portion of the main body; the top locking member and the bottom locking member adapted to rotate relative to the main body from a first rotational position to a second rotational position when the main body is located in the first and second non-round through-holes. In this twistlock fastener system, the bed form is adapted to be locked to the channel when the main body is located in the first and second non-round through-holes and the top locking member and the bottom locking member are rotated relative to the main body from the first rotational position to the second rotational position; and the bed form is further adapted to be unlocked from the channel when the main body is located in the first and second non-round through-holes and the top locking member and the bottom locking member are rotated relative to the main body from the second rotational position to the first rotational position. In various embodiments, the top and/or bottom locking members are rotationally attached to the top portion of the main body at least in part by at least one of: a screw; a bolt; a rivet; a shaft; and/or a retaining clip. The first and second non-round through-holes may comprise an oblong shape, as may the non-round cross-section of the main body of the a twistlock fastener, which may be formed at least in part from stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A method of is also provided for removably fastening a bed form to a channel in a wave generating apparatus, comprising the steps of: providing a twistlock fastener system as described above; locating the bed form at least partially adjacent the bottom of the channel such that the first and second non-round through-holes are adjacent and aligned; and locking the bed form to the channel by locating the main body of the twistlock fastener in the first and second non-round through-holes and rotating the top locking member and the bottom locking member relative to the main body from the first rotational position to the second rotational position. Additional steps may include unlocking the bed form from the channel by rotating the top locking member and the bottom locking member relative to the main body from the second rotational position to the first rotational position. In various embodiments the method may further comprise any of the steps of: removing the twistlock fastener from the first and second non-round through-holes; moving the bed form relative to the channel; and/or removing the bed form from the channel. In fastening the bed form to the channel, the top and/or bottom locking members may in various embodiments be rotated relative to the main body by an angle between about forty-five degrees to about one hundred thirty five degrees.</p>

No. 11/958,785 filed Dec. 18, 2007, all of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A bed form, such as one or more barreling wave forming foils <b>105</b> may be mounted in the channel <b>110</b> at, for instance, an oblique angle to the flow direction of water along the channel <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The example bed form <b>105</b> of this embodiment may be of hollow construction entirely or in part, and may include additional features not shown, such as vents for providing additional flow paths for the water, as described in various applications incorporated herein by reference. Bed forms may alternatively be of solid or any other appropriate construction.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the exterior profile of a bed form, such as one or more barreling wave forming foils <b>105</b>, may be provided with a base section <b>210</b> adjacent to the wave forming channel <b>110</b>, the exterior profile of the base section <b>210</b> defining a first, non-abrupt angle to the direction of flow of water in the wave forming channel <b>110</b>. In some embodiments the first angle is, for example, less than forty-five degrees (i.e., the first angle is the included angle between the exterior profile of the base section <b>210</b> and the floor of the water forming channel <b>110</b>). The base section <b>210</b> may extend upward and transition to an upper section <b>205</b> at a second, steeper angle to the direction of water flow. In some embodiments the second angle is, for example, greater than thirty degrees (i.e., the second angle is the included angle between the exterior profile of the upper section <b>205</b> and the floor of the water forming channel <b>110</b>). The exterior profiles of the base section <b>210</b> and/or the upper section <b>205</b> may define at least in part nominally flat panels. Nominally flat panels may not be perfectly flat due to manufacturing and assembly variations. The base section <b>210</b> and/or the upper section <b>205</b> may be formed on one or more leading sides of the bed form (i.e., the side(s) facing toward the oncoming flow of water), and/or on one or more trailing sides of the bed form (i.e., the side(s) facing away from the oncoming flow of water). Alternatively, as in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a base section <b>210</b> and an upper section <b>205</b> may be formed on all sides of the bed form <b>105</b> that interface with the wave forming channel <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a cross-section of an example bed form, namely a barreling wave forming foil <b>105</b>, including a base section <b>210</b> with an exterior profile defining a first, non-abrupt angle to the direction of flow of water in the wave forming channel <b>110</b>, where the base section <b>210</b> transitions to an upper section <b>205</b> that forms an exterior profile defining a second, steeper angle to the direction of water flow (that direction being generally from left to right, or right to left, in the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the base section <b>210</b> is formed from a first structure and the upper section <b>205</b> is formed from a second structure connected to the first structure. The first structure may be permanently connected to the second structure, for instance by welding, or may be removably connected to the second structure, for instance by fasteners (not shown). In the example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the bed form, a barreling wave forming foil <b>105</b>, is at least approximately symmetrical about a central vertical axis. In other embodiments, the bed form may be non-symmetrical about a central vertical axis, such that the leading and trailing sides of the bed form have base sections <b>210</b> with exterior profiles that define different included angles to the wave forming channel <b>110</b>, and/or such that the leading and trailing sides of the bed form have upper sections <b>205</b> with exterior profiles that define different included angles to the wave forming channel <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In other embodiments, bed forms may be provided with additional sections with exterior profiles that define additional angles to the wave forming channel <b>110</b>, for instance three sections with three increasingly steep angles (not shown). Providing a bed form with multiple sections that define an exterior profile that increases in steepness as it rises above the wave forming channel <b>110</b> tends to allow the water in the wave forming channel <b>110</b> to flow better by limiting the amount of water backup near the base of the bed form, because the water meets the bed form at a gentler angle. This tends to generate smoother water and a better wave. Additionally, multi-angle designs incorporating substantially flat sections are typically substantially easier and less expensive to construct than concave or otherwise rounded sections.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Bed forms, such as a barreling wave forming foil <b>105</b>, may be permanently connected to the wave forming channel <b>110</b>, for instance by welding, or may be removably connected to the wave forming channel <b>110</b>, for instance by fasteners or a fastener system, an example of which is described in the following section.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">2. An Example Fastener System Adapted to Removably Attach a Bed Form to a Wave Forming Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While bed form shapes have historically been permanently formed into the profile of the wave forming channel <b>110</b>, the present inventor has invented bed forms that may also comprise separate modular components that can be removably secured in the channel <b>110</b> in various locations and positions as desired, as described in prior applications incorporated herein. For instance, one or more barreling wave forming foils <b>105</b> may each be separately constructed modular components adapted to be attached to, removed from, repositioned in and reoriented in channel <b>110</b>. While any appropriate fastening or restraint means may be used, an example fastener system specially adapted to removably attach a bed form to a wave forming apparatus is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example fastener system <b>400</b>, shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, <b>4</b>C, <b>4</b>D, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. System <b>400</b> may include a first oblong, elongated, or otherwise non-round through-hole <b>405</b> formed in a bottom surface <b>411</b> of a bed form, such as the base section <b>210</b> of a barreling wave forming foil <b>105</b>. In certain embodiments, the system <b>400</b> may further include a second oblong, elongated, or otherwise non-round through-hole <b>115</b> formed in the channel <b>110</b>. In the example shown in the above figures, holes <b>405</b> and <b>115</b> are adapted to match in size, orientation and location upon mounting the bed form into the channel <b>110</b>. Alternatively, the hole <b>115</b> in the channel <b>110</b> may be a smaller size and/or a different shape than hole <b>405</b>, for instance to prevent a fastener placed into hole <b>405</b> from falling through hole <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the example shown in the above figures, holes <b>405</b> and <b>115</b> are adapted to accept a twistlock fastener <b>600</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C</figref>, <b>4</b>D, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a twistlock fastener <b>600</b> includes a longitudinally-extending main body <b>605</b> having a top portion and a bottom portion and an oblong, elongated, or otherwise non-round cross-section adapted to fit in but not rotate within correspondingly sized and shaped holes <b>405</b> and <b>115</b>. Rotationally attached to the top portion of the main body <b>605</b> is a top locking member <b>610</b>, and rotationally attached to the bottom portion of the main body <b>605</b> is a bottom locking member <b>615</b>. Top and bottom locking members <b>610</b>, <b>615</b> may be rotationally attached to the main body <b>605</b> by any suitable means, for example by rotation-permitting members <b>620</b>, which may include, for instance, a screw, a bolt, a rivet, or a shaft having a head or other means for retaining the locking members <b>610</b>, <b>615</b> to the main body <b>605</b>, such as a retaining clip (not shown). The twistlock fastener <b>600</b> may be formed from any suitable material, such as stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the example shown in the above figures, the twistlock fastener <b>600</b> may be installed in holes <b>405</b> and <b>115</b> when the top and/or bottom locking members <b>610</b>, <b>615</b> are rotationally aligned with the main body <b>605</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, such alignment would be achieved by rotating said pieces until dashed lines <b>625</b> were aligned. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows an example twistlock fastener <b>600</b> installed in holes <b>405</b> and <b>115</b> with the locking members <b>610</b>, <b>615</b> rotationally aligned with the main body <b>605</b>. Rotating locking members <b>610</b>, <b>615</b> relative to the main body <b>605</b>, which is rotationally trapped within holes <b>405</b>, <b>115</b>, locks the twistlock fastener <b>600</b> in place, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D and 5</figref>. Specifically, when bottom locking member <b>615</b> is rotated (for instance approximately 45 to 135 degrees, such as for instance 90 degrees) relative to the main body <b>605</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, then any attempt to move twistlock fastener <b>600</b> upwards (i.e., towards the bed form <b>105</b>) will cause the bottom locking member <b>615</b> to push upward against the bottom surface <b>111</b> of the channel <b>110</b>. Likewise, when top locking member <b>610</b> is rotated (for instance approximately 45 to 135 degrees, such as for instance 90 degrees) relative to the main body <b>605</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, then any attempt to move twistlock fastener <b>600</b> downwards (i.e., towards the channel <b>110</b>) will cause the top locking member <b>610</b> to push downward against an upper surface <b>411</b> of the bed form <b>105</b>. Accordingly, once the example twistlock fastener <b>600</b> is installed in holes <b>405</b> and <b>115</b> with the locking members <b>610</b>, <b>615</b> rotated with respect to the main body <b>605</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D and 5</figref>, then the bed form <b>105</b> will be securely fastened to the channel <b>110</b>, preventing both vertical and lateral relative movement between the bed form <b>105</b> and the channel <b>110</b>. Unfastening the bed form <b>105</b> from the channel <b>110</b> is achieved by simply rotationally realigning either the top and/or bottom locking members <b>610</b>, <b>615</b> with the main body <b>605</b>, such that dashed line segments <b>625</b> would be aligned, and removing the twistlock fastener <b>600</b> from the holes <b>405</b>, <b>115</b>, after which the bed form <b>105</b> may be lifted off and/or moved on the channel <b>110</b>. The fastener system <b>400</b> described herein may be used to connect a bed form or similar feature to any portion of a channel <b>110</b>, including the bed or floor, and/or the walls thereof. The foregoing system <b>400</b> is quick and easy for a user to manipulate and may be adapted for use by hand without tools. The fastener system <b>400</b> may be located in recessed areas of a bed form <b>105</b>, as shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 5</figref>, in some embodiments under removable covers (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Apparatus as described in each of the above embodiments may be scaled up or down depending on the type of water attraction desired.
