<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention relates generally to wireless communications and more particularly to antennas, transmitters, and/or receivers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Communication systems are known to support wireless and wire lined communications between wireless and/or wire lined communication devices. Such communication systems range from national and/or international cellular telephone systems to the Internet to point-to-point in-home wireless networks to radio frequency identification (RFID) systems to radio frequency radar systems. Each type of communication system is constructed, and hence operates, in accordance with one or more communication standards. For instance, radio frequency (RF) wireless communication systems may operate in accordance with one or more standards including, but not limited to, RFID, IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, advanced mobile phone services (AMPS), digital AMPS, global system for mobile communications (GSM), code division multiple access (CDMA), WCDMA, local multi-point distribution systems (LMDS), multi-channel-multi-point distribution systems (MMDS), LTE, WiMAX, and/or variations thereof. As another example, infrared (IR) communication systems may operate in accordance with one or more standards including, but not limited to, IrDA (Infrared Data Association).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Depending on the type of RF wireless communication system, a wireless communication device, such as a cellular telephone, two-way radio, personal digital assistant (PDA), personal computer (PC), laptop computer, tablet computer, home entertainment equipment, RFID reader, RFID tag, radar transmitter and/or receiver, et cetera communicates directly or indirectly with other wireless communication devices. For direct communications (also known as point-to-point communications), the participating wireless communication devices tune their receivers and transmitters to the same channel or channels (e.g., one of the plurality of radio frequency (RF) carriers of the wireless communication system) and communicate over that channel(s). For indirect wireless communications, each wireless communication device communicates directly with an associated base station (e.g., for cellular services) and/or an associated access point (e.g., for an in-home or in-building wireless network) via an assigned channel. To complete a communication connection between the wireless communication devices, the associated base stations and/or associated access points communicate with each other directly, via a system controller, via the public switch telephone network, via the Internet, and/or via some other wide area network and/or local area network.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For each RF wireless communication device to participate in wireless communications, it includes a built-in radio transceiver (i.e., receiver and transmitter) or is coupled to an associated radio transceiver (e.g., a station for in-home and/or in-building wireless communication networks, RF modem, etc.). As is known, the receiver is coupled to the antenna and includes a low noise amplifier, one or more intermediate frequency stages, a filtering stage, and a data recovery stage. The low noise amplifier receives inbound RF signals via the antenna and amplifies then. The one or more intermediate frequency stages mix the amplified RF signals with one or more local oscillations to convert the amplified RF signal into baseband signals or intermediate frequency (IF) signals. The filtering stage filters the baseband signals or the IF signals to attenuate unwanted out of band signals to produce filtered signals. The data recovery stage recovers raw data from the filtered signals in accordance with the particular wireless communication standard.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As is also known, the transmitter includes a data modulation stage, one or more intermediate frequency stages, and a power amplifier. The data modulation stage converts raw data into baseband signals in accordance with a particular wireless communication standard. The one or more intermediate frequency stages mix the baseband signals with one or more local oscillations to produce RF signals. The power amplifier amplifies the RF signals prior to transmission via an antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Since the wireless part of a wireless communication begins and ends with the antenna, a properly designed antenna structure is an important component of wireless communication devices. As is known, the antenna structure is designed to have a desired impedance (e.g., 50 Ohms) at an operating frequency, a desired bandwidth centered at the desired operating frequency, and a desired length (e.g., &#xbc; wavelength of the operating frequency for a monopole antenna). As is further known, the antenna structure may include a single monopole or dipole antenna, a diversity antenna structure, the same polarization, different polarization, and/or any number of other electro-magnetic properties.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One popular antenna structure for RF transceivers is a three-dimensional in-air helix antenna, which resembles an expanded spring. The in-air helix antenna provides a magnetic omni-directional monopole antenna. Other types of three-dimensional antennas include aperture antennas of a rectangular shape, horn shaped, etc,; three-dimensional dipole antennas having a conical shape, a cylinder shape, an elliptical shape, etc.; and reflector antennas having a plane reflector, a corner reflector, or a parabolic reflector. An issue with such three-dimensional antennas is that they cannot be implemented in the substantially two-dimensional space of a substrate such as an integrated circuit (IC) and/or on the printed circuit board (PCB) supporting the IC.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Two-dimensional antennas are known to include a meandering pattern or a micro strip configuration. For efficient antenna operation, the length of an antenna should be &#xbc; wavelength for a monopole antenna and &#xbd; wavelength for a dipole antenna, where the wavelength (&#x3bb;)=c/f, where c is the speed of light and f is frequency. For example, a &#xbc; wavelength antenna at 900 MHz has a total length of approximately 8.3 centimeters (i.e., 0.25*(3&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>m/s)/(900&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>c/s)=0.25*33 cm, where m/s is meters per second and c/s is cycles per second). As another example, a &#xbc; wavelength antenna at 2400 MHz has a total length of approximately 3.1 cm (i.e., 0.25*(3&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>m/s)/(2.4&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>c/s)=0.25*12.5 cm).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">While two-dimensional antennas provide reasonably antenna performance for many wireless communication devices, there are issues when the wireless communication devices require full duplex operation and/or multiple input and/or multiple output (e.g., single input multiple output, multiple input multiple output, multiple input single output) operation. For instance, in a full duplex wireless communication, the wireless communication device simultaneously transmits and receives signals. For full duplex wireless communications to work reasonably well, the receiver antenna(s) must be isolated from the transmitter antenna(s) (e.g., &#x3e;20 dBm). One popular mechanism is to use an isolator. Another popular mechanism is to use duplexers. While such mechanisms provide receiver antenna(s) isolation from the transmitter antenna(s), but does so at the cost of increasing the overall manufacturing costs of wireless communication devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of a wireless communication device <b>10</b> that includes a receiver section <b>12</b>, a transmitter section <b>14</b>, a baseband processing module <b>16</b>, a power management unit <b>18</b>, a power amplifier (PA) <b>20</b>, an RX-TX isolation module <b>22</b>, an antenna tuning unit (ATU) <b>24</b>, and an antenna assembly <b>26</b>, which may be implemented as described in one or more of the following figures. The receiver section <b>12</b> may be a direct conversion receiver or it may be a super-heterodyne receiver, which includes a radio frequency (RF) to intermediate frequency (IF) conversion section <b>28</b> and an IF to baseband (BB) section <b>30</b>. The wireless communication device <b>10</b> may be any device that can be carried by a person, can be at least partially powered by a battery, includes a radio transceiver (e.g., radio frequency (RF) and/or millimeter wave (MMW)) and performs one or more software applications. For example, the wireless communication device <b>10</b> may be a cellular telephone, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, a video game console, a video game player, a personal entertainment unit, a tablet computer, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In an example embodiment, the receiver section <b>12</b>, the transmitter section <b>14</b>, the baseband processing unit <b>16</b> and the power management unit <b>18</b> may be implemented as a system on a chip (SOC). The power amplifier <b>20</b>, the RX-TX isolation module <b>22</b>, and the ATU <b>24</b> may be implemented within a front end module (FEM). The FEM may include multiple paths of Pas <b>20</b>, RX-TX isolation modules <b>22</b>, and ATUs <b>24</b>. For example, the FEM may include one path for 2G (second generation) cellular telephone service, another path for 3G or 4G (third generation or fourth generation) cellular telephone service, and a third path for wireless local area network (WLAN) service. Of course there are a multitude of other example combinations of paths within the FEM to support one or more wireless communication standards (e.g., IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, global system for mobile communications (GSM), code division multiple access (CDMA), radio frequency identification (RFID), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), WCDMA, high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), high-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA), LTE (Long Term Evolution), WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access), and/or variations thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In an example of single frequency band operation, the baseband processing unit <b>16</b>, or module, performs one or more functions of the wireless communication device <b>10</b> regarding transmission of data. In this instance, the processing module receives outbound data (e.g., voice, text, audio, video, graphics, etc.) and converts it into one or more outbound symbol streams in accordance with one or more wireless communication standards (e.g., GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, HSUPA, HSDPA, WiMAX, EDGE, GPRS, IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, ZigBee, universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), long term evolution (LTE), IEEE 802.16, evolution data optimized (EV-DO), etc.). Such a conversion includes one or more of: scrambling, puncturing, encoding, interleaving, constellation mapping, modulation, frequency spreading, frequency hopping, beamforming, space-time-block encoding, space-frequency-block encoding, frequency to time domain conversion, and/or digital baseband to intermediate frequency conversion. Note that the baseband processing unit <b>16</b> converts the outbound data into a single outbound symbol stream for Single Input Single Output (SISO) communications and/or for Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) communications and converts the outbound data into multiple outbound symbol streams for Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communications.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The baseband processing unit <b>16</b> provides the one or more outbound symbol streams to the transmitter section <b>14</b>, which converts the outbound symbol stream(s) into one or more outbound RF signals (e.g., signals in one or more frequency bands 800 MHz, 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz, 2000 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 60 GHz, etc.). The transceiver section <b>14</b> may include at least one up-conversion module, at least one frequency translated bandpass filter (FTBPF), and an output module; which may be configured as a direct conversion topology (e.g., direct conversion of baseband or near baseband symbol streams to RF signals) or as a super heterodyne topology (e.g., convert baseband or near baseband symbol streams into IF signals and then convert the IF signals into RF signals).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">For a direction conversion, the transmitter section <b>12</b> may have a Cartesian-based topology, a polar-based topology, or a hybrid polar-Cartesian-based topology. In a Cartesian-based topology, the transmitter section <b>12</b> mixes in-phase and quadrature components (e.g., A<sub>I</sub>(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>BB</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;<sub>I</sub>(t)) and A<sub>Q</sub>(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>BB</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;<sub>Q</sub>(t)), respectively) of the one or more outbound symbol streams with in-phase and quadrature components (e.g., cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)) and sin(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)), respectively) of one or more transmit local oscillations (TX LO) to produce mixed signals. If included, the FTBPF filters the mixed signals and the output module conditions (e.g., common mode filtering and/or differential to single-ended conversion) them to produce one or more outbound up-converted signals (e.g., A(t) cos(&#x3c9;<sub>BB</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;(t))+&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t))). A power amplifier driver (PAD) module amplifies the outbound up-converted signal(s) to produce a pre-PA (power amplified) outbound RF signal(s).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In a phase polar-based topology, the transmitter section <b>14</b> includes an oscillator that produces an oscillation (e.g., cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)) that is adjusted based on the phase information (e.g., +/&#x2212;&#x394;&#x3c6;[phase shift] and/or &#x3c6;t) [phase modulation]) of the outbound symbol stream(s). The resulting adjusted oscillation (e.g., cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)+/&#x2212;&#x394;&#x3c6;) or cos (&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;(t)) may be further adjusted by amplitude information (e.g., A(t) [amplitude modulation]) of the outbound symbol stream(s) to produce one or more up-converted signals (e.g., A(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;(t)) or A(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)+/&#x2212;&#x394;&#x3c6;)). If included, the FTBPF filters the one or more up-converted signals and the output module conditions (e.g., common mode filtering and/or differential to single-ended conversion) them. A power amplifier driver (PAD) module then amplifies the outbound up-converted signal(s) to produce a pre-PA (power amplified) outbound RF signal(s).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In a frequency polar-based topology, the transmitter section <b>14</b> includes an oscillator that produces an oscillation (e.g., cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)) this is adjusted based on the frequency information (e.g., +/&#x2212;&#x394;f [frequency shift] and/or f(t)) [frequency modulation]) of the outbound symbol stream(s). The resulting adjusted oscillation (e.g., cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)+/&#x2212;&#x394;f) or cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)+f(t)) may be further adjusted by amplitude information (e.g., A(t) [amplitude modulation]) of the outbound symbol stream(s) to produce one or more up-converted signals (e.g., A(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)+f(t)) or A(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)+/&#x2212;&#x394;f)). If included, the FTBPF filters the one or more up-converted signals and the output module conditions (e.g., common mode filtering and/or differential to single-ended conversion) them. A power amplifier driver (PAD) module then amplifies the outbound up-converted signal(s) to produce a pre-PA (power amplified) outbound RF signal(s).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In a hybrid polar-Cartesian-based topology, the transmitter section <b>14</b> separates the phase information (e.g., cos(&#x3c9;<sub>BB</sub>(t)+/&#x2212;&#x394;&#x3c6;) or cos(&#x3c9;<sub>BB</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;(t)) and the amplitude information (e.g., A(t)) of the outbound symbol stream(s). The transmitter section <b>14</b> mixes in-phase and quadrature components (e.g., cos(&#x3c9;<sub>BB</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;<sub>I</sub>(t)) and cos(&#x3c9;<sub>BB</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;<sub>Q</sub>(t)), respectively) of the one or more outbound symbol streams with in-phase and quadrature components (e.g., cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)) and sin(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)), respectively) of one or more transmit local oscillations (TX LO) to produce mixed signals. If included, the FTBPF filters the mixed signals and the output module conditions (e.g., common mode filtering and/or differential to single-ended conversion) them to produce one or more outbound up-converted signals (e.g., A(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>BB</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;(t))+&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t))). A power amplifier driver (PAD) module amplifies the normalized outbound up-converted signal(s) and injects the amplitude information (e.g., A(t)) into the normalized outbound up-converted signal(s) to produce a pre-PA (power amplified) outbound RF signal(s) (e.g., A(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;(t))).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">For a super heterodyne topology, the transmitter section <b>14</b> includes a baseband (BB) to intermediate frequency (IF) section and an IF to a radio frequency (RF section). The BB to IF section may be of a polar-based topology, a Cartesian-based topology, a hybrid polar-Cartesian-based topology, or a mixing stage to up-convert the outbound symbol stream(s). In the polar-based topology, the Cartesian-based topology, and/or the hybrid polar-Cartesian-based topology, the BB to IF section generates an IF signal(s) (e.g., A(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>IF</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;(t))) and the IF to RF section includes a mixing stage, a filtering stage and the power amplifier driver (PAD) to produce the pre-PA outbound RF signal(s).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">When the BB to IF section includes a mixing stage, the IF to RF section may have a polar-based topology, a Cartesian-based topology, or a hybrid polar-Cartesian-based topology. In this instance, the BB to IF section converts the outbound symbol stream(s) (e.g., A(t)cos((&#x3c9;<sub>BB</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;(t))) into intermediate frequency symbol stream(s) (e.g., A(t) (&#x3c9;<sub>IF</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;(t)). The IF to RF section converts the IF symbol stream(s) into the pre-PA outbound RF signal(s).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The transmitter section <b>14</b> outputs the pre-PA outbound RF signal(s) to a power amplifier module (PA) <b>20</b> of the front-end module (FEM). The PA <b>20</b> includes one or more power amplifiers coupled in series and/or in parallel to amplify the pre-PA outbound RF signal(s) to produce an outbound RF signal(s). Note that parameters (e.g., gain, linearity, bandwidth, efficiency, noise, output dynamic range, slew rate, rise rate, settling time, overshoot, stability factor, etc.) of the PA <b>20</b> may be adjusted based on control signals <b>32</b> received from the baseband processing unit <b>16</b> and/or another processing module of the wireless communication device <b>10</b>. For instance, as transmission conditions change (e.g., channel response changes, distance between TX unit <b>14</b> and RX unit <b>12</b> changes, antenna properties change, etc.), the processing resources (e.g., the BB processing unit <b>16</b> and/or the processing module) of the SOC monitors the transmission condition changes and adjusts the properties of the PA <b>20</b> to optimize performance. Such a determination may not be made in isolation; for example, it is done in light to other parameters of the front-end module that may be adjusted (e.g., the ATU <b>24</b>, the RX-TX isolation module <b>22</b>) to optimize transmission and reception of the RF signals.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The RX-TX isolation module <b>22</b> (which may be a duplexer, a circulator, or transformer balun, or other device that provides isolation between a TX signal and an RX signal using a common antenna) attenuates the outbound RF signal(s). The RX-TX isolation module <b>22</b> may adjusts it attenuation of the outbound RF signal(s) (i.e., the TX signal) based on control signals <b>32</b> received from the baseband processing unit <b>16</b> and/or the processing module of the SOC. For example, when the transmission power is relatively low, the RX-TX isolation module <b>22</b> may be adjusted to reduce its attenuation of the TX signal.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The antenna tuning unit (ATU) <b>24</b> is tuned to provide a desired impedance that substantially matches that of the antenna assembly <b>26</b>. As tuned, the ATU <b>22</b> provides the attenuated TX signal from the RX-TX isolation module <b>22</b> to the antenna assembly <b>26</b> for transmission. Note that the ATU <b>24</b> may be continually or periodically adjusted to track impedance changes of the antenna assembly <b>26</b>. For example, the baseband processing unit <b>16</b> and/or the processing module may detect a change in the impedance of the antenna assembly <b>26</b> and, based on the detected change, provide control signals to the ATU <b>24</b> such that it changes it impedance accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The antenna assembly <b>26</b> also receives one or more inbound RF signals, which are provided to the ATU <b>24</b>. The ATU <b>24</b> provides the inbound RF signal(s) to the RX-TX isolation module <b>22</b>, which routes the signal(s) to the receiver (RX) RF to IF section <b>28</b>. The RX RF to IF section <b>28</b> converts the inbound RF signal(s) (e.g., A(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>RF</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;(t))) into an inbound IF signal (e.g., A<sub>I</sub>(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>IF</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;<sub>I</sub>(t)) and A<sub>Q</sub>(t)cos(&#x3c9;<sub>IF</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;<sub>Q</sub>(t))).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The RX IF to BB section <b>30</b> converts the inbound IF signal into one or more inbound symbol streams (e.g., A(t)cos((&#x3c9;<sub>BB</sub>(t)+&#x3c6;(t))). In this instance, the RX IF to BB section <b>30</b> includes a mixing section and a combining &#x26; filtering section. The mixing section mixes the inbound IF signal(s) with a second local oscillation (e.g., LO<b>2</b>=IF&#x2212;BB, where BB may range from 0 Hz to a few MHz) to produce I and Q mixed signals. The combining &#x26; filtering section combines (e.g., adds the mixed signals together&#x2014;which includes a sum component and a difference component) and then filters the combined signal to substantially attenuate the sum component and pass, substantially unattenuated, the difference component as the inbound symbol stream(s).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The baseband processing unit <b>16</b> converts the inbound symbol stream(s) into inbound data (e.g., voice, text, audio, video, graphics, etc.) in accordance with one or more wireless communication standards (e.g., GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, HSUPA, HSDPA, WiMAX, EDGE, GPRS, IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, ZigBee, universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), long term evolution (LTE), IEEE 802.16, evolution data optimized (EV-DO), etc.). Such a conversion may include one or more of: digital intermediate frequency to baseband conversion, time to frequency domain conversion, space-time-block decoding, space-frequency-block decoding, demodulation, frequency spread decoding, frequency hopping decoding, beamforming decoding, constellation demapping, deinterleaving, decoding, depuncturing, and/or descrambling. Note that the processing module converts a single inbound symbol stream into the inbound data for Single Input Single Output (SISO) communications and/or for Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) communications and converts the multiple inbound symbol streams into the inbound data for Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communications.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The power management unit <b>18</b> may be integrated into the SOC to perform a variety of functions. Such functions include monitoring power connections and battery charges, charging a battery when necessary, controlling power to the other components of the SOC, generating supply voltages, shutting down unnecessary SOC modules, controlling sleep modes of the SOC modules, and/or providing a real-time clock. To facilitate the generation of power supply voltages, the power management unit <b>18</b> may includes one or more switch-mode power supplies and/or one or more linear regulators.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In another example of operation, the processing module, which may be the baseband processing module or another processing module, determines an operational mode based on type of antenna assembly. For example, the processing module determines the type of antenna assembly (e.g., number of antenna units (e.g., interwoven spiral antennas), configuration of the antenna units (e.g., functioning as single antennas or as a multiple antenna unit antenna), the excitation points of the antenna units (e.g., a center excitation point of the single interwoven spiral antenna, differential excitation points of the single interwoven spiral antenna, dipole excitation points of the single interwoven spiral antenna, one or more end of spiral excitation points of the single interwoven spiral antenna, a center excitation point of the poly interwoven spiral antenna, differential excitation points of the poly interwoven spiral antenna, and dipole excitation points of the poly interwoven spiral antenna), excitation point options (e.g., an approximately zero degree phase shift excitation, a phase shifted excitation in a range between approximately zero degrees and approximately ninety degrees, and/or a plurality of phase shifted excitations), and/or operable characteristics of the antenna assembly).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Additionally, or in the alternative, the processing module may determine the operation mode based on the number of frequency bands to support the wireless communication(s), whether the antenna assembly will be shared for transmit and receive communication or whether the antenna assembly will include separate transmit and receive antenna assemblies, MIMO operation, diversity operation, and/or whether the antenna assembly will support multiple concurrent communications (e.g., communication sharing). The processing module may determine the operational mode in isolation or it may negotiation the operation mode with a target wireless communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The processing module then generates one or more control signals in accordance with the operational mode.

<p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram of an embodiment of an interwoven spiral antenna that may be used in one or more of the antennas assemblies of the wireless communication devices discussed with reference to one or more of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>. The interwoven spiral antenna includes a non-inverted spiral section <b>68</b> having a spiral shape, an inverted spiral section <b>70</b> having an inverted spiral shape, and an excitation region (e.g., an excitation point or multiple points). Collectively, the non-inverted spiral section <b>68</b> and the inverted spiral section <b>70</b> may form a Celtic spiral (which may include 3 interwoven spirals), an Archimedean spiral, and/or a Celtic logarithmic spiral (an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). In this example, the antenna includes an excitation region (e.g., a point) <b>74</b> at the connection point of the two spiral sections and a return connection, which may be ground, another AC ground, or another reference potential.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Various properties of the interwoven spiral antenna define its operational characteristics. For instance, the dimensions of the excitation region (e.g., establishes the upper cutoff region of the bandwidth) and the circumference of the interwoven spiral antenna (e.g., establishes the lower cutoff region of the bandwidth) define the bandwidth of the interwoven spiral antenna. The trace width, distance between traces, length of each spiral section, distance to a ground plane, and/or use of an artificial magnetic conductor plane affect the quality factor, radiation pattern, impedance (which is fairly constant over the bandwidth), gain, and/or other characteristics of the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In an example of monopole operation, an outbound RF signal is applied to the excitation point <b>74</b> of the interwoven spiral antenna. This generates an electric field and causes a current <b>72</b> to flow through the interwoven spiral antenna from the excitation point <b>74</b> to the interconnection of the spiral sections. The current <b>72</b> generates a magnetic field such that, in combination with the electric field, the antenna has a circular polarization, which may be inverted by changing the direction of current flow <b>72</b>. For instance, the pattern of the interwoven spiral may be flipped 180 degrees to change the current flow <b>72</b> direction. This enables one interwoven spiral antenna to be used for transmission of RF signals and another interwoven spiral antenna with opposite circular polarity to be used for reception of RF signals. Return energy of the interwoven spiral antenna is via a return connection (e.g., a ground plane, a reference potential, AC ground, and/or an artificial magnetic conductor).</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In such an embodiment, a small footprint and wideband antenna that has a relatively constant gain throughout the band pass region is achievable. For example, the interwoven spiral antenna (e.g., a Celtic spiral antenna and/or an Archimedean spiral antenna) may be printed on a metal layer of a printed circuit board (e.g., FR-4 substrate with a relative permittivity &#x3b5;r=4.40, dissipation factor tan &#x3b4;=0.02, and thickness of 2.0 mm). For a frequency band of 2 GHz, each spiral section of this example antenna includes two turns and has a radius of 8 mm; the width of spiral line and gap between adjacent lines are chosen to be 1 mm and 2.25 mm, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In another example embodiment, the interwoven spiral antenna may be implemented on one or more layers of a substrate and second interwoven spiral antenna may be implemented on another one or more layers of the substrate. The first interwoven spiral antenna provides a first leg of an antenna assembly and the second interwoven spiral antenna provides a second leg of the antenna assembly. The two interwoven spirals are aligned from a major surface perspective of the substrate such that the magnetic fields of the two antenna legs are additive. In furtherance of this example, the first interwoven spiral antenna provides a first leg of a dipole antenna and the second interwoven spiral antenna provides a second leg of the dipole antenna. In still furtherance of this example, the first interwoven spiral antenna functions as previously described with reference to the present figure and the second interwoven spiral antenna provides a return path.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram of an example of a current waveform and a voltage waveform of an interwoven spiral antenna of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The current waveform has zero crossings at 0 degrees, at 180 degrees, and at 360 degrees. The voltage waveform has zero crossings at 90 degrees and 270 degrees. As is further shown, the length of one of the spiral sections may be one-half wavelength <b>78</b> or a full wavelength <b>76</b>. As such, with any of the wavelengths, the current at the ends of the spirals is approximately zero, while the voltage is approximately at its largest magnitude. In general, the length of each of the non-inverting spiral section and the inverted spiral section may be m*one-half wavelength, where m is an integer greater than or equal to one.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">If the length of each spiral section is one-quarter wavelength, then the excitation point may be excited with a 90 degree phase shifted signal. In this manner, the antenna exhibits the current and voltage waveforms from 0 to 180 degrees and/or exhibits the current and voltage waveforms from 180 to 360 degrees.</p>

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">If the return path of the antenna is through a ground and/or an artificial magnetic conductor, the radiation pattern <b>80</b> primarily includes the one radiation lobe as shown. If, however, the return path of the antenna is through some other means (e.g., another interwoven spiral or a return connection), a second radiation lobe may be present that is perpendicular the surface of the antenna, but in the opposite direction as the one presently illustrated.</p>
