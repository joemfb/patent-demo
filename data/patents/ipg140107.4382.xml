<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/030,449 filed on Feb. 13, 2008, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,270,404, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention generally relates to distribution of data. More particularly, this invention relates to a system, method, and computer program product for improved distribution of data in a computing environment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general computing systems, including computing systems with multiple nodes, relatively increased performance may be obtained through parallel processing. For example, a data set may be divided into smaller subsets by a head node. The head node may distribute the smaller subsets, individually, to a plurality of processing nodes. The processing nodes may return results to a further node, which may reassemble the smaller subset results into a complete result dataset, which may be a final result of this general parallel processing example. However, as is apparent, the head node and further node may form bottlenecks hindering the overall efficiency of the processing through use of system resources for subset division, subset distribution to corresponding nodes, and result assembly. If either the head node or further node is omitted, the process may be further hindered by use of system resources for storage of the complete data set in each of the plurality of processing nodes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An example embodiment of the present invention includes a method for improved distribution of data in a computing environment. The method includes receiving data for distribution in the computing environment and receiving configuration data of the computing environment. The method also includes parsing the data for distribution using the configuration data into header information of a packet. The header information includes data offsets identifying a common data portion within the date for distribution, the common data portion being available to all nodes of the computing environment and identifying a first node of the computing environment and a particular-node data portion within the data for distribution, the particular-node data portion being available only to the first node of the computing environment. The method also includes broadcasting the header information of a packet to all nodes of the computing environment and broadcasting the data for distribution to all nodes of the computing environment in response to broadcasting the header information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example embodiment of the present invention includes a method for improved distribution of data in a computing environment. The method includes receiving, at a node of the computing environment, a header information broadcast and receiving, at the node of the computing environment, a data broadcast. The header information broadcast includes one or more data offsets identifying a common data portion within the data broadcast, the common data portion being available to all nodes of the computing environment, and identifying the node and a particular-node data portion within the data broadcast, the particular-node data portion being available only to the node. The method also includes storing the common data portion and the particular-node data portion of the data broadcast and processing the stored portions of data at the node of the computing environment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An example embodiment of the present invention includes a computer program product including a non-transitory computer readable storage medium with program segments for, when executed on a computer device, causing the computer device to implement a method of improved distribution of data. The method includes receiving data for distribution in the computing environment and receiving configuration data of the computing environment. The method also includes parsing the data for distribution using the configuration data into header information of a packet. The header information includes data offsets identifying a common data portion within the date for distribution, the common data portion being available to all nodes of the computing environment and identifying a first node of the computing environment and a particular-node data portion within the data for distribution, the particular-node data portion being available only to the first node of the computing environment. The method also includes broadcasting the header information of a packet to all nodes of the computing environment and broadcasting the data for distribution to all nodes of the computing environment in response to broadcasting the header information.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an exemplary embodiment, a method is provided which significantly increases the efficiency of data distribution in computing environments. This increase in efficiency results in a decrease in utilized network bandwidth, frees systems resources, and provides additional technical benefits as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">If a large data set is used in computational tasks in a computing environment, moving the data set through multiple nodes for computation may consume large amounts of network and/or system resources. For example, several terabytes of data may be used in some banking applications, while clash analysis and pricing of equities may also utilize relatively large data sets. Many other applications may involve large data sets, and as such, example embodiments should not be limited to any particular application, but rather to any suitable application.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Some approaches to data distribution for parallel processing may include transmitting an entire data set to each of a plurality of processing nodes, or splitting the data set before distribution to each of the processing nodes. These approaches, although providing a manner by which to distribute data, may hinder overall efficiency through over utilization of system resources and network bandwidth. It follows that the technical effect of example embodiments is to provide a method of data distribution which increases the efficiency of data distribution in computing environments. The computing environments may include super-computing environments, clustered computing environments, grid computing environments, and any other suitable computing environment. Further, according to at least one example embodiment, distribution of data may be facilitated through the use of a header portion transmitted with a data set or portion of a data set to every node of a plurality of nodes in a computing environment. For example, a broadcasting approach may be used where a header portion is transmitted with information related to corresponding portions of a data set, including information related to directing particular portions of the data set to one or more nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a data packet is illustrated, according to an example embodiment. The data packet <b>100</b> may include a header portion <b>101</b> and a data portion <b>102</b>. The header portion <b>101</b> may include information related to distribution of data contained within the data portion <b>102</b>. Furthermore, the data portion <b>102</b> may include at least a portion of information to be computed, processed, executed, and/or manipulated by one or more nodes in a computing environment. As illustrated, the header portion <b>101</b> is attached to the data portion <b>102</b>. Therefore, the entire data packet <b>100</b> may be broadcast to all nodes of a computing environment, with the header portion <b>101</b> being received within relatively the same time as the data portion <b>102</b>. However, example embodiments are not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a data packet <b>200</b> may include a header portion <b>201</b> and a data portion <b>202</b> which are not directly attached to one another. Therefore, either the header portion <b>201</b> or the data portion <b>202</b> may be transmitted simultaneously, in succession, or at different times altogether. For example, according to at least one example embodiment the header portion <b>201</b> is broadcast before the data portion <b>202</b>. As described above, data packets (e.g., <b>100</b> and/or <b>200</b>) may be broadcast to nodes of a computing environment. A portion of a computing environment is described more fully below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a portion of a computing environment, according to an exemplary embodiment. The portion <b>300</b> may include a network adapter <b>303</b> and a data storage portion <b>304</b>. The network adapter <b>303</b> may include an enhancement portion <b>302</b> which may facilitate data distribution as is further described herein. The network adapter <b>303</b> may be operatively connected to a network <b>301</b>. The network <b>301</b> may be any suitable network, and may transmit information (e.g., data packets) to the network adapter <b>303</b> and/or the enhancement portion <b>302</b>. The data may include any relevant data to be processed by the entire computing environment to which portion <b>300</b> is a part of.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Upon receipt of the data packets, the enhancement portion <b>302</b> may interpret information included within the header portion of the data packets to decipher instructions, offsets, or other relevant information included therein. For example, the header portion may include offset values of data contained within a data portion of its respective packet. The offset values may direct the enhancement portion to store data within said offsets to the storage portion <b>304</b>. In this manner, only portions of the data portion relevant to the portion <b>300</b> may be stored within the storage portion <b>304</b>, and portions of the data portion not relevant to the portion <b>300</b> may be discarded thereby reducing use of system resources. Alternatively, if a header portion does not include instructions or data offset information, or even if a header portion is not received, the network adapter <b>303</b> may direct the entire data portion to be stored in the data portion <b>304</b>. Therefore, exemplary embodiment allow for utilization of portions of a computing environment in virtually any manner. To better understand data distribution relative to an entire computing environment, the following description with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a computing environment, according to an exemplary embodiment. The computing environment <b>400</b> may include a plurality of nodes <b>401</b>. The plurality of nodes <b>401</b> may be somewhat similar to portion <b>300</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>; therefore, exhaustive description of the functionality of the nodes will be omitted herein for the sake of brevity. The computing environment <b>400</b> further includes communications channel <b>402</b>. Communications channel <b>402</b> may be any suitable communications channel providing distribution of data packets among each of the plurality of nodes <b>401</b>. For example, the communications channel <b>402</b> may allow for broadcasting of data packets to each of the plurality of nodes <b>401</b> relatively simultaneously. Furthermore, the communications channel <b>402</b> may be in operative communication with a network (e.g., network <b>301</b>). Therefore, information may be retrieved or received from the network and broadcast to each of the plurality of nodes <b>401</b>. Moreover, each of the plurality of nodes <b>401</b> may interpret header portions of data packets, store relevant portions of data, process said portions of data, and transmit the results using communications channel <b>402</b>. In this manner, parallel computation of the data packets may be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Therefore, as described above, individual nodes of a computing environment may receive data packets broadcast over a communications channel. Each node of the plurality of nodes may retrieve and store relevant portions of the data packet for computation. Hereinafter, a more detailed description of relevant portions of a data packet is given with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a data packet, according to an exemplary embodiment. As illustrated, the data packet <b>500</b> includes a header portion <b>510</b> and a data portion <b>520</b>. The header portion <b>510</b> may be substantially similar to header portions <b>101</b> and <b>201</b>, and furthermore, the data portion <b>520</b> may be substantially similar to data portions <b>102</b> and <b>202</b>. However, the particular portions and divisions of each of header portion <b>510</b> and data portion <b>520</b> are given for illustrative purposes only, and should not be construed as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The header portion <b>510</b> may include internet protocol (IP) header portion <b>501</b> and distribution header portion <b>502</b>. According to at least one example embodiment, IP header portion <b>501</b> may be omitted entirely, or may be altered to include information related to any communication protocol besides the internet protocol. As such, IP header portion <b>501</b> is given for illustrative purposes only. The IP header portion <b>501</b> may include communications information related to a communications protocol used for distribution of the data packet <b>500</b> (in this example, internet protocol information). Thus, the data packet <b>500</b> may be readily transmitted or broadcast among virtually any communications channel.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The distribution header portion <b>502</b> may include information related to actual distribution of portions of the data portion <b>520</b>. More clearly, data header portion <b>502</b> may include any of data offsets, instructions, node identification information, and/or any other suitable information. Therefore, if the data header portion <b>502</b> is received by a node of a computing environment, said node may interpret the data header portion <b>502</b> and decipher relevant portions of the data portion <b>520</b> to store and/or perform computations on.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The data portion <b>520</b> may include a plurality of information, including a data set. The data portion <b>520</b> may be divided into segments, or portions, identified in the data header portion <b>502</b>. For example, given by way of illustration only and therefore not limiting, data portion <b>520</b> may include common data portions (e.g., portion <b>503</b>), and particular node data portions (e.g., <b>504</b>). There may be any number of common data portions, or the common data portions may not exist altogether. Furthermore, the particular node portions may be omitted entirely if only common data is being broadcasted. Moreover, the particular node portions may overlap and/or duplicate each other altogether. Data packets as described herein are available to, and may be readily distributed on, a communications channel. However, these data packets may originate on virtually any portion of a communication system, or even a remote computing apparatus. Hereinafter, a packet forming system is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a packet forming system, according to an exemplary embodiment. The packet forming system <b>600</b> may be included in a computing environment, or may be completely or partially remote to the computing environment. The packet forming system <b>600</b> may include a data storage portion <b>601</b>. The data storage portion <b>601</b> may include configuration data for the computing environment of which data packets are being assembled for. For example, the configuration data may include information related to the number of nodes in the computing environment, the particular configuration of the nodes, node identification means, and/or other suitable information.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The packet forming system <b>600</b> may further include data portion <b>602</b>, parser portion <b>603</b>, and header information portion <b>604</b>. For example, the data portion <b>602</b> may include one or more data files from which packets are to be created. The data file may be transmitted from the data portion <b>602</b> to the parser portion <b>603</b>. Alternatively, the parser portion <b>603</b> may access data portion <b>602</b>. For example, the parser portion <b>603</b> may read the data file from data portion <b>602</b>. The parser may receive configuration information from the data storage portion <b>601</b>, and with the configuration data, may parse the data file according to the configuration information.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, the parser portion <b>603</b> may parse the data file according to the number of appropriate nodes in the computing environment, the configuration of the nodes, and/or other suitable information related to data distribution. Upon parsing the data file, the parser portion <b>603</b> may create header information for one or more data packets to be created from the data file. The header information may include information necessary for particular nodes of the computing environment to store and/or perform computations on corresponding portions of the data packet(s) including the header information. The header information may be transmitted to the header information portion <b>604</b>. Header information portion may store the header information and/or append the header information as a header of at least one data packet. Alternatively, the parser portion <b>603</b> may create the header from the header information, and pass the completed header to the header information portion <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, it is noted that the data portion <b>602</b>, the parser portion <b>603</b>, and the header information portion <b>604</b> may all exist as a set of computer executable instructions within the computing environment, or on a computer apparatus remote to the computing environment. For example, the data portion <b>602</b>, the parser portion <b>603</b>, and the header information portion <b>604</b> may exist as an application <b>610</b> or other suitable grouping on a storage medium of the computer apparatus. Hereinafter, a methodology of forming packets is described more fully with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a flowchart for a method of forming packets, according to an exemplary embodiment. According to method <b>700</b>, data may be received at block <b>701</b>. The data may be a data file or portion thereof. The data may be received by a packet forming system somewhat similar to packet forming system <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The method <b>700</b> further includes receiving configuration data at block <b>702</b>. The configuration data may include configuration data for a computing environment, for example, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Furthermore, the configuration data may be stored in a storage portion of a packet forming system somewhat similar to packet forming system <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The method <b>600</b> further includes parsing data at block <b>703</b>. For example, using the received data and configuration data, attributes of the data, or data file, may be interpreted such that an appropriate header portion may be formed. The length (e.g., bitwise length, or other denominator) may be calculated and may be stored as an attribute of portions of the data file for header portion creation. For example, Table 1 below sets forth an example set of code which may be used for data file portion length calculation:</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With the created header file, the data packet may be broadcast to the nodes of a computing environment, and therefore, the data may be processed accordingly. A method of broadcasting data (i.e., data distribution) is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a flowchart for a method of distributing data, according to an exemplary embodiment. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the method <b>800</b> includes broadcasting a header of a data packet at block <b>801</b>. For example, the header portion of a data packet (i.e., header portion <b>201</b>) may be transmitted separate from the data portion according to some example embodiments. Upon transmittal of the header, or at substantially the same time, a data portion of the data packet may be transmitted at block <b>802</b>. For example, the data portion of the data packet (i.e., data portion <b>202</b>) may be transmitted separate from the header portion according to some example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Alternatively, the method <b>800</b> may include broadcasting the entire data packet (not illustrated). For example, a header portion (i.e., header portion <b>101</b>) and a data portion (i.e., data portion <b>102</b>) may be attached and transmitted in succession. However, example embodiments should not be limited to only successive transmission of header and data portions. For example, header portions and data portions may be broadcast simultaneously, in succession, or any combination thereof. However, according to at least one example embodiment, a header portion is transmitted before the data portion.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The method <b>800</b> further includes receiving processing results at block <b>803</b>. For example, after the data packet is broadcasted (e.g., see blocks <b>801</b> and <b>802</b>), node of a computing environment may separate corresponding portions of the data portion of the data packet, process said portions, and return results of said processing over a communications channel.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a flowchart of a method of distributing data, according to an exemplary embodiment, is illustrated. The method <b>900</b> includes receiving a header broadcast at block <b>901</b>. For example, the header may be received at a node of a computing environment. The node may decipher the header and interpret portions of a data portion to be stored and/or processed. It follows that the method <b>900</b> further includes receiving a data broadcast at block <b>902</b>. The data broadcast may include information to be processed, for example, a data file or data set. It is noted that as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the data packets may be broadcasted in their entirety, in portions (i.e., header broadcast followed by data broadcast), or any suitable broadcast combination. Therefore, the method <b>900</b> may include receiving an entire data packet (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, nodes of a computing environment receiving the data packet broadcast may interpret the header to decipher information related to the data portion of the data packet.

Upon completion of this processing, or during this processing (e.g., as shown in example Table 7), data may be written or stored in a corresponding node (see block <b>903</b>). Therefore, each node receiving a broadcasted data packet may decipher the header portion to interpret whether portions of the data within the packet are to be processed by a corresponding node. Upon identification of relevant portions of data within the data packet and/or storage of the relevant portions, the nodes may each process the data (e.g., see block <b>904</b>). As such, each node with corresponding data from the broadcasted packet may store only data directed to each node in the header portion, and the data may be processed in a relatively parallel manner.</p>
