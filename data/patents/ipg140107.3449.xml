<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed generally to a lighting unit and a driver for a lighting unit. More particularly, various inventive methods and apparatus disclosed herein relate to a lighting unit having a plurality of LED light sources and a driver for such a lighting unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Illumination devices based on semiconductor light sources, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), offer a viable alternative to traditional fluorescent, HID, and incandescent lamps. Functional advantages and benefits of LEDs include high energy conversion and optical efficiency, durability, lower operating costs, and many others. Recent advances in LED technology have provided efficient and robust full-spectrum lighting sources that enable a variety of lighting effects in many applications. Some of the fixtures embodying these sources feature one or more lighting units, including one or more LEDs capable of producing different colors, e.g. red, green, and blue, as well as a processor for independently controlling the output of the LEDs in order to generate a variety of colors and color-changing lighting effects. These lighting units may employ two or more groups or &#x201c;channels&#x201d; of LEDs which produce light of different colors, each supplied with the proper current to enable generation and mixing of light to produce a desired lighting effect, for example, as discussed in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,016,038 and 6,211,626, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some lighting units, the first channel may include a first plurality of white LEDs (e.g., four LEDs) in series with each other, and the second channel may include a second plurality of red LEDs (e.g., two LEDs) in series with each other. A desired color effect of the lighting unit may be controlled by adjusting the current through the two channels. In some lighting units the channels are connected in series so that a single stream or channel of current flows through all the LEDs, and a shunt is provided across selected LEDs (e.g., the LEDs of the second channel) to divert the current away from selected LEDs to yield the desired color effect.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, this arrangement typically entails a loss of energy and/or a complicated control scheme. For example, if the shunt is a linear shunt, it can result in additional unwanted power losses. A switching or pulse-width modulated (PWM) shunt can be employed, but the known arrangements require a complicated drive scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a need in the art to provide a lighting unit with multiple LED channels which can be driven efficiently to achieve a desired lighting effect.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to a lighting unit and a driver for a lighting unit. For example, the present disclosure describes a lighting unit that includes at least two channels of light sources, and a driver for the light sources. The driver includes a DC/DC converter and a control arrangement for controlling the current supplied to at least one of the two channels in response to a control signal produced by the DC/DC converter. Beneficially, a feedback loop controls a switching device in the DC/DC converter to maintain the light level produced by the light sources at a desired level regardless of changes in the supply voltage and the load.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, in one aspect, an apparatus includes: a first channel of first light emitting devices (LEDs) connected in series with each other; a second channel of second LEDs connected in series with each other; and a driver for driving the first and second channels of LEDs. At least one of the second LEDs has a different color or color temperature than at least one of the first LEDs. The driver includes: a flyback converter, a buck converter, a pulse width modulator, and a feedback device. The flyback converter is configured to receive a first DC voltage and to output a second DC voltage, The buck converter is configured to receive the second DC voltage and to generate an output voltage that causes a first current to flow through the first channel of LEDs and a second current to flow through the second channel of LEDs. The pulse width modulator is configured to control the second current flowing through the second channel of LEDs in response to a control signal. The control signal is produced from an inductor winding in one of the flyback converter and the buck converter. The feedback device is configured to sample at least one of the first current and the second current and in response thereto to control a switching operation of the buck converter.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the first channel of LEDs is connected in series with the second channel of LEDs. The driver may include a temperature sensor configured to sense a temperature of at least one of the LEDs, and in response thereto to generate a feedback signal for adjusting the output voltage of the DC/DC converter. The driver may also include a light sensor configured to sense light produced by the LEDs, and in response thereto to generate a feedback signal for adjusting the output voltage of the DC/DC converter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Generally, in another aspect, an apparatus includes a first group of light sources connected in series with each other, a second group of light sources connected in series with each other, and a driver for driving the first and second groups of light sources. At least one of the light sources of the second group has a different color or color temperature than at least one of the light sources of the first group. The driver includes a DC/DC converter and a control device. The DC/DC converter is configured to receive a first DC voltage and to output an output voltage. The output voltage causes a first current to flow through the first group of light sources and a second current to flow through the second group of light sources. The control device is configured to control the second current provided to the second group of light sources in response to a control signal. The DC/DC converter produces the control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the control device includes a pulse width modulator that controls the second current flowing through to the second group of light sources by shunting the second current across one or more of the second light sources in response to the control signal. Also, the second light sources may have a different color or color temperature than the first light sources.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the DC/DC converter includes a flyback converter. The control signal for controlling the current flowing through the second group of light sources is produced by a winding of a transformer in the flyback converter. In another embodiment, the DC/DC converter includes a buck converter. The control signal for controlling the current flowing through the second group of light sources is produced by an inductor winding in the buck converter.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the driver may include a feedback device configured to sample at least one of the first current and the second current and in response thereto to control a switching operation of the DC/DC converter. Additionally or alternatively, the driver may include a sensor sensing a temperature or a light emitted by at least one of the first and second light sources, and in response thereto generates a feedback signal for adjusting the output voltage of the DC/DC converter.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Generally, in still another aspect of the invention, a driver supplies a current to a plurality of light sources. The driver includes: a DC/DC converter and a control device. The DC/DC converter is configured to receive a first DC voltage and to output an output voltage. The output voltage causes a current to flow through the light sources. A control device is configured to control the current flowing through a portion of the light sources in response to a control signal. The control signal is produced by the DC/DC converter.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In many embodiments, the control device includes a pulse width modulator that controls the current flowing through the portion of the light sources by shunting the current across one or more of the light sources in response to the control signal. In one embodiment, the DC/DC converter includes a flyback converter. The control signal is produced by a winding of a transformer in the flyback converter. In another embodiment, the DC/DC converter includes a buck converter. The control signal is produced by an inductor winding in the buck converter.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The driver may include a feedback device configured to sample the current and in response thereto to control a switching operation of the DC/DC converter.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein for purposes of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;LED&#x201d; should be understood to include any electroluminescent diode or other type of carrier injection/junction-based system that is capable of generating radiation in response to an electric signal. Thus, the term LED includes, but is not limited to, various semiconductor-based structures that emit light in response to current, light emitting polymers, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), electroluminescent strips, and the like. In particular, the term LED refers to light emitting diodes of all types (including semi-conductor and organic light emitting diodes) that may be configured to generate radiation in one or more of the infrared spectrum, ultraviolet spectrum, and various portions of the visible spectrum (generally including radiation wavelengths from approximately 400 nanometers to approximately 700 nanometers). Some examples of LEDs include, but are not limited to, various types of infrared LEDs, ultraviolet LEDs, red LEDs, blue LEDs, green LEDs, yellow LEDs, amber LEDs, orange LEDs, and white LEDs (discussed further below). It also should be appreciated that LEDs may be configured and/or controlled to generate radiation having various bandwidths (e.g., full widths at half maximum, or FWHM) for a given spectrum (e.g., narrow bandwidth, broad bandwidth), and a variety of dominant wavelengths within a given general color categorization.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, one implementation of an LED configured to generate essentially white light (e.g., a white LED) may include a number of dies which respectively emit different spectra of electroluminescence that, in combination, mix to form essentially white light. In another implementation, a white light LED may be associated with a phosphor material that converts electroluminescence having a first spectrum to a different second spectrum. In one example of this implementation, electroluminescence having a relatively short wavelength and narrow bandwidth spectrum &#x201c;pumps&#x201d; the phosphor material, which in turn radiates longer wavelength radiation having a somewhat broader spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It should also be understood that the term LED does not limit the physical and/or electrical package type of an LED. For example, as discussed above, an LED may refer to a single light emitting device having multiple dies that are configured to respectively emit different spectra of radiation (e.g., that may or may not be individually controllable). Also, an LED may be associated with a phosphor that is considered as an integral part of the LED (e.g., some types of white LEDs). In general, the term LED may refer to packaged LEDs, non-packaged LEDs, surface mount LEDs, chip-on-board LEDs, T-package mount LEDs, radial package LEDs, power package LEDs, LEDs including some type of encasement and/or optical element (e.g., a diffusing lens), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;light source&#x201d; should be understood to refer to any one or more of a variety of radiation sources, including, but not limited to, LED-based sources (including one or more LEDs as defined above), incandescent sources (e.g., filament lamps, halogen lamps), fluorescent sources, phosphorescent sources, high-intensity discharge sources (e.g., sodium vapor, mercury vapor, and metal halide lamps), lasers, other types of electroluminescent sources, pyro-luminescent sources (e.g., flames), candle-luminescent sources (e.g., gas mantles, carbon arc radiation sources), photo-luminescent sources (e.g., gaseous discharge sources), cathode luminescent sources using electronic satiation, galvano-luminescent sources, crystallo-luminescent sources, kine-luminescent sources, thermo-luminescent sources, triboluminescent sources, sonoluminescent sources, radioluminescent sources, and luminescent polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A given light source may be configured to generate electromagnetic radiation within the visible spectrum, outside the visible spectrum, or a combination of both. Hence, the terms &#x201c;light&#x201d; and &#x201c;radiation&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. Additionally, a light source may include as an integral component one or more filters (e.g., color filters), lenses, or other optical components. Also, it should be understood that light sources may be configured for a variety of applications, including, but not limited to, indication, display, and/or illumination. An &#x201c;illumination source&#x201d; is a light source that is particularly configured to generate radiation having a sufficient intensity to effectively illuminate an interior or exterior space. In this context, &#x201c;sufficient intensity&#x201d; refers to sufficient radiant power in the visible spectrum generated in the space or environment (the unit &#x201c;lumens&#x201d; often is employed to represent the total light output from a light source in all directions, in terms of radiant power or &#x201c;luminous flux&#x201d;) to provide ambient illumination (i.e., light that may be perceived indirectly and that may be, for example, reflected off of one or more of a variety of intervening surfaces before being perceived in whole or in part).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;spectrum&#x201d; should be understood to refer to any one or more frequencies (or wavelengths) of radiation produced by one or more light sources. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;spectrum&#x201d; refers to frequencies (or wavelengths) not only in the visible range, but also frequencies (or wavelengths) in the infrared, ultraviolet, and other areas of the overall electromagnetic spectrum. Also, a given spectrum may have a relatively narrow bandwidth (e.g., a FWHM having essentially few frequency or wavelength components) or a relatively wide bandwidth (several frequency or wavelength components having various relative strengths). It should also be appreciated that a given spectrum may be the result of a mixing of two or more other spectra (e.g., mixing radiation respectively emitted from multiple light sources).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For purposes of this disclosure, the term &#x201c;color&#x201d; is used interchangeably with the term &#x201c;spectrum.&#x201d; However, the term &#x201c;color&#x201d; generally is used to refer primarily to a property of radiation that is perceivable by an observer (although this usage is not intended to limit the scope of this term). Accordingly, the terms &#x201c;different colors&#x201d; implicitly refer to multiple spectra having different wavelength components and/or bandwidths. It also should be appreciated that the term &#x201c;color&#x201d; may be used in connection with both white and non-white light. The term &#x201c;color temperature&#x201d; generally is used herein in connection with white light, although this usage is not intended to limit the scope of this term. Color temperature essentially refers to a particular color content or shade (e.g., reddish, bluish) of white light. The color temperature of a given radiation sample conventionally is characterized according to the temperature in degrees Kelvin (K) of a black body radiator that radiates essentially the same spectrum as the radiation sample in question. Black body radiator color temperatures generally fall within a range of from approximately 700 degrees K (typically considered the first visible to the human eye) to over 10,000 degrees K; white light generally is perceived at color temperatures above 1500-2000 degrees K. Lower color temperatures generally indicate white light having a more significant red component or a &#x201c;warmer feel,&#x201d; while higher color temperatures generally indicate white light having a more significant blue component or a &#x201c;cooler feel.&#x201d; By way of example, fire has a color temperature of approximately 1,800 degrees K, a conventional incandescent bulb has a color temperature of approximately 2848 degrees K, early morning daylight has a color temperature of approximately 3,000 degrees K, and overcast midday skies have a color temperature of approximately 10,000 degrees K. A color image viewed under white light having a color temperature of approximately 3,000 degree K has a relatively reddish tone, whereas the same color image viewed under white light having a color temperature of approximately 10,000 degrees K has a relatively bluish tone.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term &#x201c;lighting unit&#x201d; is used herein to refer to an apparatus including one or more light sources of same or different types. A given lighting unit may have any one of a variety of mounting arrangements for the light source(s), enclosure/housing arrangements and shapes, and/or electrical and mechanical connection configurations. Additionally, a given lighting unit optionally may be associated with (e.g., include, be coupled to and/or packaged together with) various other components (e.g., control circuitry) relating to the operation of the light source(s). An &#x201c;LED-based lighting unit&#x201d; refers to a lighting unit that includes one or more LED-based light sources as discussed above, alone or in combination with other non LED-based light sources. A &#x201c;multi-channel&#x201d; lighting unit refers to an LED-based or non LED-based lighting unit that includes at least two light sources configured to respectively generate different spectrums of radiation, wherein each different source spectrum may be referred to as a &#x201c;channel&#x201d; of the multi-channel lighting unit.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Applicants have recognized and appreciated that it would be beneficial to allow for the independent and efficient adjustment of current through one channel of a two channel LED driver while keeping the current in the un-adjusted channel constant. In view of the foregoing, various embodiments and implementations of the present invention are directed to providing a DC/DC converter with a control arrangement for controlling the current supplied to at least one of the two channels in response to a control signal produced by the DC/DC converter.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a functional block diagram of a lighting unit <b>100</b>. Lighting unit <b>100</b> includes a driver <b>110</b> and first through N<sup>th </sup>channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-N, for example, light emitting diodes (LEDs). In one exemplary arrangement, the light sources in first through N<sup>th </sup>channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-N are light emitting diodes (LEDs).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Also, at least one of the light sources in each channel has a different color or color temperature than at least one of the light sources in each of the other channels. In some embodiments, all of the light sources in each channel have a different color or color temperature than all of the light sources in each of the other channels. In an example embodiment, there may be two channels and the first channel may include &#x201c;white&#x201d; light sources (e.g., LEDs) and the second channel may include non-white &#x201c;colored&#x201d; (e.g., red) light sources (e.g., LEDs). Many such example embodiments are possible. In one embodimentt, N=2 and the first and second channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> are connected in series with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Driver <b>110</b> includes AC/DC converter <b>130</b>, DC/DC converter <b>140</b>, current control device <b>160</b>, a sensor <b>170</b>, a current monitor <b>180</b>, and a feedback controller <b>190</b>. In some embodiments, the driver may be supplied with a DC voltage (for example, form an external AC/DC converter), in which case AC/DC converter <b>130</b> may be omitted. In some embodiments in particular, sensor <b>170</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In embodiments where it is included, AC/DC converter <b>130</b> converts an AC voltage such as 120 VAC to a DC voltage and may include an input filter and a voltage rectifier.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">DC/DC converter <b>140</b> converts a DC voltage (e.g., output by AC/DC converter <b>130</b>) to a desired voltage level for driving first through N<sup>th </sup>channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-N. Beneficially, DC/DC converter may include two stages comprising: a flyback converter as a first stage or front end, which converts a first DC voltage to a second DC; and a &#x201c;Buck&#x201d; converter as a second stage or back end converting the second DC voltage to an output DC voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Current control device <b>160</b> supplies and controls current from the output of DC/DC converter <b>140</b> to first through N<sup>th </sup>channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-N. In particular, current control device <b>160</b> receives a current control signal <b>175</b> derived from DC/DC converter <b>140</b> and in response thereto controls the current through one or more of the first through N<sup>th </sup>channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-N. In a beneficial arrangement, current control device includes a pulse width modulator (PWM) type switch is provided across a selection of the light sources as necessary to achieve a desired lighting effect for lighting unit <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In embodiments where it is included, sensor <b>170</b> senses heat or light generated by first through N<sup>th </sup>channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-N and provides a feedback signal <b>185</b> to feedback controller <b>190</b> for adjusting DC voltage output by DC/DC converter <b>140</b> to maintain a desired lighting effect by lighting unit <b>100</b> as components age, environmental conditions change, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Current monitor <b>180</b> monitors or samples the current through first through N<sup>th </sup>channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-N and provides a current sample signal <b>195</b> to feedback controller <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Feedback controller <b>190</b> receives the current sample signal from current monitor <b>180</b> and in response thereto provides one or more control signals to DC/DC converter <b>140</b> for adjusting the output voltage of DC/DC converter <b>140</b>. Beneficially, the feedback loop with feedback controller <b>190</b> current, maintains the current through first through N<sup>th </sup>channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-N, and hence the light level of lighting unit <b>100</b>, constant with any change in the input voltage or load.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In lighting unit <b>100</b>, a number of variables are available to achieve a desired lighting effect: the choice of light source, (i.e., the number and color temperatures of the light sources in first through N<sup>th </sup>channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-N); the selection and number of light sources controlled by current control device <b>160</b>; internal and output voltages of DC/DC converter <b>140</b>; and the mechanism for producing the control signal <b>175</b> in DC/DC converter <b>140</b> all provide means that can be adjusted or determined to provide the necessary drive current for first through N<sup>th </sup>channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-N. Once determined and designed, then the lighting affect achieved by lighting unit <b>100</b> can be altered or fine-tuned by changing or adjusting an internal voltage and/or output voltage of DC/DC converter <b>140</b>. The voltage(s) can be fixed at the factory pending the utilization of a particular batch or bin of light sources (e.g., LEDs), or may be adjusted by means of a feedback loop with sensor <b>170</b> to maintain the desired lighting effect with variations in environmental and aging conditions, or may be adjusted by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further explanation of lighting unit <b>100</b> will now be provided with reference to specific exemplary embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a first embodiment of a lighting unit <b>200</b>. Lighting unit <b>200</b> includes a driver <b>210</b> and first and second channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In lighting unit <b>200</b>, first and second channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> are connected in series with each other. As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment the light sources are LEDs. Also beneficially, at least one of the light sources in each channel has a different color or color temperature than at least one of the light sources in each of the other channels. In some embodiments, all of the light sources in each channel have a different color or color temperature than all of the light sources in each of the other channels. In an example embodiment, the light sources in the first channel <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> are &#x201c;white&#x201d; light sources (e.g., white LEDs) and the light sources in the second channel <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> are non-white &#x201c;colored&#x201d; (e.g., red) light sources (e.g., red LEDs). Many such example embodiments are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Driver <b>210</b> includes an AC/DC converter <b>230</b>, a flyback converter <b>240</b>, a flyback drive unit <b>244</b>, a flyback control unit <b>246</b>, a flyback feedback unit <b>248</b>, a buck converter <b>245</b>, a pulse width modulator (PWM) switch <b>260</b>, a current sampling resistor <b>280</b>, and a buck converter feedback control and drive unit <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">AC/DC converter <b>230</b> receives an input AC voltage from AC input <b>205</b> and converts the AC voltage to a first DC voltage. AC/DC converter <b>230</b> may include an input filter and rectifier.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Flyback converter <b>240</b> includes a flyback transformer <b>242</b>, a switching device, a diode, and a capacitor. Flyback converter <b>240</b> comprises a first stage or front end of the DC/DC converter of driver <b>210</b>. Flyback converter <b>240</b> receives a first DC voltage from AC/DC converter <b>230</b> and outputs a second DC voltage which may be adjusted by proper selection of turn ratios in flyback transformer <b>242</b> and the feedback and switching control operations of flyback drive unit <b>244</b>, flyback control unit <b>246</b>, and flyback feedback unit <b>248</b>. In some embodiments, flyback converter <b>240</b> may provide active power factor correction to the input line current, i.e., the load seen by the AC input <b>205</b>. In some embodiments, flyback converter <b>240</b> may also provide safety isolation between AC input <b>205</b> and the user or light sources in channels <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b>. Otherwise, the configuration and operation of flyback converters are well known and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Buck converter <b>245</b> comprises a second stage or back end of the DC/DC converter of driver <b>210</b>. Buck converter <b>245</b> receives the second DC voltage from flyback converter <b>240</b> and produces an output voltage that causes a current to flow through first and second channels of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a function diagram of one embodiment of a buck converter <b>300</b> which may be employed in lighting unit <b>200</b>. Buck converter <b>300</b> includes a switching device <b>310</b> (e.g., a transistor such as a switching field effect transistor (FET)), a diode <b>320</b>, an inductor <b>330</b>, and optionally a second inductor <b>520</b> which is inductively coupled to inductor <b>330</b>. The duty cycle of switching device <b>310</b> is controlled by a buck converter control signal <b>255</b> which is produced by buck converter feedback control and drive unit <b>290</b>, as will be explained in greater detail below. An explanation of optional second inductor <b>520</b> will be provided below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Otherwise, configuration and operation of buck converters are well known and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Current sampling resistor <b>280</b> samples the total current through the first channel of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and provides a current sampling signal to buck converter feedback control and drive unit <b>290</b>. In response to the current sampling signal, buck converter feedback control and drive unit <b>290</b> generates buck converter control signal <b>255</b> which, for example, controls the duty cycle of switching device <b>310</b> in buck converter <b>245</b>. This in turn controls the current through the first channel of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, feedback control and drive unit <b>290</b> may include an operational amplifier or comparator which compares the current sampling signal to a desired value and in response thereto adjusts the buck converter control signal <b>255</b>. In some embodiments, the current sampling resistor may be connected &#x201c;on the high side&#x201d; between the output voltage of buck converter <b>245</b> and the light sources, rather than between the light sources and the return voltage (e.g., ground). In some embodiments, other current sampling arrangements may be provided instead of the series current sampling resistor <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Nominally, the duty cycle of buck regulator <b>245</b> will set the ratio of the output voltage divided by the second DC voltage. In a beneficial arrangement, the control loop including sampling resistor <b>280</b>, buck converter feedback control and drive unit <b>290</b>, and buck converter <b>245</b> keeps the overall current though the first channel of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> constant with any change in the first DC voltage or load. Beneficially, this arrangement can provide for a regulated current through the light sources over a relatively wide range of first DC voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In lighting unit <b>200</b>, PWM switch <b>260</b> is a bipolar transistor, but in some embodiments, a different switching device may be employed. PWM switch <b>260</b> is connected across the light sources of the second channel of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> so as to periodically shunt or bypass the current that would otherwise flow through the second channel of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> in response to the control signal <b>275</b>. By varying the duty cycle of PWM switch <b>260</b>, the average current flowing through the second channel of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> is adjusted. This in turn adjusts the average light produced by the second channel of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>2</b>, which results in an adjustment of the overall intensity and color of the light produced by lighting unit <b>200</b>. In some embodiments the PWM switch may be connected on the &#x201c;high side&#x201d; of the series arrangement, across the first channel of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> instead of the second channel of light sources <b>120</b>-<b>2</b>. In general, PWM switch <b>260</b> may be connected across any selection of the light sources as necessary to achieve a desired lighting effect.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one particular arrangement, in lighting unit <b>200</b> the secondary winding of flyback transformer <b>242</b> is employed to provide control signal <b>275</b> for controlling PWM switch <b>260</b>. To achieve a desired lighting effect, a number of variables or parameters of lighting unit <b>200</b> can be adjusted. The choice of light sources (e.g., the number and color temperatures of the &#x201c;White&#x201d; light sources (e.g., LEDs) of first channel <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>, and the light sources of second channel <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> having a different color or color temperature); the placement of PWM switch <b>260</b>; the second DC voltage level; and the turns ratio of flyback transformer <b>242</b> all provide a means that can be adjusted or determined to provide the control signal for PWM switch <b>260</b>. Once determined and designed, then the lighting affect can be altered or fine-tuned by changing or adjusting the second DC voltage level. The second DC voltage level may be fixed at the factory pending the utilization of a particular batch or bin of light sources (e.g., LEDs)</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second DC voltage level may be adjusted by means of a feedback loop with a thermal and/or light sensor (e.g., sensor <b>170</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to maintain the desired lighting effect with variations in environmental and aging conditions, or it may be adjusted by the user. This feedback adjustment may occur on either the primary or secondary (isolated) side of flyback transformer <b>242</b>.</p>
