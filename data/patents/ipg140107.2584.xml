<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a solar cell, a solar cell system and a method for making the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An operating principle of a solar cell is the photoelectric effect of a semiconducting material. The solar cells can be roughly classified into silicon-based solar cells, gallium arsenide solar cells, and organic thin film solar cells.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A traditional silicon-based solar cell includes a rear electrode, a P-type silicon layer, an N-type silicon layer, and a front electrode. The P-type silicon layer can be made of polycrystalline silicon or monocrystalline silicon and has a first surface and a flat second surface opposite to the first surface. The rear electrode is located on and in ohmic contact with the first surface of the P-type silicon layer. The N-type silicon layer is formed on the second surface of the P-type silicon layer and serves as a photoelectric conversion element. The N-type silicon layer has a flat surface. The front electrode is located on the flat surface of the N-type silicon layer. The P-type silicon layer and the N-type silicon layer cooperatively form a P-N junction near an interface of the P-type silicon layer and the N-type silicon layer. In use, light directly irradiates the front electrode, and reaches the P-N junction through the front electrode and the N-type silicon layer. Consequently, a plurality of electron-hole pairs (carriers) can be generated in the P-N junction due to photon excitation. Electrons and holes in the electron-hole pairs can be separated from each other and separately move toward the rear electrode and the front electrode under an electrostatic potential. If a load is connected between the front electrode and the rear electrode, a current can flow through the load.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, a light absorbing efficiency of the P-N junction of the above solar cell is low, because partial photons in the incident light are absorbed by the front electrode and the N-type silicon layer. Thus, carriers generated by exciting of photons in the P-N junction are relatively sparse, and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of the solar cell is relatively low.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is needed, therefore, is to provide a solar cell having high photoelectric conversion efficiency and a method for making the same.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step S<b>13</b>, the at least one arc shaped solar cell <b>260</b> defines at least one arc shaped surface. The method of cutting the round solar cell preform <b>240</b> can be selected according to need. In one embodiment, the round solar cell preform <b>240</b> is cut into one of the at least one rectangular solar cell <b>250</b> and four of the least one arc shaped solar cells <b>260</b> along four cutting lines <b>245</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where the at least one rectangular solar cell <b>250</b> has a diagonal equal to the diameter of the round solar cell preform <b>240</b>.

In one embodiment, the round solar cell preform <b>240</b> is cut into three of the at least one rectangle solar cells <b>250</b> that are substantially the same and several of the at least one arc shaped solar cells <b>260</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Also, the round solar cell preform <b>240</b> can be used as a solar cell with the round side surface as photoreceptive surface.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The at least one rectangular solar cell <b>250</b> includes a first electrode layer <b>251</b>, a P-type silicon layer <b>252</b>, an N-type silicon layer <b>253</b>, and a second electrode layer <b>254</b> stacked on each other in that order and electrically connected in series. The P-type silicon layer <b>252</b> and the N-type silicon layer <b>253</b> are electrically connected with and contacting each other to form a P-N junction. In one embodiment, the at least one rectangular solar cell <b>250</b> can be used as a traditional silicon-based solar cell in which the light directly irradiates the at least one rectangular solar cell <b>250</b> from the first electrode layer <b>251</b> or the second electrode layer <b>254</b>. In one embodiment, the at least one rectangular solar cell <b>250</b> can be used as one type of solar cell in which the light directly irradiates the P-N junction from a side surface <b>256</b> of the at least one rectangular solar cell <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the at least one arc shaped solar cell <b>260</b> of one embodiment includes a first electrode layer <b>261</b>, a P-type silicon layer <b>262</b>, an N-type silicon layer <b>263</b>, and a second electrode layer <b>264</b>. The first electrode layer <b>261</b>, the P-type silicon layer <b>262</b>, the N-type silicon layer <b>263</b>, and the second electrode layer <b>264</b> can be arranged in series along the same direction, side by side, in that order, cooperatively forming an integrated structure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In particular, the P-type silicon layer <b>262</b> has an arc shaped first top surface <b>2661</b>, a planar first bottom surface <b>2671</b> opposite to and connecting to the arc shaped first top surface <b>2661</b>, a first side surface <b>2621</b> and a second side surface <b>2623</b> opposite to the first side surface <b>2621</b>. The N-type silicon layer <b>263</b> has an arc shaped second top surface <b>2662</b>, a planar second bottom surface <b>2672</b> opposite to and connecting to the arc shaped second top surface <b>2662</b>, a third side surface <b>2631</b> and a fourth side surface <b>2633</b> opposite to the third side surface <b>2631</b>. The first electrode layer <b>261</b> is electrically connected with and contacting the first side surface <b>2621</b> of the P-type silicon layer <b>262</b>. The second electrode layer <b>264</b> is electrically connected with and contacting the fourth side surface <b>2633</b> of the N-type silicon layer <b>263</b>. The second side surface <b>2623</b> of the P-type silicon layer <b>262</b> and the third side surface <b>2631</b> of the N-type silicon layer <b>263</b> are electrically connected with and contacting each other to form a P-N junction. The arc shaped first top surface <b>2661</b> and the arc shaped second top surface <b>2662</b> commonly form an arc shaped photoreceptive surface <b>266</b> to receive an incident light. The planar first bottom surface <b>2671</b> and the planar second bottom surface <b>2672</b> are coplanar to form a planar supporting surface <b>267</b> to mount the at least one arc shaped solar cell <b>260</b>. The arc shaped photoreceptive surface <b>266</b> and the planar supporting surface <b>267</b> connect to each other at line <b>268</b>. The P-N junction is exposed out from the arc shaped photoreceptive surface <b>266</b>. The at least one arc shaped solar cell <b>260</b> has a larger surface to receive an incident light because the arc shaped photoreceptive surface <b>266</b> is arc shaped. The arc shaped photoreceptive surface <b>266</b> can reduce the reflection of the incident light from different directions.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An inner electric field having a field direction from the N-type silicon layer <b>263</b> to the P-type silicon layer <b>262</b> is formed, because surplus electrons in the N-type silicon layer <b>263</b> diffuse across the P-N junction and reach the P-type silicon layer <b>262</b>. When a plurality of electron-hole pairs are generated in the P-N junction due to excitation of an incident light, the electrons and the holes are separated from each other under the inner electric field. Specifically, the electrons in the N-type silicon layer <b>263</b> move toward the second electrode layer <b>264</b>, and are gathered by the second electrode layer <b>264</b>. The holes in the P-type silicon layer <b>262</b> move toward the first electrode layer <b>261</b>, and are gathered by the first electrode layer <b>261</b>. Thus, a current is formed, thereby realizing a conversion from the light energy to the electrical energy.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In use, the incident light does not reach the P-N junction through the first electrode layer <b>261</b>, namely, the first electrode layer <b>261</b> will not obstruct the incident light to reach the P-N junction. Thus, the first electrode layer <b>261</b> can be a continuous planar shaped structure coated on an entirety of the first side surface <b>2621</b> of the P-type silicon layer <b>262</b>, or a lattice shaped structure partially coated on the on the first side surface <b>2621</b>. A material of the first electrode layer <b>261</b> is conductive material, such as metal, conducting polymer, indium tin oxide, and carbon nanotube structure. In one embodiment, the first electrode layer <b>261</b> is made of a metal layer having a continuous planar shaped structure and coated on the entirety of the first side surface <b>2621</b>. The metal can be aluminum, copper, or silver. A thickness of the first electrode layer <b>261</b> is not limited, and can be in a range from about 50 nm to about 300 nm. In one embodiment, the first electrode layer <b>261</b> is an aluminum sheet having a thickness of about 200 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, the incident light does not reach the P-N junction through the second electrode layer <b>264</b>. Thus, the second electrode layer <b>264</b> can be a continuous planar shaped structure coated on an entirety of the fourth side surface <b>2633</b> of the N-type silicon layer <b>263</b>, or a lattice shaped structure partially coated on the fourth side surface <b>2633</b>. A material of the second electrode layer <b>264</b> can be conductive material, such as metal, conducting polymer, indium tin oxide, and carbon nanotube structure. In one embodiment, the second electrode layer <b>264</b> is made of a metal layer having a continuous planar shaped structure and coated on the entirety of the fourth side surface <b>2633</b>. The metal can be aluminum, copper, or silver. A thickness of the second electrode layer <b>264</b> is not limited, and can be in a range from about 50 nm to about 300 nm. In one embodiment, the second electrode layer <b>264</b> is an aluminum sheet having a thickness of 200 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, the material of the first electrode layer <b>261</b> and the second electrode layer <b>264</b> can be opaque to avoid leakage of the incident light passing through the first electrode layer <b>261</b> and the second electrode layer <b>264</b>, thus the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the at least one arc shaped solar cell <b>260</b> is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the incident light irradiates the arc shaped photoreceptive surface <b>266</b> of the at least one arc shaped solar cell <b>260</b>, since the P-N junction is directly exposed from the arc shaped photoreceptive surface <b>266</b>, the photons in the incident light directly reach the P-N junction without passing through the second electrode layer <b>264</b> and the first electrode layer <b>261</b>, and can be directly absorbed by the P-N junction. Accordingly, the second electrode layer <b>264</b> and the first electrode layer <b>261</b> cannot obstruct the incident light to reach the P-N junction, thereby increasing the light absorbing efficiency of the P-N junction. Correspondingly, the P-N junction can excite more electron-hole pairs under the irradiation of the incident light. In addition, the second electrode layer <b>264</b> can have any shape and cannot obstruct light. In one embodiment, the second electrode layer <b>264</b> having a planar shaped structure is coated on the entirety of the fourth side surface <b>2633</b>. Thus, the second electrode layer <b>264</b> has a large area, thereby decreasing the diffusing distance of the carriers in the second electrode layer <b>264</b> and the interior loss of the carriers, and increasing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the at least one arc shaped solar cell <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a step S<b>14</b> of forming a reflector <b>269</b> on the planar supporting surface <b>267</b> can be performed.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the reflector <b>269</b> can be a continuous reflection layer directly in contact with the planar supporting surface <b>267</b> and spaced from the first electrode layer <b>261</b> and the second electrode layer <b>264</b>.

In one embodiment, the reflector <b>269</b> is aluminum foil with a thickness of about 50 nm. The reflector <b>269</b> can be formed on the planar supporting surface <b>267</b> by vacuum evaporation or magnetron sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, the reflector <b>269</b> can be spaced from the planar supporting surface <b>267</b> by a transparent insulating layer (not shown).

The thickness of the transparent insulating layer can be in a range from about 10 nm to about 100 &#x3bc;m. In one embodiment, the thickness of the transparent insulating layer can be in a range from about 10 nm to about 50 nm in order to reduce the light absorption. The transparent insulating layer can be coated on the planar supporting surface <b>267</b> by physical vapor deposition or chemical vapor deposition. The reflector <b>269</b> can be formed on the transparent insulating layer by vacuum evaporation or magnetron sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, the reflector <b>269</b> can be free standing, suspended and spaced from the planar supporting surface <b>267</b>. The distance between the reflector <b>269</b> and the planar supporting surface <b>267</b> can be in a range from about 1 millimeters (mm) to about 5 centimeters (cm). If the reflector <b>269</b> is not free standing, a plate (not shown) can be used to support the reflector <b>269</b>. The term &#x201c;free standing&#x201d; means that the reflector can sustain the weight of itself when it is hoisted by a portion thereof without any significant damage to its structural integrity. The plate can be a glass plate, ceramic plate or silicon plate. The reflector <b>269</b> can be formed on the plate by vacuum evaporation or magnetron sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, the reflector <b>269</b> is a plurality of micro-structures. Each of the plurality of micro-structures can be a concave groove on the planar supporting surface <b>267</b> or a protrusion protruding from the planar supporting surface <b>267</b>. Each of the plurality of micro-structures can be V shaped, cylindrical, hemispherical, or pyramid-shaped. The micro-structures can be formed by etching the planar supporting surface <b>267</b>. Furthermore, the micro-structures can be coated with a reflecting material such as aluminum, gold, copper or silver by vacuum evaporation or magnetron sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Furthermore, a step S<b>15</b> of forming an antireflection layer (not shown) on the arc shaped photoreceptive surface <b>266</b> can be performed. The antireflection layer is used to decrease reflection of the incident light and increase absorption of the incident light. The antireflection layer can absorb little light. A material of the antireflection layer can be silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) or silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>). A thickness of the antireflection layer can be less than 150 nm. In one embodiment, the antireflection layer is the silicon nitride layer having the thickness of 900 angstrom (&#x212b;).</p>
