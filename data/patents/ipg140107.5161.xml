<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An expandable electrode pad having a flexible and stretchable base member that may be either expanded or compressed to provide proper positioning for a plurality of electrode distal contacts. Portions of the base member may have perforations that allow one or more sections of the base member to be separated and positioned a greater, non-stretchable distance away from the remaining strip of distal contacts. Additionally, the circuit body may comprise a distal cut zone that provides for freedom of movement of the plurality of distal contacts and a proximal perforated zone that eliminates lead wire entanglements while also allowing for the tearing of perforations between adjacent conductive circuits when a greater reach is required for the proper placement of a distal contact.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a device comprising multiple electrodes and multiple leads, particularly pads and leads for use in taking electrocardiograms wherein a plurality of electrical signals in a patient's body are monitored through his or her skin.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Electrocardiograph (ECG) monitors and recorders are widely used to obtain biopotential signals containing information indicative of the electrical activity associated with the heart and pulmonary system. To obtain biopotential signals, ECG electrodes are applied to the skin of a patient in various locations and coupled to an ECG monitor. Placement of the electrodes is dependent on the information sought by the clinician.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The placement of the ECG electrodes on the patient has been established by medical protocols. The most common protocols require the placement of the electrodes in a 3-lead, a 5-lead or a 12-lead configuration. A 3-lead configuration requires the placement of three electrodes; one electrode adjacent each clavicle bone on the upper chest and a third electrode adjacent the patient's lower left abdomen. A 5-lead configuration requires the placement of the three electrodes in the 3-lead configuration with the addition of a fourth electrode adjacent the sternum and a fifth electrode on the patient's lower right abdomen. A 12-lead configuration requires the placement of 10 electrodes on the patient's body. Four electrodes, which represent the patient's limbs, include the left arm electrode (LA), the right arm electrode (RA), the left leg electrode (LL), and the right leg electrode (RL). Six chest electrodes (V1-V6 leads) are placed on the patient's chest at various locations near the heart. Three additional references are constructed from measurements between the right arm and left arm (Lead I), the right arm and the left leg (Lead II) and the left arm to left leg (Lead III). The ten electrodes provide 12 measurement points consisting of I, II, III, AVR, AVL, AVF, and V1-V6 with the right leg electrode typically used as a ground.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The electrodes, after being positioned on the patient, connect to an ECG monitor by an ECG lead set. The distal end of the ECG lead set, or portion closest to the patient, connects to each electrode (alternatively, the electrodes may be integrated into the distal end of the ECG lead set) and receives biopotential signals from the body. The proximal end of the ECG lead set connects to the ECG input connector and supplies the biopotential signals received from the body to the ECG monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Proper placement of the ECG electrodes and proper connections of the ECG electrodes to the ECG lead sets is critical for obtaining the correct biopotential signals. Clinicians often have difficulty connecting ECG lead sets to ECG electrodes because the individual wires of the ECG lead set often become entangled or because the clinician must determine which individual wire connects to each electrode. In addition, the individual wires of the ECG lead sets are often long and cumbersome resulting in patient discomfort.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Issues with placement of electrodes and connection of the ECG lead set are often compounded during emergency situations. First responders and clinicians often place ECG electrodes on accident victim or heart attack sufferers to establish the medical condition. Any delay may result in adverse consequences. Other emergency treatments may require the rapid removal of ECG electrodes further compounding the issues with entanglement and re-connection.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present application provides an expandable multiple electrode device having multiple leads and methods of use thereof for preventing the aforementioned problems. Prior art attempts have consistently failed to provide a beneficial and efficient solution to such problems. Such prior art devices include U.S. Pat. No. 3,151,619 to Sullivan that focuses on providing an electrode with a self-contained quantity of electrolyte paste confined within a surrounding band or strip of pressure-sensitive adhesive seal that is adaptable to irregular surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">U.S. Pat. No. 4,233,987 to Feingold comprises electrodes for use in taking electrocardiograms by a multiple electrode pad formed as an elongate, narrow, curved strip with the electrodes arranged in a curvilinear relation to one another. The pad readily assumes the shape of the thorax or chest of a man, woman, or child at several desirable application sites, such as precordially, for routine or emergency use. The strip may be perforated or otherwise weakened in lines between the electrodes for tearing of the strip to separate the electrodes for individualized placement.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Pat. No. 6,205,346 to Akiva comprises an electrode apron for ECG which is comprised of an apron cast from flexible material to be placed over the chest of the patient, ten electrodes inlaid within the apron in predetermined places wherein six of the said electrodes are located at predetermined distances between the ribs, two under each shoulder and two at both sides of the stomach. Either curved or spiraled conductors are cast within flexible material and each conductor is connected to an electrode. A multiple-pronged cable feeds each of the conductors and includes a connector for connecting the apron to any standard ECG measuring device. The apron also has straps and a belt for tightening the apron on the body of the patient, locating the electrodes of the apron in their required locations for ECG tests.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">U.S. Pat. No. 6,847,836 to Sujdak comprises an ECG electrode chest pad particularly adapted for use in emergency room situations having upper fit portions with upper limb electrodes, and elongated central or medial base fit portion with a plurality of precordal unipolar electrodes and lower fit portions with lower limb electrodes, said electrodes being attached to leads which are internal to the base chest pad and terminate into at least one lead branch adapted to plug into an ECG monitor and having a perforation in the base pad material such that one group of electrodes may be separated from a second group of electrodes to facilitate ease of patient monitoring and complimentary medical procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2008/0177168 to Callahan et al. comprises an ECG lead set including an ECG electrode assembly and a lead set hub. The ECG electrode includes at least one electrode configured to receive biopotential signals from a patient, a plug connector for connecting said ECG electrode assembly, a web, connected between the at least one electrode and the plug connector and configured to form an electrical connection therebetween. The lead set hub includes at least one receptacle configured to receive the plug connector of the ECG electrode assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Electrodes of the prior art are typically provided in the form of standard fixed strips. However, a standard fixed strip of electrodes does not fit all patients due to variations in patient size, gender, weight, and other physical factors. The devices of the prior art do not allow for movement of the electrodes to allow for proper placement on different people having varying chest sizes; do not allow for exact placement of all the electrodes; and do not allow for electrodes to be separated or placed as a one-piece unit. The devices of the prior art also do not allow for a female person to remain wearing her undergarments while applying the electrode pad; and furthermore the devices of the prior art do not allow for &#x201c;V4R&#x201d; (V4R is a position on the body that is mid-clavicular over the fifth intercostal space and the R represents the patient's right side) to be obtained with the same electrode. These prior art fixed strips of electrodes must be sized to the patient and do not allow for movement to lengthen the distance between electrodes as is provided for by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Herein is described a device that allows for the electrodes to be stretched farther apart or pressed closer together as needed allowing the device to fit virtually all patients except for potentially the very small. This electrode pad comprises electrodes on a flexible and stretchy material allowing for speedy and accurate placement. This electrode strip can be stretched apart or pressed closer together for an accurate fit for children and adult patients of a wide range of sizes. The present invention provides a multitude of benefits including but not limited to faster performance of 12 lead electrocardiograph, facilitating application and decreasing application time, increasing wire management by reducing/eliminating tangles, improving readings due to less artifacts, increasing adhesion due to larger application area, improving female patient modesty by application around worn garments, facilitating evaluation of V4A (right side heart attack), providing a relatively low cost of manufacture for addition of significant functional benefits, providing a one-size-fits-all stretchable device allowing for both speed and accuracy in use, and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Herein is described an invention that allows for electrodes, for instance electrocardiogram electrodes but generally any medical electrode type or use including but not limited to electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, pain relief, and muscle stimulation, to be stretched farther apart or pressed closer together as needed allowing the device to fit virtually all patients except potentially the very small. Electrodes may perform the function of detecting and transmitting electric pulses from the body surface of a patient to a unit that processes the electrical pulses; electrodes may also perform the function of transmitting electrical pulses to the body, as is done, for instance, in electrotherapy applications. The electrode pad of the present invention comprises electrodes on a base member composed of flexible and stretchy material that provides for speedy and accurate electrode placement by allowing the electrodes to be &#x201c;stretched&#x201d; to a desired location on the body, even reaching underneath clothing if desired, and therefore overcoming the above described deficiencies of the prior art. The present electrode strip can be stretched apart or pressed closer together for an accurate fit for children and adult patients of a wide range of sizes and can therefore be utilized to accommodate variations in patient size, gender, weight, and other physical factors.</p>

An embodiment of an individual base member and associated electrode or snap <b>120</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36-39</figref>. The individual unit is identical to the ambulance embodiment disclosed above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref> and shares all of its structures with the exception being the exemplary shape of the base member <b>10</b> and each electrode unit starting without an attachment through the base member <b>10</b> to the other respective electrode units. A plurality of electrode units may be retained on one or more releasable adhesive backings <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>). This embodiment is not limited to the use of four electrode units and may comprise one or more individual electrode units disposed on one or more adhesive backings <b>41</b>. The adhesive backing <b>41</b> may comprise any shape or configuration, wherein a preferred embodiment of an adhesive backing <b>41</b> follows the outer contour of the plurality of electrode units and may further provide a tab <b>42</b> to facilitate grasping of the adhesive backing <b>41</b> and removal of each electrode unit (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>). Once the individual electrode units are positioned on the patient's body, conductive circuits <b>70</b> of the circuit body <b>20</b> may then attach to the snaps <b>120</b> or other electrode structure.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42-45</figref> depict an alternate embodiments and configurations of a device of the present invention. Respective conductive circuits <b>70</b> connecting each distal contact <b>22</b> to a respective proximal contact <b>21</b> may comprise an extra length of material or &#x201c;slack&#x201d; thereby allowing the base member <b>10</b> to stretch without causing harm to the conductive circuit <b>70</b>. As the base member <b>10</b> is stretched, the extra length of conductive circuit <b>70</b> (i.e. slack) is reduced accordingly. The plurality of proximal contacts <b>21</b> may provide a connecting structure to communicate with conventional monitoring devices or, alternatively, the plurality of proximal contacts <b>21</b> may connect to a wireless unit providing wireless communication to conventional monitoring devices set up to send and/or receive such wireless communications. The depicted embodiments within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 44</figref> further include perforations <b>31</b> within the base member <b>10</b> between two or more adjacent distal contacts <b>22</b>. The stretch characteristics and/or the ability for the base member <b>10</b> to tear away at the perforations <b>31</b> provide two methods alone or in combination that allow the plurality of distal contact <b>22</b> of the present inventive device to achieve additional reach distance thereby providing a one-size fits-all device for patients. As disclosed with previous embodiments, each of the plurality of distal contact <b>22</b> may also be provided with a covering of conductive medium <b>90</b> to assist or enhance the electrical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46-49</figref> depict an exemplary assortment of base member <b>10</b> configurations. These embodiments are only shown as illustrative examples and base members <b>10</b> of the present invention may comprise any shape or configuration known within the art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> depicts generally rectangular base member <b>10</b> units connected by segments, wherein the connecting segments may or may not have perforations <b>31</b> therein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> depicts a generally rectangular base member <b>10</b>, wherein the base member <b>10</b> may or may not have perforations <b>31</b> therein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> depicts generally oval base member <b>10</b> units connected by segments, wherein the connecting segments may or may not have perforations <b>31</b> therein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> depicts generally oval base member <b>10</b> units, wherein the oval base member <b>10</b> units may or may not have perforations <b>31</b> therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50-51</figref> depict additional alternate embodiments of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> generally comprises a stretchable base member <b>10</b> having perforations <b>31</b> between each adjacent electrode unit and a circuit body <b>20</b> having a cut zone <b>35</b> located distal to a perforated zone <b>30</b>. The perforations <b>31</b> within both the base member <b>10</b> and the perforation zone <b>30</b> of the circuit body <b>20</b> help reduce wire entanglement issues while providing a means to stretch and/or add reach length to each electrode unit as may be necessary for patients of all dimension and sizes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> depicts the use of multiple units of devices of the present invention to provide as many distal contacts <b>22</b> as are needed. All embodiments of the present invention may use any number of distal contacts <b>22</b> ranging from one to infinity. Additional distal contacts <b>22</b> may be provided as need for any current or future procedure by using multiple devices of the present invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, by constructing and providing devices of the present invention with the required number of distal contacts <b>22</b>, by providing as many individual distal contacts <b>22</b> as are required (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36-41</figref>), and the like. Thus the present invention is freely expandable to new technologies that may require any number of additional leads and distal contacts <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52-60</figref> depict an embodiment of a connector cable assembly <b>300</b> of the present invention. The connector cable assembly <b>300</b> may attach to the plurality of proximal contact <b>21</b> of the circuit body <b>20</b> of the present invention. The connector cable assembly <b>300</b> may comprise a clip base <b>125</b> having a plurality of conductive surfaces <b>130</b> for electrically communicating with said plurality of proximal contacts <b>21</b>, a pressure arm <b>135</b> pivotable between and open and a closed configuration relative to the clip base <b>125</b>, and a cable <b>140</b> extending from the clip base <b>125</b> proximally to an electrical monitoring device. The pressure arm <b>135</b> may be biased to the closed position for retaining the plurality of proximal contacts <b>21</b> therein. The bias of the pressure arm <b>135</b> may be provided by any method known within the art including but not limited to a spring <b>150</b> providing a the bias force by pivoting the pressure arm <b>135</b> about the axis of a dowel or rod <b>145</b> extending through the pressure arm <b>135</b> and into the clip base <b>125</b>. While the connector cable assembly <b>300</b> depicted within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52-60</figref> is shown having a plurality of conductive surfaces <b>130</b> wherein six (6) conductive surfaces <b>130</b> are shown, the scope of the present invention includes any and all number of conductive surfaces <b>130</b> that may be incorporated into the connector cable assembly <b>300</b> of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Generally speaking, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref>, <b>23</b>-<b>24</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>50</b>, a snap <b>120</b> or a distal contact <b>22</b> of the circuit body <b>20</b> may pass through a contact aperture <b>23</b> within the base member <b>10</b> of the conductive circuit <b>70</b>. As the base member <b>10</b> is stretched to fit larger people, the one or more conductive circuits <b>70</b> may separate (as needed) within the perforated zone <b>30</b> of the circuit body <b>20</b> via the perforations <b>31</b> disposed therein thereby allowing the base member <b>10</b> to stretch as needed without damaging the one or more individual conductive circuits <b>70</b>. The base member may also, or alternatively, separate at perforations <b>31</b> disposed through the base member <b>10</b> material.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As the device is applied it is stretched to allow each contact <b>20</b> to be placed in the proper position on the patient's chest such that the conductive gel or other conductive medium <b>90</b> contacts the skin of the chest wall and receives or transmits electrical signals from or to the patient's body. Received electrical signals are transferred through the conductive medium <b>90</b> and then through the distal contact <b>22</b> and into the respective conductive circuits <b>70</b> that in turn transfer the signals to another device such that each signal is ultimately seen as a waveform. As the base member <b>10</b> is stretched to allow for the exact placement needed, the perforations <b>30</b> between the conductive circuits <b>70</b> within the perforated zone <b>30</b> separate allowing the base member <b>10</b> to move freely until attached to the chest wall with an adhesive that may be disposed on the bottom of the base member <b>10</b>. If needed, the distal contacts <b>22</b> may be separated from the device and placed either as individual distal contacts <b>22</b> or as groups of distal contacts <b>22</b>. For example, if a female wishes not to remove her bra or undergarments, the device can be separated and the V1 and V2 leads can be placed on the upper chest and the V3 through V6 leads can be placed on the lower chest area without removing the patient's bra or undergarments. In addition, if V4R is needed, the present inventive design allows for the V4 distal contact <b>22</b> to be separated and moved to the right chest area for evaluation of V4R.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In order to manufacture the device, the base member <b>10</b> can be stamped out and the distal contacts <b>22</b> poked or pushed through or adhered to the bottom of the base member <b>10</b>. The conductive circuits <b>70</b> may be attached to their respective distal contact <b>20</b> with a wide variety of connection methods including but not limited to conductive gel, liquid paste, dry or powder conductive mediums <b>90</b> added to the bottom surface of each distal contact <b>20</b> to increase the electrical signal gathered, and the like. The conductive circuits <b>70</b> may be printed by any method of circuit printing known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The device <b>200</b> of the present invention may be configured to perform the majority of, if not all, cardiac monitoring. These additional duties and functions may be possible simply by changing the circuit connector at the plurality of proximal contacts <b>21</b>, adding more contacts <b>20</b>, and/or adding more perforations <b>31</b>. The present inventive device <b>200</b> allows for placement of a distal contact <b>22</b> almost anywhere on a patient's body. This device <b>200</b> can be used for EEG (electroencephalogram) procedures, as addition to any other locations where an electrical impulse generated by the body would need to be gathered. The device <b>200</b> can be made one-size-fits-all, with a possible exception for infants and neonates.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The device <b>200</b> can be used by a person wishing to perform a 12-lead ECG on a patient having chest pains or for any other medically necessary reason. In use, the device <b>200</b> may be removed from its package and connected to the 12-lead monitor. The proper placements for the chest leads are then located. The V1 distal contact <b>22</b> is placed upon the skin directly over the fourth intercostal space just to the right side of the patient's sternum. The device <b>200</b> is then stretched, if necessary, and the V2 distal contact <b>22</b> is placed directly over the fourth intercostal space on the left side of the patient's sternum. The V4 distal contact <b>22</b> is then placed over the fifth intercostal space in the mid-clavicular area. The V3 distal contact <b>22</b> is then located between V2 and V4 forming a straight line. The V5 distal contact <b>22</b> is then placed halfway between V4 and the fifth intercostal space mid-auxiliary on the patient. The V6 distal contact <b>22</b> is then placed directly over the fifth intercostal space mid-auxiliary. The 12-lead machine may then be used to read the signal received from the placement of the device <b>200</b>. Between every distal contact <b>22</b> placement occurring after the first distal contact <b>22</b> placement, the base member <b>10</b> of the device <b>200</b> may be stretched and/or the perforations <b>31</b> within the perforated zone <b>30</b> of the circuit body <b>20</b> may be torn to provide any further reach or positioning movement that is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In alternative embodiments, the device <b>200</b> of the present invention can be used anywhere a disposable device is needed to gather electrical signals where the device <b>200</b> may accommodate various sizes and different shapes. As non-limiting examples, both a veterinarian and a brain surgeon may highly benefit from the use of a device <b>200</b> of the present invention. With increased insulation and/or greater electrode size, the present inventive device <b>200</b> may also have beneficial uses in electrical shock therapy. In non-medical uses, an electrician may use the instant device <b>200</b> to determine the exact location of an electrical short in circuits found in homes, cars, ships, and the like. Telephone companies and/or cable companies may also attach the present inventive device <b>200</b> to wires in order to read the electrical signals from the wires and thereby pinpoint signal leak locations.</p>
