<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A semiconductor memory device includes a cell array having a plurality of first wirings and a plurality of second wirings intersecting each other and memory cells disposed at intersections between the plurality of first wirings and the plurality of second wirings. The semiconductor memory device further includes a control circuit for selectively driving the plurality of first wirings and the plurality of second wirings. The control circuit applies a first voltage for a first operation to a first select wiring and applies a second voltage for a second operation different from the first operation to a second select wiring and applies a third voltage for the first and second operation to a third select wiring. The first operation is completed before the second operation is completed. The control circuit applies a fourth voltage for a third operation to a forth select wiring before the second operation is completed.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device for nonvolatilely writing data in accordance with application of a voltage to a variable resistive element.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, attention has been focused on a nonvolatile memory comprising memory cells each containing a variable resistive element, which are connected at intersections of word lines and bit lines and arranged in matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Known examples of the nonvolatile memory of such the type include: a PRAM (Phase-Change Random Access Memory) that uses a chalcogenide element as the variable resistive element; a ReRAM (Resistance Random Access memory) that uses a transition metal oxide element; and a CBRAM (Conductive Bridging RAM) that changes the resistance by precipitating metal cations to form a bridge between electrodes and ionizing the precipitated metal to destruct the bridge. These variable resistive memories are characterized in that the variation in resistance is stored as information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The PCRAM utilizes the shape, such as the magnitude and the width, of a current/voltage pulse applied to the chalcogenide element to control the process from heating to cooling, thereby causing a phase change between the crystalline state and the amorphous state to control the resistance of the element (see Patent Document 1: JP 2002-541613T).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The ReRAM includes the bipolar type and the unipolar type. In the case of the biolar type, the direction of the current/voltage pulse applied to the transition metal oxide element is used to control the resistance of the element. On the other hand, in the case of the unipolar type, the magnitude and the width of the current/voltage pulse applied to the transition metal oxide element are used to control the resistance of the element.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the case of the ReRAM of the unipolar type, data can be programmed in a variable resistive memory by applying a program voltage of around 4.0 V to the variable resistive element (actually about 6V including a voltage drop of diode) for around 10 ns, thereby changing the variable resistive element from a high-resistance state to a low-resistance state. This state change is referred to as &#x201c;program&#x201d; or &#x201c;set&#x201d;. When an erase voltage of around 0.7 V is applied to the data-programmed variable resistive element (actually about 2.2 V including a voltage drop of diode) and a flow of current of 1-10 uA is applied for 200 ns to 1 us, the variable resistive element is changed from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state. This state change is referred to as &#x201c;erase&#x201d; or &#x201c;reset&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The memory cell has a high-resistance state as a stable state (reset state or erase state), and a low-resistance state as a set state or program state, for example. In a case of two-bit per cell, data is written by a set operation of applying a set pulse to only the cell to be programmed among the memory cells in the reset state, for example. In an erase operation, a reset pulse is applied, irrespective of the cell state (set state or reset state).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A read operation of the memory cell involves applying a voltage of 0.4V (actually about 1.9V including a voltage drop of diode) to a variable resistive element and monitoring a current flowing via the variable resistive element. Thereby, the data stored in the variable resistive element is read by detecting whether the variable resistive element is in the low-resistance state or the high-resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A certain processing time is required for performing the set operation, reset operation or read operation for a memory cell array provided on a semiconductor substrate. Particularly, the reset operation requires a longer voltage application time and takes a longer time for processing than the set operation. In a sequence control of performing the other operation (e.g., set operation) for the other memory cell array after completing the operation (e.g., reset operation) for one memory cell array, the succeeding operation waits until the preceding operation is ended.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A flash memory having a plurality of cores, each being a set of blocks in units of data erase, and capable of simultaneously performing the data write or erase operation in one core and the data read operation in the other core was described in patent application 2. However, in patent application 2, since a control circuit is provided for each core, the operation for the other memory block cannot be started until the operation for one memory block is ended in a plurality of memory blocks within the core. Also, since the memory block is a unit of data erase, the simultaneous operation is not allowed for each memory cell array within the memory block. Therefore, the time required for the operation of the semiconductor memory device is longer, whereby the processing capacity can not be increased.</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A first embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">[Entire Configuration]</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a nonvolatile memory according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The nonvolatile memory comprises a memory cell array <b>1</b> of memory cells arranged in matrix, each memory cell including a later-described variable resistive element, as in a PCRAM (Phase-Change RAM) and a ReRAM (Resistance RAM). A column control circuit <b>2</b> is provided on a position adjacent to the memory cell array <b>1</b> in the bit line BL direction. It controls the bit line BL in the memory cell array <b>1</b> to erase data from the memory cell, write data in the memory cell, and read data out of the memory cell. A row control circuit <b>3</b> is provided on a position adjacent to the memory cell array <b>1</b> in the word lie WL direction. It selects the word line WL in the memory cell array <b>1</b> and applies voltages required to erase data from the memory cell, write data in the memory cell, and read data out of the memory cell. The column control circuit <b>2</b> and the row control circuit <b>3</b> configure a data read/write circuit for use in data read/write to the memory cell array <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A data I/O buffer <b>4</b> is connected to an external host device, now shown, to receive write data, receive erase instructions, provide read data, and receive address data and command data from/to the host device. The data I/O buffer <b>4</b> sends received write data to the column control circuit <b>2</b> and receives read-out data from the column control circuit <b>2</b> and provides it to external.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An address fed from the external host device to the data I/O buffer <b>4</b> is sent via an address register <b>5</b> to the column control circuit <b>2</b> and the row control circuit <b>3</b>. A command fed from the external host device to the data I/O buffer <b>4</b> is sent to a command interface <b>6</b>. The command interface <b>6</b> receives an external control signal from external and decides whether the data fed to the data I/O buffer <b>4</b> is write data, a command or an address. If it is a command, then the command interface transfers it as a received command signal to a state machine <b>7</b>. The state machine <b>7</b> manages the entire nonvolatile memory to receive commands from the external host device, read, write, erase, and execute data I/O management. The external host device can also receive status information managed by the state machine <b>7</b> and decide the operation result. The status information is also utilized in control of write and erase.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The state machine <b>7</b> controls the pulse generator <b>9</b>. Under this control, the pulse generator <b>9</b> is allowed to provide a pulse of any voltage at any timing. The pulse formed herein can be transferred to any line selected by the column control circuit <b>2</b> and the row control circuit <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Peripheral circuit elements other than the memory cell array <b>1</b> can be formed in a Si substrate immediately beneath the memory array <b>1</b> formed in a wiring layer. Thus, the chip area of the nonvolatile memory can be made almost equal to the area of the memory cell array <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">There are plural first lines or word lines WL<b>0</b>-WL<b>2</b> disposed in parallel, which cross plural second lines or bit lines BL<b>0</b>-BL<b>2</b> disposed in parallel. A memory cell MC is arranged at each intersection of both lines as sandwiched therebetween. Desirably, the first and second lines are composed of heat-resistive low-resistance material such as W, WSi, NiSi, CoSi.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The memory cell MC comprises a serial connection circuit of a variable resistive element VR and a non-ohmic element NO as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The variable resistive element VR can vary the resistance through current, heat, of chemical energy on voltage application. Arranged on an upper and a lower surface thereof are electrodes EL<b>1</b>, EL<b>2</b> serving as a barrier metal layer and an adhesive layer. Material of the electrodes may include Pt, Au, Ag, TiAlN, SrRuO, Ru, RuN, Ir, Co, Ti, TiN, TaN, LaNiO, Al, PtIrOx, PtRhOx, Rh/TaAlN. A metal film capable of achieving uniform orientation may also be interposed. A buffer layer, a barrier metal layer and an adhesive layer may further be interposed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Available examples of the variable resistive element VR include: one that changes the resistance in accordance with a phase change between the crystalline state and the amorphous state, such as a chalcogenide (PCRAM); one that changes the resistance by precipitating metal cations to form a bridge (contacting bridge) between electrodes and ionizing the precipitated metal to destruct the bridge (CBRAM); and one that changes the resistance by applying a voltage or current (ReRAM) (which is roughly divided into one that causes a variation in resistance in accordance with the presence/absence of charge trapped in charge traps present in the electrode interface, and one that causes a variation in resistance in accordance with the presence/absence of the conduction path due to an oxygen loss and so forth).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show example of the ReRAM. The variable resistive element VR shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a recording layer <b>12</b> arranged between electrode layers <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>. The recording layer <b>12</b> is composed of a composite compound containing at least two types of cation elements. At least one of the cation elements is a transition element having the d-orbit incompletely filled with electrons, and the shortest distance between adjacent cation element is 0.32 nm or less. Specifically, it is represented by a chemical formula A<sub>x</sub>M<sub>y</sub>X<sub>z </sub>(A and M are different elements) and may be formed of material having a crystal structure such as a spinel structure (AM<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), an ilmenite structure (AMO<sub>3</sub>), a delafossite structure (AMO<sub>2</sub>), a LiMoN<sub>2 </sub>structure (AMN<sub>2</sub>), a wolframite structure (AMO<sub>4</sub>), an olivine structure (A<sub>2</sub>MO<sub>4</sub>), a hollandite structure (A<sub>x</sub>MO<sub>2</sub>), a ramsdellite structure (A<sub>x</sub>MO<sub>2</sub>), and a perovskite structure (AMO<sub>3</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, A comprises Zn, M comprises Mn, and X comprises O. In the recording layer <b>12</b>, a small white circle represents a diffused ion (Zn), a large white circle represents an anion (0), and a small black circle represents a transition element ion (Mn). The initial state of the recording layer <b>12</b> is the high-resistance state. When the electrode layer <b>11</b> is kept at a fixed potential and a negative voltage is applied to the electrode layer <b>13</b>, part of diffused ions in the recording layer <b>12</b> migrate toward the electrode layer <b>13</b> to reduce diffused ions the recording layer <b>12</b> relative to anions. The diffused ions arrived at the electrode layer <b>13</b> accept electrons from the electrode layer <b>13</b> and precipitate as a metal, thereby forming a metal layer <b>14</b>. Inside the recording layer <b>12</b>, anions become excessive and consequently increase the valence of the transition element ion in the recording layer <b>12</b>. As a result, the carrier injection brings the recording layer <b>12</b> into electron conduction and thus completes setting. On regeneration, a current may be allowed to flow, of which value is very small so that the material configuring the recording layer <b>12</b> causes no resistance variation. The programmed state (low-resistance state) may be reset to the initial state (high-resistance state) by supplying a large current flow in the recording layer <b>12</b> for sufficient time, which causes Joule heating to facilitate the oxidation reduction reaction in the recording layer <b>12</b>. Application of an electric field in the opposite direction from that at the time of setting may also allow resetting.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a recording layer <b>15</b> sandwiched between the electrode layers <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> is formed of two layers: a first compound layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>and a second compound layer <b>15</b><i>b</i>. The first compound layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>is arranged on the side close to the electrode layer <b>11</b> and represented by a chemical formula A<sub>x</sub>M<b>1</b><sub>y</sub>X<b>1</b><sub>z</sub>. The second compound layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>is arranged on the side close to the electrode layer <b>13</b> and has cavity sites capable of accommodating cation elements from the first compound layer <b>15</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, A comprises Mg, M<b>1</b> comprises Mn, and X<b>1</b> comprises O in the first compound layer <b>15</b><i>a</i>. The second compound layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>contains Ti shown with black circles as transition element ions. In the first compound layer <b>15</b><i>a</i>, a small white circle represents a diffused ion (Mg), a large white circle represents an anion (0), and a double circle represents a transition element ion (Mn). The first compound layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>and the second compound layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>may be stacked in multiple layers such as two or more layers.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In such the variable resistive element VR, potentials are given to the electrode layer <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> so that the first compound layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>serves as an anode and the second compound layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>serves as a cathode to cause a potential gradient in the recording layer <b>15</b>. In this case, part of diffused ions in the first compound layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>migrate through the crystal and enter the second compound layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>on the cathode side. The crystal of the second compound layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>includes cavity sites capable of accommodating diffused ions. Accordingly, the diffused ions moved from the first compound layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>are trapped in the cavity sites. Therefore, the valence of the transition element ion in the first compound layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>increases while the valence of the transition element ion in the second compound layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>decreases. In the initial state, the first and second compound layers <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>may be in the high-resistance state. In such the case, migration of part of diffused ions in the first compound layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>thereform into the second compound layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>generates conduction carriers in the crystals of the first and second compounds, and thus both have electric conduction. The programmed state (low-resistance state) may be reset to the erased state (high-resistance state <b>9</b> by supplying large current flow in the recording layer <b>15</b> for sufficient time for Joule heating to facilitate the oxidation reduction reaction in the recording layer <b>15</b>, like in the preceding example. Application of an electric field in the opposite direction from that at the time of setting may also allow reset.</p>
