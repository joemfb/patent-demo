<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention involves the ejection of ink drops by way of forming gas or vapor bubbles in a bubble forming liquid. This principle is generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,747,120 to Stemme.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There are various known types of thermal ink jet (bubblejet) printhead devices. Two typical devices of this type, one made by Hewlett Packard and the other by Canon, have ink ejection nozzles and chambers for storing ink adjacent the nozzles. Each chamber is covered by a so-called nozzle plate, which is a separately fabricated item and which is mechanically secured to the walls of the chamber. In certain prior art devices, the top plate is made of Kapton&#x2122; which is a Dupont trade name for a polyimide film, which has been laser-drilled to form the nozzles. These devices also include heater elements in thermal contact with ink that is disposed adjacent the nozzles, for heating the ink thereby forming gas bubbles in the ink. The gas bubbles generate pressures in the ink causing ink drops to be ejected through the nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Before printing, the chambers need to be primed with ink. During operation, the chambers may deprime. If the chamber is not primed the nozzle will not eject ink. Thus it is useful to detect the presence or absence of ink in the chambers. However, the microscopic scale of the chambers and nozzles makes the incorporation of sensors difficult and adds extra complexity to the fabrication process.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The resistive heaters operate in an extremely harsh environment. They must heat and cool in rapid succession to form bubbles in the electable liquid, usually a water soluble ink. These conditions are highly conducive to the oxidation and corrosion of the heater material. Dissolved oxygen in the ink can attack the heater surface and oxidise the heater material. In extreme circumstances, the heaters &#x2018;burn out&#x2019; whereby complete oxidation of parts of the heater breaks the heating circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The heater can also be eroded by &#x2018;cavitation&#x2019; caused by the severe hydraulic forces associated with the surface tension of a collapsing bubble.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To protect against the effects of oxidation, corrosion and cavitation on the heater material, inkjet manufacturers use stacked protective layers, typically made from Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, SiC and Ta. In certain prior art devices, the protective layers are relatively thick. U.S. Pat. No. 6,786,575 to Anderson et al (assigned to Lexmark) for example, has 0.7 &#x3bc;m of protective layers for &#x2dc;0.1 &#x3bc;m thick heater.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">To form a vapor bubble in the bubble forming liquid, the surface of the protective layers in contact with the bubble forming liquid must be heated to the superheat limit of the liquid (&#x2dc;300&#xb0; C. for water). This requires that the heater and the entire thickness of its protective layers be heated to 300&#xb0; C. If the protective layers are much thicker than the heater, they will absorb a lot more heat. If this heat cannot be dissipated between successive firings of the nozzle, the ink in the nozzles will boil continuously and the nozzles will stop ejecting. Consequently, the heat absorbed by the protective layers limits the density of the nozzles on the printhead and the nozzle firing rate. This in turn has an impact on the print resolution, the printhead size, the print speed and the manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Attempts to increase nozzle density and firing rate are hindered by limitations on thermal conduction out of the printhead integrated circuit (chip), which is currently the primary cooling mechanism of printheads on the market. Existing printheads on the market require a large heat sink to dissipate heat absorbed from the printhead IC.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Inkjet printheads can also suffer from nozzle clogging from dried ink. During periods of inactivity, evaporation of the volatile component of the bubble forming liquid will occur at the liquid-air interface in the nozzle. This will decrease the concentration of the volatile component in the liquid near the heater and increase the viscosity of the liquid in the chamber. The decrease in concentration of the volatile component will result in the production of less vapor in the bubble, so the bubble impulse (pressure integrated over area and time) will be reduced: this will decrease the momentum of ink forced through the nozzle and the likelihood of drop break-off. The increase in viscosity will also decrease the momentum of ink forced, through the nozzle and increase the critical wavelength for the Rayleigh Taylor instability governing drop break-off, decreasing the likelihood of drop break-off. If the nozzle is left idle for too long, the nozzle is unable to eject the liquid in the chamber. Hence each nozzle has a maximum time that it can remain unfired before evaporation will clog the nozzle.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention aims to overcome or ameliorate some of the problems of the prior art, or at least provide a useful alternative.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a first aspect, the present invention provides an inkjet printhead comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0019">a plurality of nozzles;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0020">a bubble forming chamber corresponding to each of the nozzles respectively, the bubble forming chambers adapted to contain ejectable liquid; and,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0021">a heater element disposed in each of the bubble forming chambers respectively, the heater element configured for heating some of the ejectable liquid above its boiling point to form a gas bubble that causes the ejection of a drop of the ejectable liquid from the nozzle; wherein,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0022">the heater element is formed from a transition metal nitride with an additive whose oxidation is thermodynamically favored above all other elements in the transition metal nitride, such that the heater element is self passivating.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">Transition metal nitrides have high thermal stability, hardness, wear resistance, chemical inertness and corrosion resistance, because of the high degree of covalency of the metal nitride bonds. The metallic bonding in some transition metal nitrides such as TiN and TaN can also result in low resistivity suitable for inkjet heaters. However, TiN is not self passivating as it oxidises readily. Testing has shown that nozzles using uncoated TiN heaters ejected no more than a few tens of thousands of droplets before the heater went open circuit (that is, the heater element burned out due to oxidative failure). TaN was also found to have inadequate oxidation resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">The Applicant resolved the oxidation problem by introducing an additive that allows the metal nitride to self passivate. Self passivation is defined below, but basically entails the incorporation of an additive whose oxidation is thermodynamically favored so that it forms a surface oxide layer with a low diffusion coefficient for oxygen to provide a barrier to further oxidation. This can provide the heater element with excellent oxidation resistance such that a protective coating becomes unnecessary. Thinning or removing the protective coatings can greatly reduce the energy needed to form a bubble.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">Preferably, the additive is aluminium. Alternatively, the additive is chromium. In particular embodiments, the self passivating transition metal nitride is TiAlN. In a particularly preferred form, the printhead further comprises control, circuitry for driving the heater elements with a driver voltage of approximately 3.3 Volts, wherein the self passivating transition metal nitride has a resistivity between 1.5 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m to 8 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m. Optionally, the control, circuitry drives the heater elements with a driver voltage of approximately 5 Volts, wherein the self passivating transition metal nitride has a resistivity between 1.5 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m to 30 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m. In other embodiments, the control circuitry drives the heater elements with a driver voltage of approximately 12 Volts, and the transition metal nitride has a resistivity between 6 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m to 150 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m. Preferably, each heater element requires an actuation energy of less than 500 nanojoules (nJ) to heat that heater element sufficiently to form said bubble causing the ejection of said drop.</p>

Terminology
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0159">As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the ejection of a drop of the ejectable liquid as described herein, is caused by the generation of a vapor bubble in a bubble forming liquid, which, in embodiments, is the same body of liquid as the ejectable liquid. The generated bubble causes an increase in pressure in ejectable liquid, which forces the drop through the relevant nozzle. The bubble is generated by Joule heating of a heater element which is in thermal contact with the ink. The electrical pulse applied to the heater is of brief duration, typically less than 2 microseconds. Due to stored heat in the liquid, the bubble expands for a few microseconds after the heater pulse is turned off. As the vapor cools, it recondenses, resulting in bubble collapse. The bubble collapses to a point determined by the dynamic interplay of inertia and surface tension of the ink. In this specification, such a point is referred to as the &#x201c;point of collapse&#x201d; of the bubble.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0160">Throughout this specification, &#x2018;self passivation&#x2019; refers to the incorporation of an additive whose oxidation is thermodynamically favored above the other elements in the heater. The additive forms a surface oxide layer with a low diffusion coefficient for oxygen so as to provide a barrier to further oxidation. Accordingly, a &#x2018;self passivating&#x2019; material has the ability to form such a surface oxide layer. The self passivating component need not be aluminium: any other additive whose oxidation is thermodynamically favored over the other components will form an oxide on the heater surface provided this oxide has a low oxygen diffusion rate (comparable to aluminium oxide), the additive will be a suitable alternative to aluminium.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0161">Throughout the specification, references to &#x2018;self cooled&#x2019; or &#x2018;self cooling&#x2019; nozzles will be understood to be nozzles in which the energy required to eject a drop of the ejectable liquid is less than the maximum amount of thermal energy that can be removed by the drop, being the energy required to heat a volume of the ejectable fluid equivalent to the drop volume from the temperature at which the fluid enters the printhead to the heterogeneous boiling point of the ejectable fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0162">Throughout this specification, the &#x2018;nozzle length&#x2019; refers to the distance, in the direction of droplet travel, of the sidewall defining a nozzle aperture, from the interior of the chamber to the external edge of the nozzle plate, or nozzle rim projecting from the nozzle plate. This dimension of the nozzle aperture influences the viscous drag on the ink drop as it is ejected from the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0163">The printhead according to the invention comprises a plurality of nozzles, as well as a chamber and one or more heater elements corresponding to each nozzle. Each portion of the printhead pertaining to a single nozzle, its chamber and its one or more elements, is referred to herein, as a &#x201c;unit cell&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0164">In this specification, where reference is made to parts being in thermal contact with each other, this means that they are positioned relative to each other such that, when one of the parts is heated, it is capable of heating the other part, even though the parts, themselves, might not be in physical contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0165">Also, the term &#x201c;ink&#x201d; is used to signify any ejectable liquid, and is not limited to conventional inks containing colored dyes. Examples of non-colored inks include fixatives, infra-red absorber inks, functionalized chemicals, adhesives, biological fluids, water and other solvents, and so on. The ink or ejectable liquid also need not necessarily be a strictly a liquid, and may contain a suspension of solid particles or be solid at room temperature and liquid at the ejection temperature.</p>

<p id="p-0176" num="0231">In the description than follows, corresponding reference numerals, or corresponding prefixes of reference numerals (i.e. the parts of the reference numerals appearing before a point mark) which are used in different figures relate to corresponding parts. Where there are corresponding prefixes and differing suffixes to the reference numerals, these indicate different specific embodiments of corresponding parts.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Overview of the Invention and General Discussion of Operation</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0232">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the unit cell <b>1</b> of a printhead according to an embodiment of the invention comprises a nozzle plate <b>2</b> with nozzles <b>3</b> therein, the nozzles having nozzle rims <b>4</b>, and apertures <b>5</b> extending through the nozzle plate. The nozzle plate <b>2</b> is plasma etched from a silicon nitride structure which is deposited, by way of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), over a sacrificial material which is subsequently etched.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0233">The printhead also includes, with respect to each nozzle <b>3</b>, side walls <b>6</b> on which the nozzle plate is supported, a chamber <b>7</b> defined by the walls and the nozzle plate <b>2</b>, a multi-layer substrate <b>8</b> and an inlet passage <b>9</b> extending through the multi-layer substrate to the far side (not shown) of the substrate. A looped, elongate heater element <b>10</b> is suspended within the chamber <b>7</b>, so that the element is in the form of a suspended beam. The printhead as shown is a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) structure, which is formed by a lithographic process which is described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0234">When the printhead is in use, ink <b>11</b> from a reservoir (not shown) enters the chamber <b>7</b> via the inlet passage <b>9</b>, so that the chamber fills to the level as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thereafter, the heater element <b>10</b> is heated for somewhat less than 1 microsecond (&#x3bc;s), so that the heating is in the form of a thermal pulse. It will be appreciated that the heater element <b>10</b> is in thermal contact with the ink <b>11</b> in the chamber <b>7</b> so that when the element is heated, this causes the generation of vapor bubbles <b>12</b> in the ink. Accordingly, the ink <b>11</b> constitutes a bubble forming liquid. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the formation of a bubble <b>12</b> approximately 1 &#x3bc;s after generation of the thermal pulse, that is, when the bubble has just nucleated on the heater elements <b>10</b>. It will be appreciated that, as the heat is applied in the form of a pulse, all the energy necessary to generate the bubble <b>12</b> is to be supplied within that short time.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0235">Turning briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, there is shown a mask <b>13</b> for forming a heater <b>14</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>) of the printhead (which heater includes the element <b>10</b> referred to above), during a lithographic process, as described in more detail below. As the mask <b>13</b> is used to form the heater <b>14</b>, the shapes of several of its parts correspond to the shape of the element <b>10</b>. The mask <b>13</b> therefore provides a useful reference by which to identify various parts of the heater <b>14</b>. The heater <b>14</b> has electrodes <b>15</b> corresponding to the parts designated <b>15</b>,<b>34</b> of the mask <b>13</b> and a heater element <b>10</b> corresponding to the parts designated <b>10</b>,<b>34</b> of the mask. In operation, voltage is applied across the electrodes <b>15</b> to cause current to How through the element <b>10</b>. The electrodes <b>15</b> are much thicker than the element <b>10</b> so that most of the electrical resistance is provided by the element. Thus, nearly all of the power consumed in operating the heater <b>14</b> is dissipated via the element <b>10</b>, in creating the thermal pulse referred to above.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0236">When the element <b>10</b> is heated as described above, the bubble <b>12</b> forms along the length of the element, this bubble appearing, in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as four bubble portions, one for each of the element portions shown in cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0237">The bubble <b>12</b>, once generated, causes an increase in pressure within the chamber <b>7</b>, which in turn causes the ejection of a drop <b>16</b> of the ink <b>11</b> through the nozzle <b>3</b>. The rim <b>4</b> assists in directing the drop <b>16</b> as it is ejected, so as to minimize the chance of drop misdirection.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0238">The reason that there is only one nozzle <b>3</b> and chamber <b>7</b> per inlet passage <b>9</b> is so that the pressure wave generated within the chamber, on heating of the element <b>10</b> and forming of a bubble <b>12</b>, does not affect adjacent chambers and their corresponding nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0239">The advantages of the heater element <b>10</b> being suspended rather than embedded in any solid material, are discussed below. However, there are also advantages to bonding the heater element to the internal surfaces of the chamber. These are discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0240"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show the unit cell <b>1</b> at two successive later stages of operation of the printhead. It can be seen that the bubble <b>12</b> generates further, and hence grows, with the resultant advancement of ink <b>11</b> through the nozzle <b>3</b>. The shape of the bubble <b>12</b> as it grows, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is determined by a combination of the inertial dynamics and the surface tension of the ink <b>11</b>. The surface tension tends to minimize the surface area of the bubble <b>12</b> so that, by the time a certain amount of liquid has evaporated, the bubble is essentially disk-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0241">The increase in pressure within the chamber <b>7</b> not only pushes ink <b>11</b> out through the nozzle <b>3</b>, but also pushes some ink back through the inlet passage <b>9</b>. However, the inlet passage <b>9</b> is approximately 200 to 300 microns in length, and is only about 16 microns in diameter. Hence there is a substantial inertia and viscous drag limiting back flow. As a result, the predominant effect of the pressure rise in the chamber <b>7</b> is to force ink out through the nozzle <b>3</b> as an ejected drop <b>16</b>, rather than back through the inlet passage <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0242">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the printhead is shown at a still further successive stage of operation, in which the ink drop <b>16</b> that is being ejected is shown during its &#x201c;necking phase&#x201d; before the drop breaks off. At this stage, the bubble <b>12</b> has already reached its maximum size and has then begun to collapse towards the point of collapse <b>17</b>, as reflected in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0243">The collapsing of the bubble <b>12</b> towards the point of collapse <b>17</b> causes some ink <b>11</b> to be drawn from within the nozzle <b>3</b> (from the sides <b>18</b> of the drop), and some to be drawn from the inlet passage <b>9</b>, towards the point of collapse. Most of the ink <b>11</b> drawn in this manner is drawn from the nozzle <b>3</b>, forming an annular neck <b>19</b> at the base of the drop <b>16</b> prior to its breaking off.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0244">The drop <b>16</b> requires a certain amount of momentum to overcome surface tension forces, in order to break off. As ink <b>11</b> is drawn from the nozzle <b>3</b> by the collapse of the bubble <b>12</b>, the diameter of the neck <b>19</b> reduces thereby reducing the amount of total surface tension holding the drop, so that the momentum of the drop as it is ejected out of the nozzle is sufficient to allow the drop to break off.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0245">When the drop <b>16</b> breaks off, cavitation forces are caused as reflected by the arrows <b>20</b>, as the bubble <b>12</b> collapses to the point of collapse <b>17</b>. It will be noted that there are no solid surfaces in the vicinity of the point of collapse <b>17</b> on which the cavitation can have an effect.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Manufacturing Process</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0246">Relevant parts of the manufacturing process of a printhead according to embodiments of the invention are now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 33</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0247">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, there is shown a cross-section through a silicon substrate portion <b>21</b>, being a portion of a Memjet&#x2122; printhead, at an intermediate stage in the production process thereof. This figure relates to that portion of the printhead corresponding to a unit cell <b>1</b>. The description of the manufacturing process that follows will be in relation to a unit cell <b>1</b>, although it will be appreciated that the process will be applied to a multitude of adjacent unit cells of which the whole printhead is composed.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0248"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> represents the next successive step, during the manufacturing process, after the completion of a standard CMOS fabrication process, including the fabrication of CMOS drive transistors (not shown) in the region <b>22</b> in the substrate portion <b>21</b>, and the completion of standard CMOS interconnect layers <b>23</b> and passivation layer <b>24</b>. Wiring indicated by the dashed lines <b>25</b> electrically interconnects the transistors and other drive circuitry (also not shown) and the heater element corresponding to the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0249">Guard rings <b>26</b> are formed in the metallization of the interconnect layers <b>23</b> to prevent ink <b>11</b> from diffusing from the region, designated <b>27</b>, where the nozzle of the unit cell <b>1</b> will be formed, through the substrate portion <b>21</b> to the region containing the wiring <b>25</b>, and corroding the CMOS circuitry disposed in the region designated <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0250">The first stage after the completion of the CMOS fabrication process consists of etching a portion of the passivation layer <b>24</b> to form the passivation recesses <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0251"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the stage of production after the etching of the interconnect layers <b>23</b>, to form an opening <b>30</b>. The opening <b>30</b> is to constitute the ink inlet passage to the chamber that will be formed later in the process.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0252"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the stage of production after the etching of a hole <b>31</b> in the substrate portion <b>21</b> at a position where the nozzle <b>3</b> is to be formed. Later in the production process, a further hole (indicated by the dashed line <b>32</b>) will be etched from the other side (not shown) of the substrate portion <b>21</b> to join up with the hole <b>31</b>, to complete the inlet passage to the chamber. Thus, the hole <b>32</b> will not have to be etched all the way from the other side of the substrate portion <b>21</b> to the level of the interconnect layers <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0253">If, instead, the hole <b>32</b> were to be etched all the way to the interconnect layers <b>23</b>, then to avoid the hole <b>32</b> being etched so as to destroy the transistors in the region <b>22</b>, the hole <b>32</b> would have to be etched a greater distance away from that region so as to leave a suitable margin (indicated by the arrow <b>34</b>) for etching inaccuracies. But the etching of the hole <b>31</b> from the top of the substrate portion <b>21</b>, and the resultant shortened depth of the hole <b>32</b>, means that a lesser margin <b>34</b> need be left, and that a substantially higher packing density of nozzles can thus be achieved.</p>

<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Bonded Heater Element</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0268">In other embodiments, the heater elements are bonded to the internal walls of the chamber. Bonding the heater to solid surfaces within the chamber allows the etching and deposition fabrication process to be simplified. However, heat conduction to the silicon substrate can reduce the efficiency of the nozzle so that it is no longer &#x2018;self cooling&#x2019;. Therefore, in embodiments where the heater is bonded to solid surfaces within the chamber, it is necessary to take steps to thermally isolate the heater from the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0269">One way of improving the thermal isolation between the heater and the substrate is to find a material with better thermal barrier properties than silicon dioxide, which is the traditionally used thermal barrier layer, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,513,298. The Applicant has shown that the relevant parameter to consider when selecting the barrier layer, is the thermal product, (&#x3c1;Ck)<sup>1/2</sup>. The energy lost into a solid underlayer in contact with the heater is proportional to the thermal product of the underlayer, a relationship which may be derived by considering the length scale for thermal diffusion and the thermal energy absorbed over that length scale. Given that proportionality, it can be seen that a thermal barrier layer with reduced density and thermal conductivity will absorb less energy from the heater. This aspect of the invention focuses on the use of materials with reduced density and thermal conductivity as thermal barrier layers inserted underneath the heater layer, replacing the traditional silicon dioxide layer. In particular, this aspect of the invention focuses on the use of low-k dielectrics as thermal barriers</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0270">Low-k dielectrics have recently been used as the inter-metal dielectric of copper damascene integrated circuit technology. When used as an inter-metal dielectric, the reduced density and in some cases porosity of the low-k dielectrics help reduce the dielectric constant of the inter-metal dielectric, the capacitance between metal lines and the RC delay of the integrated circuit. In the copper damascene application, an undesirable consequence of the reduced dielectric density is poor thermal conductivity, which limits heat flow from the chip. In the thermal barrier application, low thermal conductivity is ideal, as it limits the energy absorbed from the heater.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0271">Two examples of low-k dielectrics suitable for application as thermal barriers are Applied Material's Black Diamond&#x2122; and Novellus' Coral&#x2122;, both of which are CVD deposited SiOCH films. These films have lower density than SiO<sub>2</sub>(&#x2dc;1340 kgm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>vs &#x2dc;2200 kgm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) and lower thermal conductivity (&#x2dc;0.4 Wm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>vs &#x2dc;1.46 Wm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The thermal products for these materials are thus around 600 Jm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1/2</sup>, compared to</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0272">1495 Jm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1/2 </sup>for SiO<sub>2 </sub>i.e. a 60% reduction in thermal product. To calculate the benefit that may be derived by replacing SiO<sub>2 </sub>underlayers with these materials, models using equation 3 in the Detailed Description can be used to show that &#x2dc;35% of the energy required to nucleate a bubble is lost by thermal diffusion into the underlayer when SiO<sub>2 </sub>underlayers are used. The benefit of the replacement is therefore 60% of 35% i.e. a 21% reduction in nucleation energy. This benefit has been confirmed by the Applicant by comparing the energy required to nucleate a bubble on

</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0275">The latter required 20% less energy for the onset of bubble nucleation, as determined by viewing the bubble formation stroboscopically in an open pool boiling configuration, using water as a test fluid. The open pool boiling was run for over 1 billion actuations, without any shift in nucleation energy or degradation of the bubble, indicating the underlayer is thermally stable up to the superheat limit of the water i.e. &#x2dc;300&#xb0; C. Indeed, such layers can be thermally stable up to 550&#xb0; C., as described in work related to the use of these films as Cu diffusion barriers (sec &#x201c;Physical and Barrier Properties of Amorphous Silicon-Oxycarbide Deposited by PECVD from Octamethylcycltetrasiloxane&#x201d;, Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 151 (2004) by Chiu-Chih Chiang et. al.).</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0276">Further reduction in thermal conductivity, thermal product and the energy required to nucleate a bubble may be provided by introducing porosity into the dielectric, as has been done by Trikon Technologies, Inc. with their ORION&#x2122; 2.2 porous SiOCH film, which has a density of &#x2dc;1040 kgm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>and thermal conductivity of &#x2dc;0.16 Wm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(see IST 2000 30043, &#x201c;Final report on thermal modeling&#x201d;, from the IST project &#x201c;Ultra Low K. Dielectrics For Damascene Copper Interconnect Schemes&#x201d;). With a thermal product of &#x2dc;334 Jm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1/2</sup>, this material would absorb 78% less energy than a SiO<sub>2 </sub>underlayer, resulting in a 78*35%=27% reduction in the energy required to nucleate a bubble. It is possible however that the introduction of porosity may compromise the moisture resistance of the material, which would compromise the thermal properties, since water has a thermal product of 1579 Jm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1/2</sup>, close to that of SiO<sub>2</sub>. A moisture barrier could be introduced between the heater and the thermal barrier, but the heat absorption in this layer would likely degrade overall efficiency: in the preferred embodiment the thermal barrier is directly in contact with the underside of the heater. If it is not in direct contact, the thermal barrier layer is preferably no more than 1 &#x3bc;m away from the heater layer, as it will have little effect otherwise (the length scale for heat diffusion in the &#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;s time scale of the heating pulse in e.g. SiO<sub>2 </sub>is &#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;m).</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0277">An alternative for further lowering thermal conductivity without using porosity is to use the spin-on dielectrics, such as Dow Corning's SiLK&#x2122;, which has a thermal conductivity of 0.18 Wm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The spin-on films can also be made porous, but as with the CVD films, that may compromise moisture resistance. SiLK has thermal stability up to 450&#xb0; C. One point of concern regarding the spin-on dielectrics is that they generally have large coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs). Indeed, it seems that reducing k generally increases the CTE. This is implied in &#x201c;A Study of Current Multilevel Interconnect Technologies for 90 nm Nodes and Beyond&#x201d;, by Takayuki Ohba, Fujitsu magazine. Volume 38-1, paper 3. SiLK, for example, has a CTE of &#x2dc;70 ppm&#xb7;K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This is likely to be much larger than the CTE of the overlying heater material, so large stresses and delamination are likely to result from heating to the &#x2dc;300&#xb0; C. superheat limit of water based ink. SiOCH films, on the other hand, have a reasonably low CTE of &#x2dc;10 ppm.K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which in the Applicant's devices, matches the CTE of the TiAlN heater material: no delamination of the heater was observed in the Applicant's open pool testing after 1 billion bubble nucleations. Since the heater materials used in the inkjet application are likely to have CTEs around &#x2dc;10 ppm.K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the CVD deposited films are preferred over the spin-on films.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0278">One final point of interest relating to this application relates to the lateral definition of the thermal barrier. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,861,902 the thermal barrier layer is modified after deposition so that a region of low thermal diffusivity exists immediately underneath the heater, while further out a region of high thermal diffusivity exists. The arrangement is designed to resolve two conflicting requirements:
<ul id="ul0031" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0031-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0032" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0032-0001" num="0279">1. that the heater be thermally isolated from the substrate to reduce the energy of ejection and</li>
        <li id="ul0032-0002" num="0280">2. that the printhead chip be cooled by thermal conduction out the rear face of the chip.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0281">Such an arrangement is unnecessary in the Applicant's nozzles, which are designed to be self cooling, in the sense that the only heat removal required by the chip is the heat removed by ejected droplets. Formally, &#x2018;self cooled&#x2019; or &#x2018;self cooling&#x2019; nozzles can be defined to be nozzles in which the energy required to eject a drop of the ejectable liquid is less than the maximum amount of thermal energy that can be removed by the drop, being the energy required to heat a volume of the ejectable fluid equivalent to the drop volume from the temperature at which the fluid enters the printhead to the heterogeneous boiling point of the ejectable fluid. In this case, the steady state temperature of the printhead chip will be less than the heterogenous boiling point of the ejectable fluid, regardless of nozzle density, firing rates or the presence or otherwise of a conductive heatsink. If a nozzle is self cooling, the heat is removed from the front face of the printhead via the ejected droplets, and does not need to be transported to the rear face of the chip. Thus the thermal barrier layer does not need to be patterned to confine it to the region underneath the heaters. This simplifies the processing of the device. In fact, a CVD SiOCH may simply be inserted between the CMOS top layer passivation and the heater layer. This is now discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0282"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 9</figref> schematically show two bonded heater embodiments; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> the heater <b>10</b> is bonded to the floor of the chamber <b>7</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> bond the heater to the roof of the chamber.

<p id="p-0224" num="0283">Referring firstly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the heater element <b>10</b> is bonded to the floor of the ink chamber <b>7</b>. In this case the heater layer <b>38</b> is deposited on the passivation layer <b>24</b> after the etching the passivation recesses <b>29</b> (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), before etching of the ink inlet holes <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> and deposition of the sacrificial layer <b>35</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>). This rearrangement of the manufacturing sequence prevents the heater material <b>38</b> from being deposited in the holes <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>. In this case the heater layer <b>38</b> lies underneath the sacrificial layer <b>35</b>. This allows the roof layer <b>50</b> to be deposited on the sacrificial layer <b>35</b>, instead of the heater layer <b>38</b> as is the case in the suspended heater embodiments. No other sacrificial layers are required if the heater element <b>10</b> is bonded to the chamber floor, whereas suspended heater embodiments need the deposition and subsequent etching of the second sacrificial layer <b>42</b> above described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 to 35</figref>. To maintain the efficiency of the printhead, a low thermal product layer <b>25</b> can be deposited on the passivation layer <b>24</b> so that it lies between the heater element <b>10</b> and the rest of the substrate <b>8</b>. The thermal product of a material and its ability to thermally isolate the heater element <b>10</b> is discussed above and in greater detail below with reference to equation 3.

<p id="p-0225" num="0284"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> show the heater element <b>10</b> is bonded to the roof of the ink chamber <b>7</b>. In terms of the suspended heater fabrication process described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 44</figref>, the heater layer <b>38</b> is deposited on top of the sacrificial layer <b>35</b>, so the manufacturing sequence is unchanged until after the heater layer <b>38</b> is patterned and etched. At that point the roof layer <b>44</b> is then deposited on top of the etched heater layer <b>38</b>, without an intervening sacrificial layer. A low thermal product layer <b>25</b> can be included in the roof layer <b>44</b> so that the heater layer <b>38</b> is in contact with the low thermal product layer, thereby reducing thermal loss into the roof <b>50</b> during the heating pulse.</p>

<p id="p-0226" num="0285">Referring once again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the unit cell <b>1</b> shown, as mentioned above, is shown with part of the walls <b>6</b> and nozzle plate <b>2</b> cut-away, which reveals the interior of the chamber <b>7</b>. The heater <b>14</b> is not shown cut away, so that both halves of the heater element <b>10</b> can be seen.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0286">In operation, ink <b>11</b> passes through the ink inlet passage <b>9</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>) to fill the chamber <b>7</b>. Then a voltage is applied across the electrodes <b>15</b> to establish a flow of electric current through the heater element <b>10</b>. This heats the element <b>10</b>, as described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to form a vapor bubble in the ink within the chamber <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0287">The various possible structures for the heater <b>14</b>, some of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37</figref>, <b>39</b> and <b>41</b>, and <b>42</b>, can result in there being many variations in the ratio of length to width of the heater elements <b>10</b>. Such variations (even though the surface area of the elements <b>10</b> may be the same) may have significant effects on the electrical resistance of the elements, and therefore on the balance between the voltage and current to achieve a certain power of the element.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0288">Modern drive electronic components tend to require lower drive voltages than earlier versions, with lower resistances of drive transistors in their &#x201c;on&#x201d; state. Thus, in such drive transistors, for a given transistor area, there is a tendency to higher current capability and lower voltage tolerance in each process generation.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0289"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, referred to above, shows the shape, in plan view, of a mask for forming the heater structure of the embodiment of the printhead shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. Accordingly, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> represents the shape of the heater element <b>10</b> of that embodiment, it is now referred to in discussing that heater element. During operation, current flows vertically into the electrodes <b>15</b> (represented by the parts designated <b>15</b>,<b>36</b>), so that the current flow area of the electrodes is relatively large, which, in turn, results in there being a low electrical resistance. By contrast, the element <b>10</b>, represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> by the part designated <b>10</b>,<b>36</b>, is long and thin, with the width of the element in this embodiment being 1 micron and the thickness being 0.25 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0290">It will be noted that the heater <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> has a significantly smaller element <b>10</b> than the element <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, and has just a single loop <b>36</b>. Accordingly, the element <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> will have a much lower electrical resistance, and will permit a higher current flow, than the element <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. It therefore requires a lower drive voltage to deliver a given energy to the heater <b>14</b> in a given time.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0291">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, on the other hand, the embodiment shown includes a heater <b>14</b> having two heater elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> corresponding to the same unit cell <b>1</b>. One of these elements <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> is twice the width as the other element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, with a correspondingly larger surface area. The various paths of the lower element <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> are 2 microns in width, while those of the upper element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> are 1 micron in width. Thus the energy applied to ink in the chamber <b>7</b> by the lower element <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> is twice that applied by the upper element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> at a given drive voltage and pulse duration. This permits a regulating of the size of vapor bubbles and hence of the size of ink drop ejected due to the bubbles.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0292">Assuming that the energy applied to the ink by the upper element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> is X, it will be appreciated that the energy applied by the lower element <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> is about 2&#xd7;, and the energy applied by the two elements together is about 3&#xd7;. Of course, the energy applied when neither element is operational, is zero. Thus, in effect, two bits of information can be printed with the one nozzle <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0293">As the above factors of energy output may not be achieved exactly in practice, some &#x201c;fine tuning&#x201d; of the exact sizing of the elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>, or of the drive voltages that are applied to them, may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0294">It will also be noted that the upper element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> is rotated through 180&#xb0; about a vertical axis relative to the lower element <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>. This is so that their electrodes <b>15</b> are not coincident, allowing independent connection to separate drive circuits.</p>

<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Efficiency of the Printhead</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0296">The printhead of the present invention has a design that configures the nozzle structure for enhanced efficiency: less than 200 nanojoules (nJ) is required to heat the element sufficiently to form a bubble <b>12</b> in the ink <b>11</b>, so as to eject a drop <b>16</b> of ink through a nozzle <b>3</b>. In some of the Applicant's nozzle designs, the energy required to form a bubble in the ink is less than 80 nJ. By comparison, prior art devices generally require over 5 microjoules to heat the element <b>10</b> sufficiently to generate a vapor bubble <b>12</b> to eject an ink drop <b>16</b>. Thus, the energy requirements of the present invention are an order of magnitude lower than that of known thermal ink jet systems. This lower energy consumption provides lower operating costs, smaller power supplies, and so on, but also dramatically simplifies printhead cooling, allows higher densities of nozzles <b>3</b>, and permits printing at higher resolutions.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0297">These advantages of the present invention are especially significant in &#x2018;self cooling&#x2019; printheads where the individual ejected ink drops <b>16</b>, themselves, constitute the major cooling mechanism of the printhead, as described further below.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Self-Cooling of the Printhead</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0298">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref>, this feature of the invention provides that the energy applied to a beater element <b>10</b> to form a vapour bubble <b>12</b> so as to eject a drop <b>16</b> of ink <b>11</b> is removed from the printhead by a combination of the heat removed by the ejected drop itself, and the ink that is taken into the printhead from the ink reservoir (not shown). The result of this is that the net &#x201c;movement&#x201d; of heat will be outwards from the printhead, to provide for automatic cooling. Under these circumstances, the printhead does not require any other cooling systems.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0299">As the ink drop <b>16</b> ejected and the amount of ink <b>11</b> drawn into the printhead to replace the ejected drop are constituted by the same type of liquid, and will essentially be of the same mass, it is convenient to express the net movement of energy as, on the one hand, the energy added by the heating of the element <b>10</b>, and on the other hand, the net removal of heat energy that results from ejecting the ink drop <b>16</b> and the intake of the replacement quantity of ink <b>11</b>. Assuming that the replacement quantity of ink <b>11</b> is at ambient temperature, the change in energy due to net movement of the ejected and replacement quantities of ink can conveniently be expressed as the heat that would be required to raise the temperature of the ejected drop <b>16</b>, if it were at ambient temperature, to the actual temperature of the drop as it is ejected.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0300">It will be appreciated that a determination of whether the above criteria are met depends on what constitutes the ambient temperature. In the present case, the temperature that is taken to be the ambient temperature is the temperature at which ink <b>11</b> enters the printhead from the ink storage reservoir (not shown) which is connected, in fluid flow communication, to the inlet passages <b>9</b> of the printhead. Typically the ambient temperature will be the room ambient temperature, which is usually roughly 20&#xb0; C. (Celsius).</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0301">However, the ambient temperature may be less, if for example, the room temperature is lower, or if the ink <b>11</b> entering the printhead is refrigerated.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0302">In one preferred embodiment, the printhead is designed to achieve complete self-cooling (i.e. where the outgoing heat energy due to the net effect of the ejected and replacement quantities of ink <b>11</b> is equal to the heat energy added by the heater element <b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0303">By way of example, assume that the ink <b>11</b> is the bubble forming liquid and is water based, thus having a boiling point of approximately 100&#xb0; C. If the ambient temperature is 40&#xb0; C., then there is a maximum of 60&#xb0; C. from the ambient temperature to the ink boiling temperature: that is the maximum temperature rise that the printhead could undergo. To ensure self cooling in this case, the energy required to produce each drop <b>16</b> must be less than the maximum amount of energy that can be taken away. The maximum amount of energy that can be taken away is

where &#x3c1;=1000 kg&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>is the density of water, C=4190 J&#xb7;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.C<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>is the specific heat of water, V is the drop volume and &#x394;T=60&#xb0; C. Assume, by way of example, that a 1.2 pl drop is ejected. In this case E<sub>removed</sub>=302 nJ. In this example, if it took more than 302 nJ to eject each drop, the temperature of a dense array of nozzles would rise with each pulse to the point where the ink inside the nozzles <b>11</b> would boil continuously. If, however, it took less than 302 nJ to produce each drop, then regardless of other cooling mechanisms, the steady state ink temperature would settle below the boiling point, at a maximum temperature given by
<br/>

</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0304">It is desirable to avoid having ink temperatures within the printhead (other than at time of ink drop <b>16</b> ejection) which are very close to the boiling point of the ink <b>11</b>. Temperatures close to boiling result in elevated evaporation rates, causing the ink in the nozzles <b>11</b> to rapidly increase in viscosity and clog the nozzles. Furthermore, ink temperatures above 60&#xb0; C. can cause dissolved air in water based inks to come out of solution (known as &#x2018;outgassing&#x2019;), forming air bubbles that can block the ink channels, preventing refill of the nozzle chamber <b>7</b>. Accordingly, a preferred embodiment of the invention is configured such that complete self-cooling, as described above, can be achieved so that the ink <b>11</b> (bubble forming liquid) in a particular nozzle chamber <b>7</b> has a steady state temperature substantially below the ink boiling point when the heating element <b>10</b> is not active, in the case of water based inks, the steady state temperature is ideally less than 60&#xb0; C., to avoid outgassing of dissolved air.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0305">The main advantage of self cooling is that it allows for a high nozzle density and for a high speed of printhead operation without requiring elaborate cooling methods for preventing undesired boiling in nozzles <b>3</b> adjacent to nozzles from which ink drops <b>16</b> are being ejected. This can allow as much as a hundred-fold increase in nozzle packing density than would be the case if such a feature, and the temperature criteria mentioned, were not present. Furthermore, if the steady state ink temperature predicted by equation 2 is significantly below boiling (&#x2dc;60&#xb0; C. for water based inks), the firing frequency of the nozzles will not limited by thermal constraints. The maximum firing rate and the resulting print speed will instead limited by the refill time of the ink chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0306">Note that thermal conduction out of the printhead integrated circuit (see item <b>81</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>) through the back (the surface of the wafer substrate opposite the nozzle plate <b>50</b>) or through the wire bonds will reduce the temperature of the printhead integrated circuit (IC) further below the steady state temperature determined by equation 2. The degree to which thermal conduction further reduces the printhead IC temperature will depend on the time scale for thermal conduction out of the printhead IC and how that time scale compares with the firing rate. Designs which operate close to the self cooling limit (ink close to boiling) will still show significant frequency dependent temperature and viscosity effects. Thus, as already mentioned, it is preferable to aim for steady state fluid temperatures significantly below boiling i.e. 60&#xb0; C. in the case of a water based ink.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Areal Density of Nozzles</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0307">This feature of the invention relates to the density, by area, of the nozzles <b>3</b> on the printhead. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the nozzle plate <b>2</b> has an upper surface <b>50</b>, and the present aspect of the invention relates to the packing density of nozzles <b>3</b> on that surface. More specifically, the areal density of the nozzles <b>3</b> on that surface <b>50</b> is over 10,000 nozzles/cm<sup>2 </sup>of surface area.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0308">In one preferred embodiment, the areal density exceeds 20,000 nozzles/cm<sup>2 </sup>of surface area <b>50</b>, while in another preferred embodiment, the areal density exceeds 40,000 nozzles/cm<sup>2</sup>. In some of the Applicant's designs, the areal density is 48 828 nozzles/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0309">When referring to the areal density, each nozzle <b>3</b> is taken to include the drive-circuitry corresponding to the nozzle, which consists, typically, of a drive transistor, a shift register, an enable gate and clock regeneration circuitry (this circuitry not being specifically identified).</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0310">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> in which a single unit cell <b>1</b> is shown, the dimensions of the unit cell are shown as being 32 microns in width by 64 microns in length. The nozzle <b>3</b> of the next successive row of nozzles (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>) immediately juxtaposes this nozzle, so that, as a result of the dimension of the outer periphery of the printhead chip, there are 48,828 nozzles/cm<sup>2</sup>. This is about 85 times the nozzle areal density of a typical thermal inkjet printhead, and roughly 400 times the nozzle areal density of a piezoelectric printhead.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0311">The main advantage of a high areal density is low manufacturing cost, as the devices are batch fabricated on silicon wafers of a particular size.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0312">The more nozzles <b>3</b> that can be accommodated in a square cm of substrate, the more nozzles can be fabricated in a single batch, which typically consists of one wafer. The cost of manufacturing a CMOS plus MEMS wafer of the type used in the printhead of the present invention is, to some extent, independent of the nature of patterns that are formed on it. Therefore if the patterns are relatively small, a relatively large number of nozzles <b>3</b> can be included. This allows more nozzles <b>3</b> and more printheads to be manufactured for the same cost than in cases where the nozzles had a lower areal density. The cost is directly proportional to the area taken by the nozzles <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Drop Size</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0313">Equation 2 (T<sub>steady state</sub>=T<sub>ambient</sub>+E<sub>ejection</sub>/&#x3c1;CV) shows that both the drop volume and ejection energy strongly impact the steady state temperature of the ink in a self-cooling printhead. Doubling the drop size, for example, doubles the amount of heat the drop can take away, but doubling the drop size will generally required more energy, so the steady state ink temperature will not necessarily be lower.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0314">In the present invention, the print head resolution is 1600 dpi and the preferred drop size is between 1 pl and 2 pl. Drops that are 1 pl will produce 1600 dpi images on a page without any white space visible between dots if the drop placement accuracy is very good. Drops that are 2 pl will produce 1600 dpi dots that overlap significantly, loosening the requirement for accuracy and drop trajectory stability (commonly termed &#x201c;directionality&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0315">Equation 2 can be used to determine the relationship between &#x394;T=T<sub>steady state</sub>&#x2212;T<sub>ambient </sub>and the energy required to eject drops between 1 pl and 2 pl. For 1 pl drops of water based ink, a 300 nJ ejection energy results in a 71&#xb0; C. rise from the ambient temperature. For 1.2 pl drops, 300 nJ results in a 60&#xb0; C. rise and for 2 pl drops, 300 nJ results in a 36&#xb0; C. rise. Assuming the worst case ambient temperature is 40&#xb0; C., the steady state ink temperature with 300 nJ, 2 pl drop ejection will be 76&#xb0; C. The ink will be above the boiling point with 300 nJ, 1 pl drop ejection and the ink will be at the boiling point with 300 nJ, 1.2 pl drop ejection. Given the constraints on drop size and ink temperature, for the present invention 300 nJ is chosen as the upper limit of ejection energy for a viable self-cooling design.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Features of Low Energy Ejection</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0316">The embodiments shown achieve self cooling with nozzle designs that eject with much less energy than the prior art. This led to the development of a range of mechanisms and techniques for reducing ejection energy. These are best understood by considering the energy required for bubble formation and each source of energy loss associated with driving the heater. An approximate expression for the energy required for bubble formation is:

where &#x394;T is the temperature increase from ambient to the film boiling point (&#x2dc;309&#xb0; C. for water based inks), A is the planar surface area of the heater, &#x3c1; is density, C is specific heat, t is thickness, k is thermal conductivity, &#x3c4; is the time taken for the bubble to nucleate and the subscripts h, c, u and i refer to heater, coating, underlayer and ink respectively. The coating is any passivating or protective coating placed between the heater material and the ink, assumed for the sake of simplicity in equation 3 to be a single homogenous layer. The underlayer is the material in thermal contact with the heater, on the opposite side of the heater to the side which forms the bubble that causes ejection. This definition leaves open the possibility of heaters attached to the chamber sidewall or roof and the possibility of a heater suspended at each end which is fully immersed in ink. In the case of a suspended heater the underlayer is ink and its properties are identical to the ink properties. FL is the loss in the driving CMOS FET and SL is loss in non-nucleating resistances in series with the heater. Some second order terms associated with heat leakage from the edge of the heater have been neglected in equation 3.
</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0317">According to equation 3, there are many practical possibilities for minimizing the energy required for bubble formation:

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0327">Each of these options is discussed in detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Reduced Heater Area</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0328">The heater area A plays a large role in equation 3. Two terms scale directly with area: the energy required to heat the heater to the film boiling point &#x394;TA&#x3c1;<sub>h</sub>C<sub>h</sub>t<sub>h </sub>and the energy required to heat the coating to the film boiling point &#x394;TA&#x3c1;<sub>c</sub>C<sub>c</sub>t<sub>c</sub>. The energy lost by diffusion into the underlayer &#x394;TA(&#x3c1;<sub>u</sub>C<sub>u</sub>k<sub>u</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>&#x3c4;<sup>1/2 </sup>and the energy lost by diffusion into the ink &#x394;TA(&#x3c1;<sub>i</sub>C<sub>i</sub>k<sub>i</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>&#x3c4;<sup>1/2 </sup>are even more strongly dependent on area, since &#x3c4; depends on A: smaller area implies a smaller volume being heated and smaller volumes will reach the film boiling point more quickly with a given power input. Overall, since the FL and SL terms in equation 3 can largely be eliminated by design, heater area has a strong influence on the energy required to eject and the steady state fluid temperature. Typically, halving the heater area (keeping the heater resistance constant) will reduce the energy required to nucleate the bubble by &#x2dc;60%.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0329">The heater areas of printers currently on the market are around 400 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>. These heaters are covered with &#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;m of protective coatings. If the protective coatings on prior art heaters could be removed to eliminate the energy wasted in heating them, it would be possible to create self cooling inkjets with heater areas as large as 400 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, but the drop volume would need to be at least 5 pl to take the required amount of heat away. It is generally understood by people experienced in the art that drop volumes smaller than 5 pl are desirable, to:

        <li id="ul0036-0002" num="0331">2. reduce the amount of fluid the paper has to absorb, thereby facilitating faster printing without exacerbating paper cockle.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0332">Drop sizes of 1-2 pl are preferable, as they allow &#x2dc;1600 dpi printing. The Applicant has fabricated nozzles that eject &#x2dc;1.2 pl water based ink drops with &#x2dc;200 nJ ejection energy using &#x2dc;150 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>heaters. The corresponding temperature rise of the chip with an arbitrary number of nozzles is predicted to be 40&#xb0; C., since a 1.2 pl water based ink drop 40&#xb0; C. above ambient can take away 200 nJ of heat. In reality, the rise in chip temperature from the ambient will be somewhat less than this, as heat conduction out of the back of the chip is not taken into account in this calculation. In any case, these nozzles meet the definition of self cooling, as they require no cooling mechanisms other than heat removal by the droplets to keep the ink below its boiling point in the expected range of ambient temperatures. If the ambient is 20&#xb0; C., the steady state chip and ink temperature will be less than 60&#xb0; C., no matter how densely the nozzles are packed or how quickly they are fired. 60&#xb0; C. is a good upper temperature limit to aim for, since ink can quickly dehydrate and clog the nozzles or outgas air bubbles above that temperature. Therefore, when the heater area is less than 150 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>the steady state ink temperature can be &#x3c;60&#xb0; C. when ejecting 1.2 pl drops with 20&#xb0; C. ambient. Likewise, if the heater area is less than 225 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, the steady state ink temperature can be &#x3c;80&#xb0; C. when ejecting 1.2 pl drops without any conductive cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0333"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> shows experimental and theoretical data for the energy required for bubble formation, shown as discussed to be a strongly decreasing function of heater area. The experimental data was taken from some of the Applicant's early devices which suffered from contact problems and consequently had large series loss. To estimate the series resistance extraneous to the heaters in these devices, the sheet resistance of the heater material was measured using a 4 terminal structure located on the semiconductor wafer close to the devices in question. The sheet resistance and the heater geometry were used to predict the 2 terminal resistances of the heaters. When the predictions were compared with 2 terminal measurements of the heater resistances, an additional 22 Ohms of series resistance was found to be contributed by resistances extraneous to the heaters. When this 22 Ohm series resistance was put into a model based on Equation 3, the theoretical energy prediction (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>) closely matched the experiment. If the series resistance were reduced from 22 Ohms to 5 Ohms, the same model predicts the energy required to nucleate with a pulse of the same width would go down by &#x2dc;30%. The low resistance shunt layer described below in the section on minimizing series loss was not used in these devices: these results emphasise its benefit.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0334">The limit to which the heater area can be reduced is determined by the evaporation of volatile ink components from the ink meniscus in the nozzle. In the case of a water based ink, evaporation of water from the ink will decrease the concentration of water in the region between the heater and the nozzle, increasing the concentration of other ink components such as the humectant glycerol. This increases the viscosity of the ink and also reduces the amount of vapour generated, so as the evaporation proceeds:
<ul id="ul0037" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0037-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0038" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0038-0001" num="0335">it becomes harder to push the ink through the nozzle and</li>
        <li id="ul0038-0002" num="0336">the bubble impulse (force integrated over time) available to push the ink reduces.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0337">When eventually the water concentration between the heater and the nozzle drops below a certain level, the impulse of the bubble explosion will be insufficient to eject the ink. To ensure continuous firing of the nozzles, the interval between successive firings must be less than the time taken for the water concentration to drop below this critical level, after which the nozzle is effectively clogged.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0338">This time period is influenced by many factors, including ambient humidity, the ink composition, the heater-nozzle separation and the heater area. The heater area is tied into this phenomenon through the ink viscosity. Smaller heaters have a smaller bubble, are less able to force viscous fluid out the nozzle and consequently have a lower viscosity limit for ejection. They are thus more susceptible to evaporation. Heaters that are too small will have clogging times that are unpractically short, requiring that nozzles be fired at a rate that would adversely affect print quality. One would expect the 150 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>heater of the present invention to have a significantly shorter clogging time than printers currently on the market, which have heater areas around 400 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>. In the present invention, however, there is the option of suspending the heater so that it is fully immersed in the fluid, with both the top side and underside contributing to bubble formation. In that case the effective surface area is 300 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, only a 25% reduction from printers currently on the market.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Thin or Non-Existent Protective Coatings</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0339">To protect against the effects of oxidation, corrosion and cavitation on the heater material, inkjet manufacturers use protective layers, typically made from Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, SiC and Ta. These layers are thick in comparison to the heater. U.S. Pat. No. 6,786,575, to Anderson et al (assigned to Lexmark), is an example of this structure. The heater is &#x2dc;0.1 &#x3bc;m thick while the total thickness of the protective layers is at least 0.7 &#x3bc;m. With reference to equation 3, this means there will be a &#x394;TA(&#x3c1;<sub>c</sub>C<sub>c</sub>t<sub>c </sub>term that is &#x2dc;7 times larger than the &#x394;TA&#x3c1;<sub>h</sub>C<sub>h</sub>t<sub>h </sub>term. Removing the protective layers eliminates the &#x394;TA(&#x3c1;<sub>c</sub>C<sub>c</sub>t<sub>c </sub>term. Removing the protective layers also significantly reduces the diffusive loss terms &#x394;TA(&#x3c1;<sub>u</sub>C<sub>u</sub>k<sub>u</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>&#x3c4;<sup>1/2 </sup>and A&#x394;TA(&#x3c1;<sub>i</sub>C<sub>i</sub>k<sub>i</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>&#x3c4;<sup>1/2</sup>, since a smaller volume is being heated and smaller volumes will reach the film boiling point more quickly with a given power input. Models based on equation 3 show that removing the 0.7 &#x3bc;m thick protective coatings can reduce the energy required to eject by as much as a factor of 6. Thus in the preferred embodiment, there are no protective coatings deposited onto the heater material. Removing or greatly thinning the protective coatings (while maintaining a practical heater longevity) is possible, provided:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p id="p-0268" num="0342">With respect to the option of thinning the coating rather than removing it entirely, models based on equation 3 show that &#x2dc;0.7 &#x3bc;m is the thickness limit for self cooling operation with water based inks, assuming 20&#xb0; C. ambient and 1.2 pl drops: even with a relatively small 120 &#x3bc;m heater the ink will be close to boiling using this thickness (neglecting the conductive heat sinking mechanism, on the assumption it will be inadequate for high density nozzle packing and high firing frequencies). In preferred embodiments, the total thickness of protective coating layers is less than 0.1 &#x3bc;m and the heater can be pulsed more than 1 billion times (i.e. eject more than 1 billion drops) before the heater burns out. Assuming the ambient temperature is 20&#xb0; C., heater area is 120 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>and the droplet size is 1.2 pl, the steady state ink temperature will be below 60&#xb0; C. thus avoiding problems discussed above in relation to heater area.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">Reduced Heater Thickness</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0343">Since the &#x394;TA(&#x3c1;<sub>c</sub>C<sub>c</sub>t<sub>c </sub>term associated with heating the protective layers is generally much larger than the &#x394;TA(&#x3c1;<sub>h</sub>C<sub>h</sub>t<sub>h </sub>term associated with heating the heater, reducing the heater thickness t<sub>h </sub>will be of little benefit unless the coating is eliminated or made thin compared to the heater. Presuming that has been done, reducing t<sub>h </sub>will further reduce the volume to be heated, thereby reducing not only the &#x394;TA(&#x3c1;<sub>h</sub>C<sub>h</sub>t<sub>h </sub>term, but also the diffusive terms, as nucleation will occur more quickly. Models based on equation 3 show that a 0.1 &#x3bc;m thick uncoated heater will typically require less than half of the energy required by a 0.5 &#x3bc;m thick heater. However, attempting to reduce thickness below 0.1 &#x3bc;m is likely to cause problems with deposition thickness control and possibly electromigration. To avoid the risk of electromigration failure with such thin heaters, the heater resistivity needs to be at least 2 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m, to ensure the current density is not too high (&#x3c;1 MA&#xb7;cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>).</p>

<p id="p-0270" num="0344">The densities and specific heats of the heater and protective coating materials are generally of secondary concern to an inkjet designer, since properties such as resistivity, oxidation resistance, corrosion resistance and cavitation resistance are of greater importance. However, if these considerations are put to one side, materials with a lower density-specific heat product are desirable. Reducing &#x3c1;<sub>h</sub>C and &#x3c1;<sub>c</sub>C<sub>c </sub>in equation 3 has the same effect as reducing t<sub>h </sub>and t<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0345">Generally the &#x3c1;C product does not vary by more than a factor of 2 in the class of materials available to the inkjet designer: considering the case of an uncoated heater, models based on equation 3 indicate the heater material selection will therefore affect the energy required to eject by at most 30%.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Minimizing Nucleation Time (Minimizing Diffusive Loss)</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0346">It is important to minimize x, as it governs the diffusive loss into the ink and underlayer. The first step in minimizing &#x3c4; is to reduce the volume to be heated, which is done by minimizing A, t<sub>h</sub>, t<sub>c </sub>and in the case of a heater bonded to a solid underlayer, (&#x3c1;<sub>u</sub>C<sub>u</sub>k<sub>u</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>. Minimizing &#x3c4; then becomes a matter of selecting the right heater resistance and drive voltage, to set the heater power. Lower resistance or higher voltage will increase the power, causing a reduction in nucleation time &#x3c4;. Lower resistance can be provided by either lowering the heater resistivity or making the heater wider (and shorter to avoid affecting A). Lowering the resistance is not the preferred option however, as elevating the current could cause problems with electromigration, increased FET loss FL and increased series loss SL. Higher voltage, on the other hand, could cause problems with electrolytic destruction of the heater or ink components, so a compromise is appropriate: in the preferred embodiment, FET drive voltages between 5V and 12V are considered optimum. Typical numbers derived from equation 3 for an uncoated 0.3 &#x3bc;m thick 120 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>heater are: 175 nJ required to eject with a 5V, 1.5 &#x3bc;s pulse, or 110 nJ with a 7 V, 0.5 &#x3bc;s pulse i.e. a 37% reduction in ejection energy obtained by simply changing the drive voltage. Thus, in one preferred embodiment, the voltage and resistance should be chosen to make t&#x3c;1.5 &#x3bc;s. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the voltage and resistance should be chosen to make t&#x3c;1 &#x3bc;s.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0347"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> shows experimental and theoretical data for the energy required for bubble formation. As discussed above, it is a strongly decreasing function of nucleation time or input pulse width (the drive voltage is adjusted to make the input pulse width equal to the nucleation time). The experimental data was taken from some of the Applicant's early devices which suffered from contact problems and consequently had large series loss. To estimate the series resistance extraneous to the heaters in these devices, the sheet resistance of the heater material was measured using a 4 terminal structure located on the semiconductor wafer close to the devices in question. The sheet resistance and the heater geometry were used to predict the 2 terminal resistances of the heaters. When the predictions were compared with 2 terminal measurements of the heater resistances, an additional 40 Ohms of series resistance was found to be contributed by resistances extraneous to the heaters. When this 40 Ohm series resistance was put into a model based on Equation 3, the theoretical energy prediction (shown, in the figure) closely matched the experiment. If the series resistance were reduced from 40 Ohms to 5 Ohms, the same model predicts the energy required to nucleate with a pulse of the same width would go down by &#x2dc;30%. The low resistance shunt layer described in the section on minimizing series loss was not used in these devices: these results emphasise its benefit.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0348">It should be noted that without a shunt layer, some heater shapes will have more extraneous series resistance than others. The Omega shape, for example, has two arms which attach the heater loop to the contacts. If those arms are wider in the attachment section than the loop section, the arms will not contribute to the bubble formation, but they will contribute to the extraneous series resistance. This explains why the extraneous series resistance of these devices with an Omega shaped heater is higher than the parallel bar designs discussed in the reduced heater area section: the parallel bars run straight between the two contacts without resistive attachment sections. Without a shunt layer, heater shapes without resistive attachment sections are preferable.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">Side Effects of Reduced Nucleation Time</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0349">It should be noted that the heat that diffuses into the ink and the underlayer prior to nucleation has an effect on the volume of fluid that vaporizes once nucleation has occurred and consequently the impulse of the vapor explosion (impulse=force integrated over time). Tests have shown that nozzles run with shorter, higher voltage heater pulses have shorter ink clogging times (discussed above in relation to Reduced Heater Area). This is explained by the reduced impulse of the vapor explosion, which is less able to push ink made viscous by evaporation through the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0350">The Applicant has additionally noted that shorter, higher voltage heater pulses reduce the extent of &#x201c;microflooding&#x201d;. Microflooding is a phenomenon whereby the stalk dragged behind the ejecting droplet attaches itself to one side of the nozzle and drags across the surface of the nozzle plate <b>2</b>. When droplet break-off occurs part of the stalk remains attached to the nozzle plate, depositing liquid onto the nozzle plate. Liquid pooling asymmetrically on one side of the nozzle can cause printing problems, because the stalks of subsequent droplets can attach themselves to the pooled liquid, causing misdirection of those droplets. The attachment of droplet stalks to liquid already on the nozzle plate encourages further accumulation of liquid, so the phenomenon of microflooding and misdirection is self-perpetuating, depending on a balance of firing rate, evaporation rate and the rate at which fluid is re-imbibed back into the nozzles. The traditional method by which the droplet stalks are discouraged from attaching themselves to the nozzle plate involves reducing the surface energy of the nozzle plate with an appropriate surface treatment or coating. This also encourages re-imbibing of fluid on the nozzle plate. However, the Applicant has found that micro-flooding can be dramatically reduced without surface treatment by reducing the time taken to nucleate below 1 &#x3bc;s. High magnification stroboscopic imaging indicates this is most likely due to the effect of reduced bubble impulse, which reduces the length of the droplet stalk and the likelihood of the stalk attaching itself to one side of the nozzle.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">Minimizing (&#x3c1;<sub>i</sub>C<sub>i</sub>k<sub>i</sub>)<sup>1/2 </sup></p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0351">Aside from minimizing &#x3c4;, not much can be done about reducing heat lost into the ink prior to the onset of film boiling, since the so-called thermal product (&#x3c1;<sub>i</sub>C<sub>i</sub>k<sub>i</sub>)<sup>1/2 </sup>is a material property intrinsic to the ink base, be it water or alcohol. For example, ethanol has a much lower thermal product than water (570 Jm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1/2 </sup>versus 1586 Jm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>1/2</sup>). While this would greatly reduce heat lost into the ink, the inkjet designer does not generally have the freedom to change ink base, since the ink base strongly affects the interaction of the ink with the print medium. In addition, ethanol and other similar solvents are less suitable to self-cooling printheads: despite having reduced ejection energies, the lower densities and specific heats mean less heat is able to be taken away in the droplets, and the reduced boiling points mean there is less margin for operating without boiling the ink continuously.</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">Improved Thermal Isolation: Minimizing (&#x3c1;<sub>u</sub>C<sub>u</sub>k<sub>u</sub>)<sup>1/2 </sup></p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0352">Generally the inkjet designer has considerable freedom to tailor the thermal properties of the underlayer, by selecting a material with a low thermal product (&#x3c1;<sub>u</sub>C<sub>u</sub>k<sub>u</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>. Low thermal conductivity k is a good initial screening criterion for material selection, since k can vary up to 2 orders of magnitude in the class of available materials, while the product &#x3c1;C varies less than 1 order of magnitude, in determining whether a particular material is suitable, it is instructive to compare the thermal products of H2O (TP=1579 Jm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>1/2</sup>) and SiO<sub>2 </sub>(TP=1495 Jm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>1/2</sup>). Since the thermal products of the two materials are very close, it is possible to conclude:

    <ul id="ul0042" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0042-0001" num="0353">1. the heat energy lost into the ink is roughly equal to the heat energy lost into the underlayer if the heater is bonded to a SiO<sub>2 </sub>underlayer,</li>
        <li id="ul0042-0002" num="0354">2. there is little difference in dissipative loss between a heater bonded to a SiO<sub>2 </sub>underlayer and a heater suspended at each end, fully immersed in ink.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0355">Thus there are at least 2 configurations in which the heat loss into the underlayer is no worse than the heat loss into the ink (underlayer=SiO<sub>2 </sub>and underlayer=ink). To improve on this situation: underlayers should be selected on the basis that the thermal product of the underlayer is less than or equal to the thermal product of the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0356">Other candidates for underlayers with lower thermal products than water or SiO<sub>2 </sub>come from the new class of low-k dielectrics, such as Applied Material's Black Diamond&#x2122; and Novellus' Coral&#x2122;, both of which are CVD deposited SiOC films, used in copper damascene processing. These films have lower density than SiO<sub>2 </sub>(&#x2dc;1340 kgm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>vs &#x2dc;2200 kgm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) and lower thermal conductivity (&#x2dc;0.4 Wm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>vs &#x2dc;1.46 Wm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). Consequently, their thermal product is around 600 Jm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>1/2 </sup>i.e. a 60% reduction in thermal product compared to SiO<sub>2</sub>. To calculate the benefit that may be derived by replacing SiO<sub>2 </sub>underlayers with these materials, models using equation 3 can be used to show that &#x2dc;35% of the energy required for ejection is lost by diffusion into the underlayer when SiO<sub>2 </sub>underlayers are used. The benefit of the replacement is therefore 60% of 35% i.e. a 21% reduction in energy of ejection. Thus in another preferred embodiment, the underlayer is made from carbon doped silicon oxide (SiOC) or hydrogenated carbon doped silicon oxide (SiOCH). In a further preferred embodiment, the silica's thermal product is reduced by introducing porosity to reduce the density and thermal conductivity.</p>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0362">The area of the FET is determined by the packing density of the nozzles and the size of each nozzle's unit cell: increasing the packing density will reduce the FET size and increase the FET resistance. N-channel FETs have lower resistance than P-channel FETs because their carrier mobility is higher. However a PFET may be preferable as it is able to pull one side of the heater up to the rail voltage. NFETs cannot do this easily: they are typically used to pull one side of the heater down to ground, implying the heater is normally held high. Holding the heater at a positive DC bias may subject the heater to electrochemical attack.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0363">As a rule of thumb, the heater resistance should be at least 4 times higher than the FET on resistance, so that by the voltage divider equation, no more than 20% of the circuit power is dissipated in the FET. The heater resistance should not be too high though, as this reduces the power delivered to the heater, increases the nucleation time and increases the amount of heat lost by diffusion into the ink and underlayer prior to nucleation. The ideal heater resistance depends on the CMOS process chosen, and the type of FET (N or P). SPICE models of the FET can be used in conjunction with equation 3 to determine the heater resistance which minimizes FET loss without compromising diffusive loss. Typical resistance ranges for an uncoated 120 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>heater are 50-200 Ohms for a 5V process and 300-800 Ohms for a 12V process. Designers with the freedom to choose should target the upper end of these ranges, to minimize device current: high currents can cause problems in the circuit external to the heater, including electromigration, series loss, power supply droop and ground bounce. Preferably, the higher resistances would be obtained with higher heater resistivity rather than modifications of the heater geometry, since higher resistivity will reduce the heater current density, reducing the likelihood of heater electromigration failure. The resistivity range suited to a 5V process is &#x2dc;2.5 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m to &#x2dc;12 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m. The resistivity range suited to a 12V process is &#x2dc;8 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m to &#x2dc;100 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m. Thus in the preferred embodiment, the heater resistance is between 50 Ohms and 800 Ohms, while the heater resistivity is between 8 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m and 100 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m.</p>

<p id="p-0291" num="0373">In a configuration such as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, the bubble <b>12</b> forms on only one side of the heater element <b>10</b> because the element is embedded in a substrate <b>51</b>, By contrast, the bubble <b>12</b> can form on both sides in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> as the heater element <b>10</b> here is suspended.</p>

<p id="p-0293" num="0375">The advantage of the bubble <b>12</b> forming on both sides is the higher efficiency that is achievable.

<p id="p-0295" num="0377">As discussed in relation to equation 3, a key step in lowering the energy required to form a bubble is the reduction of heater area. This has an undesirable side effect of reducing the force of the bubble explosion. To compensate for the reduced force, the designer must:

</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0381">Furthermore, with the oxidation prevention coatings removed, the designer must replace the conventional heater material with one less susceptible to oxidation. With the tantalum cavitation protection coating removed, the designer must find an alternate means of preventing cavitation damage.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0382">These additional requirements are discussed below.</p>
<p id="h-0033" num="0000">Heater-Nozzle Separation</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0383">The ink chamber volumes of ink jet printers currently on the market are typically greater than 10 pl. The heaters are around 400 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>and are placed at the bottom of the ink chamber, about 12 &#x3bc;m below the nozzle. In the present invention, 1-2 pl is chosen as preferred drop size to facilitate 1600 dpi resolution and 150 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>is chosen as the preferred heater area to facilitate self cooling operation with that drop size.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0384">The reduction in the heater area of the present invention reduces the bubble impulse (pressure integrated over area and time), so the likelihood of ejecting a particular ejectable liquid is reduced. It is possible to mitigate this effect by reducing the forces acting against the drop ejection, so that ejection with reduced bubble impulse remains possible.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0385">The forces acting against drop ejection are associated with:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0389">With a particular heater area and bubble impulse, the inertia of the ink will determine the acceleration of the body of liquid between the heater and the nozzle. The inertia depends on the liquid density and the volume of liquid between the heater and the nozzle. It is possible to reduce the ink inertia by reducing the volume of liquid between the heater and the nozzle i.e. by moving the heater closer to the nozzle. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 44</figref>, this is achieved by using a thickness of the sacrificial layer <b>42</b> less than 10 &#x3bc;m. If the inertia is reduced in this fashion, the liquid acceleration and momentum produced by the bubble will increase.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0390">In choosing to move the heater closer to the nozzle, one must take into account nozzle clogging from increased ink viscosity because of water evaporation.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0391">If the heater is moved closer to the ink-air interface, the concentration of the volatile ink component (typically water) at the level of the heater will decrease (a diffusion gradient of the volatile component results from the loss of that component by evaporation at the ink-air interface). This decreases the volume of vapour generated and the impulse of the bubble and makes the clogging time shorter.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0392">It should be noted that the heater to nozzle aperture separation, and therefore the inertia of the ink displaced are the important design considerations and not the chamber volume. In light of this, the heater need not be attached to the bottom of the ink chamber: it may also be suspended or attached to the roof of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0393">It is important to realize that in addition to inertia, successful ejection requires that the bubble impart sufficient momentum, to overcome the other forces acting against ejection i.e. those associated with, surface tension and viscosity.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">Surface Tension and Viscosity</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0394">Surface tension decelerates the emerging liquid from the moment the meniscus in the nozzle begins to bulge to the moment of drop break-off. If the bubble impulse is sufficient to push the meniscus out far enough, a droplet will form, but this droplet will drag a stalk of liquid behind it that will attach the droplet to the liquid remaining in the ink chamber. The action of surface tension in the stalk acts like a stretching rubber band that decelerates the droplet, but if the drop momentum is high enough, the stalk will stretch to a sufficient length for drop break-off to occur (a necessary condition for successful ejection). The length to which the stalk must be stretched is largely governed by the critical wavelength of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which is a strongly increasing function of liquid viscosity. The stalks of higher viscosity liquids will stretch out further before break-off occurs, giving surface tension more time to decelerate the droplet. Thus drop break-off is harder to achieve with higher viscosity fluids: if the bubble impulse is too low or the viscosity is high enough, the drop will not break, off; the stalk will instead pull the droplet back into the ink chamber.</p>

<p id="p-0307" num="0395">Viscosity plays an additional role in reducing the likelihood of drop break-off: viscous drag in the nozzle reduces the momentum of fluid flowing through the nozzle. The viscous drag increases as the nozzle length in the direction of fluid flow increases, so devices with thinner nozzle plates are more likely to eject if the bubble impulse is low. As addressed below in relation to the formation of the nozzle plate <b>2</b> by CVD, and with the advantages described in that regard, the nozzle plates in the present invention are thinner than in the prior art. More particularly, the nozzle plates <b>2</b> are less than 10 &#x3bc;m thick and typically about 2 &#x3bc;m thick.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0396">The likelihood of ejection can be determined with a particular heater area, heater-nozzle separation, nozzle diameter and length, liquid viscosity and surface tension using finite-element solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations together with the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method to simulate the free surface motion. These computations can be used to examine the optimal actuator geometry for low energy ejection (&#x3c;500 nJ) for a range of liquids of interest. In particular, the following limits have been determined for successful ejection:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0400">The Applicant's devices satisfy these constraints, along with a number of others described in the above referenced co-pending applications. In doing so, the Applicant has successfully fabricated self-cooling devices, with drop sizes of 1 pl to 2 pl and ejection energies of &#x2dc;200 nJ for water based inks. In comparison, printheads on the market typically have heat-nozzle separations and nozzle lengths of 10 &#x3bc;m or more and typically have ejection energies of &#x2dc;4000 nJ.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0401">It will be appreciated by those experienced in the art that any reduction in ejection energy is highly desirable for any thermal inkjet design, regardless of whether that reduction is sufficient to achieve self cooling. The energy of ejection will be significantly reduced by adopting the measures discussed above. This will lower the chip temperature and allow increases in nozzle density and firing rate, even if it is not to the degree permitted by self-cooling designs.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">Chemical Vapour Deposited Nozzle Plate, and Thin Nozzle Plates</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0402">The nozzle ejection aperture <b>5</b> of each unit cell <b>1</b> extends through the nozzle plate <b>2</b>, the nozzle plate thus constituting a structure which is formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In various preferred embodiments, the CVD is of silicon nitride, silicon dioxide or silicon oxynitride.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0403">The advantage of the nozzle plate <b>2</b> being formed by CVD is that it is formed in place without the requirement for assembling the nozzle plate to other components such as the walls <b>6</b> of the unit cell <b>1</b>. This is an important advantage because the assembly of the nozzle plate <b>2</b> that would otherwise be required can be difficult to effect and can involve potentially complex issues. Such issues include the potential mismatch of thermal expansion between the nozzle plate <b>2</b> and the parts to which it would be assembled, the difficulty of successfully keeping components aligned to each other, keeping them planar, and so on, during the curing process of the adhesive which bonds the nozzle plate <b>2</b> to the other parts.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0404">The issue of thermal expansion is a significant factor in the prior art, which limits the size of ink jets that can be manufactured. This is because the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between, for example, a nickel nozzle plate and a substrate to which the nozzle plate is connected, where this substrate is of silicon, is quite substantial. Consequently, over as small a distance as that occupied by, say, 1000 nozzles, the relative thermal expansion that occurs between the respective parts, in being heated from the ambient temperature to the curing temperature required for bonding the parts together, can cause a dimension mismatch of significantly greater than a whole nozzle length. This would be significantly detrimental for such devices.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0405">Another problem addressed by the features of the invention presently under discussion, at least in embodiments thereof, is that, in prior art devices, nozzle plates that need to be assembled are generally laminated onto the remainder of the printhead under conditions of relatively high stress. This can result in breakages or undesirable deformations of the devices. The deposition of the nozzle plate layer <b>2</b> by CVD in the embodiments of the present invention avoids this.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0406">A further advantage of the present features of the invention, at least in embodiments thereof, is their compatibility with existing semiconductor manufacturing processes. Depositing a nozzle plate <b>2</b> by CVD allows the nozzle plate to be included in the printhead at the scale of normal silicon wafer production, using processes normally used for semi-conductor manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0407">Existing bubble jet systems experience, pressure transients, during the bubble generation phase, of up to 100 atmospheres. If the nozzle plates <b>2</b> in such devices were applied by CVD, then to withstand such pressure transients, a substantial thickness of CVD nozzle plate would be required. As would be understood by those skilled in the art, such thicknesses of deposited nozzle plates would give rise to certain problems as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0408">For example, the thickness of nitride sufficient to withstand a 100 atmosphere pressure in the nozzle chamber <b>7</b> may be, say, 10 microns. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>, which shows a unit cell <b>1</b> that is not in accordance with the present invention, and which has such a thick nozzle plate <b>2</b>, it will be appreciated that such a thickness can result in problems relating to drop ejection. Increasing the thickness of nozzle plate <b>2</b>, increases the fluidic drag exerted by the nozzle <b>3</b> as the ink <b>11</b> is ejected through the nozzle. This can significantly reduce the efficiency of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0409">Another problem that would exist in the case of such a thick nozzle plate <b>2</b>, relates to the actual etching process. This is assuming that the nozzle <b>3</b> is etched, as shown, perpendicular to the wafer <b>8</b> of the substrate portion, for example using standard plasma etching. This would typically require more than 10 microns of resist <b>69</b> to be applied. The level of resolution required to expose that thickness of resist <b>69</b> becomes difficult to achieve, as the focal depth of the stepper that is used to expose the resist is relatively small. Although it would be possible to expose this relevant depth of resist <b>69</b> using x-rays, this would be a relatively costly process.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0410">A further problem that would exist with such a thick nozzle plate <b>2</b> in a case where a 10 micron thick layer of nitride were CVD deposited on a silicon substrate wafer, is that, because of the difference in thermal expansion between the CVD layer and the substrate, as well as the inherent stress of within thick, deposited layer, the wafer could be caused to bow to such a degree that further steps in the lithographic process would become impractical. Thus, a 10 micron thick nozzle plate <b>2</b> is possible but (unlike in the present invention), disadvantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0411">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, in a Memjet&#x2122; thermal ink ejection device according to an embodiment of the present invention, the CVD nitride nozzle plate layer <b>2</b> is only 2 microns thick. Therefore the fluidic drag through the nozzle <b>3</b> is not particularly significant and is therefore not a major cause of loss.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0412">Furthermore, the etch time, and the resist thickness required to etch nozzles <b>3</b> in such a nozzle plate <b>2</b>, and the stress on the substrate wafer <b>8</b>, will not be excessive.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0413">Embodiments of the present invention are able to use a relatively thin nozzle plate <b>2</b> because the forces exerted on it are smaller, due to a reduction in heater surface area and input pulse length: both of these factors will as previously mentioned influence the amount of ejectable fluid that is vaporized and consequently the impulse of the bubble. However, a reduced bubble impulse can still eject drops because:

<p id="p-0323" num="0421">As previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 44</figref>, the etching of the 2-micron thick nozzle plate layer <b>2</b> involves two relevant stages.

<p id="h-0037" num="0000">De-Clogging Pre-Heat Cycles and Humidity</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0422">During periods of inactivity, evaporation at the ink-air interface in the nozzle will cause the concentration of the volatile ink component in the ink chamber to decrease as a function of time. Regions of the fluid closer to the ink-air interface will dry out more quickly, so a concentration gradient or depleted region of the volatile component is established near the ink-air interface. As time progresses, the depleted region will extend further towards the heater and the concentration of the volatile component in the fluid immediately in contact with the heater will decrease. The evaporation has two deleterious effects: the viscosity of the ink between the heater and the nozzle will increase, making it harder to push ink through the nozzle, and the volume of vapor generated will decrease, reducing the impulse of the bubble. Eventually, if the nozzle is left too long without firing, the impulse of the bubble explosion will be insufficient to force the fluid through the nozzle and the nozzle will become unable to fire ink. Therefore, the maximum interval between successive firings, before the nozzle becomes clogged, can be determined and monitored by the print engine controller.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0423">A short maximum interval before clogging is undesirable when printing images with a high density nozzle array, as individual nozzles may be used irregularly. Every nozzle should be fired at a frequency less than the maximum interval before clogging. The print engine controller can do this by firing so called &#x201c;keep wet&#x201d; drops, i.e. drops fired at a frequency high enough to avoid clogging. However, the dots from keep wet drops can cause printing defects. Ideally, if keep-wet drops are required, they are fired between pages into a spittoon to avoid them appearing on the page. However, with small chamber volumes the viscosity of the ink increases quickly and the maximum time before clogging is typically less than the time to print a page. In this case, the keep-wet drops need to be fired onto the page. The Applicant's work in this area has found that if the density of dots from keep-wet drops is low enough, they are not visible to the human eye. To achieve this, the print engine controller (PEC) monitors the keep-wet times of every nozzle and ensures that the density keep-wet dots on the page is less than 1 in 250, and that these dots are not clustered. This effectively avoids any artifacts that can be detected by the eye. However, if the keep-wet times of the nozzles permit, the PEC will keep the density of keep-wet times below 1 in every 1000 drops.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0424">In addition to having a keep-wet strategy to avoid clogging during operation, it is helpful to have a strategy to recover clogged nozzles: this may be useful when the printer is turned on after an idle period. The Applicant has found two recovery strategics that are particularly effective:
<ul id="ul0055" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0055-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0056" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0056-0001" num="0425">1. start firing the nozzles at the keep-wet frequency while running a low level DC warming current through the heater (the fire pulses add to the DC level)</li>
        <li id="ul0056-0002" num="0426">2. apply a &#x2dc;17 kHz burst of &#x2dc;30 warm-up pulses before dropping back to the keep-wet frequency.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0427">These strategies can generally recover nozzles that have been left for up to a day uncapped in a dry environment. The explanation behind their success lies in the strong viscosity vs temperature profile of the ink components. For example, the viscosity of water is halved by heating from 20&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C. The heating compensates for the increase in viscosity caused by evaporation. In the case of the first strategy the ink is gently warmed with a low DC current. In the second strategy (which is more compatible with the CMOS drive circuitry) the fire pulses themselves provide the warming: with each unsuccessful firing of a clogged nozzle, the small amount of heat retained in the heater after firing will dissipate into the volume of fluid which failed to eject from the ink chamber, raising its temperature a small amount with each firing until eventually its viscosity drops below the limit for successful ejection. Thus after a number of attempted firings (typically less than 30) the clogged nozzle may successfully fire, restoring the nozzle to operation: from this point onwards the nozzle can be fired at the minimum keep-wet frequency to prevent clogging from occurring again.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0428">The 17 kHz frequency of the warming pulses was empirically determined to be optimum for the devices, which have a chamber diameter of 30 &#x3bc;m. This frequency corresponds to a 1/17 kHz=59 &#x3bc;s pulse period. The length scale for heat diffusion in water in this time is (4*59&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>s*k<sub>i</sub>/&#x3c1;<sub>i</sub>C<sub>i</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>=58 &#x3bc;m, while the length scale for heat diffusion in the glycerol humectant (which remains behind after the water has evaporated) is 48 &#x3bc;m. Thus it appears the ideal warming pulse interval should exceed the time scale for heat diffusion across the ink chamber, to ensure the entire volume of fluid to be ejected is heated. The warming pulse interval should not significantly exceed the time scale for heat diffusion, as that will allow the heat to dissipate away from the chamber, in which case the fluid temperature will not build up to the optimum point at the required rate and may even have a negative effect in causing increased evaporation. The optimum temperature for a water based ink is considered to be 50&#xb0; C.-60&#xb0; C.: high enough to lower the viscosity significantly from the room temperature value, but low enough to avoid increasing the evaporation rate significantly and low enough to avoid outgassing of dissolved air in the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0429">Note that as soon as ejection is restored with the 17 kHz pulse train, the temperature of the ink in the nozzle will settle at the value determined by self cooling: it does not matter that the heaters are being fired particularly quickly, as an advantage of self cooling is that the steady state fluid temperature is largely independent of the firing rate. As long as the time taken to refill the nozzles after firing is low enough, firing the nozzles at 17 kHz once they have declogged will not cause a problem. The Applicant's nozzles typically refill within 20 &#x3bc;s, so 17 kHz ejection is well within their capability.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0430">The number of pulses in the pulse train is a compromise between the effectiveness of the declog cycle and ink wastage: too few pulses and the ink may not increase in temperature enough to declog; too many pulses and a lot of ink will be wasted if ejection is restored early in the declog cycle. Thirty pulses give the nozzles ample opportunity to declog, given the total amount of energy involved: if the nozzles are not declogged after 30 pulses, more pulses are unlikely to help.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0431">A nozzle which has been left for a very long time may not be successfully restored to operation by the above strategics, as the reduction in viscosity provided by the warming cycle may not be sufficient to compensate for the increase in viscosity caused by evaporation. In this case a third strategy is required. The Applicant's nozzles have been shown to be recoverable in these circumstances when the ambient relative humidity is raised above 60%. At this level of humidity, the humectant in the ink takes up enough water from the atmosphere to reduce the viscosity of the ink in the chamber to an ejectable level. A humid environment may be supplied by two methods:
<ul id="ul0057" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0057-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0058" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0058-0001" num="0432">1. humid air blowing across the nozzles, or</li>
        <li id="ul0058-0002" num="0433">2. a capping mechanism, providing a scaled or mostly sealed chamber covering the printhead, with a source of moisture within the chamber.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0434">The first method could be used continuously to prevent clogging from occurring during operation, as the humid environment will reduce the evaporation rate, decreasing or eliminating the need for keep-wet drops. Alternatively, it could be used sparingly as a remedial measure, in conjunction with one of the warm-and-fire declog cycles, to recover clogged nozzles. Either way, the method has the advantage of not requiring the application of a capping mechanism, so it would not interrupt printing.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0435">The second method could not be used to prevent clogging during printing, but could be used to prevent clogging during idle periods. It could also be used as a remedial measure to recover clogged nozzles: the capping mechanism could be applied, then a warm-and-fire declog cycle could be used. This would require that printing be stopped however, so printers without the humid air will generally require the keep-wet drops to prevent clogging.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0436">As discussed above, the PEC can guarantee that during operation, each nozzle will be fired at an interval not more than the keep-wet time of the ink in the nozzles, where the keep-wet time is measured at what is considered the worst-case ambient humidity for the printer's operation. The PEC may also try to fire any, keep-wet drops between pages if possible, thereby reducing the density of the keep-wet drops that get printed to the page.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0437">Humid air may be blown across the nozzles to prevent clogging or increase the keep-wet time, thereby avoiding or reducing the need for keep-wet drops.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0438">Furthermore a capping mechanism can provide a humid environment for storage of the print head during idle times, with a humidity that is high enough to allow recovery of the nozzles prior to printing using one of the warm and fire declog methods.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0439">In the preferred embodiment, the warm and fire cycle used to declog the nozzles prior to printing is a &#x2dc;17 kHz burst of &#x2dc;30 pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0440">A DC offset may also be applied to the firing pulses, to provide a steady warming current, along with a set of firing pulses that will eject the ink as soon as the warming current reduces the ink viscosity to an ejectable level.</p>
<p id="h-0038" num="0000">Prevention of Cavitation Using Heater Shape</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0441">As described above, after a bubble <b>12</b> has been formed in a printhead according to an embodiment of the present invention, the bubble collapses towards a point of collapse <b>17</b>. According to the feature presently being addressed, the heater elements <b>10</b> are configured to form the bubbles <b>12</b> so that the points of collapse <b>17</b> towards which the bubbles collapse are at positions spaced from the heater elements. Preferably, the printhead is configured so that there is no solid material at such points of collapse <b>17</b>. In this way cavitation, being a major problem in prior art thermal inkjet devices, is largely eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0442">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, in a preferred embodiment, the heater elements <b>10</b> are configured to have parts <b>53</b> which define gaps (represented by the arrow <b>54</b>), and to form the bubbles <b>12</b> so that the points of collapse <b>17</b> to which the bubbles collapse are located at such gaps. The advantage of this feature is that it substantially avoids cavitation damage to the heater elements <b>10</b> and other solid material.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0443">In a standard prior art system as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, the heater element <b>10</b> is embedded in a substrate <b>55</b>, with an insulating layer <b>56</b> over the element, and a protective layer <b>57</b> over the insulating layer. When a bubble <b>12</b> is formed by the element <b>10</b>, it is formed on top of the element. When the bubble <b>12</b> collapses, as shown by the arrows <b>58</b>, all of the energy of the bubble collapse is focused onto a very small point of collapse <b>17</b>. If the protective layer <b>57</b> were absent, then the mechanical forces due to the cavitation that would result from the focusing of this energy to the point of collapse <b>17</b>, could chip away or erode the heater element <b>10</b>. However, this is prevented by the protective layer <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0444">Typically, such a protective layer <b>57</b> is of tantalum, which oxidizes to form a very hard layer of tantalum pentoxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>). Although no known materials can fully resist the effects of cavitation, if the tantalum pentoxide should be chipped away due to the cavitation, then oxidation will again occur at the underlying tantalum metal, so as to effectively repair the tantalum pentoxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0445">Although the tantalum pentoxide functions relatively well in this regard in known thermal ink jet systems, it has certain disadvantages. One significant disadvantage is that, in effect, virtually the whole protective layer <b>57</b> (having a thickness indicated by the reference numeral <b>59</b>) must be heated in order to transfer the required energy into the ink <b>11</b>, to heat it so as to form a bubble <b>12</b>. Not only does this increase the amount of heat which is required at the level designated <b>59</b> to raise the temperature at the level designated <b>60</b> sufficiently to heat the ink <b>11</b>, but it also results in a substantial thermal loss to take place in the directions indicated by the arrows <b>61</b>. As discussed earlier with reference to equation 3, this disadvantage would not be present if the heater element <b>10</b> was merely supported on a surface and was not covered by the protective layer <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0446">According to the feature presently under discussion, the need for a protective layer <b>57</b>, as described above, is avoided by generating the bubble <b>12</b> so that it collapses, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, towards a point of collapse <b>17</b> at which there is no solid material, and more particularly where there is the gap <b>54</b> between parts <b>53</b> of the heater element <b>10</b>. As there is merely the ink <b>11</b> itself in this location (prior to bubble generation), there is no material that can be eroded here by the effects of cavitation. The temperature at the point of collapse <b>17</b> may reach many thousands of degrees C, as is demonstrated by the phenomenon of sonoluminesence. This will break down the ink components at that point. However, the volume of extreme temperature at the point of collapse <b>17</b> is so small that the destruction of ink components in this volume is not significant.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0447">The generation of the bubble <b>12</b> so that it collapses towards a point of collapse <b>17</b> where there is no solid material can be achieved using heater elements <b>10</b> corresponding to that represented by the part <b>10</b>.<b>34</b> of the mask shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. The element represented is symmetrical, and has a hole represented by the reference numeral <b>63</b> at its center. When the element is heated, the bubble forms around the element (as indicated by the dashed line <b>64</b>) and then grows so that, instead of being of annular (doughnut) shape as illustrated by the dashed lines <b>64</b> and <b>65</b>) it spans the element including the hole <b>63</b>, the hole then being filled with the vapor that forms the bubble. The bubble <b>12</b> is thus substantially disc-shaped. When it collapses, the collapse is directed so as to minimize the surface tension surrounding the bubble <b>12</b>. This involves the bubble shape moving towards a spherical shape as far as is permitted by the dynamics that are involved. This, in turn, results in the point of collapse being in the region of the hole <b>63</b> at the center of the heater element <b>10</b>, where there is no solid material.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0448">The heater element <b>10</b> represented by the part <b>10</b>.<b>31</b> of the mask shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> is configured to achieve a similar result, with the bubble generating as indicated by the dashed line <b>66</b>, and the point of collapse to which the bubble collapses being in the hole <b>67</b> at the center of the element.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0449">The heater element <b>10</b> represented as the part <b>10</b>.<b>36</b> of the mask shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> is also configured to achieve a similar result. Where the element <b>10</b>.<b>36</b> is dimensioned such that the hole <b>68</b> is small, manufacturing inaccuracies of the heater element may affect the extent to which a bubble can be formed such that its point of collapse is in the region defined by the hole. For example, the hole may be as little as a few microns across. Where high levels of accuracy in the element <b>10</b>.<b>36</b> cannot be achieved, this may result in bubbles represented as <b>12</b>.<b>36</b> that are somewhat lopsided, so that they cannot be directed towards a point of collapse within such a small region. In such, a case, with regard to the heater element represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, the central loop <b>49</b> of the element can simply be omitted, thereby increasing the size of the region in which the point of collapse of the bubble is to fall.</p>

<p id="p-0350" num="0456">However, without some form of oxidation protection, an uncoated TiN heater will only eject a few tens of thousands of droplets before going &#x2018;open circuit&#x2019; (fracturing due to oxidative failure). Likewise, uncoated TaN heaters have inadequate oxidation resistance.</p>
<p id="h-0040" num="0000">Transition Metal Nitride Heater Materials with a Self Passivating Component</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0457">The Applicant resolved the oxidation problem, by introducing an additive that allows the transition metal nitride to self passivate. As previously discussed &#x2018;self passivation&#x2019; refers to the formation of a surface oxide layer, where the oxide has a low diffusion coefficient for oxygen so as to provide a barrier to further oxidation.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0458"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> shows experimental results comparing the oxidation resistance of TiN and TiAlN heater elements. The TiAlN heater is made replacing the Ti target (used to make TiN heaters) with a TiAl target (50% Ti, 50% Al by atomic composition). The resulting TiAlN heater material is &#x201c;self passivating&#x201d;, in the sense that it forms a thin Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, layer on its surface. This oxide layer acts as a diffusion barrier for oxygen. Since the diffusion coefficient for oxygen in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is much lower than that of TiO<sub>2</sub>, the oxidation resistance of TiAlN is vastly better than TiN, to the extent that an oxidation prevention coating is unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0459">The heater elements used in this test were suspended beams: these would normally be fully immersed in ink, but in this case, the ink chambers were deliberately left unfilled so that the heaters could be pulsed in air. This was done to isolate the oxidative failure mechanism. Each heater was pulsed at 5 kHz with 1 &#x3bc;s 330 nJ pulses. This amount of energy would normally be delivered mostly to the ink. Without the ink there was no diffusive loss and most of the input energy contributed to raising the heater temperature. The time scale for cooling due to conduction out the ends of the heater was measured to be &#x2dc;30 &#x3bc;s: fast enough to cool the heater to the background printhead IC (chip) temperature between pulses, but not fast enough to significantly reduce the peak heater temperature reached with each pulse. With a heater area of 164 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>and heater thickness of 0.5 &#x3bc;m, the 330 nJ input energy of each pulse was sufficient to raise the heater elements to &#x2dc;1000&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0460"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> shows a rapid rise in resistance of the TiN heater, with open circuit burn-out occurring within 0.2 billion pulses. In comparison, the TiAlN heater lasted for 1.4 billion pulses before the experiment was halted (with the heater still intact). The resistance of the TiN heater was very unstable. This was thought to be intrinsic to the heater rather than a measurement artifact such as noise, since each resistance spike typically consisted of &#x2dc;50 samples over 8 minutes. In comparison, the TiAlN heater resistance was relatively stable, but did show an initial dip then rise. Several effects could explain this, but only two have been proven to occur: with Auger depth profiling, aluminium has been shown to migrate from the bulk of the heater to the surface, then form Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>on the surface. The oxidation will increase the heater resistance while the removal of aluminium from the bulk of the material will decrease the heater resistance, since TiN is less resistive than TiAlN. This instability in the resistance of the TiAlN is not of great concern, since the peak operating temperature of the heater in ink is around 300&#xb0; C., well below the temperature required for the effect to manifest itself: further tests in an oven showed only small changes in the resistance of TiAlN heaters after heating in air to 400&#xb0; C. for various lengths of time up to one hour (0.4% change for 1 hour at 400&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0461">To further prove than the difference in heater lifetime in air was due to different oxidation rates and not a difference in mechanical properties, the above tests were repeated with DC current, to avoid the repeated expansion and contraction-caused by pulsing the current. Again, the TiAlN heaters had vastly improved lifetime compared to TiN heaters supplied the same amount of power. When the TiN heaters were coated with a 300 A layer of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, the lifetimes with DC current became comparable, indicating Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>provides effective oxidation protection. This Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer quickly cracked and peeled when the heater were pulsed however, due to a difference in coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0462">In terms of ejection performance, the TiAlN heaters again had vastly improved longevity. Uncoated 120 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>*0.5 &#x3bc;m TiAlN heaters suspended in ink 4 &#x3bc;m directly beneath the ejection nozzle typically eject several hundreds of millions of ink drops compared to several tens of thousands of drops for uncoated TiN heaters or TiN heaters coated in 300 A of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. In the light of the above experiments discussing oxidation, the improved longevity over TiN results from the improved oxidation, resistance of TiAlN, which arises from a self passivating Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0463">The cavitation resistance of TiAIN has been investigated with extensive open pool testing of non-suspended heaters bonded to SiO<sub>2 </sub>substrates. In these tests the heater was not shaped to avoid the collapse of the bubble on the heater: stroboscopic imaging indicated that the bubble was in fact collapsing on the heater. Despite this, none of the pitting traditionally associated with cavitation damage was observed, even after 1 billion nucleating pulses in water. The high &#x2dc;25 GPa hardness of TiAlN provides excellent cavitation resistance on TiAlN. Thus the use of TiAlN heaters (in addition to removing the oxidation protection layers) allow removal of the cavitation protection layer, even without a mechanism designed to avoid bubble collapse, such as shaped heaters. As a result, use of this material facilitates a dramatic increase in ejection efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0464">In the long term ejection and open pool testing, the ultimate failure mechanism of the TiAlN heaters was cracking across the heater, causing an open circuit. On one device, this occurred after 7 billion pulses. The standard deviation in lifetime was quite large, however, so it would be misleading to quote just that figure. In statistical analysis of cracking, it is common to derive reliability figures by plotting lifetime results on the so called Weibull distribution. When this was done, it was determined that 0.5 &#x3bc;m thick, 32 &#x3bc;m long, 4 &#x3bc;m wide TiAlN heaters could reach 80 million bubble nucleations in water in an open pool configuration with 99% reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0465">Exposing the TiAlN heaters to acidic (pH&#x3c;4) or alkaline (pH&#x3e;9) environments, or chlorine or fluorine ions, can destabilize the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>passivating layer. This can lead to stress corrosion cracking and ultimately failure of the element. However, the crack limited lifetime of open pool heaters can be improved by several means:

        <li id="ul0062-0002" num="0467">A 300 A TiAl coating. The corrosion resistance of TiAlN was found to be a decreasing function of increasing nitrogen content and TiAl was found to have better corrosion resistance than TiAlN, justifying the use of a TiAl coating to improve corrosion resistance. A TiAl coating is easier to fabricate than a Ta or TaN coating, as the TiAl sputter target used for the TiAlN deposition can also be used for the TiAl coating. TiAl also slicks to the TiAlN heater better than Ta or TaN and is less likely to flake off during operation.</li>

<p id="p-0360" num="0470">Several other aspects of TiAlN require discussion, to replicate this work. Firstly the aluminium content of the TiAl target impacts the oxidation resistance and resistivity, both of which increase monotonically up to &#x2dc;60% aluminium content. Beyond this point the phase of the deposited material changes to a form with reduced oxidation resistance. A 50% composition was chosen in the Applicant's work to provide a margin of safety in avoiding this phase change. Secondly, the resistivity increases monotonically as a function of increasing nitrogen flow in the reactive deposition. At a particular nitrogen flow, the resistivity increases sharply as a result of another phase change. The exact nitrogen flow at which, this occurs depends on other parameters such as argon flow and sputtering power, so it is best to characterize this effect in a new deposition chamber by running a set of depositions with increasing nitrogen flow or decreasing sputtering power, plotting the sheet resistance of the resulting layers as a function of nitrogen flow or sputtering power. In the Applicant's work, films were deposited on both sides of the phase change associated with nitrogen flow. The resistivity of the low nitrogen material was 2.5 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m, while the resistivity of the high nitrogen material was 8 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m. The higher resistivity is preferable for inkjet heaters, as the current density and current will be lower. Therefore, electromigration is less likely to be a problem. Unfortunately, the oxidation resistance of the high nitrogen material was worse: with 1 hour treatments at 400&#xb0; C., heaters made from the high nitrogen material increased in resistance 5%, compared to 0.4% for heaters made from the low nitrogen material. As a result, all of the Applicant's work has focused on the low nitrogen material.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0471">Two final aspects of TiAlN are of interest. Firstly, if the material is deposited onto aluminium metallization using reactive sputtering in a nitrogen atmosphere, care must be taken to avoid the formation of an insulating aluminium nitride layer, which will greatly increase the contact resistance. The formation of this interlayer can be avoided by sputtering a thin TiAl layer a few hundred angstroms thick as a barrier layer prior to the introduction of nitrogen into the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0472">Secondly, as with TiN, TiAlN forms columnar crystals. Both of these materials suffer from a growth defect when deposited over non-planar geometry: in the corners of trenches, the columnar crystals on the bottom of the trench grow vertically, while the crystals on the side wall grow horizontally. In this situation, regardless of the deposition thickness, it is possible for the layers on the bottom and side wall to not merge at all, but instead be electrically isolated by a crack that grows at the interface. This can make it difficult to connect the heater material to the CMOS metallization, as it must be deposited into a trench etched in the passivation covering the CMOS metallization. This problem can be overcome by electrically shorting the bottom of the trench to the top of the trench with a metal layer, deposited before or after the heater layer. The metal layer needs to be thick enough to ensure electrical continuity over the step and to ensure its current carrying capacity is high enough to avoid electromigration.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0473">Readers experienced in the art will appreciate that sputtering a composite TiAl target in a nitrogen atmosphere is not the only means by which TiAlN films may be formed. Variations such as the use of CVD deposition, replacing the composite target with co-sputtered Ti and Al targets or using a method other than argon sputtering to sputter the targets do not affect the ability of TiAlN to self-passivate.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0474">Readers experienced in the art will also appreciate that the transition metal, of the &#x201c;transition metal nitride heater materials with a self passivating component&#x201d; need not be titanium, as other transition metals such as tantalum form conductive nitrides. Also, the self passivating component need not be aluminium: any other additive whose oxidation is thermodynamically favored over the other components will form an oxide on the heater surface. Provided this oxide has a low oxygen diffusion rate (comparable to aluminium oxide), the additive will be a suitable alternative to aluminium.</p>
<p id="h-0041" num="0000">Nanocrystalline Composite Heater Material</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0475">Nanocrystalline composite films are made from two or more phases, one nanocrystalline, the other amorphous, or both nanocrystalline. By incorporating the self passivating transition metal nitrides into a nanocrystalline composite structure, it is possible to further improve hardness, thermal stability, oxidation resistance and in particular crack resistance. For example, it is possible to improve the properties of TiAlN by adding Si to form a TiAlSiN nanocomposite, in which TiAlN nanocrystals are embedded in an amorphous Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>matrix. TiAlSiN has the following advantages over TiAlN:
<ul id="ul0063" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0063-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0064" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0064-0001" num="0476">1. The columnar crystalline grain boundaries that act as fast diffusion paths for the transport of oxygen into TiAlN are removed. Diffusion of oxygen into TiAlSiN is limited by the low diffusion coefficient for oxygen of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) phase encasing the TiAlN nanocrystals.</li>
        <li id="ul0064-0002" num="0477">2. The Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>phase encasing the TiAlN nanocrystals provides enhanced corrosion resistance.</li>
        <li id="ul0064-0003" num="0478">3. The Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>phase separating the TiAlSiN crystals improves the stability against recrystallisation (Oswald ripening). TiAlSiN is thermally stable up to 1100&#xb0; C., compared to 800&#xb0; C. for TiAlN, so the material is more able to withstand the high temperatures that result when a suspended heater is pulsed in deprimed chamber.</li>
        <li id="ul0064-0004" num="0479">4. The hardness of the material can significantly exceed that of its constituent phases, improving the cavitation resistance (&#x2dc;50 GPa for TiAlSiN, compared to &#x2dc;25 GPa for TiAlN and &#x2dc;19 GPa for Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>).</li>
        <li id="ul0064-0005" num="0480">5. The resistivity can be increased from 2.5 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m to 5 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m (for similar nitrogen contents). This allows a reduction in current and current density, reducing the likelihood of problems such as ground bounce and electromigration.</li>
        <li id="ul0064-0006" num="0481">6. A crack-like defect caused by the change in direction of crystal growth in TiAlN deposited at the bottom of trenches in eliminated.</li>
        <li id="ul0064-0007" num="0482">7. The structure is less brittle and far less prone to crack propagation, thereby improving the lifetime of the heaters.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0483">As with TiAlN, increased nitrogen content can be used to increase the resistivity of TiAlSiN; films in the range 5 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m to 50 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m have been tested by the Applicant. As with TiAlN however, the corrosion resistance of the high nitrogen films (&#x3e;10 &#x3bc;Ohm&#xb7;m in this case) is relatively poor, so again the Applicant has concentrated on the low nitrogen films.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0484">The hardness of TiAlSiN films exhibit a maximum that depends on the grain size of the crystals embedded in the amorphous Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>matrix, which in turn depends on the percentage of silicon incorporated into the film. As the silicon percentage increases from zero, the crystal grain size becomes smaller and the film hardness increases because dislocation movement is hindered, as described by the Hall Petch relationship. As it approaches &#x2dc;5 nm, the hardness peaks. If the silicon percentage is increased further, the grain size will reduce further, and the hardness will decrease towards that of the amorphous Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>phase as grain, boundary sliding becomes dominant (the reverse Hall Petch effect).</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0485">Although high hardness is ideal for cavitation resistance, high fracture toughness is perhaps more relevant to the heater material given the cracking failure mechanism of TiAlN. The fracture toughness of nanocrystalline composite TiAlSiN is higher than the toughness of the constituent phases, because the crystals can terminate cracks propagating in the amorphous phase. Like the hardness, the fracture toughness exhibits a maximum as a function of silicon concentration: too little silicon and the crystal phase will dominate cracking; too much silicon and the crystals will be too sparse or small to terminate cracks, so the amorphous phase will dominate cracking.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0486">It is estimated that the peaks in hardness and toughness lie between atomic Si concentrations of 5% to 20%. Targets made with that concentration of Si, with the balance composed of equal proportions of Ti and Al, can be sputtered in a reactive nitrogen atmosphere to produce the nanocrystalline composite films. As with the TiAlN, the presence of Al is intended to improve the oxidation resistance of the material.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0487">It will be understood by those experienced in the art that the amorphous phase of the nanocrystalline composite does not have to be silicon nitride: any hard, thermally stable alternative with a low oxygen diffusivity (such as boron nitride, aluminium oxide or silicon carbide) will suffice. Also, the nanocrystalline phase need not be a transition metal nitride, as silicides, borides and carbides can also be very hard with low resistivity. Similarly, the transition metal need not be titanium, as other transition metals such as tantalum and tungsten form conductive nitrides. Finally, the self passivating component added to the nanocrystalline composite material need not be aluminium: any other additive whose oxidation is thermodynamically favored over the other components will form an oxide on the heater surface. Provided this oxide has a low oxygen diffusion rate (comparable to aluminium oxide), the additive will be a suitable alternative to aluminium.</p>
<p id="h-0042" num="0000">Using the Heater as a MEMS Fluid Sensor</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0488">The heater can be used as a fluid sensor, using the heater's thermal coefficient of resistance (TCR) to determine temperature and the temperature to determine whether the heater is surrounded by air or immersed in liquid. There are 2 key enabling aspects that allow the heaters of self cooling nozzles to be used in this fashion:
<ul id="ul0065" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0065-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0066" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0066-0001" num="0489">1. the removal of ail, or at least the vast majority of, the protective overcoat layers</li>
        <li id="ul0066-0002" num="0490">2. suspension of the heaters to thermally isolate the heaters from the substrate.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0491">Considering firstly the protective layers: these are typically about 1 &#x3bc;m thick in existing printhead heaters. These layers must be heated to the film boiling temperature to eject a drop, together with a &#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;m layer of ink. While the protective layers and the ink are being heated, heat will diffuse about the same distance into the underlayer. The heater thickness is typically &#x2dc;0.2 &#x3bc;m so in total, &#x2dc;3.2 &#x3bc;m of solid and &#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;m of liquid must be heated to the film boiling temperature. The large amount of solid that must be heated makes existing devices inefficient, but it also means the heater cannot easily be used as a fluid sensor, as the portion of heat lost to the fluid is relatively small. The drop in peak heater temperature is at most 1.5% when the ink chamber goes from an unfilled to a filled state (&#x2dc;25% of the total heat is taken away from the 3.2 &#x3bc;m of solid, of which the heater comprises only 6% by thickness).</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0492">Considering now the devices of the present invention, with heaters that have either no coatings or coatings that are thin with respect to the heater (&#x3c;20% of heater thickness). These heaters have good thermal isolation, being fully suspended or with underlayers that have thermal products (&#x3c1;<sub>u</sub>C<sub>u</sub>k<sub>u</sub>)<sup>1/1 </sup>less than that of water. If the heater is fully suspended with no protective coatings, there is no solid outside of the heater to heat. If there is no ink present, almost all of the heater will be retained by the heater on the time scale of the input pulse. If there is water based ink present, modelling with equation 3 indicates that &#x2dc;30% of the heat will be retained the heater with the remaining &#x2dc;70% diffusing into the ink. As a result, the peak heater temperature will drop 70% when the ink chamber goes from an unfilled to a filled state. If the heater has an appreciable TCR, this difference in peak temperature will show up as a difference in heater resistance at the end of the input pulse. If the input voltage is kept constant with a low output impedance drive, this will show up as a difference in current at the end of the input pulse. The change in current can be used to detect the transition of the ink chambers from an unfilled to a filled state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> shows an example of this phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0493">One point of concern regarding suspended heaters is the temperature they reach when pulsed without ink present. The temperature the heaters must reach to eject water based ink when it is present is &#x2dc;300&#xb0; C. If there is no ink present when an input pulse of the same magnitude is applied, the peak temperature will be 100%/30% higher i.e. &#x2dc;1000&#xb0; C. At this temperature the stability of the heaters becomes a concern: TiN readily oxidises at this temperature, as demonstrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>. TiAlN with an equal proportion of Ti and AI has much better stability at this temperature, but unfortunately its TCR is practically zero and cannot be used to detect the presence of ink.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0494">The fact that suspended heaters reach 1000&#xb0; C. when pulsed in air is of some concern: the heaters must be robust against depriming of the ink chambers. One way to address this concern is to use a non-suspended heater with a solid underlayer. In that case, the heater will always be in contact with a solid, regardless of the presence of ink, so the peak temperature will be lower. If the thermal product of the underlayer is comparable to that of water, modelling using equation 3 with a 0.2 &#x3bc;m thick heater predicts &#x2dc;35% of the heat would diffuse into the ink if ink were present. Without ink, this 35% would be shared between the heater and the underlayer, which has a thermal length scale of &#x2dc;0.7 &#x3bc;m. This would result in a drop in peak heater temperature of only &#x2dc;8% when the ink chamber goes from an unfilled to a filled state (&#x2dc;35% of the total heat is taken away from the 0.9 &#x3bc;m of solid, of which the heater comprises 22% by thickness). With a film boiling temperature of &#x2dc;300&#xb0; C., this implies a peak heater temperature of &#x2dc;326&#xb0; C. if the heater is pulsed with the same energy when ink is not present. The difference in temperature is more difficult to detect given the presence of noise in the measured pulses. Thus, using the heaters to detect the presence of ink is far more practical if the heater is suspended.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0495">This sensor could be applied to any MEMS fluidic device where an electrical means of determining the presence of fluid is desired. This may be required in some devices where automation of filling is required or where visual observation of filling is made impossible by obstruction. The is the case for thermal inkjet printheads and the detection of subsequent de-priming is also very useful.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0496">Of course, it is particularly convenient to use the heaters in a printhead for the dual purpose of droplet ejection and fluid sensing. However, as discussed above, traditional inkjet heater elements are not suitable as fluid sensors because of their thick protective coatings and non-suspended configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0497">An additional benefit of using the heater as a fluid sensor is that the phase change associated with bubble nucleation can be detected: as soon a film boiling occurs, the suspended heater becomes thermally isolated from the fluid it is immersed in, so further input of energy causes the temperature and resistance of the heater to rise more quickly as a function of time. By detecting this inflection point in the resistance vs time curve, the time at which nucleation occurs can be determined for a given input power. This is useful for studying the physics of the device and also useful for systems where visual inspection of the ejected drops is not possible. Experiments with the Applicant's devices show that the inflection point in the resistance vs time curve corresponds to a &#x201c;saturation point&#x201d;, where further increases in voltage or pulse length do not increase the droplet velocity any further. This is because the bubble completely envelops the heater when it is formed, preventing the heater from delivering any more energy to the fluid. With a given input voltage, tuning the pulse length so that the inflection point is occurs at the very end of the input pulse allows the pulse length, input energy and peak heater temperature to be electrically minimized. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> shows the resistance of a suspended TiN heater as a function of time. In this case the pulse length is longer than it need be: the heater is being overdriven so that the inflection point can be clearly seen.</p>
<p id="h-0043" num="0000">Suspended vs Bonded Heaters</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0498">Suspending the heater is not an essential ingredient in producing a self cooling inkjet: as long as the underlayer has a thermal product (&#x3c1;<sub>u</sub>C<sub>u</sub>k<sub>u</sub>)<sup>1/2 </sup>that is less than or equal to that of the ink, the energy required to nucleate a bubble will be less than or equal to that of a suspended heater. As discussed above, one advantage of depositing the heater on a solid underlayer is the peak temperature of the heater will be very much lower if the heater is fired without ink in the chamber, so the requirements on the thermal stability and oxidation resistance of the heater are less stringent. Other advantages are ease of manufacturing and the fact that the heater can be made thinner because it is supported by a solid underlayer. This reduces the energy required to heat the heater, which makes the nucleation time faster, which also reduces the diffusive loss terms in equation 3. Thus a heater of the same top surface area bonded to a solid underlayer can actually take less energy to nucleate a bubble than a suspended one, especially if the thermal product of the underlayer is significantly less than that of water. The big disadvantage of unsuspended heaters with respect to self cooling inkjets is the loss of half the bubble volume, which will decrease the bubble impulse (force integrated over time) and reduce the keep-wet time.</p>

<p id="p-0381" num="0500">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42</figref>, <b>44</b> and <b>55</b>, the heater elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> in the chamber <b>7</b>, may have different sizes relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0501">Also as will be appreciated with reference to the above description of the lithographic process, each heater element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> is formed by at least one step of that process, the lithographic steps relating to each one of the elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> being distinct from those relating to the other element <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0502">The elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> are preferably sized relative to each other, as reflected schematically in the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, such that they can achieve binary weighted ink drop volumes, that is, so that they can cause ink drops <b>16</b> having different, binary weighted volumes to be ejected through the nozzle <b>3</b> of the particular unit cell <b>1</b>. The achievement of the binary weighting of the volumes of the ink drops <b>16</b> is determined by the relative sizes of the elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, the area of the bottom heater element <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> in contact with the ink <b>11</b> is twice that of top heater element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0503">One known prior art device, patented by Canon, and illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>, also has two heater elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> for each nozzle, and these are also sized on a binary basis (i.e. to produce drops <b>16</b> with binary weighted volumes). These elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> are formed in a single layer, adjacent to each other in the nozzle chamber <b>7</b>. It will be appreciated that the bubble <b>12</b>.<b>1</b> formed by the small element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> alone, is relatively small, while that <b>12</b>.<b>2</b> formed by the large element <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> alone, is relatively large. The bubble generated by both elements actuated simultaneously, is designated <b>12</b>.<b>3</b>. Three differently sized ink drops <b>16</b> will be caused to be ejected by the three respective bubbles <b>12</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>12</b>.<b>2</b> and <b>12</b>.<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0504">It will be appreciated that the size of the elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> themselves are not required to be binary weighted to cause the ejection of drops <b>16</b> having different sizes or the ejection of useful combinations of drops, indeed, the binary weighting may well not be represented precisely by the area of the elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> themselves. In sizing the elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> to achieve binary weighted drop volumes, the fluidic characteristics surrounding the generation of bubbles <b>12</b>. the drop dynamics characteristics, the quantity of liquid that is drawing back into the chamber <b>7</b> from the nozzle <b>3</b> once a drop <b>16</b> has broken off, and so forth, must be considered. Accordingly, the actual ratio of the surface areas of the elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>, or the performance of the two heaters, needs to be adjusted in practice to achieve the desired binary weighted drop volumes.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0505">Where the size of the heater elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> is fixed and where the ratio of their surface areas is therefore fixed, the relative sizes of ejected drops <b>16</b> may be adjusted by adjusting the supply voltages to the two elements. This can also be achieved by adjusting the duration of the operation pulses of the elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>&#x2014;i.e. their pulse widths. However, the pulse widths cannot exceed a certain amount of time, because once a bubble <b>12</b> has nucleated on the surface of an element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>, then any duration of pulse width after that time will be of little or no effect.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0506">On the other hand, the low thermal mass of the heater elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> allows them to be heated to reach, very quickly, the temperature at which bubbles <b>12</b> are formed and at which drops <b>16</b> are ejected. While the maximum effective pulse width is limited, by the onset of bubble nucleation, typically to around 0.5 microseconds, the minimum pulse width is limited only by the available current drive and the current density that can be tolerated by the heater elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0507">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, the two heaters elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> are connected to two respective drive circuits <b>70</b>. Although these circuits <b>70</b> may be identical to each other, a further adjustment can be effected by way of these circuits, for example by sizing the drive transistor (not shown) connected to the lower element <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>, which is the high current element, larger than that connected to the upper element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>. If, for example, the relative currents provided to the respective elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> are in the ratio 2:1, the drive transistor of the circuit <b>70</b> connected to the lower element <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> would typically be twice the width of the drive transistor (also not shown) of the circuit <b>70</b> connected to the other element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0508">In the prior art described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>, the heater elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>, which are in the same layer, are produced simultaneously in the same step of the lithographic manufacturing process. In the embodiment of the present invention, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, the two heaters elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>, as mentioned above, are formed one after the other. Indeed, as described in the process illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 35</figref>, the material to form the element <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> is deposited and is then etched in the lithographic process, whereafter a sacrificial layer <b>39</b> is deposited on top of that element, and then the material for the other element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> is deposited so that the sacrificial layer is between the two heater element layers. The layer of the second element <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> is etched by a second lithographic step, and the sacrificial layer <b>39</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0509">Referring once again to the different sizes of the heater elements <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>10</b>.<b>2</b>, as mentioned above, this has the advantage that it enables the elements to be sized so as to achieve multiple, binary weighted drop volumes from one nozzle <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0510">It will be appreciated that, where multiple drop volumes can be achieved, and especially if they are binary weighted, then photographic quality can be obtained while using fewer printed dots, and at a lower print resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0511">Furthermore, under the same circumstances, higher speed printing can be achieved. That is, instead of just ejecting one drop <b>14</b> and then waiting for the nozzle <b>3</b> to refill, the equivalent of one, two, or three drops might be ejected. Assuming that the available refill speed of the nozzle <b>3</b> is not a limiting factor, ink ejection, and hence printing, up to three times faster, may be achieved. In practice, however, the nozzle refill time will typically be a limiting factor. In this case, the nozzle <b>3</b> will take slightly longer to refill when a triple volume of drop <b>16</b> (relative to the minimum size drop) has been ejected than when only a minimum volume drop has been ejected. However, in practice it will not take as much as three times as long to refill. This is due to the inertial dynamics and the surface tension of the ink <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0512">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, there is shown, schematically, a pair of adjacent unit cells <b>1</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>1</b>.<b>2</b>, the cell on the left <b>1</b>.<b>1</b> representing the nozzle <b>3</b> after a larger volume of drop <b>16</b> has been ejected, and that on the right <b>1</b>.<b>2</b>, after a drop of smaller volume has been ejected. In the case of the larger drop <b>16</b>, the curvature of the air bubble <b>71</b> that has formed inside the partially emptied nozzle <b>3</b>.<b>1</b> is larger than in the case of air bubble <b>72</b> that has formed after the smaller volume drop has been ejected from the nozzle <b>3</b>.<b>2</b> of the other unit cell <b>1</b>.<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0513">The higher curvature of the air bubble <b>71</b> in the unit cell <b>1</b>.<b>1</b> results in a greater surface tension force which tends to draw the ink <b>11</b>, from the refill passage <b>9</b> towards the nozzle <b>3</b> and into the chamber <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>, as indicated by the arrow <b>73</b>. This gives rise to a shorter refilling time. As the chamber <b>7</b>.<b>1</b> refills, it reaches a stage, designated <b>74</b>, where the condition is similar to that in the adjacent unit cell <b>1</b>.<b>2</b>. In this condition, the chamber <b>7</b>.<b>1</b> of the unit cell <b>1</b>.<b>1</b> is partially refilled and the surface tension force has therefore reduced. This results in the refill speed slowing down even though, at this stage, when this condition is reached in that unit cell <b>1</b>.<b>1</b>, a flow of liquid into the chamber <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>, with its associated momentum, has been established. The overall effect of this is that, although it takes longer to completely fill the chamber <b>7</b>.<b>1</b> and nozzle <b>3</b>.<b>1</b> from a time when the air bubble <b>71</b> is present than from when the condition <b>74</b> is present, even if the volume to be refilled is three times larger, it does not take as much as three times longer to refill the chamber <b>7</b>.<b>1</b> and nozzle <b>3</b>.<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0045" num="0000">Example Printer in which the Printhead is Used</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0514">The components described above form part of a printhead assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67 to 74</figref>. The printhead assembly <b>19</b> is used in a printer system <b>140</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>. The printhead assembly <b>19</b> includes a number of printhead modules <b>80</b> shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 63 to 66</figref>. These aspects are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0515">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, the array of nozzles <b>3</b> shown is disposed on the printhead chip (not shown), with drive transistors, drive shift registers, and so on (not shown), included on the same chip, which reduces the number of connections required on the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0516"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 63 and 64</figref> show an exploded view and a non-exploded view, respectively, a printhead module assembly <b>80</b> which includes a MEMS printhead chip assembly <b>81</b> (also referred to below as a chip). On a typical chip assembly <b>81</b> such as that shown, there are 7680 nozzles, which are spaced so as to be capable of printing with a resolution of 1600 dots per inch. The chip <b>81</b> is also configured to eject 6 different colors or types of ink <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0517">A flexible printed circuit board (PCB) <b>82</b> is electrically connected to the chip <b>81</b>, for supplying both power and data to the chip. The chip <b>81</b> is bonded onto a stainless-steel upper layer sheet <b>83</b>, so as to overlie an array of holes <b>84</b> etched in this sheet. The chip <b>81</b> itself is a multi-layer stack of silicon which has ink channels (not shown) in the bottom layer of silicon <b>85</b>, these channels being aligned with the holes <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0518">The chip <b>81</b> is approximately 1 mm in width and 21 mm in length. This length is determined by the width, of the field of the stepper that is used to fabricate the chip <b>81</b>. The sheet <b>83</b> has channels <b>86</b> (only some of which are shown as hidden detail) which are etched on the underside of the sheet as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>. The channels <b>86</b> extend as shown so that their ends align with holes <b>87</b> in a mid-layer <b>88</b>. The channels <b>86</b> align with respective holes <b>87</b>. The holes <b>87</b>, in turn, align with channels <b>89</b> in a lower layer <b>90</b>. Each channel <b>89</b> carries a different respective color of ink, except for the last channel, designated <b>91</b>. This last channel <b>91</b> is an air channel and is aligned with further holes <b>92</b> in the mid-layer <b>88</b>, which in turn are aligned with further holes <b>93</b> in the upper layer sheet <b>83</b>. These holes <b>93</b> are aligned with the inner parts <b>94</b> of slots <b>95</b> in a top channel layer <b>96</b>, so that these inner parts are aligned with, and therefore in fluid-flow communication with, the air channel <b>91</b>, as indicated by the dashed line <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0519">The lower layer <b>90</b> has holes <b>98</b> opening into the channels <b>89</b> and channel <b>91</b>. Compressed filtered air from an air source (not shown) enters the channel <b>91</b> through the relevant hole <b>98</b>, and then passes through the holes <b>92</b> and <b>93</b> and slots <b>95</b>, in the mid layer <b>88</b>, the sheet <b>83</b> and the top channel layer <b>96</b>, respectively, and is then blown into the side <b>99</b> of the chip assembly <b>81</b>, from where it is forced out, at <b>100</b>, through a nozzle guard <b>101</b> which covers the nozzles, to keep the nozzles clear of paper dust. Differently colored inks <b>11</b> (not shown) pass through the holes <b>98</b> of the lower layer <b>90</b>, into the channels <b>89</b>, and then through respective holes <b>87</b>, then along respective channels <b>86</b> in the underside of the upper layer sheet <b>83</b>, through respective holes <b>84</b> of that sheet, and then through the slots <b>95</b>, to the chip <b>81</b>. It will be noted that there are just seven of the holes <b>98</b> in the lower layer <b>90</b> (one for each color of ink and one for the compressed air) via which the ink and air is passed to the chip <b>81</b>, the ink being directed to the 7680 nozzles on the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0520"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>, in which a side view of the printhead module assembly <b>80</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 58 and 59</figref> is schematically shown, is now referred to. The center layer <b>102</b> of the chip assembly is the layer where the 7680 nozzles and their associated drive circuitry are disposed. The top layer of the chip assembly, which constitutes the nozzle guard <b>101</b>, enables the filtered compressed air to be directed so as to keep the nozzle guard holes <b>104</b> (which are represented schematically by dashed lines) clear of paper dust.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0521">The lower layer <b>105</b> is of silicon and has ink channels etched in it. These ink channels are aligned with the holes <b>84</b> in the stainless steel upper layer sheet <b>83</b>. The sheet <b>83</b> receives ink and compressed air from the lower layer <b>90</b> as described above, and then directs the ink and air to the chip <b>81</b>. The need to funnel the ink and air from where it is received by the lower layer <b>90</b>, via the mid-layer <b>88</b> and upper layer <b>83</b> to the chip assembly <b>81</b>, is because it would otherwise be impractical to align the large number (7680) of very small nozzles <b>3</b> with the larger, less accurate holes <b>98</b> in the lower layer <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0522">The flex PCB <b>82</b> is connected to the shift registers and other circuitry (not shown) located on the layer <b>102</b> of chip assembly <b>81</b>. The chip assembly <b>81</b> is bonded by wires <b>106</b> onto the PCB flex and these wires are then encapsulated in an epoxy <b>107</b>. To effect this encapsulating, a dam <b>108</b> is provided. This allows the epoxy <b>107</b> to be applied to fill the space between the dam <b>108</b> and the chip assembly <b>81</b> so that the wires <b>106</b> are embedded in the epoxy. Once the epoxy <b>107</b> has hardened, it protects the wire bonding structure from contamination by paper and dust, and from mechanical contact.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0523">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>, there is shown schematically, in an exploded view, a printhead assembly <b>19</b>, which includes, among other components, printhead module assemblies <b>80</b> as described above. The printhead assembly <b>19</b> is configured for a page-width printer, suitable for A4 or US letter type paper.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0524">The printhead assembly <b>19</b> includes eleven of the printhead modules assemblies <b>80</b>, which are glued onto a substrate channel <b>110</b> in the form of a bent metal plate. A series of groups of seven holes each, designated by the reference numerals <b>111</b>, supply the 6 different colors of ink and the compressed air to the chip assemblies <b>81</b>. An extruded flexible ink hose <b>112</b> is glued into place in the channel <b>110</b>. It will be noted that the hose <b>112</b> includes holes <b>113</b> therein. These holes <b>113</b> are not present when the hose <b>112</b> is first connected to the channel <b>110</b>, but are formed thereafter by way of melting, by forcing a hot wire structure (not shown) through the holes <b>111</b>, which holes then serve as guides to fix the positions at which the holes <b>113</b> are melted. When the printhead assembly <b>19</b> is assembled, the holes <b>113</b> are in fluid-flow communication with the holes <b>98</b> in the lower layer <b>90</b> of each printhead module assembly <b>80</b>, via holes <b>114</b> (which make up the groups <b>111</b> in the channel <b>110</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0525">The hose <b>112</b> defines parallel channels <b>115</b> which extend the length of the hose. At one end <b>116</b>, the hose <b>112</b> is connected to ink containers (not shown), and at the opposite end <b>117</b>, there is provided a channel extrusion cap <b>118</b>, which serves to plug, and thereby close, that end of the hose.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0526">A metal top support plate <b>119</b> supports and locates the channel <b>110</b> and hose <b>112</b>, and serves as a back plate for these. The channel <b>110</b> and hose <b>112</b>, in turn, exert pressure onto an assembly <b>120</b> which includes flex printed circuits. The plate <b>119</b> has tabs <b>121</b> which extend through notches <b>122</b> in the downwardly extending wall <b>123</b> of the channel <b>110</b>, to locate the channel and plate with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0527">An extrusion <b>124</b> is provided to locate copper bus bars <b>125</b>. Although the energy required to operate a printhead according to the present invention is an order of magnitude lower than that of known thermal inkjet printers, there are a total of about 88,000 nozzles in the printhead array, and this is approximately 160 times the number of nozzles that are typically found in typical printheads. As the nozzles in the present invention may be operational (i.e. may fire) on a continuous basis during operation, the total power consumption, will, be an order of magnitude higher than that in such known printheads, and the current requirements will, accordingly, be high, even though the power consumption per nozzle will be an order of magnitude lower than that in the known printheads. The busbars <b>125</b> are suitable for providing for such power requirements, and have power leads <b>126</b> soldered to them.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0528">Compressible conductive strips <b>127</b> are provided to abut with contacts <b>128</b> on the upperside, as shown, of the lower parts of the flex PCBs <b>82</b> of the printhead module assemblies <b>80</b>. The PCBs <b>82</b> extend from the chip assemblies <b>81</b>, around the channel <b>110</b>, the support plate <b>119</b>, the extrusion <b>124</b> and busbars <b>126</b>, to a position below the strips <b>127</b> so that the contacts <b>128</b> are positioned below, and in contact with, the strips <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0529">Each PCB <b>82</b> is double-sided and plated-through. Data connections <b>129</b> (indicated schematically by dashed lines), which are located on the outer surface of the PCB <b>82</b> abut with contact spots <b>130</b> (only some of which are shown schematically) on a flex PCB <b>131</b> which, in turn, includes a data bus and edge connectors <b>132</b> which are formed as part of the flex itself. Data is fed to the PCBs <b>131</b> via the edge connectors <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0530">A metal plate <b>133</b> is provided so that it, together with the channel <b>110</b>, can keep all of the components of the printhead assembly <b>19</b> together. In this regard, the channel <b>110</b> includes twist tabs <b>134</b> which extend through slots <b>135</b> in the plate <b>133</b> when the assembly <b>19</b> is put together, and are then twisted through approximately 45 degrees to prevent them from being withdrawn through the slots.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0531">By way of summary, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</figref>, the printhead assembly <b>19</b> is shown in an assembled state.

The printhead chip assemblies <b>81</b> are located on the eleven printhead module assemblies <b>80</b>, which include the PCBs <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0532">Mounting holes <b>137</b> are provided for mounting the printhead assembly <b>19</b> in place in a printer (not shown). The effective length of the printhead assembly <b>19</b>, represented by the distance <b>138</b>, is just over the width of an A4 page (that is, about 8.5 inches).</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0533">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, there is shown, schematically, a cross-section through the assembled printhead <b>19</b>.

<p id="p-0415" num="0534">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>, there is shown a block diagram illustrating a printhead system <b>140</b> according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0535">Shown in the block diagram is the printhead <b>141</b>, a power supply <b>142</b> to the printhead, an ink supply <b>143</b>, and print data <b>144</b> (represented by the arrow) which is fed to the printhead as it ejects ink, at <b>145</b>, onto print media in the form, for example, of paper <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0536">Media transport rollers <b>147</b> are provided to transport the paper <b>146</b> past the printhead <b>141</b>. A media pick up mechanism <b>148</b> is configured to withdraw a sheet of paper <b>146</b> from a media tray <b>149</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0537">The power supply <b>142</b> is for providing DC voltage which is a standard type of supply in printer devices.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0538">The ink supply <b>143</b> is from ink cartridges (not shown) and, typically various types of information will be provided, at <b>150</b>, about the ink supply, such as the amount of ink remaining.

<p id="p-0421" num="0540">It is necessary for the system controller <b>151</b> to identify when a sheet of paper <b>146</b> is moving past the printhead <b>141</b>, so that printing can be effected at the correct time. This time can be related to a specific time that has elapsed after the media pick up mechanism <b>148</b> has picked up the sheet of paper <b>146</b>. Preferably, however, a paper sensor (not shown) is provided, which is connected to the system controller <b>151</b> so that when the sheet of paper <b>146</b> reaches a certain position relative to the printhead <b>141</b>, the system controller can effect printing. Printing is effected by triggering a print data formatter <b>155</b> which provides the print data <b>144</b> to the printhead <b>141</b>. It will therefore be appreciated that the system controller <b>151</b> must also interact with the print data formatter <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0541">The print data <b>144</b> emanates from an external computer (not shown) connected at <b>156</b>, and may be transmitted via any of a number of different connection means, such as a USB connection, an ETHERNET connection, a IEEE 1394 connection otherwise known as firewire, or a parallel connection. A data communications module <b>157</b> provides this data to the print, data formatter <b>155</b> and provides control information to the system controller <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0047" num="0000">Features and Advantages of Further Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0542"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 76 to 99</figref> show further embodiments of unit cells <b>1</b> for thermal inkjet printheads, each embodiment having its own particular functional advantages. These advantages will be discussed in detail below, with reference to each individual embodiment. However, the basic construction of each embodiment is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 77</figref>, <b>79</b>, <b>81</b> and <b>84</b>. The manufacturing process is substantially the same as that described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 35</figref> and for consistency, the same reference numerals are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 76 to 99</figref> to indicate corresponding components. In the interests of brevity, the fabrication stages have been shown for the unit cell of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83</figref> only (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 85 to 101</figref>). It will be appreciated that the other unit cells will use the same fabrication stages with different masking. Again, the deposition of successive layers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 85 to 101</figref> need not be described in detail below given that the lithographic process largely corresponds to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 35</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0543">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 76 and 87</figref>, the unit cell <b>1</b> shown has the chamber <b>7</b>, ink supply passage <b>32</b> and the nozzle rim <b>4</b> positioned mid way along the length of the unit cell <b>1</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>, the drive circuitry is partially on one side of the chamber <b>7</b> with the remainder on the opposing side of the chamber. The drive circuitry <b>22</b> controls the operation of the heater <b>14</b> through vias in the integrated circuit metallisation layers of the interconnect <b>23</b>. The interconnect <b>23</b> has a raised metal layer on its top surface. Passivation layer <b>24</b> is formed in top of the interconnect <b>23</b> but leaves areas of the raised metal layer exposed. Electrodes <b>15</b> of the heater <b>14</b> contact the exposed metal areas to supply power to the element <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0544">Alternatively, the drive circuitry <b>22</b> for one unit cell is not on opposing sides of the heater element that it controls. All the drive circuitry <b>22</b> for the heater <b>14</b> of one unit cell is in a single, undivided area that is offset from the heater. That is, the drive circuitry <b>22</b> is partially overlaid by one of the electrodes <b>15</b> of the heater <b>14</b> that it is controlling, and partially overlaid by one or more of the heater electrodes <b>15</b> from adjacent unit cells. In this situation, the center of the drive circuitry <b>22</b> is less than 200 microns from the center of the associate nozzle aperture <b>5</b>. In most Memjet printheads of this type, the offset is less than 100 microns and in many cases less than 50 microns, preferably less than 30 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0545">Configuring the nozzle components so that there is significant overlap between the electrodes and the drive circuitry provides a compact design with high nozzle density (nozzles per unit area of the nozzle plate <b>2</b>). This also improves the efficiency of the printhead by shortening the length of the conductors from the circuitry to the electrodes. The shorter conductors have less resistance and therefore dissipate less energy.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0546">The high degree of overlap between the electrodes <b>15</b> and the drive circuitry <b>22</b> also allows more vias between the heater material and the CMOS metalization layers of the interconnect <b>23</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 84 and 85</figref>, the passivation layer <b>24</b> has an array of vias to establish an electrical connection with the heater <b>14</b>. More vias lowers the resistance between the heater electrodes <b>15</b> and the interconnect layer <b>23</b> which reduces power losses.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0547">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 76 and 79</figref>, the unit cell <b>1</b> is the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 76 and 77</figref> apart from the heater element <b>10</b>. The heater element <b>10</b> has a bubble nucleation section <b>158</b> with a smaller cross section than the remainder of the element. The bubble nucleation section <b>158</b> has a greater resistance and heats to a temperature above the boiling point of the ink before the remainder of the element <b>10</b>. The gas bubble nucleates at this region and subsequently grows to surround the rest of the element <b>10</b>. By controlling the bubble nucleation and growth, the trajectory of the ejected drop is more predictable.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0548">The heater element <b>10</b> is configured to accommodate thermal expansion in a specific manner. As heater elements expand, they will deform to relieve the strain. Elements such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 76 and 77</figref> will bow out of the plane of lamination because its thickness is the thinnest cross sectional dimension and therefore has the least bending resistance. Repeated bending of the element can lead to the formation of cracks, especially at sharp corners, which can ultimately lead to failure. The heater element <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 78 and 79</figref> is configured so that the thermal expansion is relieved by rotation of the bubble nucleation section <b>158</b>, and slightly splaying the sections leading to the electrodes <b>15</b>, in preference to bowing out of the plane of lamination. The geometry of the element is such that miniscule bending within the plane of lamination is sufficient to relieve the strain of thermal expansion, and such bending occurs in preference to bowing. This gives the heater element greater longevity and reliability by minimizing bend regions, which are prone to oxidation and cracking.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0549">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 80 and 81</figref>, the heater element <b>10</b> used in this unit cell <b>1</b> has a serpentine or &#x2018;double omega&#x2019; shape. This configuration keeps the gas bubble centered on the axis of the nozzle. A single omega is a simple geometric shape which is beneficial from a fabrication perspective. However the gap <b>159</b> between the ends of the heater element means that the heating of the ink in the chamber is slightly asymmetrical. As a result, the gas bubble is slightly skewed to the side opposite the gap <b>159</b>. This can in turn affect the trajectory of the ejected drop. The double omega shape provides the heater element with the gap <b>160</b> to compensate for the gap <b>159</b> so that the symmetry and position of the bubble within the chamber is better controlled and the ejected drop trajectory is more reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0550"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref> shows a heater element <b>10</b> with a single omega shape. As discussed above, the simplicity of this shape has significant advantages during lithographic fabrication. It can be a single current path, that is relatively wide and therefore less affected by any inherent inaccuracies in the deposition of the heater material. The inherent inaccuracies of the equipment used to deposit the heater material result in variations in the dimensions of the element. However, these tolerances are fixed values so the resulting variations in the dimensions of a relatively wide component are proportionally less than the variations for a thinner component. It will be appreciated that proportionally large changes of components dimensions will have a greater effect on their intended function. Therefore the performance characteristics of a relatively wide heater element are more reliable than a thinner one.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0551">The omega shape directs current flow around the axis of the nozzle aperture <b>5</b>. This gives good bubble alignment with the aperture for better ejection of drops while ensuring that the bubble collapse point is not on the heater element <b>10</b>. As discussed above, this avoids problems caused by cavitation.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0552">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 83 to 96</figref>, another embodiment of the unit cell <b>1</b> is shown together with several stages of the etching and deposition, fabrication process. In this embodiment, the heater element <b>10</b> is suspended from opposing sides of the chamber. This allows it to be symmetrical about two planes that intersect along the axis of the nozzle aperture <b>5</b>. This configuration provides a drop trajectory along the axis of the nozzle aperture <b>5</b> while avoiding the cavitation problems discussed above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 97 and 98</figref> show other variations of this type of heater element <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0553"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</figref> shows a unit cell <b>1</b> that has the nozzle aperture <b>5</b> and the heater element <b>10</b> offset from the centre of the nozzle chamber <b>7</b>. Consequently, the nozzle chamber <b>7</b> is larger than the previous embodiments. The heater <b>14</b> has two different electrodes <b>15</b> with the right hand electrode <b>15</b> extending well into the nozzle chamber <b>7</b> to support one side of the heater element <b>10</b>. This reduces the area of the vias contacting the electrodes which can increase the electrode resistance and therefore the power losses. However, laterally offsetting the heater element from the ink inlet <b>31</b> increases the fluidic drag retarding flow back through the inlet <b>31</b> and ink supply passage <b>32</b>. The fluidic drag through the nozzle aperture <b>5</b> comparatively much smaller so little energy is lost to a reverse flow of ink through the inlet when a gas bubble form on the element <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0554">The unit cell <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</figref> also has a relatively large chamber <b>7</b> which again reduces the surface area of the electrodes in contact with the vias leading to the interconnect layer <b>23</b>. However, the larger chamber <b>7</b> allows several heater elements <b>11</b> offset from the nozzle aperture <b>5</b>. The arrangement shown uses two heater elements <b>10</b>; one on either side of the chamber <b>7</b>. Other designs use three or more elements in the chamber. Gas bubbles nucleate from opposing sides of the nozzle aperture and converge to form a single bubble. The bubble formed is symmetrical about at least one plane extending along the nozzle axis. This enhances the control of the symmetry and position of the bubble within the chamber <b>7</b> and therefore the ejected drop trajectory is more reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0555">Although the invention is described above with reference to specific embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms. For example, although the above embodiments refer to the heater elements being electrically actuated, non-electrically actuated elements may also be used in embodiments, where appropriate.</p>
