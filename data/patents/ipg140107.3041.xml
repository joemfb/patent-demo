<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a foot control for a musical instrument, which can be operated by one foot to vary and or control various musical effects. In particular it relates to a movable foot control connected to the instrument, or to an electrical component in a sound system by a cable, and incorporating a roller control which can be rotated by one foot.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well known to provide a variety of musical instruments with special controls which can vary the musical effects of the instrument. For example the piano has foot pedals which can vary the effects produced by the strings. Harps also incorporate such a foot pedal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electric guitars are also provided with a foot control device which can vary the effects of the guitar. Usually such foot controls have been in the form of a pedal of some kind. On a piano for example the pedal or pedals are pivoted on a column extending down beneath the piano, in a fixed location. The player is usually located, preferably seated, where he/she can reach the pedals</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Foot controls for a guitar are not incorporated in the guitar itself. The control is a separate component. It is connected to the guitar by an electric cable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It can be positioned in a convenient location on the floor, close to the location of the player, who may be standing or seated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This allows for greater flexibility in arranging the various players of different instruments, and also takes up less floor space than conventional controls.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However such movable controls have usually been based on some kind of pedal. Either the pedal was similar in operation to a piano pedal, i.e. it was hinged to a base, or the pedal was a sort of tilting see-saw device, with the foot resting on the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other cases the control was some kind of button which could simply be depressed or released.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">These controls operated some form of electrical circuit. The range of movement of such a device was restricted by the range of swinging of the pedal about its tilt axis. As a result the of range of movement was limited.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This in turn resulted in the device providing a somewhat insensitive degree of control over the musical effect.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Clearly it is desirable to provide such a control in which the range of physical movement available for the control is greater than in such previous controls. This will enable the player to achieve a finer degree of control of variation.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another disadvantage of known controls was that they were relatively bulky and heavy. Players of an instrument such as a guitar will want to move from one venue to another as freely as possible. Given that the instrument itself must be of a certain size, it is desirable that the auxiliary devices shall be as small and compact as possible, so as to render them easily portable when moved from place to place.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is also desirable that, when in use such a control shall occupy a minimum floor area, or &#x201c;footprint&#x201d;, or space on the control; board of the player, to avoid interfering with other players, and their equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">With a view to answering the foregoing conflicting requirements, the invention provides a foot control for control of musical effects from a musical instrument, the instrument having an electrical signal output operable to send signals to a speaker system, said control comprising a base adapted to be placed on the floor, the base defining at least one side wall, a notch in the side wall, a roller rotatably mounted in the base and extending outwardly from the notch, and having a roller surface portion exposed away from the base for contact by a foot, and circuitry within the base connectable with the instrument and operable in response to rotation of the roller, to vary signals from said instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably the control will be of such design that it can withstand at least some of the body weight of the player.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Usefully the control will have a roller which is mounted on a horizontal roller axis, on an axle carried by the base.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Usefully the control will have housing or base of generally rectangular box like shape, defined by four side walls and a top wall, and the notch being formed in one side wall and in the top wall so that a curved side surface portion of the roller is exposed and extended outwardly from the base, for contact by the foot.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Usefully the control will have circuitry mounted within the box like housing shape, and a connecting cables as needed extending from the base for connection to the instrument, and to the speaker or other electrical equipment. Plug in jacks of conventional size as used in such equipment enables the device to be moved from one instrument, or from one component, to another, as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Usefully the control will have at least one electrical component, typically a potentiometer, forming part of the circuitry, which is rotatable, and a gear or gears connecting the roller with the rotatable electrical component. This component, for example a potentiometer, may have a range or arc of movement of as much as 300 or more degs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Usefully the control will have a drive gear on the roller axle, and a driven gear on the rotatable component, and at least one intermediate gear between the drive gear and the driven gear, the ratios of the gears being selected to provide a desired range of rotation of the rotatable electrical component.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Usefully the control may have a resilient member connected to the electrical rotatable component, which is biased to provide a predetermined rotational position.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some cases is may be desirable to provide a non-horizontal rotational mounting for the roller, such as a vertical shaft, with the roller mounted on an end of the shaft extending above the base, or with a portion of the roller extending outwardly from the base to one side, for foot contact.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this case the foot could rest on the flat side of the roller, and be operated by twisting the foot, rather than rolling the foot on the cylindrical surface of the roller.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with more particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and specific objects attained by its use, reference should be made to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated and described preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF A SPECIFIC EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> it will be seen that the invention is illustrated here, in general, as being used in conjunction with an electric guitar. Such instruments are well know, and the details are not part of the invention. However in such an instrument, and in others in which electrical sound signals are produced it is customary to provide a foot control by which the effects of such signals can be varied. Electrical instruments other than electric guitars may also use a foot control for varying sound effects.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the instrument, in this case a electric guitar, is shown as (<b>10</b>). It is connected to the foot control (<b>12</b>) by an electrical connection cables (<b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The instrument is also connected to a speaker (<b>16</b>). There may be other electrical components such as an amplifier (not shown), connected as well, in known manner. The player will often be playing with a group. The space for the group may be restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The foot controls available in the past have been large and cumbersome. They occupied significant space. They were also added weight. The range of control of such controls was limited.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The foot control illustrating the invention, in this case, comprised a housing (<b>20</b>) of generally rectangular shape. Within the housing there are electronic components indicated generally as (<b>22</b>) on a base plate (<b>23</b>). These components will be designed and specified to permit a range of variations in the musical effect of the instrument, or in some cases to control the parameters of other controls.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Such components may vary from one instrument to another. They may also vary, depending on the type of effect to be controlled. Thus the control may be simply the comparative sounds, such as volume, or tone, or they could be treble/bass sounds, or there may be any combination of effects, or other effect.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Such circuits and components are know per se, and require no special description. The variation in such control is produced by the control shaft (<b>24</b>) extending from the components (<b>22</b>). Rotation of the shaft will change the control effect.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the present invention such rotation is procured by the roller (<b>26</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Roller (<b>26</b>), in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> is mounted on a horizontal axle shaft (<b>28</b>) rotatably mounted between upright walls (<b>25</b>) which are secured to plate (<b>23</b>) in the housing (<b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Housing (<b>20</b>) is formed with an opening or recess, or notch (<b>30</b>), and the roller (<b>26</b>) is located within such opening. The axle (<b>28</b>) is positioned such that a portion at least of the roller (<b>26</b>) projects outwardly from housing (<b>20</b>). The radius of the roller is larger than the space between the roller axle and the edges of the housing. In this way the roller surface will project above and away from the housing, and is thus exposed for easy contact by the foot. Preferably the roller (<b>26</b>) will project both above and to one side of the housing (<b>20</b>). The axle will be strong enough to permit the player to rest his foot on the roller, during play.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To prevent accidental over rotation stop (<b>32</b>) may be provided to provide a limit to the arc of rotation of the roller.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It this way the roller (<b>26</b>) is readily accessible to the sole of a shoe, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. By resting the shoe on the roller (<b>26</b>) and moving the shoe forward or back, the roller (<b>26</b>) can be rotated in either direction.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Floor friction elements (<b>34</b>) are provided on the underside of plate (<b>23</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">These may be of rubber, or for example, of Velcro (trade Mark) material, or any other suitable friction material.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Within housing (<b>20</b>) there is a gear train comprising a first drive</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">gear (<b>36</b>) and a second driven gear (<b>38</b>). This is merely by way of example and illustration. The gear train could be only two gears, or could include three or more gears, depending on the choice of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The function of the gear train is to transmit rotation of the roller (<b>26</b>) to the electronic component shaft (<b>24</b>), which in this case is a potentiometer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In doing so the gear train will preferably, although not essentially, provide for a greater arc of rotation of the component shaft (<b>24</b>), than would be possible by a simple direct connection between the roller shaft (<b>28</b>) and the component shaft (<b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this way the arc of operation of the roller itself, which may typically be limited, in order to permit operation by the foot, to between 90 and 180 degs, for example, will achieve a varying range of rotation of the component shaft (<b>24</b>), up to 300 or more degs if desired, and thus provide for a more precise degree of variation and a greater range of variation of the musical effect.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A further embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In some cases the musician may find that it is more convenient to use the control with the roller in a vertical orientation. In this cases he would simply place his foot on the end on the roller, and twist his foot from side to side.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">This will produce a rotation of the roller shaft, and thus a variation of the musical effect. In this embodiment the housing (<b>40</b>) has a recess (<b>42</b>), as before, but the recess is open as at (<b>44</b>) on one side (or end) of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The housing would preferably have floor friction elements (<b>40</b>) on both its underside and on one end, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The roller (<b>46</b>) is mounted in the notch (<b>44</b>) and extends outwardly from the housing both on its upper and side surfaces, and at one end surface. It may have a frictional surface material, to facilitate control by the sole of a shoe without slipping.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A button (<b>48</b>) may be provided on the exposed end surface of the roller, for convenient operation of the roller, in its upright mode.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">This same function could also be achieved in the alternate embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this case the housing (<b>50</b>) has a somewhat different profile, being lower, and the roller (<b>52</b>) is mounted on a vertical shaft (not shown). The upper flat side surface (<b>54</b>) of the roller has a friction surface, for contact by the shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Friction strips (<b>56</b>) on the underside will hold the housing steady when used. In fact they may grip on a typical mounting panel or board, (not shown) such as is well known and used by various players. A stop (<b>58</b>) limits the arc of travel of the roller.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The effect variable controlled by the controller, may be varied by, for example, the knob (<b>60</b>). An on/off switch (<b>62</b>) may be provided, where it will be of assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The foregoing is a description of a preferred embodiment of the invention which is given here by way of example only. The invention is not to be taken as limited to any of the specific features as described, but comprehends all such variations thereof as come within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
