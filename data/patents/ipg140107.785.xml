<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Rotary cutting tools, such as helical end mills and face mills, are well known in the industry. Conventional helical end mills include those shown on pages 182-216 in Kennametal's Milling Catalog No. 5040, copyright 1995.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One form of helical mill that has been in use for years is a helical mill where the cutting edge of each insert is axially spaced apart from the cutting edge of the next adjacent insert and where the inserts in each helix are staggered such that two or more rows are necessary to produce one complete or &#x201c;all effective&#x201d; cutting edge. Such a design is shown by the Kennametal 0 degree Lead-Helical End Mills, as shown on page 188 of the above referenced Milling Catalog. One of the disadvantages of such design is that the lead insert in at least one helix must either be of a different length or offset inward and thus incapable of face milling. This is a result of the need to stagger the inserts in each helix. Consequently, all of the inserts are generally not the same and thus not interchangeable, thus requiring the manufacture and inventory of multiple inserts.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a conventional helical end mill <b>100</b> includes a tool body <b>102</b> and a shank <b>104</b>. The shank <b>104</b> is configured so as to be capable of insertion and securing within a spindle of a milling or other cutting machine (not shown) as is well known in the art. The tool body <b>102</b> is a substantially cylindrical body and has a central, longitudinal axis <b>103</b>. The tool body <b>102</b> extends axially from the shank <b>104</b> to an end face <b>106</b> thereby defining an exterior surface <b>108</b> therebetween. The exterior surface <b>108</b> of the tool body <b>102</b> preferably includes a plurality of helical grooves or flutes <b>110</b>. It will be appreciated that most any number of helical grooves may be formed in the tool body <b>102</b>. Each groove <b>110</b> is preferably cut into the exterior surface <b>108</b> in a helical or spiral manner that extends from the end face <b>106</b> to substantially the shank <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An insert (not shown) is affixed to each pocket <b>116</b> in each groove <b>110</b> using a screw (not shown) with a tapered head insertable through a correspondingly tapered hole (not shown) in each insert and then threaded into a threaded hole <b>118</b> in the respective pocket <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each pocket <b>116</b> has a bottom support surface <b>120</b> that may be at an angle with respect to the axis <b>103</b>. The pocket <b>116</b> also includes an axial support surface <b>122</b> and an radial support surface <b>124</b> that constitute an axial and radial abutment surfaces, respectively, for the side walls of the insert when mounted in the pocket <b>116</b>. A corner relief <b>126</b> is provided between the bottom support surface <b>120</b> and the axial support surface <b>122</b>. The radial support surface <b>124</b> in the vicinity of each pocket <b>116</b> may include one or more circular coolant passages <b>128</b> for providing coolant to the cutting insert and associated workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Usually when a helical end mill is in operation, the machining force is exerted against one or more edges of the cutter. The resulting bending moment is resisted by the tool holder which rigidly grips the cutter shank. Ignoring the fact that the direction of the moment changes continually as the cutter revolves, the cutter can be considered to be stressed as a cantilever.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, simulations have shown that a maximum tensile stress of the pocket <b>116</b> during machining operations of approximately 736 MPa (106.76 kpsi) is located at a point <b>130</b> proximate the coolant passage <b>128</b>, resulting in a safety factor for fatigue at 10E6 cycles of about 0.750.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While the matter of stress discussed above is related to avoiding fatigue that would result in tool breakage, no less important is the requirement to minimize tool deflection, in order to improve accuracy and surface finish and to reduce vibration and noise. The bending moment, along with the rotation of the cutter, produces a fully reversed stress condition (alternating tensile and compressive stresses), which is the most devastating condition for fatigue.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved cutting tool that can overcome the limitations of the known cutting tool, and reduce or eliminate the overall stress of the cutting tool.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention has solved the problem of high stress associated with conventional cutting tools by providing a pocket feature located proximate the area of high stress on the radial support surface that greatly reduces the tensile stress, thereby improving tool safety and lifetime of the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, a cutting tool comprises a tool body including a plurality of pockets for receiving cutting inserts, each pocket comprising a bottom support surface, an axial support surface, a radial support surface and a corner relief between the bottom support surface and the radial support surface; a coolant passage proximate at least one of the plurality of pockets; and a non-circular recess surrounding the coolant passage, wherein the non-circular recess reduces a tensile stress in cutting tool during a machining operation.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, a cutting tool comprises a tool body including a plurality of pockets for receiving cutting inserts, each pocket comprising a bottom support surface, an axial support surface, a radial support surface and a corner relief between the bottom support surface and the radial support surface; a non-circular recess proximate at least one of the plurality of pockets; and a coolant passage disposed within the non-circular recess, wherein the non-circular recess reduces a tensile stress in cutting tool during a machining operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to the drawings wherein like reference characters designate like elements there is shown a helical cutting tool <b>10</b>, such as an end mill, face mill, and the like, according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the helical end mill <b>10</b> includes a tool body <b>12</b> and a shank <b>14</b>. The shank <b>14</b> is configured so as to be capable of insertion and securing within a spindle of a milling or other cutting machine (not shown) as is well known in the art. The tool body <b>12</b> is a substantially cylindrical body and has a central, longitudinal rotational axis <b>13</b>. The tool body <b>12</b> extends axially from the shank <b>14</b> to an end face <b>16</b> thereby defining an exterior surface <b>18</b> therebetween. The exterior surface <b>18</b> of the tool body <b>12</b> preferably includes a plurality of helical grooves or flutes <b>20</b>. It will be appreciated that most any number of helical grooves may be formed in the tool body <b>12</b>. Each groove <b>20</b> is preferably cut into the exterior surface <b>18</b> in a helical or spiral manner that extends from the end face <b>16</b> to substantially the shank <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As known in the art, an insert (not shown) is affixed to each pocket <b>26</b> in each groove <b>20</b> using a screw (not shown) with a tapered head insertable through a correspondingly tapered hole (not shown) in each insert and then threaded into a threaded hole <b>28</b> in the respective pocket <b>26</b>. It is within the scope of the invention that any known insert securing method and device may be used including all those well recognized in the art without altering the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The inserts may generally be of any known construction, size, shape, or configuration so long as the inserts securely and properly fit the pocket <b>34</b> in the intended manner. Examples of such inserts include those inserts described on pages 7-132 in the above referenced Kennametal Milling catalog. Specific examples include the ADKT or LFEW style inserts described therein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each pocket <b>26</b> has a bottom support surface <b>30</b> that may be at an angle with respect to the axis <b>13</b>. The pocket <b>26</b> also includes an axial support surface <b>32</b> and a radial support surface <b>34</b> that constitute axial and radial abutment surfaces for the side walls of the insert when mounted in the pocket <b>26</b>, respectively. A corner relief <b>36</b> is provided between the bottom support surface <b>30</b> and the axial support surface <b>32</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the corner relief <b>36</b> has a radius of approximately 0.047 inches (approximately 1.19 mm). However, the radius of the corner relief <b>36</b> depends on the design of the cutting insert, and other factors. The cutting tool <b>10</b> includes one or more circular coolant passages <b>38</b> in the vicinity of each pocket <b>26</b> for providing coolant to the cutting insert and associated workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Up to this point, the helical end mill <b>10</b> of the invention is similar to the conventional helical end mill <b>100</b>. One aspect of the invention is that the helical end mill <b>10</b> includes a stress-reducing feature, shown generally at <b>40</b>, for reducing tensile stress in the helical end mill <b>10</b> during machining operations. Specifically, the stress-reducing feature is in the form of a non-circular recess <b>40</b> that surrounds the coolant passage <b>38</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In other words, the coolant passage <b>38</b> is disposed within the non-circular recess <b>40</b> of the invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the center of the non-circular recess <b>40</b> is substantially aligned with the center of the coolant passage <b>38</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the center of the stress-reducing feature <b>40</b> does not have to be aligned with the center of the coolant passage <b>38</b>, but can be off-center with respect the coolant passage <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The non-circular recess <b>40</b> can be oblong, oval or elliptical shaped having a maximum width <b>42</b> that is approximately twice the depth <b>44</b>. In other words, the recess <b>40</b> has a width/depth ratio of about 2:1. In general, it has been found that increasing the depth of the recess <b>40</b> lowers the tensile stress on the edge of the coolant passage <b>38</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited by the relative dimension of the recess, and that the invention can be practiced with any desirable width/depth ratio that provides the desired reduction in the overall stress of the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the illustrated embodiment, the major axis of the non-circular recess <b>40</b> is substantially aligned with the rotational axis <b>13</b> of the tool <b>10</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the major axis of the non-circular recess <b>40</b> can be oriented at any desirable angle with respect to the rotational axis <b>13</b> that will provide the desirable reduction in the overall stress of the tool <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the stress-reducing feature <b>40</b> is substantially oblong shaped. Simulations have shown unexpected results that a maximum tensile stress of the pocket <b>26</b> during machining operations of approximately 388 MPa (53.1 kpsi) is located at a point <b>46</b> proximate the coolant passage <b>42</b>, as compared to the maximum tensile stress of approximately 736 MPa (106.76 kpsi), which is a reduction of about 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the tensile stress has been more widely dispersed in the direction of the radial support surface <b>34</b>, and also is no longer located proximate the coolant passage <b>38</b>. As a result of the non-circular recess <b>40</b> of the invention, the maximum tensile stress of the pocket is greatly reduced, resulting in a much larger safety factor for the cutting tool <b>10</b>, as compared to the conventional cutting tool <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the stress-reducing feature <b>40</b> is substantially elliptical shaped. Simulations have shown unexpected results that a maximum tensile stress of the pocket <b>26</b> during machining operations of approximately 366 MPa (53.1 kpsi) is located at a point <b>46</b> proximate the coolant passage <b>42</b>, as compared to the maximum tensile stress of approximately 736 MPa (106.76 kpsi), which is a reduction of about 50%. As a result, a safety factor at 10E6 cycles of about 1.471 for fatigue is achieved in the pocket design of the invention, as compared to a safety factor of about 0.75 for fatigue in the conventional pocket design, which is almost a factor of two.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the tensile stress has been more widely dispersed in the direction of the radial support surface <b>34</b>, and also is no longer located proximate the coolant passage <b>38</b>. As a result of the non-circular recess <b>40</b> of the invention, the maximum tensile stress of the pocket is greatly reduced, resulting in a much larger safety factor for the cutting tool <b>10</b>, as compared to the conventional cutting tool <b>100</b>.</p>
