<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Integrated circuits may be formed on semiconductor wafers that are formed from materials such as silicon. The semiconductor wafers are processed to form various electronic devices thereon. At some point during the processing, the wafers may be diced into semiconductor chips (a chip is also known as a die), and attached to a substrate using a variety of known methods.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Operation of the integrated circuit generates heat in the device. As the internal circuitry operates at increased clock frequencies and/or higher power levels, the amount of heat generated may rise to levels that are unacceptable unless some of the heat can be removed from the device. Heat is conducted to a surface of the die, and should be conducted or convected away to maintain the temperature of the integrated circuit below a predetermined level for purposes of maintaining functional integrity of the integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One way to conduct heat from an integrated circuit die is through the use of a heat spreader, which may in certain configurations include a plate-shaped body thermally coupled to the die through a thermal interface material. Materials such as metals (for example, copper) may be used to form heat spreaders. Materials such as, for example, solders, may be used as thermal interface materials to couple the heat spreader to the die and transmit heat from the die to the heat spreader. The heat spreading performances of these devices are limited by the relatively poor thermal conductivity of the thermal interface materials and the solid plate of copper.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Certain embodiments relate to electronic assemblies including a heat spreading device on a die and include devices and methods related thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of an electronic assembly including a plurality of nanotube structures such as carbon nanotube (CNT) structures <b>14</b> formed on a body such as, for example, a semiconductor die <b>12</b>. Nanotube structures are small filaments that typically have a diameter on the order of about 10 nm and a length of up to hundreds of &#x3bc;m. While carbon nanotube structures are described in connection with certain figures, nanotube structures formed from other materials may also be used in various embodiments. A working fluid <b>18</b> is positioned on the die <b>12</b> between the carbon nanotube structures <b>14</b>. An endcap <b>16</b> is positioned over the carbon nanotube structures and the working fluid <b>18</b> and may be coupled to the die through sidewalls <b>20</b>. It should be appreciated that where terms such as over, above below, top, bottom, and the like are used herein, such terms are used in reference to the views illustrated in the Figures and not in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a gap or open region <b>22</b> remains between the endcap <b>16</b> and the tops of the carbon nanotube structures <b>14</b>. The sidewalls <b>20</b> of the endcap <b>16</b> are coupled to the die <b>12</b> for form a tight fit that ensures that the interior portions of the assembly housing the carbon nanotube structures <b>14</b> and the working fluid <b>18</b> are sealed off and closed to the external atmosphere. The resultant structure forms a vapor chamber in which a cooling cycle may take place during operation of the die <b>12</b>. When a portion of the die <b>12</b> reaches a sufficient temperature, at least a portion of the working fluid <b>18</b> positioned on the die <b>12</b> and between the carbon nanotube structures <b>14</b> will vaporize. At least some of the vapor will condense on the interior surface <b>24</b> of the endcap <b>16</b> and accumulate thereon, until one or more drops that are large enough will drip off of the interior surface <b>24</b> and/or contact one or more of the carbon nanotube structures <b>14</b> and be delivered back towards the die <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The working fluid <b>14</b> may be selected from a variety of materials, including, but not limited to, water, ethanol, perfluorocarbons, and hydrofluoroethers (HFE's). An example of a suitable perfluorocarbon fluid is FC-72, which is perfluorohexane (C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>14</sub>). Perfluorocarbons are available as Fluorinert&#x2122; Electronic Liquids from 3M&#x2122; Corporation. Hydrofluorethers are available as Novec&#x2122; Engineered Fluids from 3M&#x2122; Corporation. In certain embodiments, it may be advantageous for the working fluid to wet the carbon nanotube structures <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a portion of an embodiment of an electronic assembly similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, including several additional layers that may be included in the assembly. Between the semiconductor die <b>12</b> and the carbon nanotube structures <b>14</b>, an insulating layer <b>26</b> such as an oxide layer (for example, silicon oxide, aluminum oxide), and a catalyst layer <b>28</b> for forming the carbon nanotube structures <b>14</b>, may be formed. The catalyst layer <b>28</b> is formed from a material (for example, a metal including nickel, cobalt and/or iron) that assists in the formation of the carbon nanotube structures <b>14</b>. The catalyst layer <b>28</b> may be deposited in patterned manner on the insulating layer if desired, in order to control the position of the carbon nanotube structures that will be subsequently formed. The carbon nanotube structures <b>14</b> may be formed using any suitable method, for example, a CVD method in which the insulating layer <b>26</b> and the catalyst layer are formed on the die and the substrate is heated to an elevated temperature (for example, 700&#xb0; C.). A gas, which may including a combination of a process gas (for example, ammonia, nitrogen, and/or hydrogen) and a carbon-containing gas (for example, ethylene, acetylene, and/or methane), is then introduced and carbon nanotube structures are grown at the catalyst sites. In certain embodiments, it may be advantageous for the carbon nanotube structures to be substantially vertically oriented with respect to the surface they are grown on.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">After forming the array of the carbon nanotube structures <b>14</b>, the array may be filled with a suitable quantity of the working fluid <b>18</b> under vacuum and the system sealed with the endcap <b>16</b> coupled to the die <b>12</b>, to form the vapor chamber. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the connection of a sidewall <b>20</b> of the endcap <b>16</b> to the die <b>12</b>. A sealant material <b>30</b>, such as, for example, an polymer epoxy, may be formed on the insulating layer <b>26</b> on the die <b>12</b>. The sealant material <b>30</b> ensures that the endcap <b>16</b> has a tight fit to maintain a closed system. The working fluid <b>18</b> may be inserted into the system and system sealed using any suitable technique. For example, after coupling the endcap <b>16</b> to the die <b>12</b>, a vacuum is applied to remove any gases in the closed vapor chamber through opening <b>51</b> having a pipe therein in the sidewall <b>20</b> of the endcap <b>16</b>. Then the working fluid <b>18</b> is inserted through the opening <b>51</b>, and then the opening <b>51</b> is crimped shut, using a method similar to those used for conventional heat pipes and vapor chambers. In another example of a connection and filling process, the working fluid <b>18</b> may be positioned within the endcap <b>16</b> and then the endcap <b>16</b> is coupled to the die <b>12</b>.</p>

The vapor travels into the space <b>22</b> above the carbon nanotube structures <b>14</b> and condenses on the cooler interior surface <b>24</b> of the endcap <b>16</b> as one or more drops <b>32</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(C)-3(D)</figref> illustrate the drops <b>32</b> growing larger and coalescing, as more of the working fluid <b>18</b> is vaporized by the heat from the die <b>12</b>.</p>

The cycle may be repeated continuously to transmit heat away from the die <b>12</b> and to the endcap <b>16</b>. Other types of cooling devices such as a plate shaped heat spreader or a heat sink with fins, may be positioned on the endcap <b>16</b> if desired.</p>
