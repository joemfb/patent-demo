<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A disc cartridge includes a case body for receiving disc-shaped recording media in an axial direction of a central shaft so that first and second shells respectively having a base surface portion parallel to a recording surface of the disc-shaped recording media are coupled separated by axial engagement/disengagement; and a lock lever supported perpendicular to the axial direction in the case body and locking the shells coupled. The shells are separated to form a disc insertion/extraction hole for the insert or discharge of the disc-shaped recording media into/from the case body. A support shaft serving as a pivoting point of the lock lever is installed to the case body. The lock lever includes a supported portion supported by the support shaft, a lock portion protruding from the supported portion and locking the shells, and a balance portion protruding from the supported portion approximately opposite to protrusion of the lock portion.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a technical field of a disc cartridge. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a technical field which prevents a lock from being released when an impact is applied thereto, by installing a balance unit protruding approximately in a direction substantially opposite to a lock unit to a lock lever which locks a first shell and a second shell into a coupled state.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A plurality of disc-shaped recording media may be received in a disc cartridge in parallel to an axial direction of a central shaft. The disc cartridge is, for example, used for a disc reproduction device for reproducing music, such that a desired disc-shaped recording medium is taken out by an extraction mechanism and music data recorded on the disc-shaped recording medium is reproduced (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication 63-29392).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, as the storage capacity of disc-shaped recording media has been greatly increasing recently, the necessity for a disc cartridge in which a plurality of disc-shaped recording media with large storage capacities may be received in parallel to the axial direction of the center shaft and which is used in a data center is also increasing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above disc cartridge is a type in which an outer circumference of each disc-shaped recording medium is inserted into a pair of support grooves and is received. Since this type of disc cartridge does not demand a disc tray which supports the disc-shaped recording medium, the receiving space may be devised so as to be smaller, and also the amount of preserved data may be devised so as to be greater by increasing the number of received media.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, in regards to the disc cartridge, commercialization of a type in which the case body includes first and second shells capable of being separated, in which disc-shaped recording media may be received in or extracted from the case body when the first and second shells are separated, and which has a lock lever for locking the first and second shells in a coupled state has been considered.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in regards to the disc cartridge in which the case body may be separated, when a great impact is applied to the case body, for example when the disc cartridge is dropped by mistake, the lock lever may move due to the impact so that the lock in the coupled state may be released.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If the lock is released unintentionally as described above, a problem in the data preservation may be caused due to the damage to the received disc-shaped recording medium or the ejection of the disc-shaped recording medium from the case body.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is desirable to provide the disc cartridge capable of preventing a lock from being released when an impact is applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A disc cartridge according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes a case body capable of receiving a plurality of disc-shaped recording media in parallel to an axial direction of a central shaft thereof so that a first shell having a base surface portion parallel to a recording surface of the disc-shaped recording media and a second shell having a base surface portion parallel to the recording surface of the disc-shaped recording media are coupled to or separated from each other by engagement or disengagement in the axial direction; and a lock lever pivotally supported on a surface perpendicular to the axial direction in the case body and locking the first shell and the second shell in a coupled state, wherein the first shell and the second shell are separated to form a disc insertion/extraction hole through which the disc-shaped recording media are inserted into or discharged from the case body, wherein a support shaft serving as a pivoting point of the lock lever is installed to the case body, and wherein the lock lever includes a supported portion supported by the support shaft, a lock portion protruding from the supported portion and locking the first shell and the second shell, and a balance portion protruding from the supported portion in a direction approximately opposite to the direction in which the lock portion protrudes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, in regards to the disc cartridge, the center of the lock lever may be set to be present in the supported portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the disc cartridge, it is desirable that a regulating surface for regulating the location of the disc-shaped recording media received in the case body be formed at the balance portion of the lock lever.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Since the regulating surface regulating the location of the disc-shaped recording media is formed at the balance portion of the lock lever, the location of the disc-shaped recording media is regulated by the balance portion optimizing the location of the center of the lock lever.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In regards to the disc cartridge, it is desirable that the regulating surface of the lock lever have an arc surface shape along the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Since the regulating surface of the lock lever has an arc surface shape along the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media, the regulating surface may be located closer to the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the disc cartridge, it is desirable that a center pin inserted into a center hole of the received disc-shaped recording media and regulating the location of the disc-shaped recording media be installed to the case body.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Since the center pin regulating the location of the disc-shaped recording media is installed to the case body, when the first shell and the second shell are coupled, the location of the disc-shaped recording media is regulated at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the disc cartridge, it is desirable that an opening/closing panel for opening or closing the disc insertion/extraction hole be installed to the first shell, the difference between the diameter of the center pin and the diameter of the center hole of the disc-shaped recording media be set to A, the difference between the diameter of a circle extending from the arc of the regulating surface of the lock lever and the diameter of the disc-shaped recording media be set to B, the difference between the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media and the inner surface of the opening/closing panel when the disc-shaped recording media is pressed to the center pin in a direction of being inserted from the disc insertion/extraction hole be set to C, and C&#x3e;A&#x3e;B.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Since the opening/closing panel opening or closing the disc insertion/extraction hole is installed to the first shell and C&#x3e;A&#x3e;B, when the location of the disc-shaped recording media is misaligned, the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media does not contact the inner surface of the opening/closing panel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the disc cartridge, it is desirable that a location regulating protrusion protruding from the supported portion in a direction orthogonal to the axial direction of the support shaft and having a front end surface located opposite to the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media received in the case body be installed to the lock lever, and that in the state in which the first shell and the second shell are locked by the lock lever, the location regulating protrusion be located at the disc insertion/extraction hole rather than a line connecting the axial center of the support shaft and the center of the disc-shaped recording media.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Since the location regulating protrusion is located at the disc insertion/extraction hole rather than the line connecting the axial center of the support shaft and the center of the disc-shaped recording media, when an impact is applied to the case body and the disc-shaped recording media contact the location regulating protrusion, a pivoting force in a direction of locking the first shell and the second shell is applied to the lock lever.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the disc cartridge, it is desirable that the front end surface of the location regulating protrusion have a curved shape convex at the front end side.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Since the front end surface of the location regulating protrusion has a curved shape convex at the front end side, the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media contacts the curved surface.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the disc cartridge, it is desirable that the balance portion be installed as the location regulating protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Since the balance portion is installed as the location regulating protrusion, the balance portion and the location regulating protrusion are integrated into a portion with the same function.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the disc cartridge, it is desirable that the lock lever be pivotally supported by any one of the first shell and the second shell, a lock protrusion be installed to the lock portion, a lock concave portion into which the lock protrusion of the lock lever is inserted in the coupled state be formed at the other one of the first shell and the second shell, a fitting concave portion opened in the axial direction of the support shaft be formed at any one of the lock protrusion and the lock concave portion, and a fitting protrusion protruding in the axial direction of the support shaft and capable of being fitted to the fitting concave portion when a force in a separating direction is applied to at least one of the first shell and the second shell locked in the coupled state be installed to the other end of the lock protrusion and the lock concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Since fitting protrusion capable of being fitted to the fitting concave portion when a force is applied to at least one of the first shell and the second shell in a separating direction is installed, the pivotal movement of the lock protrusion of the lock lever in a direction to be extracted from the first lock concave portion is regulated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The disc cartridge according to the embodiment of the present disclosure includes a case body capable of receiving a plurality of disc-shaped recording media in parallel to an axial direction of a central shaft thereof so that a first shell having a base surface portion parallel to a recording surface of the disc-shaped recording media and a second shell having a base surface portion parallel to the recording surface of the disc-shaped recording media are coupled to or separated from each other by engagement or disengagement in the axial direction; and a lock lever pivotally supported on a surface perpendicular to the axial direction in the case body and locking the first shell and the second shell in a coupled state, wherein the first shell and the second shell are separated to form a disc insertion/extraction hole through which the disc-shaped recording media are inserted into or discharged from the case body, wherein a support shaft serving as a pivoting point of the lock lever is installed to the case body, and wherein the lock lever includes a supported portion supported by the support shaft, a lock portion protruding from the supported portion and locking the first shell and the second shell, and a balance portion protruding from the supported portion in a direction approximately opposite to the direction in which the lock portion protrudes.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Therefore, since the center of the lock lever is closer to the center of the supported portion, when a great impact is applied to the case body, the lock lever is not easily pivoted by the impact, and the lock in the coupled state is not easily released such that the data recorded in the disc-shaped recording medium may be preserved in a good state.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In regards to the disc cartridge according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, a regulating surface for regulating the location of the disc-shaped recording media received in the case body is formed at the balance portion of the lock lever.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Therefore, the location deviation of the disc-shaped recording media may be prevented, and the number of components may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In regards to the disc cartridge according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the regulating surface of the lock lever has an arc surface shape along the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Therefore, the positioning accuracy of the disc-shaped recording media may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the disc cartridge according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, a center pin inserted into a center hole of the received disc-shaped recording media and regulating the location of the disc-shaped recording media is installed to the case body.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Therefore, when the first shell and the second shell are coupled, the location of the disc-shaped recording media is regulated at the same time, and the location of the disc-shaped recording media may be simply and reliably regulated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the disc cartridge according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, an opening/closing panel for opening or closing the disc insertion/extraction hole is installed to the first shell, the difference between the diameter of the center pin and the diameter of the center hole of the disc-shaped recording media is set to A, the difference between the diameter of a circle extending from the arc of the regulating surface of the lock lever and the diameter of the disc-shaped recording media is set to B, the difference between the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media and the inner surface of the opening/closing panel when the disc-shaped recording media is pressed to the center pin in a direction of being inserted from the disc insertion/extraction hole is set to C, and C&#x3e;A&#x3e;B.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Therefore, when the first shell is moved with respect to the second shell and the first shell and the second shell are separated, the opening/closing panel does not contact the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media, and it is possible to prevent the disc-shaped recording media from being damaged or broken.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the disc cartridge according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, a location regulating protrusion protruding from the supported portion in a direction orthogonal to the axial direction of the support shaft and having a front end surface located opposite to the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media received in the case body is installed to the lock lever, and, in the state in which the first shell and the second shell are locked by the lock lever, the location regulating protrusion is located at the disc insertion/extraction hole rather than a line connecting the axial center of the support shaft and the center of the disc-shaped recording media.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Therefore, when a great impact is applied to the case body, the locked state of the case body by the lock lever is not released, and the stable support of the disc-shaped recording media to the case body may be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the disc cartridge according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the front end surface of the location regulating protrusion has a curved shape convex at the front end side.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Therefore, when the front end surface of the location regulating protrusion contacts the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media, it is possible to prevent the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media from being scratched or broken.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the disc cartridge according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the balance portion is installed as the location regulating protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Therefore, it is possible to simplify the structure of the lock lever and integrate functions of the lock lever.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the disc cartridge according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the lock lever is pivotally supported by any one of the first shell and the second shell, a lock protrusion is installed to the lock portion, a lock concave portion into which the lock protrusion of the lock lever is inserted in the coupled state is formed at the other one of the first shell and the second shell, a fitting concave portion opened in the axial direction of the support shaft is formed at any one of the lock protrusion and the lock concave portion, and a fitting protrusion protruding in the axial direction of the support shaft and capable of being fitted to the fitting concave portion when a force in a separating direction is applied to at least one of the first shell and the second shell locked in the coupled state is installed to the other end of the lock protrusion and the lock concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Therefore, the pivoting movement of the lock protrusion of the lock lever in a direction to be extracted from the lock concave portion is regulated, and it is possible to prevent the lock between the first shell and the second shell from being unnecessarily released by an impact.</p>

<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The lock levers <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>A include supported portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b>, lock portions <b>23</b> and <b>23</b>, lock releasing portions <b>24</b> and <b>24</b>, and location regulating protrusions <b>75</b> and <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The location regulating protrusion <b>75</b> protrudes in a direction orthogonal to the axial direction of the support shaft <b>13</b>, namely in a horizontal direction, from the supported portion <b>22</b>, and the front end surface <b>75</b><i>a </i>is opposite to the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>, . . . received in the case body <b>2</b>. The front end surface <b>75</b><i>a </i>of the location regulating protrusion <b>75</b> has a curved shape convex at the front end side.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">In addition, a balance portion <b>25</b> is installed to the lock lever <b>21</b>A, and the balance portion <b>25</b> may be installed as the location regulating protrusion <b>75</b>. In this case, the balance portion <b>25</b> and the location regulating protrusion <b>75</b> are configured as the same component of the lock lever <b>21</b>A, and the location regulating protrusion <b>75</b> is formed with the same shape as the balance portion <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">The location regulating portion <b>75</b> is located at the disc insertion/extraction hole <b>4</b><i>a </i>rather than a line L connecting the axial center P<b>1</b> of the support shaft <b>13</b> and the center P<b>2</b> of the disc-shaped recording medium <b>100</b>, in the locked state in which the first shell <b>3</b> and the second shell <b>4</b> are locked by the lock lever <b>21</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">By locating the location regulating protrusion <b>75</b> of the lock lever <b>21</b>A in the above location relation with respect to the disc-shaped recording medium <b>100</b>, when a great impact is applied to the case body <b>2</b>, for example when the disc cartridge <b>1</b> is dropped by mistake, the locked state of the case body <b>2</b> by the lock lever <b>21</b>A is not released. In other words, even though a great impact is applied to the case body <b>2</b> such that the disc-shaped recording media <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>, . . . move in an S<b>1</b> direction discharged from the case body <b>2</b>, the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>, . . . is in contact with the location regulating protrusion <b>75</b>, and this contact applies a pivoting force to the lock lever <b>21</b>A in an S<b>2</b> direction. Since the S<b>2</b> direction is a pivoting direction in which the lock lever <b>21</b>A locks the first shell <b>3</b> and the second shell <b>4</b>, the locked state of the case body <b>2</b> by the lock lever <b>21</b>A is not released.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Therefore, when a great impact is applied to the case body <b>2</b>, the locked state of the case body <b>2</b> by the lock lever <b>21</b>A is not released, and it may be secured that the disc-shaped recording media <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>, . . . are stably supported by the case body <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">In addition, when a great impact is applied to the case body <b>2</b>, if the lock lever <b>21</b>A pivots in a direction opposite to the S<b>2</b> direction in which the lock lever <b>21</b>A locks the case body <b>2</b>, the location regulating protrusion <b>75</b> contacts the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>, . . . so that the disc-shaped recording media <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>, . . . are pressed in a direction to be received in the case body <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Therefore, when the first shell <b>3</b> and the second shell <b>4</b> are separated in the vertical direction, the panel portion <b>38</b> does not contact the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>, . . . , and it is possible to prevent the disc-shaped recording media <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>, . . . from being damaged or broken.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">In addition, as described above, since the front end surface <b>75</b><i>a </i>of the location regulating protrusion <b>75</b> has a curved shape convex at the front end side, when the front end surface <b>75</b><i>a </i>of the location regulating protrusion <b>75</b> contacts the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>, . . . , it is possible to prevent the outer circumference of the disc-shaped recording media <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>, . . . from being scratched or broken.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">In addition, by installing the balance portion <b>25</b> as the location regulating protrusion <b>75</b>, it is possible to simplify the structure of the lock lever <b>21</b>A and integrate functions of the lock lever <b>21</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Next, a lock lever <b>21</b>B according to a second modified example will be described (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 to 35</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the lock levers <b>21</b>B and <b>21</b>B include supported portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b>, lock portions <b>23</b>B and <b>23</b>B, lock releasing portions <b>24</b> and <b>24</b>, and balance portions <b>25</b> and <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">The lock portion <b>23</b>B includes a lock protrusion <b>23</b><i>c </i>protruding laterally and formed at the front end portion, and a spring support protrusion <b>23</b><i>b </i>is installed to the lock portion <b>23</b>B. A fitting concave portion <b>23</b><i>d </i>opened upwards is formed in the upper surface of the lock protrusion <b>23</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The first lock concave portions <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>a </i>are formed in the second shell <b>4</b> as described above, and the lock protrusions <b>23</b><i>c </i>and <b>23</b><i>c </i>of the lock levers <b>23</b>B and <b>23</b>B are respectively inserted into and engaged with the first lock concave portions <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">A fitting protrusion <b>45</b><i>g </i>protruding downwards is installed to the upper surface (the surface oriented downwards) of the first lock concave portion <b>45</b><i>a </i>of the second shell <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, and the fitting protrusion <b>45</b><i>g </i>may be fitted to the fitting concave portion <b>23</b><i>d </i>in the state in which the lock protrusion <b>23</b><i>c </i>of the lock lever <b>23</b>B is inserted into the lock concave portion <b>45</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">In the state in which the first shell <b>3</b> and the second shell <b>4</b> are coupled, if the lock levers <b>21</b>B and <b>21</b>B respectively pivot by the biasing force of the bias springs <b>30</b> and <b>30</b> in a direction (in an outward direction) in which the lock protrusions <b>23</b><i>c </i>and <b>23</b><i>c </i>of the lock portions <b>23</b>B and <b>23</b>B are spaced apart from each other, the lock protrusions <b>23</b><i>c </i>and <b>23</b><i>c </i>are respectively inserted into the first lock concave portions <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>a </i>of the second shell <b>4</b>, and the first shell <b>3</b> and the second shell <b>4</b> are locked in a coupled state (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">In the state in which the first shell <b>3</b> and the second shell <b>4</b> are coupled, the first shell <b>3</b> may be moved slightly with respect to the second shell <b>4</b> in the vertical direction. Therefore, in the state in which the first shell <b>3</b> moves downwards with respect to the second shell <b>4</b> and the lock protrusions <b>23</b><i>c </i>and <b>23</b><i>c </i>of the lock levers <b>21</b>B and <b>21</b>B are pressed to the lower surface (the surface oriented upwards) of the first lock concave portions <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>a</i>, the upper surfaces of the lock protrusions <b>23</b><i>c </i>and <b>23</b><i>c </i>are located slightly below the upper surfaces of the first lock concave portions <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">In the first shell <b>3</b> and the second shell <b>4</b>, since the upper surfaces of the lock protrusions <b>23</b><i>c </i>and <b>23</b><i>c </i>are respectively located slightly below the upper surfaces of the first lock concave portions <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>a</i>, the lock protrusions <b>23</b><i>c </i>and <b>23</b><i>c </i>may be easily inserted into and extracted from the first lock concave portions <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">In addition, when a great impact is applied to the case body <b>2</b>, for example, when the disc cartridge <b>1</b> is dropped by mistake, a force in a pivoting direction in which the lock protrusions <b>23</b><i>c </i>and <b>23</b><i>c </i>are respectively extracted from the first lock concave portions <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>a </i>may be applied to the lock levers <b>21</b>B and <b>21</b>B by the impact.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">However, when an impact is applied, the first shell <b>3</b> and the second shell <b>4</b> move so as to be away from each other in the vertical direction, and the fitting protrusions <b>45</b><i>g </i>and <b>45</b><i>g </i>installed to the first lock concave portions <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>a </i>are respectively fitted to the fitting concave portions <b>23</b><i>d </i>and <b>23</b><i>d </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Therefore, the pivotal movement in a direction in which the lock protrusions <b>23</b><i>c </i>and <b>23</b><i>c </i>of the lock levers <b>21</b>B and <b>21</b>B are respectively extracted from the first lock concave portions <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>a </i>is regulated, and therefore it is possible to prevent the lock between the first shell <b>3</b> and the second shell <b>4</b> from being released unnecessarily by an impact.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">In addition, though the fitting concave portion <b>23</b><i>d </i>is formed at the lock lever <b>21</b>B and the fitting protrusion <b>45</b><i>g </i>is installed to the first lock concave portion <b>45</b><i>a </i>in the above example, on the contrary, it is also possible that a fitting protrusion is installed to the lock lever and a fitting concave portion is formed at the first lock concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">The detailed shape and structure of each component described in the above embodiments are just an example of the present disclosure, and the scope of the present disclosure should not be limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">The present disclosure contains subject matter related to that disclosed in Japanese Priority Patent Application JP 2010-253066 filed in the Japan Patent Office on Nov. 11, 2010, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
