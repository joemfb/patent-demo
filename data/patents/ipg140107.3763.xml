<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a light-emitting diode (LED) driving circuit. More particularly, the present invention relates to an LED driving circuit for driving a plurality of lightbars each including a plurality of LEDs coupled in series.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a conventional LED driving circuit. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an LED driving circuit <b>1</b> is adapted to driving a plurality of lightbars LB<b>1</b>-LBm, and each lightbar LBi includes a plurality of LEDs D<b>1</b>-Dn coupled in series, where m and n are positive integers, and i is an integer from 1 to m. The LED driving circuit <b>1</b> includes a direct-current to direct-current (DC/DC) converter <b>11</b> and an LED controller <b>12</b>. The DC/DC converter <b>11</b> such as a buck or boost converter converts a DC input voltage Vin to a DC voltage Vlb sufficient to drive the lightbars LB<b>1</b>-LBm. Each lightbar LBi has a first terminal coupled to the DC/DC converter <b>11</b> to receive the DC voltage Vlb and a second terminal coupled to a corresponding channel terminal CHi of the LED controller <b>12</b>. The LED controller <b>12</b> detects current of each lightbar LBi and controls current of each lightbar LBi to become equal to a predetermined value by built-in constant current sources or variable resistors; that is, the LED controller <b>12</b> balances currents of the lightbars LB<b>1</b>-LBm. The LED controller <b>12</b> further outputs a feedback signal from a feedback terminal FB to control the DC/DC converter <b>11</b> to adjust the DC voltage Vlb.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">If too many lightbars LB<b>1</b>-LBm are employed, or if LEDs D<b>1</b>-Dn with high brightness are employed, the total current of the lightbars LB<b>1</b>-LBm may cause the LED controller <b>12</b> to be destroyed. Accordingly, there is a need for an LED driving circuit to employ external control manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an LED driving circuit <b>2</b> includes a DC/DC converter <b>21</b>, an LED controller <b>22</b>, a plurality of transistors M<b>1</b>-Mm and a plurality of resistors R<b>1</b>-Rm. The transistor Mi and the resistor Ri are coupled in series between the second terminal of a corresponding lightbar LBi and a ground. The LED controller <b>22</b> detects current of each lightbar LBi from a corresponding current sensing terminal ISi and outputs a signal from a corresponding channel terminal CHi to control current of each lightbar LBi to become equal to a predetermined value. The LED controller <b>22</b> further detects a voltage at the second terminal of each lightbar LBi from a voltage detecting terminal VDi to provide a short protection for the LED driving circuit <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The LED driving circuits <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> employ the LED controllers <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> which are specific-purpose integrated circuits (ICs). However, a commercially available LED controller IC supports a fixed number of lightbars. It may be necessary to employ a plurality of LED controller ICs to drive the lightbars as the number of the lightbars increases. The number of the transistors M<b>1</b>-Mm and the resistors R<b>1</b>-Rm employed in the LED driving circuit <b>2</b> will increase as the number of the lightbars increases. Therefore, as the number of the lightbars increases, the conventional LED driving circuits become more complex and expensive to design and manufacture.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an LED driving circuit employing a simple driving structure with reduced components and without using a specific-purpose LED controller IC.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides an LED driving circuit for driving a plurality of first lightbars and a plurality of second lightbars. Each of the first lightbars and the second lightbars includes a plurality of LEDs coupled in series. Each of the first lightbars and the second lightbars has a first terminal coupled to receive a direct-current (DC) voltage and a second terminal. The LED driving circuit includes a first current mirror, a second current mirror and a control circuit. The first current mirror is coupled to the second terminals of the first lightbars. The first current mirror balances currents of the first lightbars when the first current mirror is enabled, and causes the currents of the first lightbars to become zero when the first current mirror is disabled. The second current mirror is coupled to the second terminals of the second lightbars. The second current mirror balances currents of the second lightbars when the second current mirror is enabled, and causes the currents of the second lightbars to become zero when the second current mirror is disabled. The control circuit is coupled to the first current mirror and the second current mirror. During a first period, the control circuit disables the second current mirror and adjusts the duration of enabling the first current mirror according to a dimming signal. During a second period, the control circuit disables the first current mirror and adjusts the duration of enabling the second current mirror according to the dimming signal. The first period and the second period are repeated alternatively.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first current mirror includes a first constant current source, a plurality of first transistors and a second transistor. The first constant current source provides a first constant current. Each of the first transistors and the second transistor has a first terminal, a second terminal and a control terminal. The first terminal of each first transistor is coupled to the second terminal of a corresponding first lightbar. The second terminals of the first transistors and the second transistor are coupled to one another and to a ground. The control terminals of the first transistors and the second transistor are coupled to one another and to the first terminal of the second transistor, the first constant current source and the control circuit. The first transistors and the second transistor are matched to one another. The second current mirror includes a second constant current source, a plurality of third transistors and a fourth transistor. The second constant current source provides a second constant current having the same magnitude as the first constant current. Each of the third transistors and the fourth transistor has a first terminal, a second terminal and a control terminal. The first terminal of each third transistor is coupled to the second terminal of a corresponding second lightbar. The second terminals of the third transistors and the fourth transistor are coupled to one another and to the ground. The control terminals of the third transistors and the fourth transistor are coupled to one another and to the first terminal of the fourth transistor, the second constant current source and the control circuit. The third transistors and the fourth transistor are matched to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The control circuit includes a controller, a first switch unit, a second switch unit, a short protection circuit, a third switch unit and a fourth switch unit. The controller outputs a first pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal and a second PWM signal. Duty cycles of the first PWM signal and the second PWM signal are determined by the dimming signal. The first switch unit has a first terminal coupled to the control terminal of the second transistor, a second terminal coupled to the ground and a control terminal. The second switch unit has a first terminal coupled to the control terminal of the fourth transistor, a second terminal coupled to the ground and a control terminal. The short protection circuit is coupled to the second terminals of the first lightbars and the second lightbars and outputs a short signal. The short signal is valid when a voltage at the second terminal of one of the first lightbars and the second lightbars is larger than a threshold voltage. The short signal is invalid when voltages at the second terminals of the first lightbars and the second lightbars are smaller than the threshold voltage. The third switch unit has a first terminal coupled to receive the first PWM signal, a second terminal coupled to the control terminal of the first switch unit and a control terminal coupled to receive the short signal. The third switch unit is open when the short signal is valid, and the third switch unit is closed when the short signal is invalid. The first switch unit is open or closed according to the first PWM signal when the third switch unit is closed, and the first switch unit is closed when the third switch unit is open. The fourth switch unit has a first terminal coupled to receive the second PWM signal, a second terminal coupled to the control terminal of the second switch unit and a control terminal coupled to receive the short signal. The fourth switch unit is open when the short signal is valid, and the fourth switch unit is closed when the short signal is invalid. The second switch unit is open or closed according to the second PWM signal when the fourth switch unit is closed, and the second switch unit is closed when the fourth switch unit is open.</p>

The fourth switch unit SW<b>4</b> has a first terminal coupled to receive the second PWM signal Vpwm<b>2</b>, a second terminal coupled to the control terminal of the second switch unit SW<b>2</b> and a control terminal coupled to receive the short signal Vshort. The fourth switch unit SW<b>4</b> is open when the short signal Vshort is valid, and the fourth switch unit SW<b>4</b> is closed when the short signal Vshort is invalid.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other words, when a voltage at the second terminal of one of the first lightbars LB<b>11</b>-LB<b>1</b><i>m </i>and the second lightbars LB<b>21</b>-LB<b>2</b><i>m </i>is larger than the threshold voltage, a short circuit occurs in the first lightbars LB<b>11</b>-LB<b>1</b><i>m </i>and the second lightbars LB<b>21</b>-LB<b>2</b><i>m</i>, so that the short protection circuit outputs the short signal Vshort which is valid. The valid short signal Vshort controls the third switch unit SW<b>3</b> and the fourth switch unit SW<b>4</b> to be open, so that the first switch unit SW<b>1</b> and the second switch unit SW<b>2</b> are closed. Now the control terminals of the first transistors Q<b>11</b>-Q<b>1</b><i>m</i>, the second transistor Q<b>2</b>, the third transistors Q<b>31</b>-Q<b>3</b><i>m </i>and the fourth transistor Q<b>4</b> (i.e. the base terminals of the NPN BJTs) are coupled to the ground and turned off accordingly, so that the control circuit <b>33</b> disables the first current mirror <b>31</b> and the second current mirror <b>32</b> to provide a short protection for the LED driving circuit <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">When voltages at the second terminals of the first lightbars LB<b>11</b>-LB<b>1</b><i>m </i>and the second lightbars LB<b>21</b>-LB<b>2</b><i>m </i>are smaller than the threshold voltage, no short circuit occurs in the first lightbars LB<b>11</b>-LB<b>1</b><i>m </i>and the second lightbars LB<b>21</b>-LB<b>2</b><i>m</i>, so that the short protection circuit outputs the short signal Vshort which is invalid. The invalid short signal Vshort controls the third switch unit SW<b>3</b> and the fourth switch unit SW<b>4</b> to be closed, so that the first switch unit SW<b>1</b> is open or closed according to the first PWM signal Vpwm<b>1</b>, and the second switch unit SW<b>2</b> is open or closed according to the second PWM signal Vpwm<b>2</b> to achieve time division control of the first lightbars LB<b>11</b>-LB<b>1</b><i>m </i>and the second lightbars LB<b>21</b>-LB<b>2</b><i>m </i>of the LED driving circuit <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a timing diagram illustrating time division control of the LED driving circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> under maximum brightness when no short circuit occurs in the first lightbars and the second lightbars. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a pulse signal Vpulse generated by an internal oscillator (not shown) of the controller U<b>1</b> is served as an operating frequency of the controller U<b>1</b>. Time can be divided into a plurality of periods each having a duration of T. Each period includes a pulse having a duration (or pulse width) of Td, where Td is much less than T. These pulses are adapted to avoiding overlap between the first PWM signal Vpwm<b>1</b> and the second PWM signal Vpwm<b>2</b> so that the first lightbars LB<b>11</b>-LB<b>1</b><i>m </i>are turned on when the second lightbars LB<b>21</b>-LB<b>2</b><i>m </i>are turned off, and the first lightbars LB<b>11</b>-LB<b>1</b><i>m </i>are turned off when the second lightbars LB<b>21</b>-LB<b>2</b><i>m </i>are turned on. It is defined that odd periods are first periods T<b>1</b>, and even periods are second periods T<b>2</b>; hence, the first period T<b>1</b> and the second period T<b>2</b> are repeated alternatively.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">During the first period T<b>1</b>, the second PWM signal Vpwm<b>2</b> remains at low level and controls the second switch unit SW<b>2</b> to be closed to disable the second current mirror <b>32</b>, then the disabled second current mirror <b>32</b> controls the second lightbars LB<b>21</b>-LB<b>2</b><i>m </i>to be turned off and causes the currents I<b>21</b>-I<b>2</b><i>m </i>of the second lightbars LB<b>21</b>-LB<b>2</b><i>m </i>to become zero (here, taking the current I<b>21</b> as an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The first PWM signal Vpwm<b>1</b> is at high level except in the interval from j&#xd7;2T to (j&#xd7;2T+Td), where j is a non-negative integer. The first PWM signal Vpwm<b>1</b> which is at high level of a duration of Ton1 controls the first switch unit SW<b>1</b> to be open to enable the first current mirror <b>31</b>, then the enabled first current mirror <b>31</b> controls the first lightbars LB<b>11</b>-LB<b>1</b><i>m </i>to be turned on and balances the currents I<b>11</b>-I<b>1</b><i>m </i>of the first lightbars LB<b>11</b>-LB<b>1</b><i>m </i>(here, taking the current I<b>11</b> as an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, the dimming signal Vdim is a DC signal whose magnitude influences the duty cycles of the first PWM signal Vpwm<b>1</b> and the second PWM signal Vpwm<b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In summary, the LED driving circuit of the present invention divides all lightbars into the first lightbars and the second lightbars for time division control, and only the first lightbars or the second lightbars are driven in each period. For example, only the first lightbars are driven in the first period, and only the second lightbars are driven in the second period. It reduces the amount of current provided by the DC/DC converter for driving the lightbars in each period; hence, the DC/DC converter can reduce voltage ripple therein and employ a filter capacitor of smaller capacitance at its output to reduce its cost. In addition, the LED driving circuit of the present invention employs a simple driving structure with reduced components and without using a specific-purpose LED controller IC to reduce its cost.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the structure of the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. In view of the foregoing, it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations of this invention provided they fall within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
