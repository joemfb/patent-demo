<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for correcting an X-ray diffraction (XRD) profile measured by an X-ray diffraction imaging (XDi) system is provided. The XDi system includes an anode, a detector, and a control system. The method includes obtaining an emission spectrum of the anode using the control system. The emission spectrum includes spectral structures. The method further includes calculating a piecewise spectral-correction function using the spectral structures in the emission spectrum, obtaining a measured spectrum of an object, and applying the spectral-correction function to the measured spectrum to generate a spectrally-corrected measured spectrum.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The embodiments described herein relate generally to correction methods X-ray diffraction profiles and, more particularly, to energy-based and angular-variation-based correction methods for X-ray diffraction profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">At least some known detection systems are used at travel checkpoints to inspect containers, such as carry-on luggage and/or checked luggage, for concealed contraband, such as weapons, narcotics, and/or explosives. At least some such detection systems include X-ray imaging systems. An X-ray imaging system includes an X-ray source that transmits X-rays through a container towards a detector. An output of the detector is processed to identify a set of objects and/or materials within the container. In addition, at least some known detection systems include X-ray diffraction imaging (XDi) systems. At least some known XDi systems use inverse fan-beam geometry (a large source and a small detector) and a multi-focus X-ray source (MFXS) to detect objects and/or materials. Further, some known XDi systems provide an improved discrimination of materials, as compared to that provided by other known X-ray imaging systems, by measuring d-spacings between lattice planes of micro-crystals in materials. X-ray diffraction (XRD) may also yield data from a molecular interference function that may be used to identify other materials, such as liquids, in the container.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some known energy-dispersive XRD profiles that are measured with an electron impact X-ray source are normalized against an emission spectrum of the X-ray source to remove spectral structures, such as anode K characteristic lines and/or a non-uniform form of bremsstrahlung background. However, such known normalization significantly increases noise in the XRD profile, even when a primary spectrum of the X-ray source is substantially noise free. Further such known normalization suppresses genuine XRD peaks within a region where a bremsstrahlung curve has its peak intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A non-uniform emission spectrum of an electron impact X-ray source, or primary spectrum, is directly reflected in a shape of its energy-dispersive XRD profile. Such non-uniformity of the emission spectrum arises in two separate ways. First, a K alpha line, a K beta line, and a K edge of an anode of the X-ray source are characteristic effects arising from an interaction of high-energy electrons from a cathode with K shell electrons orbiting nuclei of the anode. Second, the bremsstrahlung or continuous component of the emission spectrum has non-uniformity originating from an interaction of high-energy electrons from the cathode with an electric field of the anode nuclei. In order to avoid adverse effects of the non-uniform primary spectrum on measured XRD spectra, the measured XRD spectra are often normalized against the primary spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One known process of normalizing the measured XRD profile against the non-uniform primary spectrum essentially multiplies the measured XRD profile by varying weighting factors. For example, if a signal in a k-th channel of the measured spectrum is S<sub>k </sub>and a weighting factor for this channel is w<sub>k</sub>, a noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) can be calculated using the following equation, where RMS denotes the root mean square deviation:</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For Poisson statistics that govern photon scattering experiments, a minimum NSR is achieved when all of the weighting factors are equal to one another. As such, a compromise is made when correcting for the disturbing effects of the primary spectrum on the measured XRD profile. On one hand, removing non-uniformities from the measured XRD profile improves feature extraction and/or substance identification. On the other hand, known normalization processing effectively increases noise in the measured XRD data, especially for lower density objects, even when the primary spectrum form is substantially noise free. As such, known normalization processing may reduce detection rates and/or increase false alarms.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, at least some known detection systems have a multiple-inverse fan-beam (MIFB) XDi topology, which has approximately 10% variation in an angle of scatter during a scan. Such scatter angle variations affect both the abscissa (momentum) and ordinate (intensity) scales of measured spectra.

where E is photon energy, h is Planck's constant, and c is the speed of light. As such, the correct value of &#x3b8;<sub>IJ </sub>from Equation 2 is incorporated into Equation 3 to correctly transform the photon energy scale E into a momentum scale x. However, because the primary spectrum is non-uniform, it is not sufficient to only transform the energy scale E into a correct momentum scale x. More specifically, the photon intensity at energy E<sub>1 </sub>corresponding to a momentum x for an angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>is different than the photon intensity at energy E<sub>2 </sub>corresponding to the same momentum x for an angle &#x3b8;<sub>2</sub>. However, the above-described known method does not transform a photon intensity scale to produce measured XRD profiles that are comparable to the reference XRD profiles.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The embodiments described herein provide a low-noise spectral-correction procedure and an angular-variation correction procedure that can be used in conjunction with the spectral-correction procedure. The spectral-correction procedure makes use of a priori knowledge of energies of the K lines and K edge of an anode to derive a corrected X-ray diffraction XRD profile that would have been measured in the absence of K structures of the anode. In addition to being low-noise, the spectral-correction procedure significantly enhances amplitudes of measured XRD peaks near a maximum in a bremsstrahlung curve as compared with the previous correction procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Of the two types of beam non-uniformity discussed above, the non-uniformity associated with K structures is the more serious of the two. As such the spectral-correction procedure described herein removes the K structure non-uniformity without removing the bremsstrahlung non-uniformity. Such an approach is taken for three main reasons. First, the K peaks and the K edge interfere more with detection of Bragg peaks in the measured spectrum than does the smoothly varying bremsstrahlung component. Second, a ratio of a number of photons under the K peaks to a total number of photons in the measured spectrum is only about 10%. As such, the K structures can be removed without appreciably degrading a signal-to-noise ratio. Third, there is a satisfactory theory, such as Kuhlenkampff's equation, describing a shape of the continuous component of non-uniformity, so an effect of the continuous component can be corrected for, if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, the angular-variation correction procedure described herein transforms energy-dispersive XRD spectra to a common intensity and momentum scale, irrespective of actual scatter angle. As such, the angular-variation correction procedure correctly transforms both the energy and intensity of the photon spectrum from an electron impact X-ray source. Accordingly, the herein-described angular-variation correction procedure can transform a measured XRD spectrum at any actual scatter angle &#x3b8; to a reference scatter angle.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of an exemplary detection system <b>10</b> in substantially an X-Y plane. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view of detection system <b>10</b> in an X-Z plane.

In the exemplary embodiment, detection system <b>10</b> is a multiple-inverse fan-beam X-ray diffraction imaging (MIFB XDi) system. Detection system <b>10</b> includes a multi-focus X-ray source (MFXS) <b>14</b> having an anode <b>15</b>, a primary collimator <b>16</b>, an object space <b>18</b>, a support <b>20</b>, a secondary collimator <b>22</b>, a transmission detector <b>24</b>, and a scatter detector <b>26</b>. Scatter detector <b>26</b> is offset in a Z-axis direction from transmission detector <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the exemplary embodiment, transmission detector <b>24</b> includes a plurality of detector elements <b>38</b>. More specifically, detector elements <b>38</b> are each configured to detect radiation from primary rays <b>34</b> that are transmitted through object <b>12</b> within object space <b>18</b>. Furthermore, scatter detector <b>26</b> includes a plurality of scatter detector elements <b>40</b> that are configured to detect coherent scattered radiation <b>42</b> generated when a primary ray <b>34</b> interacts with object <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">MFXS <b>14</b> is located on a lower support surface, such as a floor, while transmission detector <b>24</b> and scatter detector <b>26</b> are located on an upper support structure, such as a ceiling. In an alternative embodiment, MFXS <b>14</b> is located on the upper support structure, and transmission detector <b>24</b> and scatter detector <b>26</b> are located on the lower support surface. Furthermore, in the exemplary embodiment, MFXS <b>14</b>, transmission detector <b>24</b>, and scatter detector <b>26</b> are stationary, and support <b>20</b> is a conveyor belt capable of movement backward and forward in a direction substantially parallel to a Z-axis. In the exemplary embodiment, object space <b>18</b> is defined between transmission detector <b>24</b> and MFXS <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, object space <b>18</b> is a baggage tunnel through which the conveyor belt moves. In an alternative embodiment, MFXS <b>14</b>, transmission detector <b>24</b>, and scatter detector <b>26</b> are capable of coordinated movement at least in a direction substantially parallel to the Z-axis, and support <b>20</b> is stationary. In certain alternative embodiments, MFXS <b>14</b>, transmission detector <b>24</b>, scatter detector <b>26</b>, and support <b>20</b> are each capable of moving.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the exemplary embodiment, MFXS <b>14</b> is configured to emit X-ray radiation sequentially or simultaneously from a plurality of focus points <b>28</b> distributed along MFXS <b>14</b> in a direction substantially parallel to a Y-axis.

In the exemplary embodiment, MFXS <b>14</b> has any suitable number of focus points <b>28</b> that enables detection system <b>10</b> to function as herein described. Detection system <b>10</b> is designed such that each focus point <b>28</b> lies at a point on a straight line <b>30</b> that is substantially parallel to the Y-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, MFXS <b>14</b> is, in the exemplary embodiment, configured to emit, through primary collimator <b>16</b>, a set <b>32</b> of primary rays <b>34</b> of radiation from each focus point <b>28</b>. In one embodiment, primary rays <b>34</b> are X-ray pencil beams generated from each focus point <b>28</b> of MFXS <b>14</b>. More specifically, in the exemplary embodiment, each primary ray <b>34</b> of each set <b>32</b> is directed at a corresponding target point <b>36</b> of a plurality of target points <b>36</b> which lie in the same X-Y plane as MFXS <b>14</b>. Further, each target point <b>36</b> is positioned at the same X-coordinate value, but at different Y-coordinate values. In the exemplary embodiment, each target point <b>36</b> is located at a detector element <b>38</b> of transmission detector <b>24</b>. As such, each detector element <b>38</b> is configured to detect one primary ray <b>34</b> from each focus point <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A portion of the X-ray radiation from each primary ray <b>34</b> typically is scattered in various directions upon interaction with object <b>12</b> in object space <b>18</b>. Secondary collimator <b>22</b> is configured to facilitate ensuring that a portion of scattered radiation <b>42</b> arriving at each scatter detector element <b>40</b> has a constant scatter angle &#x3b8; with respect to corresponding primary ray <b>34</b> from which scattered radiation <b>42</b> originated. For example, secondary collimator <b>22</b> is configured to absorb scattered radiation that is not parallel to the direction of scattered radiation <b>42</b>. Further, although in the exemplary embodiment secondary collimator <b>22</b> and scatter detector elements <b>40</b> are positioned on one side of primary rays <b>34</b> with respect to the Z-axis, in alternative embodiments secondary collimator <b>22</b> and scatter detector elements <b>40</b> may be positioned on the other side, or on both sides, of primary rays <b>34</b> with respect to the Z-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the exemplary embodiment, transmission detector <b>24</b> and scatter detector <b>26</b> are in electronic communication with a number of channels <b>44</b>. In a particular embodiment, the number of channels <b>44</b> is selected based on the configuration of detection system <b>10</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, channels <b>44</b> electronically communicate data collected by transmission detector <b>24</b> and each scatter detector element <b>40</b> to a control system <b>46</b>. Control system <b>46</b> combines an output from transmission detector <b>24</b> and outputs from scatter detector elements <b>40</b> to generate information about object <b>12</b> within object space <b>18</b>. For example, but not by way of limitation, control system <b>46</b> may generate multi-view projections, section images, and/or an X-ray diffraction (XRD) profile of object <b>12</b> to facilitate identifying a location in the container of specific materials detected by XDI analysis. Images, information, results, alarms, and/or any other suitable data generated by control system <b>46</b> can be output to a display <b>48</b> and/or a storage device <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, control system <b>46</b> stores data, an XRD profile, and/or an image in storage device <b>50</b>.

Other examples of storage device <b>50</b> include a floppy disk, a compact disc-ROM (CD-ROM), a magneto-optical disk (MOD), and a digital versatile disc (DVD). Further, control system <b>46</b> also receives commands and scanning parameters from an operator (not shown) via an operator console (not shown). Display <b>48</b> allows the operator to observe an XRD profile and other data from control system <b>46</b>. The operator supplied commands and parameters are used by control system <b>46</b> in operation of components of detection system <b>10</b>. Moreover, in the exemplary embodiment, control system <b>46</b> uses computer algorithms to analyze a generated XRD profile with XRD profiles of known contraband materials. If a match is found, control system <b>46</b> sounds an alarm and/or displays an image of object <b>12</b> on display <b>48</b> such that the operator may view the image to determine whether a real threat exists.</p>

In such an embodiment, control system <b>46</b> is configured to read the computer-readable medium for performing method <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the exemplary embodiment, method <b>100</b> includes a noise-correction procedure <b>102</b> and an angular-variation-correction procedure <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, noise-correction, or spectral-correction procedure <b>102</b> is performed without performing angular-variation-correction procedure <b>104</b>. In an alternative embodiment, angular-variation-correction procedure <b>104</b> is performed without performing noise-correction procedure <b>102</b>. Further, although a tungsten anode tube is described herein with respect to method <b>100</b>, it should be understood that method <b>100</b> can be used with any suitable anode.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, in the exemplary embodiment, spectral-correction procedure <b>102</b> includes obtaining <b>106</b> an emission spectrum S(E) of anode <b>15</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). Emission spectrum S(E) is also referred to herein as a primary spectrum. Emission spectrum S(E) includes a K&#x3b1; peak <b>202</b>, a K&#x3b2; peak <b>204</b>, and a K edge <b>206</b>. K&#x3b1; peak <b>202</b>, K&#x3b2; peak <b>204</b>, and/or K edge <b>206</b> of emission spectrum S(E) may cause non-uniformity in measured spectra generated using anode <b>15</b>. As such, spectral-correction procedure <b>102</b> is configured to remove K&#x3b1; peak <b>202</b>, K&#x3b2; peak <b>204</b>, and K edge <b>206</b> from emission spectrum S(E) so K&#x3b1; peak <b>202</b>, K&#x3b2; peak <b>204</b>, and K edge <b>206</b> will not adversely affect measured spectra.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Spectral-correction procedure <b>102</b> derives corrected emission spectrum S<sub>C</sub>(E) that is free of K structures from an original emission spectrum S(E) by dividing emission spectrum S(E) into three energy bands. More specifically, windows <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>202</b> are defined <b>108</b> on emission spectrum S(E) based on energies of the spectral structures of emission spectrum S(E). In the exemplary embodiment, a first window <b>208</b> is defined <b>108</b> from a beginning point <b>214</b> of emission spectrum S(E) to a center <b>216</b> of K&#x3b2; peak <b>204</b> (E<sub>0</sub>&#x2266;E&#x2266;E<sub>1</sub>), a second window <b>210</b> is defined <b>108</b> from center <b>216</b> of K&#x3b2; peak <b>204</b> to an end <b>208</b> of K edge <b>206</b> (E<sub>1</sub>&#x2266;E&#x2266;E<sub>2</sub>), and a third window <b>212</b> is defined <b>108</b> from end <b>218</b> of K edge <b>206</b> to an end point <b>220</b> of emission spectrum S(E) (E<sub>2</sub>&#x2266;E&#x2266;E<sub>E</sub>). In the exemplary embodiment, energy E<sub>1 </sub>is approximately equal to 67.5 kilo-electron volts (keV) and energy E<sub>2 </sub>is approximately equal to 71.8 keV. Once windows <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> are defined <b>108</b>, windows <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> are used to calculate <b>110</b> spectral-correction function S<sub>s</sub>(E) (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). More specifically, a piecewise spectral-correction function S<sub>s</sub>(E) is calculated <b>110</b> using spectral structures, such as K&#x3b1; peak <b>202</b>, K&#x3b2; peak <b>204</b>, and K edge <b>206</b>, in emission spectrum S(E). Spectral-correction function S<sub>s</sub>(E) includes an equation portion corresponding to each defined window <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Within first window <b>208</b>, spectral bands <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> are defined on either side of K&#x3b1; peak <b>202</b>. For example, first spectral band <b>222</b> is defined between energy E<sub>3 </sub>and energy E<sub>4</sub>, and second spectral band <b>224</b> is defined between energy E<sub>5 </sub>and energy E<sub>6</sub>. Knowledge of the anode material, such as tungsten, and the energy of its characteristic lines permits spectral bands <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> to be located accurately. As an example for tungsten emission spectrum S(E), low-energy spectral band <b>222</b> is defined between energy E<sub>3 </sub>that is approximately equal to 54 keV and energy E<sub>4 </sub>that is approximately equal to 56 keV, and high-energy spectral band <b>224</b> is defined between energy E<sub>5 </sub>that is approximately equal to 63.5 keV and energy E<sub>6 </sub>that is approximately equal to 65.5 keV. An average number of photon counts in each spectral band <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> is determined and a straight line L(E) is fit through centers of spectral bands <b>222</b> and <b>224</b>. Control system <b>46</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) stores straight line parameters, such as a gradient M and an intercept C with an intensity axis.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Within third window <b>212</b>, an average number of photon counts is determined by control system <b>46</b>. A ratio of the average number of photon counts to a height of straight line L(E) is stored as a K-edge ratio K<sub>R </sub>by control system <b>46</b>. In a particular embodiment, K-edge ratio K<sub>R </sub>is equal approximately 0.67. To calculate <b>110</b> spectral-correction function S<sub>s</sub>(E), a numerical difference between unity and K-edge ratio K<sub>R </sub>is multiplied by a function that is unity at energy E<sub>2 </sub>and exponentially decreases with increasing photon energy. In mathematical form, spectral-correction function S<sub>s</sub>(E) within third window <b>212</b> is calculated <b>110</b> as:

The approach of spectral-correction function S<sub>s</sub>(E) to unity is considered to the relaxation associated with factor &#x3b3; in Equation 6. In a particular embodiment, factor &#x3b3; is equal to approximately 0.1. In the exemplary embodiment, a third window portion of spectral-correction function S<sub>s</sub>(E) is defined as the multiplication in Equation 6.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Calculation <b>110</b> yields a piecewise spectral-correction function S<sub>s</sub>(E) in the form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> when spectral-correction procedure <b>102</b> is implemented on emission spectrum S(E) from a tungsten anode bombarded by electrons of 150 keV. An increase in photon noise from Equation 1 when spectral-correction function S<sub>s</sub>(E) is used is about 12%. Such an increase in noise is approximately 20 times smaller than an increase in noise using the conventional procedure. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a corrected emission spectrum S<sub>C</sub>(E) is generated by dividing original emission spectrum S(E) by spectral-correction function S<sub>s</sub>(E). An approximation of a corrected emission spectrum S<sub>A</sub>(E) is shown as a dashed line. In the exemplary embodiment, approximation S<sub>A</sub>(E) is calculated using the Kuhlenkampff equation.

Although angular-correction procedure <b>104</b> is described herein with respect to detection system <b>10</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), angular-correction procedure <b>104</b> can be used with any suitable system that produces an XRD profile of a scanned object. Angular-correction procedure <b>104</b> first converts an abscissa scale of an XRD spectrum into a momentum scale at a known scatter angle of the XRD spectrum. An intensity of the XRD spectrum is then multiplied by angular-correction function F(x) that transforms an ordinate scale of the XRD spectrum into a scale measured at a smaller and/or different scatter angle. As such, angular-correction procedure <b>104</b> allows a common library of XRD profiles, for example known profiles of threat substances, at a particular scatter angle, such as reference scatter angle &#x3b8;<sub>R</sub>, to be used for all measured spectra, irrespective of scatter angle. Further, angular-correction procedure <b>104</b> allows XRD profiles pertaining to a certain object voxel, measured with varying scatter angle, to be combined by simple addition.</p>

When primary emission spectrum S(E) is corrected using spectral-correction procedure <b>102</b>, the K structures are removed and a measured XRD spectrum is equivalent to an XRD spectrum that would have been obtained had primary emission spectrum S(E) had the form of corrected emission spectrum S<sub>C</sub>(E) (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Angular-correction procedure <b>104</b> can then be performed on a spectrally-corrected measured spectrum.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, assuming that the measured spectrum was obtained <b>112</b> at second scatter angle &#x3b8;<sub>2 </sub>and the reference XRD profiles were obtained at first scatter angle &#x3b8;<sub>1</sub>, angular-correction function F(x) is applied <b>124</b> to the spectrally-corrected measured spectrum to generate a final corrected measured spectrum. More specifically, by applying 124 angular-correction function F(x) to the spectrally-corrected measured spectrum, the spectrally-corrected measured spectrum is transformed from second scatter angle &#x3b8;<sub>2 </sub>to first scatter angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>for comparison <b>116</b> with the reference XRD profiles. As such, a substance of object <b>12</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) can be identified based on the comparison <b>116</b>. Detection system <b>10</b> can then alarm and/or otherwise notify personnel of the identified substance.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The embodiments described herein provide correction procedures for spectral structures and variations of scatter angle in XRD spectra. More specifically, the spectral-correction procedure described herein effectively removes spectral structures from a primary emission spectrum while minimizing any noise introduced into a measured spectrum. Further, the above-described angular-variation correction procedure transforms all XRD profiles to have identical momentum scales and intensity distributions, irrespective of the actual angle of scatter, requires only one set of XRD library profiles for all scatter angles, which speeds processing and reduces storage requirements, and allows all XRD profiles belonging to the same object voxel to be combined with one another by a simple addition operation.</p>
