<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to packaging for optically interactive electronic devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to package assemblies for solid-state image sensors wherein a transparent cover is adhesively attached over the active surface of an image sensor chip and the image sensor chip is sealed within an encapsulant. The present invention also relates to methods of fabricating the image sensor package assemblies in an efficient manner to eliminate or reduce the potential for deposition of contaminants on the image sensor chip active surface during the fabrication process.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Optically interactive electronic devices, for example, charge coupled device (CCD) image sensors or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, are typically enclosed within a package for subsequent connection to higher-level packaging such as a larger circuit assembly in the form of a carrier substrate. The package provides electrical interconnection to the larger circuit assembly, provides protection from the surrounding environment and allows light or other forms of radiation to pass through to sensing circuitry located on the image sensor device. In the prior art, package formation has often been accomplished by placing an image sensor device in the form of a semiconductor chip into the cavity of a plastic or ceramic housing, wire bonding electrical connection points on the semiconductor chip to conductive pads associated with the housing and sealing a window or transparent cover over the cavity. The materials and structure involved with this packaging technique require a fabrication process that can be time consuming and requires several precision assembly steps. Further, each assembly step increases the opportunity for contamination or damage to the image sensor device itself, raising defect levels and slowing production time to avoid such damage and contamination. Due to the extremely cost-competitive nature of today's semiconductor industry, even small improvements in product yield and production time are of value, especially when considered in terms of the high volume of components being manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In response to large-scale production requirements, various attempts have been made to simplify the construction of image sensor packaging. U.S. Pat. No. 6,351,027 to Giboney et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,064 to Foster, for instance, disclose wafer-level packaging formed by laying a solid sidewall piece or an adhesive matrix over a wafer having an array of sensor devices and covering it with one or more transparent top pieces. The wafer is then singulated to create discrete chip-scale packages. While these packaging techniques reduce material costs and assembly steps, they do not completely protect the semiconductor chips from the environment and may require complicated process steps for forming electrical connections to the sensor devices. U.S. Pat. No. 6,266,197 to Glenn et al. discloses a method for forming image sensor packages wherein an array of image sensors is wire bonded to a carrier substrate, and a molded window array is placed over the array of image sensors. The substrate and attached molded window array are then singulated to form a plurality of individual image sensor packages. The molded window array of Glenn et al., however, suffers from the fact that individual transparent windows must be formed within, or later attached to the molded array, requiring additional assembly and alignment steps during fabrication. U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,799 to Wu discloses an image sensor package formed by attaching a plurality of preformed or glue walls to an array of printed wiring frames having image sensors thereon and sealing the walls with transparent material. The printed wiring frames are then diced to form discrete packages. Once again, this arrangement may require the attachment or formation of multiple components during fabrication and may increase the occurrence of process contamination.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As is evident from the foregoing description of the state of the art, a simplified method is needed for forming an image sensor package that is conducive to mass production while still offering suitable and robust mechanical and environmental protection for an image sensor chip.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the present invention, a plurality of package assemblies for image sensors and other optically interactive electronic devices are simultaneously fabricated to minimize process steps and reduce the cost associated with each individual package. The methods of fabrication also reduce the possibility of contaminants being deposited on the active surface of a device during assembly. While the following exemplary packaging embodiments are depicted in terms of image sensor chips, it should be understood that the package assemblies and methods presented herein would work equally well for enclosing other types of optically interactive electronic devices. The term &#x201c;optically interactive&#x201d; as used herein is meant to encompass devices sensitive to various wavelengths of light or other forms of radiation, including, but not limited to, CCD and CMOS image sensors, EPROMs, and photodiodes, as well as light-emitting devices including semiconductor lasers and light-emitting diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first embodiment according to the present invention, a wafer of semiconductor material is provided containing a plurality of image sensor chips with active surfaces arranged in an array on the front side of the wafer. The active surface of each image sensor chip includes an image sensitive area and bond pads for providing electrical connection to internal circuitry of the image sensor chip. A transparent cover of a size sufficient to cover the array of image sensor chip active surfaces is attached to the front side of the wafer using an adhesive material. The adhesive material is formed in a pattern such that, when the transparent cover is attached, the adhesive material lies between the bond pads and the image sensitive area on the active surface of each image sensor chip. The pattern of adhesive material may be applied to the front side of the wafer and/or to the transparent cover.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Once the wafer and transparent cover are joined, a layer of semiconductor material is removed from the back side of the wafer by backgrinding to reduce the image sensor chips to a desired thickness. A dicing or singulating operation is then carried out to separate the image sensor chips from the wafer. In a first stage of the dicing operation, the transparent cover is cut along the edge of the pattern of adhesive material surrounding the image sensitive area on the active surface of each image sensor chip. The bond pads on the active surface of each image sensor chip are thus left exposed for further processing, while the image sensitive area of the active surface is sealed by the remaining portion of the transparent cover. In a second stage of the dicing operation, the wafer is cut along streets of semiconductor material located between adjacent image sensor chips for complete separation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Each individual image sensor chip is subsequently affixed to an interposer substrate having conductive traces. The conductive traces extend from attachment pads formed on a first surface of the interposer to which the image sensor chips are attached, to external connection points on a second, opposing surface of the interposer. Wire bonds are formed to electrically connect the image sensor chip bond pads with the interposer attachment pads. A layer of encapsulant material is then formed over the first surface of the interposer to cover the wire bond locations and surround the edges of the transparent cover attached to each image sensor chip. Discrete conductive elements such as solder balls are formed on, or attached to the external connection points of the interposer, and the interposer is singulated to provide individual image sensor package assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a second embodiment according to the present invention, image sensor package assemblies are formed as in the first embodiment, but the image sensor chips are not connected to the interposer attachment pads using wire bonds. Instead, the image sensor chips include back side conductive elements configured for direct connection to the interposer attachment pads. In one variant of the second embodiment, the image sensor chips include conductive vias extending from the image sensor chip active surfaces into the wafer semiconductor material. The vias are exposed through the back side of the wafer during the backgrinding process and conductive elements such as bumps or pads are formed over the vias on the back side of the wafer. The back side conductive elements may then be directly connected to the interposer attachment pads. In another variant of the second embodiment, after separating the image sensor chips from the wafer, a redistribution layer (RDL) may be formed on each image sensor chip to provide conductive traces extending from the bond pads to the edge of the active surface and down to the back side of the image sensor chip. Conductive bumps or pads may then be formed on the RDL traces at locations configured for direct connection to the interposer attachment pads.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a third embodiment according to the present invention, the transparent cover is not attached to the image sensor chips at the wafer level. Instead, after dicing the wafer, the individual image sensor chips are affixed to the interposer and electrically connected to the interposer attachment pads. Individual transparent covers are attached to each of the image sensor chips with an adhesive material. The formation of the layer of encapsulant material, discrete conductive elements and singulation of the interposer are then carried out as in the first embodiment. The third embodiment enables the transparent cover to overlie the entire active surface of an image sensor chip and also allows the adhesive material to be placed directly over any wire bond connections.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a fourth embodiment according to the present invention, image sensor package assemblies are formed by mounting individual image sensor chips within the cavity of a preformed leadless chip carrier (LCC). In one variant of the fourth embodiment, individual image sensor chips having transparent covers are affixed to an interposer substrate as in the first through third embodiments. Discrete conductive elements are included on the external connection points of the interposer; however, the interposer is singulated without adding a layer of encapsulant material to form a packaging subassembly. The packaging subassembly is then mounted within the cavity of an LCC, and the cavity is filled with a liquid sealant that covers the packaging subassembly and surrounds the edges of the transparent cover attached to each image sensor chip. In another variant of the fourth embodiment individual image sensor chips are formed with transparent covers as in the first through third embodiments, and are affixed directly to the bottom of the LCC cavity such that the LCC itself is the interposer substrate. The cavity is filled with a liquid sealant that covers the packaging subassembly and surrounds the edges of the transparent cover attached to each image sensor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other and further features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following descriptions of the various embodiments when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the following embodiments are provided for illustrative and exemplary purposes only, and that numerous combinations of the elements of the various embodiments of the present invention are possible.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring in general to the accompanying drawings, various aspects of the present invention are illustrated to show exemplary image sensor package assemblies as well as methods for their construction. Common elements of the illustrated embodiments are designated with like reference numerals for clarity. It should be understood that the figures presented are not meant to be illustrative of actual views of any particular portion of a particular image sensor assembly, but are merely idealized schematic representations which are employed to more clearly and fully depict the invention. It should further be understood that while depicted in terms of image sensors, the package embodiments and methods presented herein would work equally well for housing other types of optically interactive electronic devices as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The formation of image sensor package assemblies according to a first embodiment of the present invention is illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-11</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, an exemplary wafer <b>2</b> of semiconductor material is provided containing a plurality of image sensor chips <b>4</b>. It should be noted that the present invention is applicable to bulk semiconductor substrates other than traditional wafers, and the term &#x201c;wafer&#x201d; as employed herein encompasses such other substrates. The outer edges <b>6</b> of image sensor chips <b>4</b>, schematically depicted by section lines, are defined along streets <b>8</b> of semiconductor material located between adjacent image sensor chips <b>4</b>. Each image sensor chip <b>4</b> includes an active surface <b>10</b> having an image sensitive area <b>12</b> and bond pads <b>14</b>. Image sensitive area <b>12</b> comprises sensing circuitry reactive to light or other forms of radiation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is an enlarged cross section of wafer <b>2</b> taken along line <b>1</b>B-<b>1</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, wafer <b>2</b> has a front side <b>16</b> and an opposing back side <b>18</b>, with bond pads <b>14</b> being peripherally spaced around image sensitive area <b>12</b> on the front side <b>16</b> of wafer <b>2</b>. While bond pads <b>14</b> are depicted in a single row along each of the four sides of image sensitive area <b>12</b>, other arrangements are possible, for example and not by way of limitation, having bond pads <b>14</b> formed along fewer sides or in multiple rows along one or more sides. For certain types of image sensors, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows that image sensitive area <b>12</b> may also comprise microlenses <b>20</b> formed over the sensing circuitry to aid in the reception of light.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4B</figref>, a transparent cover <b>22</b> of a size sufficient to cover the array of image sensor chip active surfaces <b>10</b> is attached to the front side <b>16</b> of wafer <b>2</b> using an adhesive material <b>24</b>. Transparent cover <b>22</b> may be formed of an at least partially optically transparent material such as borosilicate glass (BSG). Other types of glass, quartz or even plastic of suitable material characteristics and which allow the passage of a desired range of wavelengths of light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation may also be used. Furthermore, portions of transparent cover <b>22</b> may be formed to provide an optical function, for example, by shaping its surface at locations corresponding to image sensitive areas <b>12</b> to act as a focusing lens. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows adhesive material <b>24</b> applied to transparent cover <b>22</b> in a pattern that corresponds to the periphery of the image sensitive area <b>12</b> of each image sensor chip <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows that the pattern of adhesive material <b>24</b> may instead, or in addition, be applied directly to the front side <b>16</b> of wafer <b>2</b>. Adhesive material <b>24</b> may be in the form of an epoxy, a silicone, an acrylic or other liquid-type adhesive applied to transparent cover <b>22</b> and/or the front side <b>16</b> of wafer <b>2</b>, or may comprise a double-sided adhesive-coated tape segment or film, such as a polyimide. Alternatively, a two-component resin may be employed, with one component applied in an appropriate pattern to transparent cover <b>22</b> and the other to front side <b>16</b> of wafer <b>2</b> to prevent premature component reaction and adhesion.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, which is a sectional side view of wafer <b>2</b>, shows that when transparent cover <b>22</b> is attached, adhesive material <b>24</b> lies between bond pads <b>14</b> and image sensitive area <b>12</b> of the active surface <b>10</b> of each image sensor chip <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> also shows that in the case where image sensitive area <b>12</b> includes microlenses <b>20</b>, adhesive material <b>24</b> is formed to have a thickness providing a standoff space between microlenses <b>20</b> and transparent cover <b>22</b>. This avoids undesirable refraction or other optical variations that may result from contact between microlenses <b>20</b> and transparent cover <b>22</b>. In some cases, it may be desirable to apply adhesive material <b>24</b> in a pattern that also covers bond pads <b>14</b> in order to provide protection during subsequent processing, as will be described in further detail below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a sectional side view of wafer <b>2</b> with bond pads <b>14</b> covered by adhesive material <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Once transparent cover <b>22</b> has been joined with wafer <b>2</b>, a layer of semiconductor material is removed from the back side <b>18</b> of wafer <b>2</b> using a backgrinding process. Reducing the thickness of wafer <b>2</b> in this manner minimizes the final package size (thickness) and reduces the time and expense associated with cutting wafer <b>2</b> during the subsequent dicing operation. Furthermore, backgrinding removes undesirable contaminants which may have been introduced into the back side of wafer <b>2</b> during fabrication. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic representation of the backgrinding process wherein a grinding wheel <b>26</b> is applied to the back side <b>18</b> of wafer <b>2</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the prior attachment of transparent cover <b>22</b> shields the front side <b>16</b> of wafer <b>2</b>, thereby eliminating the potential for contamination from particles generated during backgrinding that might otherwise be deposited on image sensitive areas <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After backgrinding wafer <b>2</b> to the desired thickness, a dicing operation is carried out to separate image sensor chips <b>4</b> from wafer <b>2</b>. In a first stage of the dicing operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, transparent cover <b>22</b> is cut along the edge of the pattern of adhesive material <b>24</b> surrounding the image sensitive area <b>12</b> of each image sensor chip <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, which is an enlarged cross section of wafer <b>2</b> taken along line <b>6</b>B-<b>6</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, shows that the bond pads <b>14</b> of each image sensor chip <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) are left exposed for receiving electrical connections, while image sensitive area <b>12</b> is sealed by the remaining portion of transparent cover <b>22</b> overlying adhesive material <b>24</b>. Cutting of transparent cover <b>22</b> may be accomplished, by way of example, using a saw blade (not shown) having a width that is equal to the distance <b>28</b> between adjacent edges of adhesive material <b>24</b> surrounding each image sensitive area <b>12</b>. In this manner, the entire portion of transparent cover <b>22</b> between adjacent image sensitive areas <b>12</b> may be removed by a single saw pass along a street <b>8</b>. A narrower saw blade may also be used, with two saw passes being made to expose bond pads <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> show an alternative to the first stage of the dicing operation where adhesive material <b>24</b> has been formed in a pattern covering bond pads <b>14</b>, as previously depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, transparent cover <b>22</b> is cut with a narrow saw blade (not shown) down the middle of street <b>8</b>. An etching process is then carried out to remove the portions of transparent cover <b>22</b> and adhesive material <b>24</b> covering bond pads <b>14</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. Using this alternative process protects bond pads <b>14</b> and prevents the deposition of contaminants while cutting transparent cover <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a second stage of the dicing operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, wafer <b>2</b> is cut along streets <b>8</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) of semiconductor material at the outer edges <b>6</b> of image sensors chips <b>4</b> for complete separation of wafer <b>2</b> into individual image sensor chips <b>4</b>. Any conventional process for cutting wafer <b>2</b> may be used, such as with a dicing saw. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows that each individual image sensor chip <b>4</b> includes an image sensitive area <b>12</b> sealed by a remaining portion of transparent cover <b>22</b>, as well as bond pads <b>14</b> left exposed for later electrical connection.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the next stage of package formation according to the first embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows that each individual image sensor chip <b>4</b> is affixed to an interposer <b>30</b>. Interposer <b>30</b> includes conductive pathways <b>32</b> extending from attachment pads on a first surface <b>36</b> of interposer <b>30</b>, to external connection points <b>38</b> on a second, opposing surface <b>40</b> of interposer <b>30</b>. Image sensor chips <b>4</b> may be adhesively mounted to the first surface <b>36</b> of interposer <b>30</b> with an adhesive element comprising a layer of adhesive <b>42</b> such as an epoxy or by an adhesive-coated tape in a lamination process as known in the art. Wire bonds <b>44</b> are then formed to electrically connect the image sensor chip bond pads <b>14</b> with the attachment pads <b>34</b> of interposer <b>30</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first embodiment of the present invention enables the wire bonding process to be carried out while image sensitive area <b>12</b> is sealed under transparent cover <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows that after the wire bonding process is complete, a layer of encapsulant material <b>46</b> is formed over the first surface <b>36</b> of interposer <b>30</b> to cover wire bonds <b>44</b> and surround the edges of the portion of transparent cover <b>22</b> attached to each image sensor chip <b>4</b>. Encapsulant material <b>46</b> may comprise any conventional compound known for use in encapsulating semiconductor chips that exhibits low moisture uptake and good dimensional stability. Encapsulant material <b>46</b> should also be selected to have a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is compatible with those of interposer <b>30</b> and image sensor chips <b>4</b>. Examples of encapsulant material <b>46</b> contemplated for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, thermoset or thermoplastic curable compounds such as silicon-filled polymers or liquid crystal polymers. The layer of encapsulant material <b>46</b> may be formed on interposer <b>30</b> by known transfer molding, pot molding or injection molding, by liquid dispensing, by photolithographic or stereolithographic deposition processes, or as otherwise known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Discrete conductive elements <b>48</b> such as solder balls are formed on, or attached to the external connection points of interposer <b>30</b> in order to facilitate subsequent attachment to a carrier substrate or other higher-level circuit assembly. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows discrete conductive elements <b>48</b> as comprising solder balls, it should be understood that bumps of conductive or conductor-filled epoxy or even pads comprising one or more layers of metallic plating may be formed on external connection points <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">After forming discrete conductive elements <b>48</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows that interposer <b>30</b> and the layer of encapsulant material <b>46</b> are cut along lines extending between adjacent image sensor chips <b>4</b> to provide individual image sensor package assemblies <b>50</b>. This may be accomplished, for example, by cutting or scribing (followed by snapping image sensor package assemblies <b>50</b> apart along the scribe lines) with a conventional dicing saw. Alternatively, the individual image sensor package assemblies <b>50</b> may be singulated using a laser or other high energy beam.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Image sensor package assemblies <b>50</b> according to a second embodiment of the present invention are formed in a manner similar to that of the first embodiment, except image sensor chips <b>4</b> are not connected to the interposer attachment pads <b>34</b> using wire bonds <b>44</b>. Instead, the image sensor chips <b>4</b> are formed to include back side conductive elements configured for direct connection to attachment pads <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">One variant of the second embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-15</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows that the image sensor chips <b>4</b> include conductive vias <b>52</b> extending from bond pads <b>14</b> on the image sensor chip active surfaces <b>10</b> into the semiconductor material of wafer <b>2</b>. Because bond pads <b>14</b> do not need to be exposed for wire bonding, transparent cover <b>22</b> is joined to the front side <b>16</b> of wafer <b>2</b> by a pattern of adhesive material <b>24</b> that covers bond pads <b>14</b> in the same manner as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> of the first embodiment. This enables adhesive material <b>24</b> to seal the entire active surface <b>10</b> of an image sensor chip <b>4</b> in the area surrounding image sensitive area <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows that vias <b>52</b> are exposed through the back side <b>18</b> of wafer <b>2</b> during the backgrinding process, and back side conductive elements such as bumps <b>54</b> are then formed over vias on the back side <b>18</b> of the wafer <b>2</b>. As with discrete conductive elements <b>48</b>, conductive bumps <b>54</b> may comprise solder, conductive or conductor-filled epoxy, metallic plating, or any other conductive material known for use in forming external conductive elements on semiconductor chips.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, wafer <b>2</b> and transparent cover <b>22</b> are simultaneously cut along streets <b>8</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) at the outer edges <b>6</b> of image sensor chips <b>4</b>. Cutting wafer <b>2</b> and transparent cover <b>22</b> may be carried out in a single pass because bond pads <b>14</b> do not require exposure for wire bonding. Therefore, the portion of transparent cover <b>22</b> remaining on an image sensor chip <b>4</b> after cutting may cover the entire active surface <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows that once cutting is completed, each individual image sensor chip <b>4</b> is affixed to interposer <b>30</b> by bonding conductive bumps <b>54</b> directly to attachment pads <b>34</b>. Formation of the layer of encapsulant material <b>46</b>, addition of discrete conductive elements <b>48</b>, and cutting into individual image sensor package assemblies <b>50</b> may then be carried out in the same manner as described in the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another variant of the second embodiment, image sensor package formation is carried out in the same manner as in the first embodiment up through the dicing operation, described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-8</figref>. According to this variant of the second embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows that after separating the image sensor chips <b>4</b> from wafer <b>2</b>, a redistribution layer (RDL) may be provided on each image sensor chip <b>4</b> in the form of conductive traces <b>56</b> extending from bond pads <b>14</b> to the edge of the active surface <b>10</b> and down to back side <b>18</b>. Conductive traces <b>56</b> of the RDL may be formed with conventional processes such as by depositing a metallic layer onto the surfaces of image sensor chips <b>4</b> by sputtering or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and then masking and etching the metallic layer to form individual traces. Alternatively, conductive traces <b>56</b> may be formed as a TAB-type assembly of preformed traces carried on a polymer film which are bonded to bond pads <b>14</b> and adhesively affixed to an image sensor chip <b>4</b> to extend around sides thereof and down to back side <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows that once conductive traces <b>56</b> are formed, back side conductive elements such as conductive bumps may be formed on conductive traces <b>56</b> and directly connected to the attachment pads <b>34</b> of interposer <b>30</b>, as in the first variant of the second embodiment. Formation of the layer of encapsulant material <b>46</b>, addition of discrete conductive elements <b>48</b>, and cutting into individual image sensor package assemblies <b>50</b> may then be carried out in the same manner as described in the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A third embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>. According to the third embodiment, transparent cover <b>22</b> is not attached to the image sensor chips <b>4</b> at the wafer level. Instead, wafer <b>2</b> is initially diced into individual image sensor chips <b>4</b>, and image sensor chips <b>4</b> are affixed to interposer <b>30</b> with adhesive layer <b>42</b> in an uncovered condition, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Wire bonds <b>44</b> are then formed to electrically connect the image sensor chip bond pads <b>14</b> with the attachment pads <b>34</b> of interposer <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows that individual transparent covers <b>22</b>&#x2032; are subsequently attached to each of the image sensor chips <b>4</b> with adhesive material <b>24</b>. Because wire bonds <b>44</b> are formed prior to attaching individual transparent covers <b>22</b>&#x2032;, adhesive material <b>24</b> may be placed directly over the attachment point of wire bonds <b>44</b> and bond pads <b>14</b>, thereby sealing the entire active surface <b>10</b> of an image sensor chip <b>4</b> in the area surrounding image sensitive area <b>12</b>. This arrangement also allows individual transparent covers <b>22</b>&#x2032; to cover the entirety of active surface <b>10</b>, which provides protection during subsequent processing. Formation of the layer of encapsulant material <b>46</b>, addition of discrete conductive elements <b>48</b>, and cutting into individual image sensor package assemblies <b>50</b> may then be carried out in the same manner as described in the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a fourth embodiment of the present invention, image sensor package assemblies are formed by mounting individual image sensor chips within the cavity of a preformed semiconductor package housing such as a leadless chip carrier (LCC). This enables a completed image sensor package assembly, according to the present invention, to be attached to a carrier substrate or other higher-level circuit assembly at an attachment location configured with a standard package footprint. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows an exemplary preformed package housing comprising a LCC <b>58</b> for use with image sensor package assemblies according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. LCC <b>58</b> includes a body <b>60</b> of ceramic, plastic, or other conventional LCC package materials, and a chip cavity <b>62</b>. Conductive pathways <b>64</b> extend from attachment pads <b>66</b> within chip cavity <b>60</b> to solder pads <b>68</b> formed about the exterior perimeter of body <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one variant of the fourth embodiment, individual image sensor chips <b>4</b> having transparent covers <b>22</b> or <b>22</b>&#x2032; are formed and affixed to interposer <b>30</b> as in the first through third embodiments. Discrete conductive elements <b>48</b> are likewise added to the external connection points <b>38</b> of interposer <b>30</b>. Rather than forming a layer of encapsulant material <b>46</b> on interposer <b>30</b>, as in the first through third embodiments, interposer <b>30</b> is singulated to form a packaging subassembly, which is mounted within chip cavity <b>62</b> of LCC <b>58</b> by bonding discrete conductive elements <b>48</b> to attachment pads <b>66</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-21C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> shows a packaging subassembly <b>70</b> mounted within chip cavity <b>62</b>, wherein image sensor chip <b>4</b> and transparent cover <b>22</b> have been formed and affixed to interposer <b>30</b> as in the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref> shows a packaging subassembly <b>72</b> mounted within chip cavity <b>62</b>, wherein image sensor chip <b>4</b> and transparent cover <b>22</b> have been formed and affixed to interposer <b>30</b> as in the second embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref> shows a packaging subassembly <b>74</b> mounted within chip cavity <b>62</b>, wherein image sensor chip <b>4</b> and individual transparent cover <b>22</b>&#x2032; have been formed and affixed to interposer <b>30</b> as in the third embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-21C</figref> show that to complete the image sensor chip package assembly <b>50</b>, chip cavity <b>62</b> is then filled with a liquid sealant <b>76</b> that covers the packaging subassemblies <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, or <b>74</b> and surrounds the edges of the transparent covers <b>22</b> or <b>22</b>&#x2032; attached to each image sensor chip <b>4</b>. Liquid sealant <b>76</b> may be a curable polymer compound, such as an epoxy, resin or molding compound, or any other liquid sealant material known for use in sealing semiconductor packaging.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Another variant of the fourth embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-22C</figref>. Under this approach, individual image sensor chips <b>4</b> are formed with transparent covers <b>22</b> or <b>22</b>&#x2032; as in the first through third embodiments, but are not affixed to interposer <b>30</b>.
