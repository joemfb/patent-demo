<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Allocations for access in a wireless system may be tiled onto a subframe having a first dimension and a second dimension. In an exemplary embodiment, allocations are distributed along the first dimension while the second dimension is locked, and the allocations are distributed along the second dimension while the first dimension is locked. In another exemplary embodiment, allocations are striped by extending a length of a first allocation along the first dimension and by expanding a breadth of the first allocation along the second dimension responsive to a size of the first allocation and by extending a length of a second allocation along the second dimension and expanding a breadth of the second allocation along the first dimension responsive to a size of the second allocation. In yet another exemplary embodiment, multiple allocations are placed proximately to an allocation placement target and allocation-free areas are produced on a subframe.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Wireless communication is extraordinarily prevalent in today's society. People use cordless phones, cellular phones, wireless data communication devices, etc. on a daily basis. The ability to communicate wirelessly has become pervasive in homes, businesses, retail establishments, and in the outdoors generally. Consequently, people can now communicate while in transit and in almost any environment.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless communication involves the use of a limited resource: the electromagnetic spectrum. Different wireless communication schemes involve using different bands or segments of the electromagnetic spectrum in different manners. Typically, each particular segment of the electromagnetic spectrum is utilized in accordance with a wireless standard that has been created by a government entity and/or an industry consortium.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are many wireless standards under which wireless devices operate today. Example wireless standards include, but are not limited to, Bluetooth, Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)-2000, Wideband-CDMA (WCDMA), Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and so forth. Wireless standards that have a marketing-oriented name typically also have a corresponding more technical name for the standard. For example, the term &#x201c;Wi-Fi&#x201d; is usually considered to correspond to at least the IEEE 802.11 (a), (b), and (g) standards. Similarly, the term &#x201c;WiMAX&#x201d; is usually considered to correspond to at least a subset of the IEEE 802.16 standard.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because the electromagnetic spectrum is a finite resource, multiple users share the available frequencies in an effectively simultaneous manner. This sharing is managed so as to reduce the interference that jeopardizes electromagnetic communications. Two mechanisms to share the electromagnetic spectrum are to separate users geographically or to separate them temporally. Multiple users may also be separated into different frequencies, different time segments, or into different codes that are spread over a relatively wide band of frequencies. These and other separation or sharing mechanisms may also be combined and simultaneously utilized in a single system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Creating and enforcing the separation and sharing mechanisms usually involve some level of planning and scheduling. Planning and scheduling can therefore relate to geographical, coding, temporal, and/or frequency mechanisms for separating usage of the electromagnetic spectrum in a manner that effectively manages interference between and among users.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to facilitate the sharing of the electromagnetic spectrum in accordance with a user separation mechanism, some entity typically provides planning and/or scheduling so that the selected separation mechanism or mechanisms may be adopted simultaneously by multiple users. When the planning and scheduling is performed by a centralized entity, the planning and scheduling decisions are typically provided wirelessly to the multiple users over the air interface. Unfortunately, existing approaches to planning and scheduling can often result in a disproportionate allocation of spectrum and/or time access among the multiple users and/or an inefficient utilization of the finite electromagnetic spectrum. Existing approaches may also fail to adequately address interference issues.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, allocations may be tiled onto a subframe having a first dimension and a second dimension. Allocations are distributed along the first dimension while the second dimension is locked, and the allocations are distributed along the second dimension while the first dimension is locked.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, allocations are striped by extending a length of a first allocation along the first dimension and by expanding a breadth of the first allocation along the second dimension responsive to a size of the first allocation and by extending a length of a second allocation along the second dimension and expanding a breadth of the second allocation along the first dimension responsive to a size of the second allocation.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present disclosure is directed to the methods, devices, systems, media, etc. for fairly and efficiently providing allocations of wireless access among multiple users in a wireless system, and the efficient distribution of such allocations within communication subframes of the system. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;allocations&#x201d; and &#x201c;bandwidth allocations&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to an allocation of access to a wireless link in the wireless system, wherein the allocation has both time and frequency dimensions and is also referred to herein as one or more &#x201c;slots.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">This &#x201c;DETAILED DESCRIPTION&#x201d; of exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure is divided into five sections. A first section references <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> and is entitled &#x201c;Example Environments&#x201d;.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example Environments</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The descriptions in this &#x201c;Example Environments&#x201d; section, as well as the referenced drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, are examples only. These described environments are only example environments in which described inventive implementations may be realized and/or practiced. Hence, the inventive implementations as described herein below in other sections may also be realized and/or practiced in other environments.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is block diagram of an example wireless environment <b>100</b> having multiple wireless devices <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> and multiple communication links <b>106</b>. As illustrated, wireless environment <b>100</b> includes a base station <b>102</b>, a network <b>108</b>, &#x201c;n&#x201d; subscriber stations <b>104</b>, and &#x201c;m&#x201d; communication links <b>106</b>, with &#x201c;n&#x201d; and &#x201c;m&#x201d; being the same or different integers. Although a single communication link <b>106</b> is explicitly shown as being associated with each subscriber station <b>104</b>, each subscriber station <b>104</b> may be simultaneously participating in multiple communication links <b>106</b>, including possibly with other subscriber stations <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Wireless communications environment <b>100</b> is representative generally of many different types of wireless communications environments, including but not limited to those pertaining to wireless local area network (wireless LAN) technology (e.g., Wi-Fi or WiMAX systems), wireless wide area network (wireless WAN) technology (e.g., WiMAX systems), ad hoc wireless network technology (e.g., Wi-Fi or Bluetooth systems), cellular technology (including so-called personal communication services (PCS)), trunking technology, hybrid or multi-use technology (e.g., WiMAX systems), and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In wireless communications environment <b>100</b>, base station <b>102</b> is in wireless communication with subscriber stations <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>) . . . <b>104</b>(<i>n</i>) via wireless communications or communication links <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>106</b>(<b>2</b>) . . . <b>106</b>(<i>m</i>), respectively. Although implementations may vary, base station <b>102</b> is typically fixed, and subscriber stations <b>104</b> are either mobile or stationary. Although wireless communications environment <b>100</b> shows base station <b>102</b> communicating to &#x201c;n&#x201d; subscriber stations <b>104</b> in one general direction, base station <b>102</b> may actually be communicating with any number of subscriber stations <b>104</b> in any number of directions, including by sectors or omni-directionally.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As illustrated, base station <b>102</b> is capable of accessing a network <b>108</b>. Network(s) <b>108</b> may be one or more of a wired network, another wireless network, a combination thereof, and so forth. Access to network <b>108</b> enables base station <b>102</b> to forward data from subscriber stations <b>104</b> to external network locations, and vice versa. Examples of network <b>108</b> include, by way of example but not imitation, the internet, a landline telephone network, another wireless network, wired nodes of the overall network of base station <b>102</b>, LANs and WANs, etc. that are operating in accordance with any given standard.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Base station <b>102</b> may be, for example, a nexus point, a trunking radio, a switch or router, an access point, a traditional cellular base station, some combination and/or derivative thereof, and so forth. Subscriber stations <b>104</b> may be, for example, a hand-held device; a server, client, personal, desktop, and/or laptop computer; a wireless expansion card, module, adapter, or similar apparatus that is coupled to a computer; a storage device; a set-top box, television, or other entertainment device; a personal digital assistant (PDA); a mobile phone or other mobile appliance; a vehicle having a wireless communication device; a tablet or hand/palm-sized computer; a wireless router; a node of a wireless mesh network; a portable inventory-related scanning device; any device capable of processing generally; some combination thereof; and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Base station <b>102</b> may interact with subscriber stations <b>104</b> in accordance with any individual or combined standardized and/or specialized air interface technologies. Example air interface technologies include, by way of example but not limitation, the IEEE 802.11 standard, the IEEE 802.16 standard, various cellular phone standards, some combination or derivative thereof, or any other such technology. However, where air interface specifics are applicable, certain description examples herein below focus on the IEEE 802.16 standard and/or on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technology and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) schemes. Nevertheless, the performance of example data downlink operations (e.g., fairness-based algorithmic scheduling, bandwidth allocation tiling, etc.) as described herein below is applicable to at least those communication environments generally in which a centralized entity is responsible for the planning and/or scheduling of transmissions across the air interface.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of an example channel <b>200</b> for one or more communication links <b>106</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). An axis <b>204</b> indicates that time (t) elapses along the abscissa axis and that frequencies (f) range along the ordinate axis. Channel <b>200</b> includes at least one subchannel <b>202</b>. As illustrated, channel <b>200</b> includes &#x201c;s&#x201d; subchannels <b>202</b>, with &#x201c;s&#x201d; being some integer. More specifically, channel <b>200</b> includes subchannel #<b>1</b> <b>202</b>(<b>1</b>), subchannel #<b>2</b> <b>202</b>(<b>2</b>), subchannel #<b>3</b> <b>202</b>(<b>3</b>) . . . subchannel #s <b>202</b>(<i>s</i>). Subchannels <b>202</b> may correspond to communication links <b>106</b>. Alternatively, a single subchannel <b>202</b> may carry multiple communication links <b>106</b>, or a single communication link <b>106</b> may consume multiple subchannels <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Typically, a channel <b>200</b> is a radio frequency (RF) channel. More specifically, a channel is usually defined by the carrier center frequency and channel bandwidth. With frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, channels are often divided into downlink (DL) subchannel(s) and uplink (UL) subchannel(s) because the rules for both their construction and their use are often different. Furthermore, the DL and UL subchannels are transmitted from separate sources. At times, an individual &#x201c;channel&#x201d; or &#x201c;subchannel&#x201d; may be a specific frequency and time allocation within an overall &#x201c;RF channel&#x201d;. The subchannel may be intended or even reserved for a specific purpose, such as for channel access requests. With time division duplex (TDD) systems, each frequency channel usually carries DL subframes and UL subframes at different times. Example FDD and TDD implementations having DL and UL subframes at a given frequency or frequencies are described further herein below with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an OFDMA implementation, for example, each RF channel is formed of a number of subcarriers, with the number being dependant upon the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) size. For instance, a 1024 point FFT results in 1024 subcarriers. In accordance with OFDMA principles, a subchannel is a group of subcarriers that are not necessarily adjacent but are within the same RF channel. The member subcarriers for a given subchannel are well defined. Which groupings of subcarriers are permitted to form subchannels is a function of the channel utilization mapping permutation being used in that zone (in time) of a particular subframe.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of two example channel utilization mapping permutations <b>300</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>300</b>(<b>2</b>), with the mappings being between subchannels and subcarriers. Mapping permutations are different ways of grouping subcarriers into subchannels. Each mapping permutation <b>300</b> is directed to a hypothetical example RF channel having 12 subcarriers and 4 subchannels. Each subchannel #<b>1</b>, #<b>2</b>, #<b>3</b> and #<b>4</b> comprises 3 subcarriers A, B, and C. As indicated by the vertical frequency axes, the 12 subcarrier frequencies range from #<b>1</b> at the top to #<b>12</b> at the bottom of each channel mapping permutation <b>300</b>. In practice, a given channel may include different numbers of subchannels, subcarriers, and/or subcarriers per subchannel than those used for this example.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">There are two primary kinds of subchannel-to-subcarrier mapping permutations: distributed and adjacent. Generally, distributed mapping permutations perform well in mobile environments, and adjacent mapping permutations are usable for fixed or lower mobility environments. These two kinds of mapping permutations enable a tradeoff between mobility and throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Mapping permutation <b>300</b>(<b>1</b>) is directed to Advanced Modulation and Coding (AMC). An AMC mapping permutation uses adjacent subcarriers to form subchannels. AMC enables a subscriber station to communicate on those subcarrier frequencies that currently have relatively less interference. AMC is therefore often better for slowly changing and relatively stable wireless environments (e.g., which often involve stationary subscriber stations).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As illustrated in the top three subcarriers of AMC permutation <b>300</b>(<b>1</b>), subchannel #<b>1</b> <b>202</b>(<b>1</b>) is formed from three adjacent subcarriers: subcarrier #<b>1</b>-A, subcarrier #<b>1</b>-B, and subcarrier #<b>1</b>-C. These three subcarriers are adjacent in the frequency band of the RF channel. Although not separately identified, each of subchannel #<b>2</b>, #<b>3</b>, and #<b>4</b> is likewise formed from three adjacent subcarriers. Hence, subchannel #<b>2</b> is formed from subcarrier #<b>2</b>-A, subcarrier #<b>2</b>-B, and subcarrier #<b>2</b>-C. Subchannel #<b>3</b> is formed from subcarrier #<b>3</b>-A, subcarrier #<b>3</b>-B, and subcarrier #<b>3</b>-C. Subchannel #<b>4</b> is formed from subcarrier #<b>4</b>-A, subcarrier #<b>4</b>-B, and subcarrier #<b>4</b>-C.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Mapping permutation <b>300</b>(<b>2</b>) is directed to Partial Usage of SubChannels (PUSC). A PUSC mapping permutation uses distributed subcarriers to form subchannels. PUSC enables interference to be relatively evenly distributed across the subchannels and thus across communicating subscriber stations. PUSC is therefore often better for wireless environments in which the communication conditions are rapidly changing (e.g., which usually includes highly mobile environments).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">PUSC can also enable different sectors of the same or adjacent base stations to have lower interference and greater handover flexibility. Although not a requirement, the subcarriers are typically divided into three groups in such a way that each group has some subcarriers for data and some for pilots. This allows the three sectors to operate independently. However, because they are all from the same RF channel, it allows a subscriber station to more easily hear transmissions from adjacent sectors, which aids in handovers. PUSC is sometimes credited with enabling a reuse ratio of one, but aside from the handover benefits, it may be argued that it simply allows a subdividing of the overall RF channel into smaller RF channels.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated by the indicated three subcarriers for subchannel #<b>1</b> <b>202</b>(<b>1</b>) in mapping permutation <b>300</b>(<b>2</b>), subchannel #<b>1</b> <b>202</b>(<b>1</b>) is formed from three distributed subcarriers: subcarrier #<b>1</b>-A, subcarrier #<b>1</b>-B, and subcarrier #<b>1</b>-C. Although not separately identified, each of subchannel #<b>2</b>, #<b>3</b>, and #<b>4</b> is likewise formed from three distributed subcarriers. Hence, subchannel #<b>2</b> is formed from subcarrier #<b>2</b>-A, subcarrier #<b>2</b>-B, and subcarrier #<b>2</b>-C. Subchannel #<b>3</b> is formed from subcarrier #<b>3</b>-A, subcarrier #<b>3</b>-B, and subcarrier #<b>3</b>-C. Subchannel #<b>4</b> is formed from subcarrier #<b>4</b>-A, subcarrier #<b>4</b>-B, and subcarrier #<b>4</b>-C.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Although PUSC mapping permutation <b>300</b>(<b>2</b>) is illustrated with subcarriers that are evenly distributed, PUSC mapping permutations may be formed from non-evenly-distributed (e.g., randomly-distributed) subcarriers. Also, there are other mapping permutations besides AMC and PUSC. For example, a mapping permutation may adopt the Full Usage of SubChannels (FUSC) approach (which is described in, e.g., IEEE 802.16) or any other approach.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are block diagrams of example TDD and FDD frame formats, respectively, for transmission on a channel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a block diagram of an example time division duplex (TDD) frame format <b>400</b>A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a block diagram of an example frequency division duplex (FDD) frame format <b>400</b>B. Frame formats <b>400</b>A and <b>400</b>B include downlink (DL) subframes <b>404</b> and uplink (UL) subframes <b>408</b>. Each block diagram also includes an axis <b>412</b> or <b>418</b> showing time (t) increasing rightward along the abscissa axis and frequency (f) increasing upward along the ordinate axis. The different frame portions are not necessarily illustrated to scale.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Frames subdivide transmission and reception times to provide temporal order to wireless communications. In general, different time periods separate DL and UL transmissions in TDD implementations. Different frequencies, on the other hand, separate DL and UL transmissions in FDD. However, there may also be a time component to FDD because individual DL and UL channels may also be internally separated temporally by subframes.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, TDD frame format <b>400</b>A includes a preamble <b>402</b>, a DL subframe N <b>404</b>, a DL/UL gap <b>406</b>, an UL subframe N <b>408</b>, and an UL/DL gap <b>410</b>. Implementations as described herein, however, need not include all of these example frame format parts. After UL/DL gap <b>410</b>, another TDD frame <b>400</b>A may be started with another preamble <b>402</b> followed by a DL subframe N+1 <b>404</b>(+1) (not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), another DL/UL gap <b>406</b>, an UL subframe N+1 <b>408</b>(+1) (not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), and so forth. In this manner, each frequency repeats DL subframes <b>404</b> and UL subframes <b>408</b> as TDD frames <b>400</b>A are repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, FDD frame format <b>400</b>B includes two different frequencies f<sub>1 </sub>and f<sub>2</sub>. One frequency, the DL subchannel f<sub>1</sub>, includes multiple DL subframes <b>404</b>. Another frequency, the UL subchannel f<sub>2</sub>, includes multiple UL subframes <b>408</b>. More specifically, the DL subchannel f<sub>1 </sub>includes a preamble <b>402</b>, a DL subframe N <b>404</b>, another preamble <b>402</b>, a DL subframe N+1 <b>404</b>(+1), and so forth. The UL subchannel f<sub>2 </sub>includes an UL subframe N <b>408</b>, an UL subframe N+1 <b>408</b>(+1), and so forth. The DL subchannel f<sub>1 </sub>and the UL subchannel f<sub>2 </sub>may have different start times for their subframes in accordance with optional time offset <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Thus, a number of different frame portions are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. These frame portions include, for example, preambles <b>402</b>, DL subframes <b>404</b>, UL subframes <b>408</b>, and so forth. These frame portions may be different lengths, may have different content, may follow different rules, and so forth. In practice, frame durations may change and/or the DL and UL ratio may be changed, including possibly dynamically. Additionally, the DL and UL ratios may be changed dynamically and/or by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Depending on perspective, the frame may be considered a Medium Access Control (MAC) concept or a physical (PHY) layer concept. Regardless, the concept originated from two primary sources or perspectives. First, from the PHY perspective, in non-continuous physical layers (e.g., in Time Division Duplexing (TDD) implementations, in most reasonable implementations of the PHY layers in IEEE 802.16, etc.), the frame is a structure that breaks time up into pieces to facilitate ease of synchronization of the subscriber station with the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, a typical &#x201c;TDD frame&#x201d; (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) has the following structure: a frame start preamble, a DL subframe, a DL/UL gap, an UL subframe, and an UL/DL gap. The time between frame start preambles is typically fixed. Usually, the position and duration of the gaps is also fixed; however, the availability of data for transmission can make them appear to vary in length. Within the DL or UL subframes, other dynamic variability can occur to take advantage of special capabilities of individual subscriber stations.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Second, from the MAC perspective, a frame is the time interval over which scheduling occurs. In a system with a framed PHY layer, this MAC frame concept usually maps directly to the PHY frame. Because the MAC layer is controlling (i) who transmits or receives and (ii) when such transmissions and receptions are to occur, the MAC layer directs a number of items. For example, the MAC layer directs the use of some PHY layer features (e.g., a burst profile such as the modulation/Forward Error Correction (FEC)), the use of subchannelization, the use of zone switches (e.g., for mapping permutation changes and special features such as Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO)), and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram <b>500</b> of an example DL subframe <b>404</b> that includes a slot <b>510</b>. As illustrated, DL subframe <b>404</b> is a rectangular block that may be defined by two dimensions: time <b>502</b> and frequency <b>504</b>. Time <b>502</b> extends along the horizontal direction and frequency <b>504</b> extends along the vertical direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, these dimensions may be exchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, frequencies <b>504</b> are divided into or mapped to subchannels <b>202</b>. Similarly, time <b>502</b> is divided into symbols. Symbols are transmitted over the air interface in accordance with a given coding rate. Symbols are described further herein below. Subchannels <b>202</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are grouped into subchannel groups <b>508</b> along the axis of frequencies <b>504</b>. Symbols are grouped into symbol groups <b>506</b> along the axis of time <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">DL subframe <b>404</b> is comprised of multiple slots <b>510</b>, but only a single slot is explicitly illustrated for the sake of clarity. Each slot <b>510</b> may have the following dimensions: one symbol group <b>506</b> by one subchannel group <b>508</b>. Each symbol group <b>506</b> includes &#x201c;m&#x201d; symbols, with &#x201c;m&#x201d; being some integer. Each subchannel group <b>508</b> includes &#x201c;n&#x201d; subchannels, with &#x201c;n&#x201d; being some integer.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Generally, the term &#x201c;symbol&#x201d; has two different, relatively-common meanings, including within IEEE 802.16. There are OFDM symbols and coding rate symbols (e.g., Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)). OFDM symbols are the basic &#x201c;packets&#x201d; at the PHY layer that are used for transmission of data, and they may have multiple modulations and coding rates. OFDM symbols represent a unit of time spread across all subcarriers of a given RF channel. They can have a built-in redundancy that makes them tolerant to mobility and multipath fading. In IEEE 802.16 for example, they usually map directly onto FEC blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">From the MAC point of view, on the other hand, different subchannels can cause different subcarriers of an OFDM symbol to be used in different ways, including having a different QAM modulation. QAM symbols are the data bits that can be deduced from (or cause) a phase and amplitude sampling of the RF carrier. When using QAM-X modulation, there are X possibilities of phase and amplitude allowing log<sub>2</sub>(X) number of bits per sample. For example, a QPSK (QAM-4) symbol represents 2 data bits and a QAM-64 symbol represents 6 data bits. The modulation or type of QAM symbol that is used determines the data carrying capacity of the OFDM symbols. Hence, both OFDM symbols and coding rate QAM symbols are relevant to scheduling.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Hence, a slot (e.g., a slot <b>510</b>) may be a unit of allocation defined by a number of subchannels (e.g., a subchannel group <b>508</b>) and by a number of OFDM symbols (e.g., a symbol group <b>506</b>). The slot definition may be a function of both the mapping permutation and whether the allocation is in the DL or the UL. For IEEE 802.16, the number of subchannels &#x201c;n&#x201d; per subchannel group <b>508</b> is one, and the number of OFDM symbols &#x201c;m&#x201d; per symbol group <b>506</b> is either two (for FUSC and PUSC) or three (for the AMC). These values for &#x201c;m&#x201d; and &#x201c;n&#x201d; may also vary in dependence on whether a given subframe is for the UL or the DL. Generally, a symbol group <b>506</b> may have any number of OFDM symbols, and a subchannel group <b>508</b> may have any number of subchannels, depending on the context.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram of an example data downlink portion <b>600</b> of a wireless communication from a base station <b>102</b> to multiple subscriber stations <b>104</b>. Base station <b>102</b> is engaged in respective communications <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>,<b>3</b>) with respective subscriber stations <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>,<b>3</b>). Subscriber station <b>104</b>(<b>3</b>) is engaged in two communications <b>106</b>(<b>3</b>-A) and <b>106</b>(<b>3</b>-B). Although shown with three subscriber stations <b>104</b> and one-to-two communications <b>106</b> per subscriber station <b>104</b>, there may be more or fewer than three subscriber stations <b>104</b> overall and more than two communications <b>106</b> with any given single subscriber station <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Each communication <b>106</b> corresponds to a connection <b>602</b> that is maintained at base station <b>102</b>.

Each connection <b>602</b> has a corresponding queue <b>604</b> that may include some amount or level of data <b>606</b>. Each connection <b>602</b> may also be associated with a connection identifier (CID). Base station <b>102</b> is responsible for transmitting some amount of data <b>606</b> to subscriber stations <b>104</b> each DL subframe <b>404</b>. The amount of transmitted data, which may be none for some subscriber stations in some subframes, may be dependent on the available bandwidth, on the channel quality, on the priority of the data and/or the subscriber station, on the existence of data, on obligations to deliver a certain amount of bandwidth, on some selected measure of fairness and/or efficiency, on some combination thereof, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram <b>700</b> that illustrates an example method for a data downlink portion of a wireless communication. Flow diagram <b>700</b> includes four (4) blocks <b>702</b>-<b>708</b>. Although the actions of flow diagram <b>700</b> may be performed in other environments and with a variety of hardware, firmware, and/or software combinations, the environments and components otherwise described herein and/or illustrated in the referenced figures are used to illuminate example implementations of the method. From the perspective of a base station <b>102</b>, a data downlink portion for wireless communication can be divided into four major phases as represented by the four blocks <b>702</b>-<b>708</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">At block <b>702</b>, downlink transmission of data is scheduled. For example, which queues <b>604</b> are to have how much of their data <b>606</b> transmitted in the current DL subframe <b>404</b> may be ascertained. In other words, area allocations of DL subframe <b>404</b> for individual connections <b>602</b> may be ascertained. Additional descriptions of downlink data scheduling are provided herein below with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> generally and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref> specifically.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">At block <b>704</b>, the downlink tiling is determined. For example, how the ascertained area allocations are to be fitted into the available bandwidth area of DL subframe <b>404</b> may be determined. Each tile may include multiple slots <b>510</b>. More specifically, a tile is a group of contiguous slots <b>510</b> in either the DL or the UL. Within any single tile, slots <b>510</b> have the same coding and modulation attributes. Additional descriptions of downlink tiling are provided herein below with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> generally and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-19</figref> (for distributive tiling) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-31</figref> (for striping tiling) specifically.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">At block <b>706</b>, protocol data units (PDUs) are dequeued to downlink tiles of the DL subframe. For example, PDUs of data <b>606</b> may be dequeued from queues <b>604</b> and applied to slots <b>510</b> of DL tiles in accordance with the determined DL tiling and the ascertained area allocations.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Generally, a layer X of the OSI protocol model receives service data units (SDUs) from layer X+1 (i.e., the layer above layer X). Layer X then sends PDUs to layer X&#x2212;1 (i.e., the layer below layer X). With reference to the example system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, SDUs are queued by the system into a queue <b>604</b>. The PDU is the (e.g., IEEE 802.16 MAC) data unit that is de-queued from queue <b>604</b>. Each PDU may be a fragment of an SDU or may contain several SDUs packed together.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At block <b>708</b>, the DL subframe is transmitted to subscriber stations. For example, a fully or partially filled DL subframe <b>404</b> may be transmitted from base station <b>102</b> to subscriber stations <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a circular diagram <b>800</b> illustrating example algorithms for scheduling the downlink transmission of data. Diagram <b>800</b> includes multiple example scheduling algorithms: max-min fairness <b>802</b>, maximum throughput fairness <b>804</b>, proportional fairness <b>806</b>, weighted fair queuing (WFQ) <b>808</b>, weighted proportional fairness <b>810</b>, strict priority <b>812</b>, round robin <b>814</b>, and so forth. As indicated by the ellipses (&#x201c; . . . &#x201d;), there are other scheduling algorithms that may be adopted in order to determine allocations.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Each scheduling algorithm produces as its output an allocation for each connection <b>602</b>. This allocation is usually in terms of bytes. The allocation in bytes is then converted to a number of slots based on the coding and modulation of the connection. The number of slots may be termed an area allocation. Each connection <b>602</b> is thus ultimately scheduled an area allocation.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">With regard to max-min fairness <b>802</b>, the max-min notion of fairness is among the more popular notions. It is based on the following premises: (a) no entity should receive an allocation larger than its demand; and (b) increasing the allocation of any entity should not result in the decrease of the allocation of another entity that received an equal or smaller allocation. The name derives from the concept of maximum allocation with minimum impact.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">With regard to maximum throughput fairness <b>804</b>, the notion reflects a desire to be most fair by maximizing total throughput of the medium, which is typically a wireless medium. To maximize use of the wireless medium, bandwidth in the medium may be allocated to users with the highest current data rates. Unfortunately, the low data rate users can be starved with this approach. A max throughput scheduler can, however, achieve maximum channel throughput and utilization.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">With regard to proportional fairness <b>806</b>, it reflects a desire to find a compromise between max-min fairness and maximum throughput fairness. A proportional fairness policy attempts to achieve two goals simultaneously: (a) optimization of the throughput by taking into account the achievable data rate in each instance (which is dependent on the channel condition); and (b) maintenance of fairness by keeping track of the achieved historical data rate. In equation form, goal (a) is reflected in the numerator, and goal (b) is reflected in the denominator.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Proportional fairness <b>806</b> is relatively simple to implement. It involves the sorting of connections in ascending order of the proportional fairness (PF) ratio. The PF ratio of connection i is given by:</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">With regard to WFQ <b>808</b>, it is a packet scheduling technique allowing guaranteed bandwidth services. A purpose of WFQ is to let several sessions share the same link. In WFQ <b>808</b>, each session has a separate First In-First Out (FIFO) queue. At any given time, the N active sessions (e.g., the ones with non-empty queues) are serviced simultaneously (e.g., once per frame). WFQ <b>808</b> allows respective sessions to have different respective guaranteed bandwidths provided to each of them.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In a described implementation with regard to weighted proportional fairness <b>810</b>, it may be considered a hybrid scheduling algorithm (i) that weights allocations based on demand and credits and (ii) that shares excess bandwidth proportionally. Hence, both a committed information rate (CIR) and an excess information rate (EIR) may be tracked and factored into the fairness scheduling decisions.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In a sense, weighted proportional fairness scheduling algorithm <b>810</b> may be characterized as being related to WFQ. It is like WFQ because it uses weights, potentially a different weight for each user, to allocate access to the medium. These weights may be calculated based on demand and credit. Credits may be calculated based on a Token Bucket Rate Algorithm (TBRA), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">There are two types of credit calculations: committed rate as represented by the CIR and excess rate as represented by the EIR. The CIR is allocated first. Usually, there is sufficient capacity to allocate the CIR to all users. This tends to be ensured by the admission control policy. However, there is a finite probability that the sum of the CIRs of all users is greater than the available channel resources. This condition is called over-subscription or overbooking. In over-subscription cases, the scheduler reduces the rate of each user proportionally to the level of over-subscription. For instance, if the over-subscription level is 10%, then all users (or at least all users of a given class level) experience a 10% reduction in allocated bandwidth in comparison to their CIR.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">With weighted proportional fairness <b>810</b>, the excess bandwidth is shared. The excess bandwidth is the leftover channel capacity after the demands for CIRs for all users have been satisfied. The excess bandwidth is shared proportionally to the respective EIR of each respective user. An implementation of weighted proportional fairness <b>810</b> is described further herein below in the third section that is entitled &#x201c;example Implementations for Scheduling Algorithms&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">With regard to strict priority <b>812</b>, the highest priority queues are served first, and the lower priority queues are served after the higher priority queues have been fully satisfied. With regard to round robin <b>814</b>, each queue is served once in turn.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Regardless of what scheduling algorithm is implemented, the output of a scheduling phase of a downlink portion of a wireless communication may be considered a bandwidth allocation. In terms of a DL subframe <b>404</b>, each bandwidth allocation translates to a number of slots that have been allocated to a given connection, which equates to an area of a DL subframe that has been allocated. However, the dimensions of each area allocation and the location within DL subframe <b>404</b> have yet to be determined. The dimensions and locations of area allocations are determined in a tiling phase. The tiling phase of a downlink portion of a wireless communication is introduced below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>

Hence, data allocations <b>902</b> may result from, for example, a weighted proportional fairness algorithm <b>810</b> as described further herein below with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>. Because data allocations <b>902</b> may be interpreted as areas that are to occupy part of DL subframe <b>404</b>, they are also referred to as allocation areas <b>902</b>. Because the bandwidth areas of allocation areas <b>902</b> are known, but their dimensions are flexible, allocation areas <b>902</b> are generically represented as circles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In order to tile allocation areas <b>902</b> in DL subframe <b>404</b>, two determinations are effected: a dimension determination <b>904</b> and a placement determination <b>906</b>. Although these two determinations are illustrated separately, they may be effected fully, partially, and/or substantially simultaneously. Jointly, dimension determination <b>904</b> and placement determination <b>906</b> comprise bandwidth allocation tiling <b>908</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">With dimension determination <b>904</b>, a height and width (or, more generally, a length and breadth) of each of allocation areas <b>902</b> is determined. This dimensioning is represented by the rectangles of determine dimensions <b>904</b>. The area that is allocated by the selected scheduling algorithm is maintained as the dimensions are determined. With placement determination <b>906</b>, the dimensioned allocations are placed within DL subframe <b>404</b> as tiles <b>910</b>. With the dimensioning (<b>904</b>) and placement (<b>906</b>) of the allocated areas <b>902</b>, the bandwidth allocations are tiled <b>910</b> into DL subframe <b>404</b> by bandwidth allocation tiling <b>908</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Bandwidth allocation tiling <b>908</b> is usually performed under one or more constraints. For example, there is a finite amount of time to make both the dimensioning and the placement determinations each frame. Also, the fewer the holes, or places of DL subframe <b>404</b> to which no data is tiled, the more efficient the utilization of the limited electromagnetic medium is generally considered to be. Other constraints can also impact or be used to tailor the bandwidth allocation tiling <b>908</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram of a two-stage per-connection scheduling scheme <b>1000</b>. Scheduling scheme <b>1000</b> may be used to implement a weighted proportional fairness scheduling algorithm. As illustrated, scheduling scheme <b>1000</b> includes a scheduler <b>1002</b>, an output buffer <b>1004</b>, a connection stage <b>1006</b>, and a class stage <b>1008</b>. Scheduler <b>1002</b> receives three inputs: system configuration, demands, and channel conditions. Scheduler <b>1002</b> provides two outputs: connection weights and class weights.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Connection stage <b>1006</b> pertains to scheduling for different connections <b>602</b>. Class stage <b>1008</b> pertains to scheduling for different classes <b>1010</b>. A class <b>1010</b> is a set of connections <b>602</b> that have a common priority level. Example priority levels include, by way of example but not limitation, real-time (RT), non-real-time (NRT), best effort (BE), and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Connection stage <b>1006</b> includes &#x201c;q&#x201d; connections <b>602</b>(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> . . . q), with &#x201c;q&#x201d; being some integer. Each connection <b>602</b> has a corresponding queue <b>604</b> and amount of data <b>606</b>. Each connection <b>602</b> also has a corresponding demand that is related to the amount of data <b>606</b>. Respective connections <b>602</b>(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> . . . q) are associated with respective weights W(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> . . . q). In a described implementation, connection stage <b>1006</b> is handled using a round robin scheduling within each class. However, other scheduling algorithms can alternatively be implemented for connection stage <b>1006</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Class stage <b>1008</b> includes &#x201c;c&#x201d; classes <b>1010</b>(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> . . . c), with &#x201c;c&#x201d; being some integer. Although only the &#x201c;q&#x201d; connections <b>602</b> of class <b>1010</b>(<b>2</b>) are explicitly illustrated, each respective class <b>1010</b> has its own respective set of connections <b>602</b> at that respective class level. Scheduler <b>1002</b> provides the class weights for class stage <b>1008</b>. In a described implementation, the classes are served in strict priority. In other words, the connections <b>602</b> of the first class <b>1010</b>(<b>1</b>) are served prior to any of the connections <b>602</b> of the second class <b>1010</b>(<b>2</b>) being served.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In flow based queuing, each connection or flow is mapped to a dedicated buffer (a.k.a., per flow queuing). Consequently, each flow within a class can have its own forwarding priority relative to other flows within the same class. Per flow queuing allows for better isolation of buffer resources. Flow based queuing can be implemented using hierarchical queuing added to class based queuing, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The per-flow-based queuing is thus a super set of the class based queuing in which only &#x201c;q&#x201d; queues are instantiated and the flows belonging to the same class are mapped to the same buffer. An advantage of implementing a hierarchical queue engine is that different queuing algorithms can be used both within the class and between classes. For example, with hierarchical queuing, the per-flow stage of class 3 may use WFQ while the per-flow stage of class 1 may use round robin.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In an example implementation of the weighted proportional fairness scheduling algorithm as described herein, scheduler <b>1002</b> uses a hierarchical queue structure with a per class stage <b>1008</b> and &#x201c;c&#x201d; per flow connection stages <b>1006</b>. Class stage <b>1008</b> is a logical stage and, depending on the implementation, may not need to store any packets.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In a described implementation, the weighted proportional fairness queuing algorithm as described herein is a bounded algorithm that scales at 2n order in which n is the number of active connections across each of the classes. It can thus be termed a two-pass algorithm because the algorithm uses two consecutive loops to calculate the fair share of the available bandwidth to be given to each active connection.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In order to bound the algorithm to two passes, the demand and credit of each flow is taken into account. The demand is the current queue depth (or amount of data <b>606</b>) of each flow in the downlink direction or the number of bytes queued by a subscriber station (e.g., the bandwidth requests) at the base station in the uplink direction.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The first pass is used to credit the Committed Information Rate (CIR) of each connection. In the second pass, the excess bandwidth is shared in accordance with the accumulated credits and demand of each connection. These first and second passes are described relatively qualitatively herein below with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, respectively. Thereafter, the two passes are described relatively quantitatively.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The allocation of the CIR and the Excess Information Rate (EIR) takes into account the modulation and coding scheme for each subscriber and the fact that the modulation and coding scheme changes over time. In a described implementation, the modulation and coding scheme is indexed by the rate ID. The rate ID reflects the communication data rate between the base station and a given subscriber station. The rate ID generally reflects the current channel quality. It also represents the efficiency or channel bandwidth utilization by the given subscriber station. Hence, subscriber stations with lower rate IDs may receive a smaller portion of the available bandwidth than subscriber stations with higher, and thus more efficient, rate IDs. This is especially valid when proportional fairness or maximum channel throughput (e.g., overall channel utilization efficiency) is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is another example block diagram of a hierarchical scheduling scheme <b>1100</b> that is termed weighted proportional fairness. Hierarchical scheduling scheme <b>1100</b> is an example implementation of two-stage per-connection scheduling scheme <b>1000</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) in which the number &#x201c;c&#x201d; of classes <b>1010</b> is two. These two classes are: real-time class <b>1010</b>(RT) and a non-real-time class <b>1010</b>(NRT). By way of example only, the traffic for real-time class <b>1010</b>(RT) may include voice over internet protocol (VoIP) communications, and the traffic for non-real-time class <b>1010</b>(NRT) may include FTP and HTTP communications. Also by way of example only, the scheduling algorithm for class stage <b>1008</b> is a strict priority scheduling algorithm <b>812</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Real-time class <b>1010</b>(RT) includes &#x201c;r1&#x201d; connections <b>602</b>, with &#x201c;r1&#x201d; being some integer. These r1 connections are connection <b>1</b> <b>602</b>(<b>1</b>)-RT, connection <b>2</b> <b>602</b>(<b>2</b>)-RT . . . connection &#x201c;r1&#x201d; <b>602</b>(<i>r</i>1)-RT. By way of example only, the scheduling algorithm for connection stage <b>1006</b>(RT) is a round robin scheduling algorithm <b>814</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Non-real-time class <b>1010</b>(NRT) includes &#x201c;r2&#x201d; connections <b>602</b>, with &#x201c;r2&#x201d; being some integer. These r2 connections are connection <b>1</b> <b>602</b>(<b>1</b>)-NRT, connection <b>2</b> <b>602</b>(<b>2</b>)-NRT . . . connection &#x201c;r2&#x201d; <b>602</b>(<i>r</i>2)-NRT. By way of example only, the scheduling algorithm for connection stage <b>1006</b>(NRT) is a proportional fairness scheduling algorithm <b>806</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A max-min fairness algorithm <b>802</b> may be realized using equations S1-S13 below. The CIR for each connection is calculated first and then the remaining channel capacity, if any, is shared with each connection in accordance with the EIR of the connection. However, the max-min fairness algorithm does not take into account the channel quality; instead, it results in a relatively precise fairness regardless of the channel conditions experienced by individual users.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In contrast, a proportional fairness algorithm <b>806</b> tends to favor users with higher channel conditions. Fairness is dependent on the relatively high probability that users, over time, will experience a similar overall channel condition. Unfortunately, it is possible that two stationary users can experience a different channel quality&#x2014;a first user experiences a generally good quality channel because the wireless device is closer to the base station, while a second user is located in an area where there is poor signal coverage. In this case, the first user will generally get a higher throughout compared to the second user.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Another potential problem with proportional fairness is that for some services it is important to allocate the user the throughput required by an application without delay (e.g., voice applications). Consequently, a hybrid approach that employs both max-min fairness and proportional fairness is adopted for a described implementation. Connections with strict delay and jitter performance requirements (so-called real-time connections) are served with strict priority. Any leftover capacity after the real-time connections have been serviced is shared using proportional fairness.</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flow diagram <b>1200</b> that illustrates an example method for a first loop of a two-loop scheduling algorithm that implements weighted proportional fairness. Flow diagram <b>1200</b> includes six (6) blocks <b>1202</b>-<b>1212</b>. Although the actions of flow diagram <b>1200</b> may be performed in other environments and with a variety of hardware, firmware, and/or software combinations, the environments and components otherwise described herein and/or illustrated in the referenced figures are used to illuminate example implementations of the method.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0139">At block <b>1202</b>, a CIR credit per connection is determined. At block <b>1208</b>, an EIR credit per connection is determined. These credits may be determined using, for example, a token bucket rate algorithm (TBRA) that is executed once every given time period (e.g., each frame) or that is calculated when relevant using a bucket filling rate. The credit determinations may also be performed outside of the first and second loops of the example scheduling algorithm. The EIR and CIR credits may be limited by maximum allowed credit levels.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0140">At block <b>1204</b>, the CIR per connection is ascertained based on the demand per connection and the determined CIR credit per connection. For example, the CIR per connection may be ascertained responsive to a minimum between the demand per connection and the determined CIR credit per connection. The CIR per connection may be ascertained in class order because the CIR allocation is granted in class order during the second loop. The demand per connection may be derived from the amount of data <b>606</b> in each queue <b>604</b> corresponding to each connection <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0141">At block <b>1206</b>, the total CIR is calculated. For example, the total CIR may be calculated by summing the individual ascertained CIRs per connection.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0142">The ascertained CIRs per connection, as ascertained at block <b>1204</b>, are provided to the EIR analysis for use at block <b>1210</b>. At block <b>1210</b>, the EIR per connection is ascertained based on the demand per connection, the determined EIR credit per connection, and the ascertained CIR per connection. For example, the EIR per connection may be ascertained responsive to a minimum between (i) a difference between the demand per connection and the ascertained CIR per connection and (ii) the determined EIR credit per connection.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0143">At block <b>1212</b>, the total EIR is calculated. For example, the total EIR may be calculated by summing the individual ascertained EIRs per connection.

<p id="p-0133" num="0145">At block <b>1302</b>, excess capacity is calculated based on total channel capacity and the calculated total CIR.

<p id="p-0134" num="0146">At block <b>1304</b>, the excess capacity is compared to the calculated total EIR. For example, it may be determined if the excess capacity is less than the calculated total EIR (from block <b>1212</b>). If so, then the method of flow diagram <b>1300</b> continues at block <b>1306</b>. If, on the other hand, the excess capacity is determined to be greater than the calculated total EIR, then the method continues at block <b>1308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0147">At block <b>1306</b>, when the total EIR is greater than the excess capacity, the EIR allocation per connection is set based on an EIR proportionality per connection and the excess capacity. For example, the EIR allocation per connection may be established responsive to a connection's EIR as a proportion of the calculated total EIR and to the excess capacity (as calculated at block <b>1302</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0148">At block <b>1308</b>, when the excess capacity is greater than the total EIR, the EIR allocation per connection is set responsive to the ascertained EIR per connection. In these situations, each connection effectively receives its full demand, at least up to any instituted PIR. First, the CIR is fully satisfied for each connection in class order. Second, the remaining EIR per connection can also be fully satisfied for each connection because the calculated excess capacity exceeds the total EIR.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0149">The CIR allocations are also &#x201c;officially&#x201d; assigned in the second loop. As noted herein below, the actions of the illustrated flow diagrams may be altered in a number of manners. For example, the order may be rearranged. Thus, although shown as occurring after the action(s) of block <b>1306</b> or <b>1308</b>, the action(s) of block <b>1310</b> may actually be performed earlier, including during the first loop of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0150">At block <b>1310</b>, the CIR allocation per connection is set responsive to the ascertained CIR per connection while channel capacity remains. To ensure that the class order is enforced, the CIR allocations per connection are assigned in class order. Hence, the CIR allocations per connection for class #<b>1</b> <b>1010</b>(<b>1</b>) are assigned prior to assigning any CIR allocations for the connections of class #<b>2</b> <b>1010</b>(<b>2</b>). The action(s) of block <b>1310</b> conform to case (a) of two described cases (a) and (b). These two cases are described further herein below after the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> in the quantitative description of the second loop.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0151">At block <b>1312</b>, the total allocation per connection is calculated based on the CIR allocation per connection and the EIR allocation per connection. For example, the total allocation per connection may be calculated responsive to a sum of the CIR allocation per connection (from block <b>1310</b>) and the EIR allocation per connection (from block <b>1306</b> or <b>1308</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0152">For a described implementation, the following provides a relatively rigorous, more quantitative description of the weighted proportional fairness example scheduling algorithm presented herein. First, the credits are calculated. The credit for each connection or flow is calculated based on its traffic descriptors. Credit is determined using the TBRA, but other credit determining algorithms may alternatively be implemented. The token determinations assume the use of separate buckets for the CIR and the EIR. The credits are bounded by respective maximum bucket sizes for the CIR and EIR.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0153">The credit is determined upon a packet arrival event. However, credit determination can also be performed at a fixed time interval (e.g., at the TDD frame), but performing this operation upon packet arrivals provides an optimization because there can be long time periods, much longer than the TDD frame duration, between consecutive packet arrivals in the packet arrival pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0154">Upon packet arrival for connection identifier<sub>i </sub>(CID<sub>i</sub>), the following token credit determinations are performed with equations S1 and S2:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>CIR</i>_token<sub>i</sub>=MIN(<i>MBS</i><sub>CIR</sub><sub><sub2>i</sub2></sub><i>,CIR</i>_token<sub>i</sub><i>+R</i><sub>CIR</sub><sub><sub2>i</sub2></sub><i>&#xd7;&#x394;t</i>), and&#x2003;&#x2003;(Eqn S1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

<br/>
where R<sub>CIR </sub>and R<sub>EIR </sub>are CIR and EIR rates in bits/s and &#x394;t is the time between packet arrival for CIR<sub>i</sub>. CIR_token and EIR_token are the accumulated CIR and EIR credits, respectively, for each connection. In this example, the units are in bytes, but they may be maintained in other units. MBS is the Maximum Burst Size or maximum size to which the credit totals can reach. If equations S1 and S2 are performed at a fixed interval (e.g., at frame times), then R<sub>EIR</sub>&#xd7;&#x394;t=CIR_refreshrate. The analysis is similar for EIR.
</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0155">The fairness allocation portion of the weighted proportional fairness algorithm is performed in two loops. Thus, the algorithm for the fairness allocation loops through the set of active connections twice. The first loop allocates the CIR for each connection based on the CIR traffic attribute or class. The second loop allocates the excess bandwidth for each connection based on the EIR traffic attribute. As noted above, the algorithm thus scales on the order of 2N, where N is the number of active connections.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0156">In a described implementation, the following actions and calculations are performed in the first loop pass: The CIR for each connection is ascertained. All classes and all connections within a class are looped through to determine the CIR. The loop is exited when the channel has been fully allocated. In addition, the EIR for each connection is ascertained, and it is accumulated for the total EIR. This total EIR is used in the second loop.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0157">It should be noted that for the purpose of a channel capacity calculation, credit and demand parameters, which are typically maintained in bytes or bits/second, are converted to slots.

<p id="p-0160" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example bandwidth allocation distributive tiling procedure <b>1400</b>. As described more generally herein above (e.g., with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), bandwidth allocations per connection <b>902</b> are dimensioned and placed within a subframe by tiling procedure <b>1400</b>. As illustrated, tiling procedure <b>1400</b> includes an allocation tiler <b>1402</b>, two groups <b>1408</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>1408</b>(<b>2</b>), and a DL subframe <b>404</b>. Allocation tiler <b>1402</b> includes a grouping unit <b>1404</b> and a proportional distributing unit <b>1406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0177">In a described implementation, allocation tiler <b>1402</b> dimensions and places allocations per connection <b>902</b> into DL subframe <b>404</b>.

Example scheduling algorithms include, but are not limited to, those that are described herein above with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Bandwidth allocations <b>902</b> represent an area in terms of a geometry that ultimately has a frequency dimension and a time dimension. The height and width (i.e., the dimensions) of an allocation may be flexible when it is initially determined by the scheduling algorithm. This dimensional flexibility is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> by the circular shape of bandwidth allocations <b>902</b>. The dimensionality resulting from a tiling procedure is represented by the rectangular shape of tiles <b>910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0178">Tiling placement attempts to reduce, if not actually minimize or even eliminate, holes in DL subframe <b>404</b>. Holes are areas of DL subframe <b>404</b> that do not have any bandwidth allocation associated therewith. Hence, holes are essentially wasted available bandwidth, and their existence in a DL subframe <b>404</b> can indicate a level of inefficiency in the tiling procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0179">More specifically for tiling procedure <b>1400</b>, grouping unit <b>1404</b> groups allocations <b>902</b> in accordance with one or more criteria, such as channel condition preferences of each subscriber, modulation and coding rate, equalization of the allocation total for each group, and so forth. As shown, two groups <b>1408</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>1408</b>(<b>2</b>) are created from allocations <b>902</b> by grouping unit <b>1404</b>. As is described further herein below, grouping unit <b>1404</b> may also create subgroups (not explicitly diagramed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) within each group <b>1408</b>.

<p id="p-0164" num="0180">As illustrated, DL subframe <b>404</b> has a first dimension <b>1410</b> and a second dimension <b>1412</b>.

In a described implementation, proportional distributing unit <b>1406</b> distributes allocations <b>902</b> proportionally onto DL subframe <b>404</b>. In operation, proportional distributing unit <b>1406</b> first locks one dimension &#x201c;A&#x201d; of DL subframe <b>404</b> and proportionally distributes allocations <b>902</b> across the other dimension &#x201c;B&#x201d;. Next, proportional distributing unit <b>1406</b> locks the other dimension &#x201c;B&#x201d; of DL subframe <b>404</b> and proportionally distributes allocations <b>902</b> across the dimension &#x201c;A&#x201d;.</p>

Each sub-band <b>1414</b>(<i>x</i>) is of a size that is proportional to a ratio of the size of the allocations <b>902</b> of the corresponding group <b>1408</b>(<i>x</i>) and the total size of all allocations <b>902</b> of all groups <b>1408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0182">Next, proportional distributing unit <b>1406</b> locks second dimension <b>1412</b>. To proportionally distribute allocations <b>902</b> along first dimension <b>1410</b>, subgroups of allocations <b>902</b> within each given group <b>1408</b>(<i>x</i>) are proportionally distributed with regard to their individual subgroup areas in proportion to the total area of the corresponding sub-band <b>1414</b>(<i>x</i>) of the given group <b>1408</b>(<i>x</i>) to form tiles <b>910</b>.

<p id="p-0167" num="0183">Although a DL subframe <b>404</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, described implementations of the distributive tiling procedure may also be applied to UL subframes <b>408</b>. Additionally, it should be understood that distributive approaches to tiling bandwidth allocations are applicable to both TDD systems (e.g., using a TDD frame format <b>400</b>A) and FDD systems (e.g., using an FDD frame format <b>400</b>B).</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0184"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a flow diagram <b>1500</b> that illustrates an example general method for a distributive approach to tiling bandwidth allocations. Flow diagram <b>1500</b> includes ten (10) blocks <b>1502</b>-<b>1520</b>. Although the actions of flow diagram <b>1500</b> may be performed in other environments and with a variety of hardware, firmware, and/or software combinations, the environments and components otherwise described herein and/or illustrated in the referenced figures are used to illuminate example implementations of the method.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0185">At block <b>1502</b>, it is given that the tiling method is provided (1) with a number of bandwidth area allocations per connection and (2) an empty two-dimensional DL subframe (or UL subframe). For example, allocation tiler <b>1402</b> may be provided with allocations per connection <b>902</b> and an empty DL subframe <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0186">At block <b>1504</b>, groups of allocations are created based on at least one criterion. For example, allocation groups <b>1408</b> may be created from area allocations <b>902</b> by grouping unit <b>1404</b> based on at least one criterion.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0187">At block <b>1506</b>, a first dimension of the DL subframe is locked. For example, first dimension <b>1410</b> of DL subframe <b>404</b> may be locked by allocation tiler <b>1402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0188">At block <b>1508</b>, groups are proportionally distributed along a second dimension of the DL subframe. For example, groups <b>1408</b> may be proportionally distributed along second dimension <b>1412</b> of DL subframe <b>404</b> by proportional distributing unit <b>1406</b>. In other words, each group <b>1408</b>(<i>x</i>) is assigned a sub-band <b>1414</b>(<i>x</i>) whose proportion of DL subframe <b>404</b> is equivalent to a given group's percentage of the total size of all groups <b>1408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0189">At block <b>1510</b>, a second dimension of the DL subframe is locked. For example, second dimension <b>1412</b> of DL subframe <b>404</b> may be locked by allocation tiler <b>1402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0190">At block <b>1512</b>, subgroups of allocations within a current group are created based on at least one criterion. For example, grouping unit <b>1404</b> may create subgroups of allocations <b>902</b> within a given current group <b>1408</b>. The criteria for creating groups and subgroups may be the same or different.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0191">At block <b>1514</b>, the subgroups are proportionally distributed along the first dimension of the DL subframe within a total allocation area of the current group. For example, the subgroups of a current group <b>1408</b>(<i>x</i>) may be proportionally distributed by proportional distributing unit <b>1406</b> along first dimension <b>1410</b> of DL subframe <b>404</b> within the sub-band <b>1414</b>(<i>x</i>) corresponding to the current group <b>1408</b>(<i>x</i>). In other words, each subgroup is assigned a portion of sub-band <b>1414</b>(<i>x</i>) that is proportional to the subgroup's size in relation to the total size of the given current group <b>1408</b>(<i>x</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0192">At block <b>1516</b>, it is determined if there is another group to tile.

<p id="p-0177" num="0193">If, on the other hand, it is determined (at block <b>1516</b>) that there is no other group to tile, then at block <b>1520</b> the tiling method produces a DL subframe (or UL subframe) that is tiled with dimensioned and placed allocations. For example, allocation tiler <b>1402</b> may produce a DL subframe <b>404</b> having dimensioned and placed allocations <b>902</b> that form tiles <b>910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0194">Either first dimension <b>1410</b> or second dimension <b>1412</b> may be frequency <b>504</b>/subchannel groups <b>508</b>. Similarly, either first dimension <b>1410</b> or second dimension <b>1412</b> may be time <b>502</b>/symbol groups <b>506</b>. Hence, either time or frequency may be locked first while allocations are first distributed along the other dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0195">A relatively-rigorous quantitative bandwidth allocation tiling scheme is described below. Bandwidth allocation tiling as described herein may be utilized in accordance with many different communication standards, including many different wireless communication standards. Nevertheless, and by way of example only, the quantitative description below comports with certain constraints imposed by an IEEE 802.16 standard. For example, an IEEE 802.16 standard imposes restrictions on how tiling can be performed in the DL. Relevant restrictions for the purpose of an example tiling implementation are: (1) tiled allocations are to have a rectangular dimension and (2) the PDUs within any single allocation are to have the same modulation and coding scheme (which may also be referred to as a modulation and coding rate pair). Notwithstanding these example restrictions, the example tiling scheme is presented below without loss of generality.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0196">A goal of the following tiling scheme is to create a set of tiles that leave few if any holes in the DL subframe (or UL subframe) while simultaneously maintaining whatever fairness for the connections has been established. Another goal is to achieve superior tiling partitioning while utilizing reasonably low computational resources. These goals are addressed by certain described implementations with a tiling scheme that produces a tiled subframe in a relatively linear manner. It does not, in contrast to other possible approaches, rely on a hoped-for convergence from an unknown number of algorithmic iterations.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0197">It should be noted, however, that there will likely be round-off, quantization, and other such errors that naturally intrude on the process. Moreover, random vagaries in allocation sizes, modulation and coding schemes, etc. can also impact the final result of a tiling scheme as described below. In other words, although described implementations of the tiling scheme are believed to offer exceptional results on average, actual real-world results, especially in individual situations, may fall short of the goals listed above for any number of reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0198">In IEEE 802.16, the TDD split setting in TDD systems or the frame duration in FDD systems gives the temporal dimension of the DL subframe in terms of the number of symbol-groups (M). For the frequency dimension, the number of sub-channel groups (N) is determined by the channel bandwidth, the FFT size, the selected channel utilization mapping permutation, and so forth. With these known values of M and N, a described implementation of the tiling scheme may begin with the following two parts (for a DL subframe example):
<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0199">(1) The dimensions of the DL subframe are defined as N&#xd7;M, with N being the number of subchannel groups and M being the number of symbol groups. Thus, DL_Slots=N&#xd7;M is the number of slots in the DL in frame n.</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0200">(2) A set of connections is organized into groups in which the number of groups is less than N. Although this example describes addressing (e.g., distributing along) the N direction first, this tiling scheme can be implemented by addressing the M direction first. The number of groups is set to be less than N to reduce the quantization or round off error.</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0003" num="0201">It is not fundamental to the scheme what criterion or criteria are used for creating the groups. One or more of the following grouping criteria may be employed: channel condition preferences of each subscriber, modulation and coding scheme, equalization of the allocation total for each group, and so forth. Connections with similar grouping criteria are grouped into groups.</li>
    </ul>

For example, if dimension N is in the frequency domain (i.e., N represents subchannel groups), then N_G<sub>j </sub>represents the number of sub-channel groups that are to be allocated to group G<sub>j</sub>. Consequently, the tile dimension of group G<sub>j </sub>is N_G<sub>j</sub>&#xd7;M at this stage of the tiling scheme. Equations T1 and T2 are repeated for each group G<sub>i </sub>to calculate the height dimension of each group.

<p id="p-0198" num="0217">In other words, the Round( ) function above is performed. Afterwards, the resulting allocation is compared to the demand. If the fractional part of the allocation is greater than 0.5, the allocation is rounded up. However, before an allocation is rounded up, the demand is checked to determine if it is sufficient to fill the extra slot area. If not, the allocation is rounded down.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0218">The example rounding implementations described above are a general approach for dealing with rounding to slot boundaries. There are, however, many cases in which this approach may not work optimally. For example, consider a case in which all of the allocations would need to be rounded up to the next slot boundary, but none of the allocations have enough demand to fill a larger allocation size.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0219">There are multiple alternative schemes that can address such cases. One example scheme involves readjusting the allocations. After performing the general rounding implementation described above, if there are any excess unallocated slots, the system can readjust the slot boundary (e.g., change the allocation size) starting with the allocation that has the highest leftover demand. Consider, for instance, an allocation that is 3.6 prior to rounding and that should therefore be rounded up to 4. However, because it has no demand to fill 4, it is instead rounded down to 3. Because not all slots have been assigned, the size of this allocation can be readjusted to 4. This readjustment can continue until all slots are assigned. Although example specific rounding algorithms have been described herein, other rounding algorithms may alternatively be employed.</p>

Connection groups 2-4 are not divided into subgroups in this example for the sake of brevity. In this example, there are 30 subchannel groups (N=30) and 25 symbol groups (M=25).</p>

<p id="p-0206" num="0225"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a block diagram <b>1600</b> in which bandwidth allocations having example numeric values are distributively tiled onto a DL subframe <b>404</b>. DL subframe <b>404</b> is shown at three different stages <b>1602</b> of a tiling procedure that illustrates the numerical example described above and presented by Tables 1 and 2. First stage <b>1602</b>(<b>1</b>) is the empty stage that merely shows the dimensions of DL subframe <b>404</b>. These dimensions are 30 subchannel groups by 25 symbol groups.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0226">In second stage <b>1602</b>(<b>2</b>), the M dimension is fixed, and the N dimension is proportionally divided according to the allocations of connection groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 as shown above in Table 1. Hence, connection group 1 is apportioned 6 subchannel groups, connection group 2 is apportioned 3 subchannel groups, connection group 3 is apportioned 12 subchannel groups, and connection group 4 is apportioned 9 subchannel groups.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0227">In third stage <b>1602</b>(<b>3</b>), the N dimension is fixed. Connection group 1 has five subgroups, and the M dimension is therefore proportionally partitioned into five allocated tiles. These five symbol group allocations are shown above in Table 2. They are also illustrated in third stage <b>1602</b>(<b>3</b>) as follows: subgroup 1-A is apportioned 5 symbol groups, subgroup 1-B is apportioned 5 symbol groups, subgroup 1-C is apportioned 8 symbol groups, subgroup 1-D is apportioned 5 symbol groups, and subgroup 1-E is apportioned 2 symbol groups.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0228">By way of example, the tile for subgroup 1-A, <b>910</b>(<b>1</b>-A), has a dimension of 6 subchannel groups by 5 symbol groups. In accordance with slot <b>510</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), tile <b>910</b>(<b>1</b>-A) has 5&#xd7;6=30 slots. The individual allocations <b>902</b> (not separately shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) of tile <b>910</b>(<b>1</b>-A) of subgroup 1-A are thus used to fill the 30 slots. The filling of the slots is accomplished by taking PDUs from associated connections <b>602</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and applying them to the slots to the limit instituted by allocations <b>902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0229"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref>, <b>18</b>, and <b>19</b> are flow diagrams <b>1700</b>, <b>1800</b>, and <b>1900</b>, respectively, that illustrate a more-specific example method for distributively tiling bandwidth allocations. Flow diagram <b>1700</b> includes five (5) blocks <b>1702</b>-<b>1710</b> and illustrates a first part that is directed to the determination of zones. Flow diagram <b>1800</b> includes five (5) blocks <b>1802</b>-<b>1810</b> and illustrates a second part that is directed to frequency domain dimensioning. Flow diagram <b>1900</b> includes five (5) blocks <b>1902</b>-<b>1910</b> and illustrates a third part that is directed to time domain dimensioning. Although the actions of flow diagrams <b>1700</b>, <b>1800</b>, and <b>1900</b> may be performed in other environments and with a variety of hardware, firmware, and/or software combinations, the environments and components otherwise described herein and/or illustrated in the referenced figures are used to illuminate example implementations of the method. Although the flow diagrams are directed to tiling a DL subframe, the method may also be applied to tiling UL subframes, as permitted by the constraints of a given wireless standard.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0230"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a flow diagram <b>1700</b> that illustrates a first part of a more-specific example method for distributively tiling bandwidth allocations, with the first part being directed to the determination of zones. Zones are partitioned areas of the DL subframe. They are relevant to some air interfaces but not to others. Zone switching is relevant to, for example, IEEE 802.16. With zone switching, the DL subframe is partitioned in the time domain on symbol group boundaries. Zone switches enable the support of different PHY layer modes. For instance, each PHY layer mode is supported by a different zone.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0231">Hence, the example specific tiling algorithm as described herein organizes users into zones to determine the proportional number of slots (e.g., in terms of symbol groups) each set of users is to be allocated. Each zone is then partitioned along a first dimension using groups and then along a second dimension using subgroups. Zone partitioning, frequency domain partitioning, and time domain partitioning are addressed by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref>, <b>18</b>, and <b>19</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0232">In a described implementation for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, flow diagram <b>1700</b> starts at block <b>1702</b> with an &#x201c;empty&#x201d; DL subframe having an N&#xd7;M size. More specifically, the following are inputs to the zone determination part of this example tiling method: a per connection allocation, a per subscriber station and/or a per connection modulation and coding scheme, and a size of the DL subframe (e.g., a number of subchannel groups N, a number of symbol groups M, and a number of slots in the DL subframe).</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0233">To determine the locations of the zones, the actions of blocks <b>1704</b>-<b>1708</b> are performed. At block <b>1704</b>, connections are organized into zones. Thus, each zone is a set of connections. Zones are partitioned on symbol group boundaries. Each connection is associated with a specific zone. The connections can therefore be organized into zones by the scheduler, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0234">At block <b>1706</b>, the total allocation for a zone is determined by summing the allocations of each connection j that is a member of the set of connections of the zone. This total zone allocation determination is repeated for each zone i.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0235">At block <b>1708</b>, the size of a zone is determined relative to its total allocation. More specifically, the size of the zone M_Z<sub>i </sub>is determined in terms of a number of symbol groups that is proportional to the zone's percentage of the total number of DL_Slots of the DL subframe. This zone size determination is repeated for each zone i. The output is a DL subframe that is partitioned into zones. As indicated by block <b>1710</b>, the method continues at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0236"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a flow diagram <b>1800</b> that illustrates a second part of the more-specific example method for distributively tiling bandwidth allocations, with the second part being directed to frequency domain dimensioning. In a described implementation for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, flow diagram <b>1800</b> starts at block <b>1802</b> with a DL subframe that is partitioned into zones. Additionally, the same inputs continue to be available for the frequency domain partitioning part of this example tiling method: a per connection allocation, a per subscriber station and/or a per connection modulation and coding scheme, and a size of the target zone or zones in the DL subframe.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0237">To determine the number of subchannel groups in each connection group, the actions of blocks <b>1804</b>-<b>1808</b> are performed. At block <b>1804</b>, the set of connections of the targeted zone are organized into connection groups. In other words, based on some grouping criterion or criteria, the connections are organized into connection groups. The grouping criteria may be one or more of the following examples: channel condition preferences of each subscriber; modulation and coding scheme of the connections; allocation leveling (e.g., the allocation for each connection group is selected such that each connection group has approximately the same total allocation); active antenna systems/multiple input, multiple output (AAS/MIMO); some combination thereof, and so forth. Any criterion or criteria may be used to organize the connections into connection groups.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0238">At block <b>1806</b>, the total allocation for a connection group is determined by summing the allocations of the j connections that have been organized into that connection group. This total group allocation determination is repeated for each connection group i.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0239">At block <b>1808</b>, the number of subchannel groups for each connection group is determined with regard to the connection group's total allocation. More specifically, the number of subchannel groups N_G<sub>j </sub>for each connection group is determined such that it is proportional to the connection group's percentage of the total size of the current zone DL_Slots_Z. This subchannel determination is repeated for each connection group j. The output is a DL subframe with the current zone partitioned in the frequency domain. In other words, the current zone is partitioned into frequency sub-bands. As indicated by block <b>1810</b>, the method continues at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0240"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a flow diagram <b>1900</b> that illustrates a third part of the more-specific example method for distributively tiling bandwidth allocations, with the third part being directed to time domain dimensioning. Although frequency domain dimensioning is illustrated as being performed prior to time domain dimensioning as reflected by the order of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, time domain dimensioning may alternatively be performed prior to frequency domain dimensioning. In a described implementation for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, flow diagram <b>1900</b> starts at block <b>1902</b> with a DL subframe that has a zone that is partitioned into sub-bands corresponding to connection groups in accordance with the frequency dimensioning.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0241">To determine the number of symbol groups in each subgroup, the actions of blocks <b>1904</b>-<b>1908</b> are performed. At block <b>1904</b>, the connections for each connection group are organized into subgroups. The criterion or criteria for subgroup creation may also vary. In an example implementation, however, the connections are organized into subgroups such that each connection in a given subgroup has the same constellation and coding rate (e.g., modulation and coding scheme).</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0242">At block <b>1906</b>, the total allocation for a subgroup is determined by summing the allocations of the n connections that have been organized into that subgroup.

This symbol group determination is repeated for each subgroup k of each connection group j.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0244">The output is a DL subframe with the current zone partitioned in the frequency domain and in the time domain. In other words, each connection group of each frequency sub-band is partitioned into tiled subgroup allocations. The current zone is thus partitioned into tiles. The number of symbol groups for each subgroup is given by M_G, and the number of subchannel groups for each subgroup is given by N_G. Hence, the tile dimension of each subgroup is given by N_G&#xd7;M_G.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0245">The actions of flow diagrams <b>1800</b> and <b>1900</b> are repeated for each zone that is established by the actions of flow diagram <b>1700</b>. As indicated by block <b>1910</b>, the basic tiling can be considered to be completed. However, rounding as described above may still be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0246"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example bandwidth allocation striping tiling procedure <b>2000</b>. As described more generally herein above (e.g., with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), bandwidth allocations per connection <b>902</b> are dimensioned and placed within a subframe by tiling procedure <b>2000</b>. As illustrated, tiling procedure <b>2000</b> includes allocation tiler <b>1402</b>, two groups <b>1408</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>1408</b>(<b>2</b>), and a DL subframe <b>404</b>. Allocation tiler <b>1402</b> includes grouping unit <b>1404</b>, a striping unit <b>2002</b>, and a packing unit <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0247">In a described implementation, and as introduced herein above with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, allocation tiler <b>1402</b> dimensions and places allocations per connection <b>902</b> into DL subframe <b>404</b>. Allocations per connection <b>902</b> are produced by some scheduling algorithm and converted from bytes to slots, as appropriate. Example scheduling algorithms include, but are not limited to, those that are described herein above with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Bandwidth allocations <b>902</b> represent an area in terms of a geometry that ultimately has a frequency dimension and a time dimension. The length and breadth (i.e., the dimensions) of an allocation may be flexible when it is initially determined by the scheduling algorithm. This dimensional flexibility and adjustability is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> by the circular shape of bandwidth allocations <b>902</b>. The ultimate dimensionality resulting from a tiling procedure is represented by the rectangular shape of tiles <b>910</b> in DL subframe <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0248">When capacity usage is at a maximum, tiling placement attempts to reduce, if not actually minimize or even eliminate, holes in DL subframe <b>404</b>. Holes are areas of DL subframe <b>404</b> that do not have any bandwidth allocation associated therewith. Hence, holes are essentially wasted available bandwidth, and their existence in a DL subframe <b>404</b> can indicate a level of inefficiency in the tiling procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0249">More specifically for tiling procedure <b>2000</b>, grouping unit <b>1404</b> groups allocations <b>902</b> in accordance with one or more criteria, such as channel condition preferences of each subscriber, modulation and coding rate, equalization of the allocation total for each group, connection category type, some combination thereof, and so forth. As shown, two groups <b>1408</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>1408</b>(<b>2</b>) are created from allocations <b>902</b> by grouping unit <b>1404</b>. Although only two groups <b>1408</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, grouping unit <b>1404</b> may create any number of groups <b>1408</b>. For example, the number of groups <b>1408</b> may be equal to the number of different modulation and coding rate pairs currently being used by a base station. The number of groups <b>1408</b> can also be larger. There can be multiple groups in which each group has the same modulation and coding rate. These multiple groups may be created, for example, to tile them in different areas of a DL subframe (e.g., in different zones).</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0250">As illustrated, DL subframe <b>404</b> has a first dimension <b>1410</b> and a second dimension <b>1412</b>. One dimension represents frequency (e.g., subchannel groups), and the other dimension represents time (e.g., symbol groups). In a described implementation generally, striping unit <b>2002</b> stripes total allocations for each group <b>1408</b> into tiles <b>910</b> onto DL subframe <b>404</b>. To reduce wasted available bandwidth, packing unit <b>2004</b> attempts to place smaller allocation groups into bonus fillable areas, which are represented by tile <b>910</b>(<b>3</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0251">More specifically, striping unit <b>2002</b> stripes the total allocations <b>902</b> of group <b>1408</b>(<b>1</b>) as tile <b>910</b>(<b>1</b>). The total allocations are striped extending toward the edge of second dimension <b>1412</b> and then expanded outward along first dimension <b>1410</b> until the entire allocation group <b>1408</b>(<b>1</b>) is placed on DL subframe <b>404</b>. Because of rounding constraints and the rectangular shape of tile <b>910</b>(<b>1</b>), an unused area may be left beyond the end of tile <b>910</b>(<b>1</b>). This bonus fillable area need not be wasted.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0252">Packing unit <b>2004</b> attempts to pack relatively smaller allocation groups into these bonus fillable areas that are created by the striping of striping unit <b>2002</b>. By way of example, packing unit <b>2004</b> has placed tile <b>910</b>(<b>3</b>) into the bonus fillable area below tile <b>910</b>(<b>1</b>). Tile <b>910</b>(<b>3</b>) corresponds to an un-illustrated third group of allocations <b>1408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0253">After tiling an allocation group along second dimension <b>1412</b>, striping unit <b>2002</b> stripes an allocation group in a different direction along first dimension <b>1410</b>. Striping unit <b>2002</b> stripes the total allocations <b>902</b> of group <b>1408</b>(<b>2</b>) as tile <b>910</b>(<b>2</b>). The total allocations are striped extending toward the edge of first dimension <b>1410</b> and then expanded outward along second dimension <b>1412</b> until the entire allocation group <b>1408</b>(<b>2</b>) is placed on DL subframe <b>404</b>. Additional striping and packing functionality for striping unit <b>2002</b> and packing unit <b>2004</b>, respectively, are described herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0254">Although a DL subframe <b>404</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, described implementations of the striping tiling procedure may also be applied to UL subframes <b>408</b>, depending on the flexibility of a given wireless standard. Additionally, it should be understood that striping approaches to tiling bandwidth allocations are applicable to both TDD systems (e.g., using a TDD frame format <b>400</b>A) and FDD systems (e.g., using an FDD frame format <b>400</b>B).</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0255"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a block diagram of a DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>21</b>) having example striped allocations (A<b>1</b>-A<b>4</b>). As illustrated, DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>21</b>) corresponds to time <b>502</b> along the abscissa axis versus frequency <b>504</b> along the ordinate axis. DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>21</b>) includes a frame control header (FCH) block, a DL/UL map block, and four allocation blocks A<b>1</b>-A<b>4</b>. DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>21</b>) also includes four bonus fillable areas (BFAs) and a connection category #<b>2</b> region.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0256">In a described implementation, allocations are separated into two or more categories. In the examples that follow, the allocations are separated into a first category #<b>1</b> and a second category #<b>2</b>. These categories may be defined in any manner. For instance, they may be separated into real-time connections (e.g., category #<b>1</b>) and non-real-time connections (e.g., category #<b>2</b>). They may also be separated into connections that cannot afford retransmission (e.g., category #<b>1</b>) and those that do tolerate retransmissions (e.g., category #<b>2</b>). In an IEEE 802.16 implementation, for example, they may be separated into Hybrid Automatic-Repeat-Request (HARQ) connections (e.g., category #<b>2</b>) and non-HARQ connections (e.g., category #<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0257">The connections of category #<b>1</b> are given to be a set of allocations A(i)={A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b> . . . An}. Each allocation A(i) may, for example, correspond to the sum of allocations <b>902</b> in each group <b>1408</b>(<i>i</i>) (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). As noted above, each group may have allocations belonging to a single modulation and coding rate pair. Without loss of generality, the connections of category #<b>2</b> are assumed to be capable of being tiled as one rectangle on DL subframe <b>404</b>. Nevertheless, category #<b>2</b> connections may alternatively be tiled as multiple rectangular regions (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0258">When grouping is implemented by modulation and coding rate pair, the total allocation size for allocations A(i) of category #<b>1</b> connections may be determined by equation T5 as follows:</p>

In equation T5, &#x201c;&#x3a3; Demand_per_Connection&#x201d; represents the total demand across all connections of a given group. The &#x201c;Modulation&#x26;CodingRate Pair_Payload&#x201d; variable represents the efficiency at which the connections are currently communicating for the given group. The quotient within the brackets therefore represents the area (e.g., in tile units) that the group should be allocated in a subframe.

<p id="p-0241" num="0260">In DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>21</b>), the FCH and DL/UL map blocks are standard overhead areas. Generally, DL subframes <b>404</b> include some overhead area. This overhead area may include those that are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> and/or alternative overhead information. The DL/UL map informs subscriber stations <b>104</b> of the areas of the DL and UL subframes that have been assigned to them in a given frame.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0261">In a described implementation, the allocations A of connection category #<b>1</b> are ordered from largest to smallest. Thus, allocation A<b>1</b> is larger than allocation A<b>2</b>, which is larger than allocation A<b>3</b>, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0262">For the sake of clarity, the blocks in DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>21</b>) are described in terms of their height and width. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the height parameter is measured top-to-bottom along the frequency <b>504</b> dimension, and the width parameter is measured right-to-left along the time <b>502</b> dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0263">An example striping tiling procedure is described in terms of stages <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>. Below the DL/UL map block, there is bonus fillable area (BFA) #<b>0</b>. As illustrated, the width of BFA #<b>0</b> is equal to the width of the DL/UL map block. The height of BFA #<b>0</b> is the amount of the frequency <b>504</b> dimension that is not consumed by the FCH and DL/UL map blocks. (In IEEE 802.16 systems, for example, the DL/UL map follows the frequency-first time-second pattern which means that the map fills up all of the subcarrier groups of a symbol group &#x201c;column&#x201d; and then might fill up only halfway through the next symbol group &#x201c;column&#x201d;. Hence, the width of BFA#<b>0</b> is one symbol group under current IEEE 802.16 specifications.) Packing unit <b>2004</b> at stage 1 attempts to find the largest allocation A that fits within BFA #<b>0</b>. This largest allocation, if any, is placed at BFA #<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0264">At stage 2, the height and width of the largest allocation, A<b>1</b>, is determined by striping unit <b>2002</b>. This allocation, after handling any rounding, is placed within DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>21</b>). It is dimensioned such that it extends in height as far as possible along the frequency <b>504</b> dimension and is then expanded in width along the time <b>502</b> dimension as much as is needed to accommodate the total area of allocation A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0265">Because of rounding constraints with the placement of allocation A<b>1</b>, a BFA #<b>1</b> is created below it. At stage 3, the largest remaining allocation A that can fit within BFA #<b>1</b>, if any, is placed below allocation #<b>1</b> A<b>1</b> by packing unit <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0266">At stage 4, the next largest allocation, A<b>2</b>, is dimensioned and placed within subframe <b>404</b>(<b>21</b>). The height and width are determined as follows. For this allocation, striping unit <b>2002</b> extends the width of allocation #<b>2</b> A<b>2</b> as far as possible along the time <b>502</b> dimension. The height of allocation #<b>2</b> A<b>2</b> is then expanded along the frequency <b>504</b> dimension as much as is needed to accommodate the total area of allocation A<b>2</b>. A BFA#<b>2</b> results, and packing of another allocation is attempted.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0267">For allocation #<b>3</b> A<b>3</b>, the height is extended as far as possible, and the width is then expanded as necessary to accommodate the total area of allocation A<b>3</b>. For allocation #<b>4</b> A<b>4</b>, the width is extended as far as possible, and the height is then expanded as necessary to accommodate the total area of allocation A<b>4</b>. A BFA #<b>4</b> is also illustrated. Each BFA is filled in by the largest possible allocation A during the tiling procedure by packing unit <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0268">In this manner, allocations A(i) of connection category #<b>1</b> are dimensioned and placed onto subframe <b>404</b>(<b>21</b>). Some allocations are extended first along the time dimension and then expanded along the frequency dimension until the total area of the allocation is accommodated. Other allocations are extended first along the frequency dimension and then expanded along the time dimension until the total area of the allocation is accommodated. This process need not be alternated each and every time an allocation is tiled. However, by having some allocations extended in height and expanded in width while some other allocations are extended in width and expanded in height, a relatively sizable rectangular area is created in a corner of the subframe that may be reserved for a connections-of-category-#<b>2</b> region. The allocations for these category #<b>2</b> connections are then allotted areas within this rectangular region.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0269"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> is a block diagram <b>2200</b>A of a DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>22</b>) illustrating a striping approach to tiling with allocations having example numerical values. DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>22</b>) is an example subframe composed of 16 slots in width and <b>30</b> slots in height. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, each allocation is assumed to be constrained to be rectangular in shape (e.g., as specified by certain IEEE 802.16 standards).</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0270">The six example allocations A<b>1</b>-A<b>6</b> are listed as follows: allocation A(i)&#x2014;category #<b>1</b> representation on DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>22</b>)-number of slots in allocation A(i). The allocations having numerical examples are: A<b>1</b>-A-100; A<b>2</b>-B-68; A<b>3</b>-C-32; A<b>4</b>-D-16; A<b>5</b>-E-9; and A<b>6</b>-F-4. In DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>22</b>), spares are represented by &#x201c;S&#x201d;, unused slots are represented by &#x201c;U&#x201d;, and slots reserved for connection category #<b>2</b> allocations are represented by &#x201c;2&#x201d;. Spare slots &#x201c;S&#x201d; are those slots that are allocated to a particular allocation as part of a rectangular block but are not needed by that particular allocation. Unused slots &#x201c;U&#x201d; are those slots that are not allocated to any user or group. In block diagram <b>2200</b>A, the resulting slots for these three types are: Spare-S-15; Unused-U-6; and Connection Category #<b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0271">Allocation A<b>1</b> is striped in a first direction. It is striped by extending its height as far as possible before its width is expanded. This creates a pattern on DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>22</b>) (not shown) of three full columns utilizing all 30 slots and a fourth column having 10 utilized &#x201c;A&#x201d; slots. Twenty slots in the fourth column would be wasted because allocation A<b>1</b> is to be rectangular. In order to create a rectangular allocation A<b>1</b> and produce a rectangular BFA &#x201c;under&#x201d; allocation A<b>1</b>, the &#x201c;As&#x201d; are compressed by placing them in a 4&#xd7;25 block of slots. Thus, a BFA can be located in a 4&#xd7;5 block of 20 slots below allocation A<b>1</b>. The largest allocation that can fit within the 20 slot block is allocation A<b>4</b>, as represented by D. With 16 slots in allocation A<b>4</b>, four slots are designated as spares, as represented by &#x201c;S&#x201d;. As is described below with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>, the &#x201c;D&#x201d; slots can also be compressed.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0272">The next largest allocation, A<b>2</b> as represented by &#x201c;Bs&#x201d;, is striped in a second direction. It is striped by extending its width as far as possible before its height is expanded. This striping determines the overall width and height. Four spares &#x201c;S&#x201d; are designated after placing the 68 &#x201c;Bs&#x201d; of allocation A<b>2</b>. The location of the spare slots depends on whether the first dimension or the second dimension is filled up first after an allocation's overall dimensions are determined. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, slots are filled up along the vertical dimension prior to the horizontal dimension, which leaves a vertical column of spare &#x201c;S&#x201d; slots. With allocation A<b>2</b>, no BFA can be created by compression.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0273">The next largest allocation, A<b>3</b> as represented by &#x201c;Cs&#x201d;, is striped in the first direction by placing its 32 &#x201c;Cs&#x201d; appropriately &#x201c;under&#x201d; allocation A<b>2</b> and to the &#x201c;right&#x201d; of allocation A<b>1</b>. It is striped by extending its height as far as possible before its width is expanded. This creates a first column of 24 &#x201c;Cs&#x201d; and a second column of eight &#x201c;Cs&#x201d; (not shown), but a BFA may be created through compression. After compression of the &#x201c;C&#x201d; slots, the originally-allocated 2&#xd7;24 block that would have had 16 spares (e.g., in the second column) becomes a 2&#xd7;16 block with no spares. Thus, this compression results in 16 slots in a 2&#xd7;8 block for a BFA. Because the 16-slot allocation A<b>4</b> has already been tiled, the next largest remaining allocation that can be packed into this 16-slot BFA is the 9-slot allocation A<b>5</b>. The 9 &#x201c;Es&#x201d; of allocation A<b>5</b> are therefore packed into this BFA. This leaves 7 spares &#x201c;S&#x201d;. Compression of this filled-in BFA is described below with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0274">The next largest and last allocation, A<b>6</b> as represented by &#x201c;Fs&#x201d;, is then striped in the second direction. It is striped by extending its width as far as possible before its height is expanded. The four &#x201c;Fs&#x201d; are placed in a row extending in width toward the edge of DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>22</b>). There are six slots that form a rectangle, but go unused, as indicated by the six &#x201c;Us&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0275">This approach of striping in different directions does create a relatively large rectangular block for use by the category #<b>2</b> connections. The resulting 10&#xd7;23 block of slots may be reserved and allocated to connections of category #<b>2</b>, as indicated by the 230&#x201c;2s&#x201d;. A second connection category #<b>2</b> allocation block can be made for the 6 unused slots &#x201c;U&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0276"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> is a block diagram <b>2200</b>B of DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>22</b>) having the example numerical values of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> in which compression and BFA packing are performed iteratively or recursively. A number of refinements may be implemented to potentially improve the overall efficiency of the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> with DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>22</b>). Some of these refinements are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>. For example, the placement of slots during packing into a BFA may be compressed, as is done for the original allocations. Also, BFA packing by packing unit <b>2004</b> may be performed recursively on an initial BFA area. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, the &#x201c;A&#x201d; slots for allocation A<b>1</b> are compressed into a 4&#xd7;25 block to produce a BFA. The overall tiling efficiency can be increased, on average, if this compression is also performed during the BFA packing. For example, if allocation A<b>4</b> is compressed into a 4&#xd7;4 block of 16 &#x201c;D&#x201d; slots, a rectangular 4&#xd7;1 slot is produced for a second BFA packing attempt iteration. Any allocation of four or fewer slots can then be placed in this second level BFA.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0277">As illustrated in block diagram <b>2200</b>B, the 4 &#x201c;F&#x201d; slots of allocation A<b>6</b> are packed into a secondary BFA tiling &#x201c;below&#x201d; the &#x201c;D&#x201d; slots of allocation A<b>4</b>. The &#x201c;E&#x201d; slots of allocation A<b>5</b> were also packed into a primary BFA. Compressing these 9 &#x201c;E&#x201d; slots results in one spare &#x201c;S&#x201d; slot and produces another secondary BFA of six slots (a 2&#xd7;3 block). If there were another allocation of six or fewer slots, it could be packed into this secondary 2&#xd7;3 BFA. This would ultimately increase the size of the connection category #<b>2</b> block. In block diagram <b>2200</b>B, the resulting slots that are not for the first category allocations are: Spare-S-5; Unused-U-6; and Connection Category #<b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>240</b>. For this particular example, employing an iterative recursive approach to BFA packing and compression (i) reduces the number of spare &#x201c;S&#x201d; slots by 10 and (ii) produces an extra 10 slots for category #<b>2</b> connections as the rectangular region for it can be started a row higher.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0278">In the description below of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-31</figref>, the two dimensions of each tile are referred to generically as length and breadth. The length and breadth can be defined on any direction of a subframe and to any dimensional units (e.g., frequency or time). The length of an allocation during tiling is extended toward a subframe edge or maximum value of one dimension. The breadth of the allocation is then expanded along the other dimension to accommodate a size of the allocation being tiled.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0279"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a flow diagram <b>2300</b> that illustrates an example general method for a striping approach to tiling bandwidth allocations. Flow diagram <b>2300</b> includes two (2) blocks <b>2302</b> and <b>2304</b>. Although the actions of flow diagram <b>2300</b> may be performed in other environments and with a variety of hardware, firmware, and/or software combinations, the environments and components otherwise described herein and/or illustrated in the referenced figures are used to illuminate example implementations of the method.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0280">A subframe is depicted as part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. This subframe has a first dimension and a second dimension. Either the first dimension or the second dimension may correspond to time, with the other dimension corresponding to frequency. The illustrated subframe includes allocations A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>. An allocation A<b>3</b> is being tiled next.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0281">At block <b>2302</b>, a first allocation is striped lengthwise along the first dimension with a breadth along the second dimension determined responsive to a size of the first allocation. For example, allocation A<b>3</b> represents a first allocation that is striped by extending its length along the first dimension and then expanding its breadth along the second dimension so as to accommodate the total bandwidth of allocation A<b>3</b>. Allocation A<b>4</b> is next tiled onto the illustrated subframe in the direction of the first dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0282">At block <b>2304</b>, a second allocation is striped lengthwise along the second dimension with a breadth along the first dimension determined responsive to a size of the second allocation. For example, allocation A<b>5</b> represents a second allocation that is striped by extending its length along the second dimension and then expanding its breadth along the first dimension so as to accommodate the total bandwidth of allocation A<b>5</b>. Afterwards, allocation A<b>6</b> is tiled onto the subframe in the direction of the first dimension, and allocation A<b>7</b> is tiled onto the subframe in the direction of the second dimension. After each of the first connection category allocations are tiled, a rectangular tile for the second category connections is reserved.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0283"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-27</figref> jointly show a flow diagram that illustrates a more-specific example method for a striping approach to tiling bandwidth allocations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> are flow diagrams <b>2400</b>, <b>2500</b>, <b>2600</b>, and <b>2700</b>, respectively. In combination, these flow diagrams textually illustrate a more-specific example method for tiling bandwidth allocations using a striping approach. Each flow diagram also includes accompanying block diagrams to further illuminate certain principles of the method.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0284">Flow diagram <b>2400</b> includes six (6) blocks <b>2402</b>-<b>2412</b> and illustrates an example setup for the method.

Although the flow diagrams are directed to tiling a DL subframe, the method is also applicable to tiling UL subframes.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0285">At block <b>2402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the method is started with a DL subframe having a first dimension and a second dimension. Either of the first and second dimensions may correspond to time or frequency. A portion of a DL subframe is typically consumed by overhead communications for the wireless system.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0286">At block <b>2404</b>, first connection category allocations are ranked by size, from largest to smallest. These example allocations A(i) are indicated to be A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b> . . . An. At block <b>2406</b>, a current tiling coordinate (CTC) is established in the DL subframe. Because no allocations have yet been tiled, the CTC may be established at, for example, any of the four corners of unused area of the DL subframe.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0287">At block <b>2408</b>, the largest remaining first category allocation is selected. In the first loop, this allocation is A<b>1</b>. As indicated by block <b>2410</b>, the method continues at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0288">The method continues from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> at block <b>2502</b>. Flow diagram <b>2500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates the alternating nature of striping allocations in different directions along the two dimensions. At block <b>2504</b>A, for the selected allocation, the breadth of the second dimension is determined responsive to (i) the available length along the first dimension of the DL subframe and (ii) the size of the selected allocation. For example, allocation A<b>1</b> may be striped lengthwise along the first dimension and then expanded in breadth along the second dimension to accommodate the total size of allocation A<b>1</b>. A more mathematical striping description of bandwidth allocation tiling is provided herein below with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0289">The alternate pass or direction (of block <b>2504</b>B) is described herein below as part of a second pass through the method. As noted herein above and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the direction of striping need not be alternated each and every pass through the method. As indicated by block <b>2506</b>, the method continues at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0290">The method continues from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> at block <b>2602</b>. At block <b>2604</b>, the selected allocation is placed within the DL subframe. For example, allocation A<b>1</b> is indicated as being placed within the DL subframe by the cross-hatched area. As is apparent, due to rounding constraints, there is extra unused spaced between the actual allocated bandwidth for A<b>1</b> and the preliminary dimensioning.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0291">This extra area is shown in conjunction with block <b>2606</b> at tiling areas <b>2606</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>2606</b>(<b>2</b>). The preliminary dimensioning of the tile for allocation A<b>1</b> is tiling area <b>2606</b>(<b>1</b>) when allocation A<b>1</b> is striped completely toward the edge of the first dimension. However, this creates a wasted area when operating in accordance with a standard that requires allocation tiles to be rectangular. A BFA may potentially be created by adjusting the actual slot placement.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0292">At block <b>2606</b>, the proportions of the placed allocation are adjusted. For example, by compressing the actual placement of individual slots, the final area for allocation A<b>1</b> may be made rectangular while also creating a rectangular BFA. This is shown by tiling area <b>2606</b>(<b>2</b>). As indicated by block <b>2608</b>, the method continues at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>.</p>

At block <b>2704</b>, packing other allocation(s) into the BFA is attempted. For example, allocation A<b>6</b> may be packed into the BFA as shown. As described herein above with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the packing (and slot placement compression, if appropriate) may be performed iteratively.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0294">At block <b>2706</b>, the CTC in the DL subframe is updated. For example, the location of the CTC may be moved to compensate for the newly tiled area by adding the breadth of the new allocation to the CTC. As shown, when the recent tiling is extended along the first dimension and expanded along the second dimension, the CTC is moved along the second dimension an amount equal to the breadth of the newly-tiled allocation. CTC updating is described in more detail herein below with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0295">At block <b>2708</b>, it is determined if there are more first connection category allocations that remain to be tiled. If so, then at block <b>2710</b>, the direction of striping with respect to the first and second dimensions of the DL subframe is switched. In other words, the striping direction is swapped, which is also indicated by the alternate path of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> along with alternative blocks <b>2504</b>A and <b>2504</b>B. As indicated previously, this switching need not be performed after each tiling.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0296">At block <b>2712</b>, the method is repeated from block <b>2412</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, block <b>2412</b> indicates that the method is continued at block <b>2408</b>. At block <b>2408</b>, the next largest remaining first category allocation is selected.

Flow diagram <b>2500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates the alternating nature of striping allocations in different directions along the two dimensions. In this example second loop, the action(s) of block <b>2504</b>B are performed. At block <b>2504</b>B, for the selected allocation, the breadth of the first dimension is determined responsive to (i) the available length along the second dimension of the DL subframe and (ii) the size of the selected allocation. For example, allocation A<b>2</b> may be striped lengthwise along the second dimension and then expanded in breadth along the first dimension to accommodate the total size of allocation A<b>2</b>. Some amount or frequency of alternating the striping directions for the first connection category allocations facilitates the production of a rectangular region for the second connection category allocations.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0298">Continuing with flow diagram <b>2700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, if there are no more first connection category allocations (as determined at block <b>2708</b>), the tiling of first connection category allocations is completed as indicated by block <b>2714</b>. At block <b>2716</b>, the tiling of the second connection category allocations can be completed by placing in the DL subframe at least one rectangular tile having an area at least as great as the total size of all of the second connection category allocations. For example, the area for the second category connections may be as large as can be accommodated by the remaining subframe area after the first connection category allocations have been tiled as long as a rectangular shape is maintained. This area for the second category connections may be limited by the total demand of all of the connections in the second category. Additionally, a given wireless standard may limit the maximum size of each block in a particular region.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0299"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> includes a block diagram and a flow diagram <b>2800</b> that illustrate a mathematical example for a striping approach to tiling bandwidth allocations.

Although the actions of flow diagram <b>2800</b> may be performed in other environments and with a variety of hardware, firmware, and/or software combinations, the environments and components otherwise described herein and/or illustrated in the referenced figures are used to illuminate example implementations of the method.</p>

The &#x201c;A(i)_Area_Allocation&#x201d; variable represents the allocated area for connections A(i). The &#x201c;CTC#<b>1</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub>2D&#x201d; variable represents the value of CTC #<b>1</b> along the second dimension. The &#x201c;ceil&#x201d; function rounds up the value of its object (e.g., 2.39 is rounded up to 3.0 by the &#x201c;ceil&#x201d; function). The value &#x201c;(2DM-CTC#<b>1</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub>2D)&#x201d; is the preliminary length for allocation A(i). The &#x201c;1D Val&#x201d; is the breadth of allocation A(i).
</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0304">The proportions of allocation A(i) are adjusted by compressing the actual slot placement to produce a BFA.

The striping techniques that are illustrated in previous figures (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20</figref>, <b>23</b>, <b>28</b>, etc.) form a right angle pattern as allocations are striped in different directions. However, other patterns may be formed when striping allocations in alternate directions. An example alternative pattern is the spiral pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0313">The right-angle pattern shown in previous figures produces a rectangular area for a second category of connections that is located, more or less, in a corner quadrant. In contrast, the spiral pattern produces a rectangular area for a second category of connections that is located, more or less, in a centralized region.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0314">DL subframes <b>404</b>(<b>29</b>-A) and <b>404</b>(<b>29</b>-B) illustrate two different spiral techniques. DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>29</b>-A) illustrates a spiral technique that applies the BFA strategy for packing relatively smaller allocations onto the subframe. DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>29</b>-B), on the other hand, attempts to tile a next largest allocation without leaving any BFAs.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0315">With reference to DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>29</b>-A), allocation A<b>1</b> is tiled along the second dimension toward the 2D maximum. A BFA is created &#x201c;below&#x201d; allocation A<b>1</b>. The largest allocation that can fit within the BFA, allocation A<b>8</b>, is packed into this area. Starting from the edge of allocation A<b>1</b>, allocation A<b>2</b> is tiled along the first dimension toward the 1D maximum.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0316">Allocation A<b>3</b> is then tiled &#x201c;upward&#x201d; along the second dimension toward an edge of the second dimension, which may be considered the 2D maximum in that direction. Allocations A<b>4</b>, A<b>5</b>, A<b>6</b>, and A<b>7</b> are then tiled in a continuing spiral pattern. If there were an allocation, say allocation A<b>9</b>, that would fit to the right of allocation A<b>2</b>, to the left of tiled allocation A<b>4</b>, or below allocation A<b>5</b>, it would have been packed into one of these BFAs.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0317">With reference to DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>29</b>-B), BFAs are largely eliminated. Again, allocation A<b>1</b> is tiled along the second dimension toward the 2D maximum. To prevent the formation of a BFA, the next allocation is to be tiled, at least partially, &#x201c;below&#x201d; allocation A<b>1</b>. In this example, allocation A<b>2</b> will not fit both below allocation A<b>1</b> and within the confines of the first dimension. Consequently, allocation A<b>3</b> is tiled along the first dimension toward the 1D maximum because it also fits below tiled allocation A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0318">Allocations are continued to be tiled in decreasing size order. However, allocation A<b>2</b> cannot fit to the right of tiled allocation A<b>3</b> and within the confines of the second dimension. Consequently, the next largest allocation, allocation A<b>4</b>, is tiled. This spiral tiling procedure is continued through allocations A<b>5</b> and A<b>6</b> until there is ample area for allocation A<b>2</b> to be tiled. Allocations A<b>7</b> and A<b>8</b> are then tiled in the spiral pattern. A central region remains for the tiling of a rectangle for the connections of category #<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0319">There is a likelihood that the spiral technique of DL subframe <b>404</b>(<b>29</b>-B) will also eventually result in one or more BFAs, as shown to the right of tiled allocation A<b>2</b> and above tiled allocation A<b>7</b>, which may be unfillable. Moreover, there is a possibility that there may never be a sufficiently-sizable area for a larger allocation, such as allocation A<b>2</b>, to be tiled onto the subframe after it is skipped earlier in the tiling process. For these reasons, the spiral pattern technique for striping allocation tiles that is illustrated in subframe <b>404</b>(<b>29</b>-A) generally offers a greater certainty of a successful, efficient tiling as compared to the technique illustrated in subframe <b>404</b>(<b>29</b>-B).</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0320"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> depicts block diagrams of DL subframes <b>404</b>(<b>30</b>-A) and <b>404</b>(<b>30</b>-B) illustrating a first example quadrant-oriented technique for a striping approach to tiling bandwidth allocations. These example quadrant-oriented techniques may also be considered corner-initiated striping approaches to tiling because the tiling is started in one of four different corners. Especially in systems that are not loaded to full capacity, these quadrant-oriented techniques can reduce overall system interference. Although they can be implemented in systems of varying load levels, they are particularly adept at reducing interference when each base station is operating at approximately 25% of capacity or less. More specifically, if there are four potentially-interfering base stations, the interference can be reduced to zero if the load on each of them is 25% of capacity of less. Even in systems with greater than 25% load, interference can be reduced and performance can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0321">At subframes <b>404</b>(<b>30</b>-A) and <b>404</b>(<b>30</b>-B), tiling is largely confined to one of four quadrants: 1, 2, 3, or 4. To establish this confinement, the size of the subframe area is artificially limited to T&#xd7;f. Because the total demand for slots in a given frame is known, the values of T and f may be found subject to: Total_Demand_Category#<b>1</b>_Connections&#x2267;T&#xd7;f. More specifically, the following example computations may be employed. If the size of the original subframe area is M&#xd7;N (e.g., area A=M&#xd7;N) and the demand for the allocation is A<b>1</b>, then T=M&#xd7;&#x221a;(A<b>1</b>/A) and f=N&#xd7;&#x221a;(A<b>1</b>/A) where &#x201c;&#x221a;&#x201d; represents the square root function. It is probably prudent to increase T and f by a few percents (e.g., 5-10%) above the computed values to account for the round-ups that are likely to occur during the tiling.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0322">Tiling may still be performed by striping allocations in alternate directions and packing BFAs. However, the values for 1D Maximum and 2D Maximum (from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>) are artificially limited to the values determined for T and f. The rectangular tile for second category connections is located in a corner of the artificial subframe region that remains after the first category connection allocations are tiled in the right-angle pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0323">The tiling may be started at any and each of the four quadrant corners: 1, 2, 3, or 4. Tiling is initiated at corner 1 for subframe <b>404</b>(<b>30</b>-A) and at corner 3 for subframe <b>404</b>(<b>30</b>-B). Different base stations may start at different corners. For example, a first base station may start at corner 1 while a second base station starts at corner 3. This approach is particularly applicable to AMC zones. In some other modes (e.g., PUSC zones), the frequency assignment to different base stations are random and/or rotate over time. Hence, quadrants 1 and 4 (and similarly for quadrants 2 and 3) would interfere in frequency. In these modes, the separation focus can be in time. Each mode covers the entire frequency band and only a fraction of time in dependence on the allocation size. For example, there can be three non-overlapping areas in time, which are assigned to three interfering sectors of each base station.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0324">With subframe <b>404</b>(<b>30</b>-A), the tile for the second category connections is located at the bottom-right area of the artificial subframe but near the center of the actual overall subframe. With subframe <b>404</b>(<b>30</b>-B), the tile for the second category connections is located at the top-left area of the artificial subframe but also near the center of the actual overall subframe. If each base station is loaded by less than approximately 25%, there is no overlap and thus essentially no interference.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0325">If the base station loading is greater than 25%, then the interfering communications are, at least in the initial loadings above 25%, in the likely overlap region, which is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. This likely overlap region corresponds to second category connections. If the second category connections are non-real-time, capable of retransmission without harm, and/or adapted for automatic retransmissions, then any interference that occurs is mitigated. In other words, if the first and second categories of connections are defined such that the second category connections are better able to withstand communication problems resulting from interference, the initiation of tiling in different corners at different base stations can improve overall system performance even if loading exceeds 25% of capacity. For example, HARQ connections in IEEE 802.16 systems are designed to handle automatic retransmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0326">Each base station may start in a different corner of the subframe based on a random determination (e.g., for each subframe). Alternatively, each base station may be assigned a different corner when a wireless system is being planned. Regardless, the corner of tiling initiation and/or the corner selection algorithm may be modified after deployment. As another alternative implementation, instead of a corner initiation, the tiling may be initiated by a base station at any coordinate on the subframe (e.g., to randomly reduce interference).</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0327"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> depicts block diagrams of DL subframes <b>404</b>(<b>31</b>-A) and <b>404</b>(<b>31</b>-B) illustrating a second example quadrant-oriented technique for a striping approach to tiling bandwidth allocations. In this second example quadrant-oriented technique, the artificial subframe is originally sized based on the total demand for slots by the first category connections while excluding the demand by the second category connections. Accordingly, T&#xd7;f is set responsive to the first connection category allocations. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, these are allocations A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b>, and A<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0328">Thus, the tiles that are striped for first connection category allocations effectively form a block. The second category connections are then tiled in two groups: Category #<b>2</b>-<b>1</b> and Category #<b>2</b>-<b>2</b>. This creates a buffer zone of second category connections around the block of tiled allocations that are of the first connection category. This is illustrated by the two ovals indicating likely regions of overlap between the two (or three or four) base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0329">This second corner-initiated technique for striping can therefore improve the interference handling attributes as compared to the first corner-initiated technique (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>). However, there is increased complexity because the second category connections are separated into two different tiles on the DL subframe. Alternatively, the second category connections can still be tiled in one larger rectangle, such as to either exposed side of the combined block of first category connection tiles.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0330"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-19</figref> (distributive) and <b>20</b>-<b>31</b> (striping) are described primarily in terms of tiling bandwidth allocations onto a DL subframe. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32-35</figref>, on the other hand, are described primarily in terms of tiling bandwidth allocations on a UL subframe. Nevertheless, the principles described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-31</figref> may also be applied to UL subframes, and the principles described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32-35</figref> may also be applied to organize DL subframes. It is also noted that the distributive approach to tiling (or the striping approach to tiling) can be used internally to organize any overall tiling rectangle for the second category connections.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0331"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is a block diagram <b>3200</b> of two base stations <b>102</b> and multiple subscriber stations <b>104</b> that illustrate inter-base station interference. Block diagram <b>3200</b> includes a first wireless area <b>3202</b>(<b>1</b>) and a second wireless area <b>3202</b>(<b>2</b>). Wireless area <b>3202</b>(<b>1</b>) is served by a first base station <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>), and wireless area <b>3202</b>(<b>2</b>) is served by a second base station <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>). Base station <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) is in communication with subscriber stations <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-A), <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-F), <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-G), and <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-H). Base station <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) is in communication with subscriber stations <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>-A), <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>-B), and <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>-C).</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0332">A number of typical wireless system characteristics may be described with reference to block diagram <b>3200</b>. First, subscriber stations <b>104</b> that are relatively distant from base stations <b>102</b> usually transmit at a higher power than those subscriber stations <b>104</b> that are relatively proximate to base stations <b>102</b>. Consequently, relatively distant subscriber stations <b>104</b>, such as <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-A) and <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>-A), transmit at a higher power and therefore generate a greater amount of interfering electromagnetic emissions with respect to other base stations than relatively proximate subscriber stations <b>104</b>, such as <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-H) and <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>-C).</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0333">Second, the relative distances between a base station <b>102</b> and respective subscriber stations <b>104</b> may be estimated using Carrier-to-Interference Noise Ratio (CINR) values. The lower that a CINR value of a subscriber station <b>104</b> is, the farther the subscriber station <b>104</b> is likely to be from its base station <b>102</b>. Hence, the CINR of subscriber station <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>-C) is probably greater than the CINR of subscriber station <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>-B), and the CINR of subscriber station <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>-B) is probably greater than the CINR of subscriber station <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>-A).</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0334"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> depicts block diagrams of two UL subframe organizations <b>408</b>(<b>33</b>-<b>1</b>) and <b>408</b>(<b>33</b>-<b>2</b>) that can mitigate inter-base station interference. A time (t) and frequency (f) axis <b>3302</b> is also shown. UL subframe for BS #<b>1</b> <b>408</b>(<b>33</b>-<b>1</b>) is divided into two approximately equal areas. However, the 50% split is illustrative only; the areas need not be equal in size or be two in number (e.g., two areas may be divided 60-40, three areas may be divided 33-33-33 or 40-30-30, etc.). The first area includes allocations for users <b>1</b>-A, <b>1</b>-B, <b>1</b>-C, <b>1</b>-D, and <b>1</b>-E that are each part of a first category of connections. The first area also includes a region for second category connections. The second area is an unused area. However, it may be otherwise designated. For instance, in accordance with the requirements of certain standards, it may be defined in the MAP as a valid area but left unpopulated. Example approaches include implementing a zone switch, assigning the area as a phony allocation (e.g., a second category region that is left blank), and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0335">UL subframe for BS #<b>2</b> <b>408</b>(<b>33</b>-<b>2</b>) is also divided into two approximately equal areas. The first area is an unused area. The second area includes allocations for users <b>2</b>-A, <b>2</b>-B, <b>2</b>-C, <b>2</b>-D, and <b>2</b>-E that are each part of a first category of connections. The second area also includes a region for second category connections. The example UL subframes specifically pertain to systems in which UL allocations need not be rectangular; nevertheless, the principles described herein are also applicable to subframes having rectangular tiled allocations.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0336">In a lightly loaded system, the UL subframe organization can be instituted in such a way so as to reduce interference to other base stations through the use of spare, unused areas. These unused areas may be designated as being for category #<b>2</b> connections, such as being setup as phony HARQ regions in IEEE 802.16 systems, for example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> presents an example of two interfering base stations labeled as BS #<b>1</b> and BS #<b>2</b>. The UL subframe organization policy of BS #<b>1</b> is to fill up the first half of UL subframe <b>408</b>(<b>33</b>-<b>1</b>). The UL subframe organization policy of BS #<b>2</b> is to fill up the second half of UL subframe <b>408</b>(<b>332</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0337">This policy enables each base station to receive on the UL from its subscriber stations when the subscriber stations of the other base station are not transmitting. Interference is therefore reduced. By placing the second category connection region between the allocations for connections of the first category and the unused area, the second category connection region can be used as a buffer zone in situations when the load exceeds 50%. Using category #<b>2</b> connections as a buffer zone is also described herein above with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0338">These example UL subframe organization policies can also be extended and applied to cases involving more than two base stations. The UL subframe may be divided, for example, into the number of relevant interfering base stations, such as three or four. The area assigned to each base station may be selected randomly or may be designated during system planning.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0339"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> depicts block diagrams of two other UL subframe organizations <b>408</b>(<b>34</b>-<b>1</b>) and <b>408</b>(<b>34</b>-<b>2</b>) that can mitigate inter-base station interference. A time (t) and frequency (f) axis <b>3402</b> is also shown. In this example, it is assumed that the load of base station <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) is such that it has to overlap the time area of the other base station. Overall interference may be reduced if those overlapping time areas are filled with second category connections for users that have a high CINR, which indicates that the subscriber stations <b>104</b> of such high-CINR users are near base station <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, base station <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) is in communication with subscriber stations <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>-F), <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>-G), and <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>-H). The CINR value of subscriber station <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-F) is lower than either of the CINR values of subscriber stations <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-G) or <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>H).</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0340">Consequently, base station <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) determines that subscriber station <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-F) is most likely to be the most distant from base station <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) and thus the most likely to interfere with other base stations, such as base station <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>), during transmission. In contrast, subscriber stations <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-G) and <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-H) are likely relatively close and thus less likely to interfere with other base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0341">Hence, the second category connection of subscriber station <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-F) is assigned to the first area, when base station <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) need not receive from its subscriber stations <b>104</b>. The second category connections of subscriber stations <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-G) and <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-H) are assigned to the second area, when base station <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) is receiving from its subscriber stations <b>104</b> because subscriber stations <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-G) and <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>-H) are less likely to cause interference.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0342"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> depicts block diagrams of two UL subframe portions <b>3500</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>3500</b>(<b>2</b>) that can be used to mitigate inter-base station interference. In AMC zones, subchannels have relatively closely clustered subcarriers (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Hence, in AMC zones, interference can be reduced by separating subscriber stations in frequency. For example, if the subscriber stations in the region of BS #<b>1</b> are interfering with the subscriber stations in the region of BS #<b>2</b>, each base station can adopt a policy for UL subframe organization that matches high CINR values at one base station with low CINR values at the other base station, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0343">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, each of BS #<b>1</b> and BS #<b>2</b> is in communication with three subscriber stations A, B, C, which correspond to users A, B, and C, respectively. For BS #<b>1</b>, CINR_<b>1</b>-A&#x3c;CINR_<b>1</b>-B&#x3c;CINR_<b>1</b>-C. For BS #<b>2</b>, CINR_<b>2</b>-A&#x3c;CINR_<b>2</b>-B&#x3c;CINR_<b>2</b>-C.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0344">By way of example only, the UL subframe organizational policy of BS #<b>1</b> is to schedule the users with lowest CINR at the top frequencies and fill up the band in frequency as the CINR increases. On the other hand, the policy of BS #<b>2</b> is to follow an opposite allocation order such that the user having the lowest CINR is placed at the bottom frequencies and the frequency band is filled up by adding users with higher CINR values at decreasing frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0345">When following this example policy and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the increasing frequency order for users allocated in UL subframe portion for BS #<b>1</b> <b>3500</b>(<b>1</b>) is: user <b>1</b>-A, user <b>1</b>-B, and user <b>1</b>-C. The increasing frequency order for users allocated in UL subframe portion for BS #<b>2</b> <b>3500</b>(<b>2</b>) is: user <b>2</b>-C, user <b>2</b>-B, user <b>2</b>-A.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0346"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is a flow diagram <b>3600</b> that illustrates an example general method for placing bandwidth allocations onto subframes <b>404</b>/<b>408</b> to mitigate inter-base station interference. Flow diagram <b>3600</b> includes three (3) blocks <b>3602</b>-<b>3606</b>. Although the actions of flow diagram <b>3600</b> may be performed in other environments and with a variety of hardware, firmware, and/or software combinations, the environments and components otherwise described herein and/or illustrated in the referenced figures are used to illuminate example implementations of the method. The actions of flow diagram <b>3600</b> may be performed by an allocation placement module, such as allocation placement module <b>3714</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0347">A subframe <b>404</b>/<b>408</b> is depicted as part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. The three depictions of subframe <b>404</b>/<b>408</b> change in accordance with the action(s) of the associated respective block <b>3602</b>, <b>3604</b>, and <b>3606</b>. This subframe <b>404</b>/<b>408</b> has a first dimension and a second dimension. Either the first dimension or the second dimension may correspond to frequency, with the other dimension corresponding to time. Subframe <b>404</b>/<b>408</b> may be a DL subframe <b>404</b> or an UL subframe <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0348">At block <b>3602</b>, an allocation placement target (APT) is ascertained. For example, an APT may be ascertained on subframe <b>404</b>/<b>408</b>. The APT may be a CTC (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-28</figref>), may be a corner or quadrant (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-31</figref>), may be a region or portion of the subframe (e.g., as shown for specific users in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-34</figref>), and so forth. Hence, the APT may be a starting coordinate on the subframe, a corner/quadrant defined on the subframe, a portion delineated on the subframe, and so forth. In the associated subframe <b>404</b>/<b>408</b>, a starting coordinate APT and a regional APT are both shown by way of example.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0349">The APT may be ascertained in any of many possible manners. For example, it may be ascertained by retrieving it from a storage location at the base station if the APT is unchanging. Alternatively, it may be ascertained from a random decision-making process at the base station. Furthermore, it may be ascertained from communication(s) with other base stations and/or with a centralized controller. Regardless, the ascertainment technique may involve an inter-base station level of coordination so that different respective base stations ascertain different respective APTs, at least on average.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0350">At block <b>3604</b>, allocations are placed proximate to the allocation placement target. For example, bandwidth allocations may be placed starting at the APT, within the APT, near the APT, or otherwise with respect to the APT. As shown in the associated subframe, allocations A<b>1</b>-A<b>6</b> are placed proximate to the APT. By way of example only, they can start at the APT-specified coordinate (e.g., where allocation A<b>1</b> is placed), be placed so as to be contained within the APT region (e.g., as allocations A<b>1</b>-A<b>6</b> have been placed), and so forth. Although not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the set of allocations may be placed starting at a corner of the subframe, within a quadrant of the subframe, and so forth. It should be understood that the total demand may cause the allocations to need to be placed beyond a desired APT region when capacity exceeds a given level.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0351">The placed allocations may be any shape and may be identified on the subframe in any manner. They may be rectangular tiles (e.g., allocations A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>4</b>, and A<b>5</b>), irregular shapes (e.g., allocations A<b>3</b> and A<b>4</b>), and so forth. The allocations may be placed in a right-angle pattern, in a spiral pattern, randomly, irregularly, some combination thereof, and so forth. Allocations may be identified by two corners for a rectangular shape, by a starting point and an ending point for allocations placed in a ribbon manner, by an amalgamation of shapes forming an allocation, by some combination thereof, and so forth. Although not specifically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, there may be unused areas between allocations resulting from relatively inefficient placements.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0352">At block <b>3606</b>, an allocation placement area is created and allocation-free area(s) are created. For example, at least one allocation placement area <b>3608</b> may be created on the subframe. This allocation placement area <b>3608</b> corresponds to the area of the subframe on which allocations are placed with the action(s) of block <b>3604</b>. As a result of placing allocations proximately to the APT, one or more allocation-free areas <b>3610</b> are produced. As illustrated, four (4) allocation-free areas <b>3610</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>3610</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>3610</b>(<b>3</b>), and <b>3610</b>(<b>4</b>) are produced.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0353">Allocation-free areas <b>3610</b> are areas for which a particular base station has determined that it will not be transmitting (for a DL subframe <b>404</b>) or receiving (for an UL subframe <b>408</b>), or more generally transceiving, in the current subframe. Consequently, one or more other base stations can communicate wirelessly in these allocation-free areas <b>3610</b> without causing or suffering from interference with respect to the particular base station.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0354">As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref>, these areas <b>3608</b> and <b>3610</b> may be roughly rectangular and correspond to quadrants for interference mitigation among as many as four different base stations. As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, these areas <b>3608</b> and <b>3610</b> may be roughly rectangular and correspond to subframe halves to mitigate interference between two different base stations. However, other area percentages, area shapes, area locations, numbers of base stations, etc. may be involved in such interference mitigation by separating subframes into areas using ascertained APTs and proximate allocation placements. The relative sizes of the areas may be equal for each base station (e.g., each of three base station is given &#x2153; of each subframe), may be set and/or weighted based on other parameter(s) (e.g., a current loading level at each base station), and so forth.</p>
