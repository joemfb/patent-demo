<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to genes and proteins that can be used in vaccination, detection and identification of spotted fever rickettsiae infection. More particularly, the invention relates to specific nucleotide sequences encoding a highly specific and immunogenic portion of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of <i>Rickettsia rickettsii</i>. The polypeptide sequence can be utilized in diagnostic and detection assays for spotted fever rickettsiae and as an immunogen component in vaccine formulations against spotted fever <i>Rickettsia. </i></p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Rickettsiae are Gram-negative, obligate intracellular parasites of the genus <i>Rickettsia</i>. They are responsible for many spotted fever group <i>Rickettsia </i>infection, and typhus group infection [1]. Of the spotted fever group, Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the most severe and most frequently reported rickettsial illness in the United States. It also occurs in Mexico and in central and south America. The disease is caused by <i>Rickettsia rickettsii</i>, a species of bacteria that is transmitted to humans by ixodid (hard) ticks. Rickettsiae target vascular endothelium. Other named species of the spotted fever group and their geographic distributions are listed in table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) can be treated easily with antibiotics. If the patient is treated within the first 4-5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours. However, it is very difficult to make a clinical diagnosis in the disease's early stages. The early clinical presentation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is nonspecific and may resemble a variety of other diseases including influenza, measles, and rubella, as well as other rickettsial diseases [2]. The classic symptoms of RMSF are sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle pain, followed by development of rash, abdominal pain, joint pain, and diarrhea [2]. However, this combination of symptoms is not always detected when the patient initially presents for care. Without prompt and appropriate treatment, the disease can be fatal. Long-term health problems following acute Rocky Mountain spotted fever infection include partial paralysis of the lower extremities, gangrene requiring amputation of fingers, toes, or arms or legs, hearing loss, loss of bowel or bladder control, movement disorders, and language disorders. These complications are most frequent in persons recovering from severe, life-threatening form of the disease, often following lengthy hospitalizations. Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment at the onset of the disease is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Serologic assays are the most widely available and frequently used methods for confirming cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The indirect immunofluoresence assay (IFA) is generally considered the reference standard in Rocky Mountain spotted fever serology and is the test currently used by Center of Disease Control and most state public health laboratories, but other well validated assays can also be used in diagnosis, including indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA), ELISA, latex agglutination, and dot immunoassays [2].</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">IFA can be used to detect either IgG or IgM antibodies. Blood samples taken at early (acute) and late (convalescent) stages of the disease are the preferred specimens for evaluation. Most patients demonstrate increased IgM titers by the end of the first week of illness. Diagnostic levels of IgG antibody generally do not appear until 7-10 days after the onset of illness. The value of testing two sequential serum or plasma samples together to show a rising antibody level is very important in confirming acute infection with rickettsial agents because antibody titers may persist in some individuals for years after the original exposure to cross-reactive rickettsial agents. IgG antibodies are more specific and reliable since other bacterial infections can also cause elevations in riskettsial IgM antibody titers. One of the disadvantage in using IFA to diagnose Rocky Mountain spotted fever is that most patients visit their physician relatively early in the course of the illness, before the presences of diagnostic antibody level. In addition, variations in the endpoint titer may occur due to differences in the quality of the microscope, the quality of the anti-immunoglobulin conjugate, and the experience of the technician.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Both IHA and latex agglutination rely on a common source of rickettsial antigen, extracted from <i>R. rickettsii</i>. This antigenic material is coated on sheep or human type O erythrocytes for IHA and onto latex beads for latex agglutination. Although IHA test demonstrates the earliest, steepest rise in antibody titer of all serologic tests for RMSF, it is rarely used as the diagnostic method in acute state of the illness. Only 19% of patients with RMSF had an acute titer of 40, which is much lower value than CDC's criterion for using a single titer indicating a probable diagnosis (&#x2267;128) [2]. The latex agglutination test is technically simple and rapid and requires no elaborate equipment. However, latex agglutination test is inappropriate for serosurveys and is more diagnostically discriminatory for establishing the diagnosis of a recent infection because the detectable antibody has persistent presentation months after the onset of illness [2].</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Although routinely used in retrospective confirmatory diagnosis, current serologic methods are not considered appropriate rapid acute diagnostic tests. Very seldom are specific antibodies to <i>R. rickettsii </i>detected during the acute stage of illness when empiric treatment must begin. The most rapid and specific diagnostic assays for Rocky Mountain spotted fever rely on molecular methods like PCR, which can detect DNA of 5-10 rickettsial organisms in a sample. While organisms can be detected in whole blood samples obtained at the acute onset of illness in a few hours, rickettsial DNA is most readily detected in fresh skin biopsies like those used in immunostaining procedures. PCR can also be done on the fixed tissues used in immunostaining, but it is less sensitive than with unfixed tissues. PCR methods can be <i>R. rickettsii</i>-specific but are usually confirmed by DNA sequencing of the amplified gene fragments. Consequently, this procedure is more specific than antibody-based methods which are often only genus or spotted fever group-specific. However, gene amplification requires sophisticated instrumentation and reagents generally not available in most rural medical facilities. In addition, extensive training is required for the end users to achieve accurate and standardized results.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another approach to Rocky Mountain spotted fever diagnostics is immunostaining. This method is used by taking a skin biopsy of the rash from an infected patient prior to therapy or within the first 48 hours after starting the antibiotic therapy. However, because rickettsiae are focally distributed in lesions of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, this test may not always detect an agent. Even in laboratories with expertise in performing this test, the sensitivity is only about 70% on biopsied tissues because of the scarcity of organisms in some samples.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Two major outer membrane proteins of spotted fever group Rickettsiae, OmpA and OmpB, have been identified as major immunogenic antigens. Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) has an apparent molecular mass of 190 kDa. Immunization with recombinant rOmpA (<i>Rickettsia </i>OmpA) protects guinea pigs against a lethal dose of <i>R. rickettsii</i>. The rOmpA gene of (<i>R. Rickettsia</i>) contains 6747 nucleotides that code for 2249 amino acid protein [5]. Moreover, immunization with recombinant OmpA of <i>R. conorii </i>completely protects guinea pigs against challenge with <i>R. conorii </i>and partially protects against challenge with <i>R. rickettsii [</i>6]. OmpA of <i>R. Rickettsii </i>was also shown to react strongly with sera from patients infected with <i>R. rickettsii </i>and other spotted fever group <i>Rickettsia</i>. Based on these observations, therefore, OmpA is a particularly advantageous target for developing diagnostic reagents against spotted fever group <i>Rickettsia</i>, especially against <i>R. Rickettsii</i>, the causative agent of RMSF.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Study of spotted fever group <i>Rickettsia </i>has led to the identification of OmpA, which is an exceptionally promising candidate as a reagent for use in diagnostic and detection assays, as well as in vaccine formulations. Central to the development and standardization of improved detection and diagnostic immunoassay methods is the development of more effective antigens for use in antibody-based methods. With a molecular weight of 190 kDa, however, OmpA is difficult to express and purify. Therefore, the large OmpA (190 kDa), is divided into five epitope-containing fragments: W (94 kDa), R (47 kDa), X (25 kDa), Y (26 kDa), and Z (70 kDa) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Each fragment can be found in a region of OmpA that is predicted to be rich in epitopes. An epitope is the region of an antigen to which the variable region of an antibody binds. Most antigens have a large number of epitopes. The purified antigens may then be used to detect antibodies against Rickettsiae caused spotted fever, and diagnose the disease. By invoking an immunogenic reaction, the antigens may also be used as vaccines. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the location of these fragments within the OmpA molecule. The amino acid sequence of OmpA is illustrated in SEQ ID No. 1, which is encoded by nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID No. 2. Fragment X has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 3 and is encoded by nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID. No. 4. Fragment Y has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 5 and is encoded by nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID 6. Fragment Z is a longer fragment containing both fragment X and Y. Fragment Z's amino acid sequence is set forth in in SEQ ID 11 and is encoded by nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID. 12. Rapid tests made with purified antigen for <i>R. rickettsii </i>may enable timely, accurate diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which can be performed even in locations where laboratory equipment is not available.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Construction of recombinant <i>R. rickettisia </i>OmpA fragments were carried out by the expression, purification, and refolding of the X, Y and Z fragments (OmpA-X, OmpA-Y and OmpA-Z). The gene coding OmpA-X (from a.a. 1281 to a.a. 1522 of OmpA) was cloned into the expression vector pET24a. The gene encoding OmpA-Y (from amino acids 1700 to 1950 of OmpA) was cloned into the expression vector pET28a. The gene encoding OmpA-Z (from amino acids 1281 to 1950) was cloned into the expression vector pET 24a. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the Vector maps for (a) pET24a and (b) pET28a. BL21(DE3) strain of <i>Escherichia coli </i>was transformed with plasmid containing gene segments for OmpA-X, OmpA-Y and Omp-Z. Following induction, the cells were lysed, and OmpA-X, OmpA-Y and Omp-Z was each found in the inclusion body. The solubilized OmpA-X, OmpA-Y and OmpA-Z in 8 M urea was purified by His-tag affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE demonstrated that greater than 90% purity was achieved in the final elution. The purified protein fragments were refolded by sequential dialysis at 4&#xb0; C. in progressively lower concentrations of urea. N-terminal protein sequencing was used to confirm the identity of the refolded proteins. Western blot experiments showed that OmpA-X, OmpA-Y and Omp-Z reacted with patient sera, OmpA-Y reacted especially strong, suggesting that these fragments can be used to develop rapid sero-diagnostic assays and may even be a candidate for a vaccine against Rocky Mountain spotted fever.</p>

The expression vector pET24a and pET28a were digested with NdeI and XhoI (NEW ENGLAND BIOLABS&#xae; Inc, Beverly Mass.). The PCR product for OmpA-X, OmpA-Y and Omp-Z were also digested with NdeI and XhoI. Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed with the samples. The digested vectors and the X and Y inserts were then cut out from the gel and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN&#x2122;, Valencia Calif.). The vectors and inserts were ligated together with T4DNA ligase (INVITROGEN&#x2122;, Carlsbad Calif.). <i>E. coli </i>TOPO10 was transform with the resulting plasmids, now pET24a-OmpA-X, pET24a-OmpA-Z and pET28a-OmpA-Y for cloning. The transformed cells were spread on agar plates that contained 50 &#x3bc;g/mL kanamycin and incubated overnight at 37&#xb0; C. The plasmids were then purified using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN&#x2122;, Valencia Calif.). A sample of the purified DNA was subjected to a double digestion with NdeI and XhoI, and agarose gel electrophoresis was performed to verify that the inserts had been successfully ligated into the vectors. The pET28a-OmpA-Y plasmid encoded OmpA-Y with a histidine tag on both the N- and C-terminuses, and the pET24a-OmpA-X plasmid encoded OmpA-X with a histidine tag on the C-terminus. The pET24a-OmpA-Z plasmid encoded OmpA-Z with a histidine tag on the C-terminus

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The plasmids containing the insert were used to transform into the expression hosts. The recombinant <i>E. coli </i>were spread on agar plates containing 50 &#x3bc;g/mL kanamycin and were incubated at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. The recombinant <i>E. coli </i>expressing the OmpA fragment was then grown in 0.5 L OVERNIGHT EXPRESS&#x2122; Instant TB Medium (NOVAGEN&#xae;, Gibbstown N.J.) containing 50 &#x3bc;g/mL kanamycin at 37&#xb0; C. with shaking at room temperature. The medium induced protein expression. Following induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in 15 mL BUGBUSTER&#xae; Master Mix (NOVAGEN&#xae;, Gibbstown N.J.). The lysis reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes with shaking. The cells were also subjected to ultrasonic disruption on a sonicator for further lysing. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 7400&#xd7;g for 30 minutes. The supernatant was collected and saved. The pellet was resuspended in 30 mL 1&#xd7;HisBind buffer (20 mM Tris-Hcl pH 8, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) and centrifuged for 30 minutes as before. The supernatant was collected and saved. This process was repeated with 30 mL 1&#xd7;HisBind buffer containing 2M urea, and finally with 15 mL 1&#xd7;HisBind buffer containing 8M urea. Bradford's test and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to analyze the fractions and determine the protein concentration of OmpA-X, OmpA-Y and OmpA-Z.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Purification of OmpA-X and OmpA-Y</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Ni-NTA His-bind Resin (NOVAGEN&#xae;, Gibbstown N.J.) was used to purify OmpA fragments from the impurities in the sample. Two milliliters of the Ni-NTA His-bind resin suspension were added to make a 1 mL column. The column was equilibrated with 10 mL of 1&#xd7;HisBind buffer containing 8M urea. Both OmpA-X and OmpA-Y were found in the inclusion body. The solubilized protein in 8M urea was then added to the column. After an incubation period of 30 minutes with shaking, the resin was allowed to settle. The flow-through was collected and saved. The column was washed twice with 10 mL 1&#xd7;HisBind buffer containing 8 M urea. OmpA fragment was eluted with six 1 mL solutions, each with an increasing concentration of imidazole (20 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, 400 mM, and 600 mM). Bradford's test was performed to determine the protein concentration of each fraction, and SDS-PAGE was used to analyze the purity of the samples.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Refolding of OmpA-X and OmpA-Y</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The purified OmpA fragments in 8M urea was refolded by dialysis against progressively lower concentrations of urea (6 M, 4 M, 2 M, 1 M, 0 M, and 0 M) at 4&#xb0; C. In addition to urea, each buffer contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). The D-Tube&#x2122; Dialyzer Maxi MWCO 12-14 kDa (NOVAGEN&#xae;, Gibbstown N.J.) was used for dialysis. The tube was hydrated for 30 seconds in 6M urea buffer, and then the protein sample to be refolded was added to the tube. The beaker containing the buffer and the tubes was placed on a stirrer for 1.5 hours. After this period of time, the tubes were transferred to the 4M urea buffer and left on the stirrer for 1.5 hours. This process was repeated for the rest of the buffers. After the second 0M urea buffer, the protein was recovered. Bradford's test was used to determine the protein concentration of the refolded sample.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In order to ascertain the reactivity of the recombinant Fragments X, Y and Z as immunogenic antigens for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, western blot analysis was performed on Fragments X, Y and Z of OmpA of R. <i>Rickettisia </i>using normal sera and sera from patient who are known to be spotted fever positive. The purified and refolded proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BIO-RAD&#xae; Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.). The entire procedure was carried out at room temperature. The membrane was blocked for non-specific binding by incubating with 10% skim milk in 1&#xd7;TBS buffer for 1 hour with rocking.
