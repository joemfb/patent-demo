<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a cutting edge of a razor blade, a non-nitrided layer containing Ti, Al, and Cr formed on opposite surfaces of a base plate as a portion of a coating layer. A remaining layer containing Ti, Al, Cr, and N formed on opposite surfaces of the non-nitrided layer as a portion of a nitrided layer of the coating layer. A surface layer containing Ti, Al, Cr, and N formed on opposite surfaces of the remaining layer as a portion of the nitrided layer of the coating layer. A fluororesin layer formed on opposite surfaces of the surface layer with a bonding layer containing Cr and Al in between. The coating layer further improves the cutting edge, enhances cutting performance of the cutting edge, and maintains the enhanced cutting performance to improve the durability of the cutting edge.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. national stage application of PCT/JP2008/055830 filed on Mar. 27, 2008, and claims priority to, and incorporates by reference, Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-091252 filed on Mar. 30, 2007.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cutting edge having a coating layer of various types of blade members such as razor blades or microtome blades.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, various types of coating processes are performed on surface layers of cutting edges of razor blades or microtome blades. By way of example, in Patent Document 1, a DLC (diamond-like carbon) layer is formed on a base plate with a predetermined intermediate layer in between.

</ul>
</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0005">According to Patent Document 1, by providing a DLC layer on a base plate with a predetermined intermediate layer in between, cutting performance of the cutting edge is improved. Also, the improved cutting performance is maintained to enhance the durability of the cutting edge. Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to further improve the cutting edge.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0006">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, a blade member in which a surface of a base plate forming a cutting edge is coated with a coating layer is provided. The coating layer includes a non-nitrided layer coating the surface of the base plate and a nitrided layer coating a surface of the non-nitrided layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0007">In this case, the nitrided layer is bonded with improved adhesion and prevented from peeling off. The cutting edge is thus improved and cutting performance of the cutting edge is enhanced. The enhanced cutting performance is maintained to improve the durability of the cutting edge.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">The hardness of the nitrided layer is preferably greater than the hardness of the non-nitrided layer. The non-nitrided layer preferably contains Ti, Al, and Cr. The relative proportion of Ti, Al, and Cr of the non-nitrided layer preferably varies along the direction of the film thickness. In these cases, the coating layer of the cutting edge <b>2</b> has an increased toughness so that deformation of the cutting edge <b>2</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">The nitrided layer preferably contains Ti, Al, Cr, and N. A relative proportion of Ti, Al, Cr, and N of the nitrided layer preferably varies along the direction of the film thickness. The relative proportion of Ti, Al, Cr, and N is preferably constant at a predetermined depth from the surface layer of the nitrided layer. In these cases, Ti and Al have antibacterial effects.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">Neither the non-nitrided layer nor the nitrided layer preferably contains O, B, or C. In this case, the composition of the non-nitrided layer and the composition of the nitrided layer are simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">The width between surfaces of the base plate forming the cutting edge on opposite sides of the direction of the thickness of the base plate preferably becomes smaller toward a point of the cutting edge. In the coating layer coating the two surfaces of the base plate, a portion the nitrided layer is preferably removed from at least one of both sides of the direction of the thickness such that the nitrided layer has a remaining layer including a surface extending from the point of the cutting edge. In this case, the remaining layer, which is formed by removing a portion of the coating layer to sharpen the cutting edge, improves the cutting edge and enhances the cutting performance of the cutting edge.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">The nitrided layer preferably has a plurality of remaining layers that are stacked together. In this case, even if the film thickness of the coating layer is increased, the cutting edge is sharpened.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">At least one of opposite surfaces of the remaining layer of the nitrided layer is formed by a first surface and a second surface, the first surface extending from the point of the cutting edge and the second surface extending from the first surface. A cutting edge angle &#x3b2;a defined by two first surfaces is greater than a cutting edge angle &#x3b2;b defined by two second surfaces. In this case, sharpening of the cutting edge having the coating layer is facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">The nitrided layer preferably has a surface layer coating a surface of the remaining layer. In this case, the sharpness of the cutting edge is adjusted by means of the surface layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">The width between surfaces of the base plate forming the cutting edge on both sides of the direction of the thickness of the base plate preferably becomes smaller toward a point of the cutting edge, and a surface extending from the point of the cutting edge is preferably formed by removing a portion of at least one of the two surfaces of the base plate. In this case, sharpening of the cutting edge is facilitated by removing the portion of the base plate. This improves the cutting performance of the cutting edge.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">In this case, removal of the base plate is facilitated. At least one of the opposite surfaces of the base plate is preferably formed by a first surface and a second surface, the first surface extending from the point of the cutting edge and the second surface extending from the first surface, and a cutting edge angle &#x3b1;a defined by two first surfaces is preferably greater than a cutting edge angle &#x3b1;b defined by two second surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">A fluororesin layer is preferably provided on a surface side of the nitrided layer of the coating layer. In this case, the fluororesin layer allows easier sliding of the cutting edge, further improving the cutting performance of the cutting edge.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">A surface of the nitrided layer is preferably coated with a bonding layer and that the fluororesin layer coats a surface of the bonding layer. In this case, by means of the bonding layer, the roughness of the surface on which the fluororesin layer is formed is adjusted in such a manner as to increase the adhesion between the fluororesin layer and the bonding layer. The fluororesin layer <b>6</b> is thus prevented from peeling off from the surface of the nitrided layer.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">The ratio of numbers of atoms a:b:c (a+b+c=1) of Ti, Al, and Cr is preferably set in such a manner as to satisfy 0.02&#x2266;a&#x2266;0.30, 0.55&#x2266;b&#x2266;0.765, and 0.06&#x2266;c. In this case, the hardness is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">The base plate is preferably a base plate forming a cutting edge of a razor blade or a microtome blade.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">The formation of the coating layer is preferably performed through at least one of a sputtering method, a vapor deposition method, an ion plating method, and a chemical vapor deposition method. In this case, the coating layer is easily formed.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0038">A first embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>) and a second embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>) will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039">In a cutting edge <b>2</b> of a razor blade <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a base plate <b>3</b> is coated with a coating layer <b>4</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>c</i>) and <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>) or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>c</i>) and <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>). A fluororesin layer <b>6</b> is formed on the coating layer <b>4</b> with a bonding layer <b>5</b> in between. The cutting edge <b>2</b> is formed through the steps described below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">In the first embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), the base plate <b>3</b> is sharpened through grinding in such a manner that a width 3x between a pair of surfaces <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> located on both sides of a width direction X of the base plate <b>3</b> becomes smaller toward a point <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the cutting edge <b>2</b>. In this manner, the surfaces <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> are both inclined with respect to an axis <b>3</b><i>a</i>, which extends along the center of the base plate <b>3</b> in the width direction X.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">In the second embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), sharpening through grinding is performed in the same manner as the first embodiment. The base plate <b>3</b> is formed of a material suitable for the cutting edge <b>2</b> of the razor blade <b>1</b>, such as metal including carbon steel, stainless steel, or aluminum alloy, fine ceramics including zirconium, and alumina or cemented carbide (WC).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042">In the first embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), the surfaces <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> of the base plate <b>3</b>, which have been sharpened through grinding, are subjected to finish polishing.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">Although finish polishing is carried out in the second embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) as in the case of the first embodiment, this process may be omitted. It is preferred that a cutting edge angle &#x3b1; defined by the surfaces <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> be 16 to 22 degrees. After the finish polishing, the point <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the base plate <b>3</b> is formed along an arc having a radius of 20 to 30 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">In the second embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>c</i>), the surfaces <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> are removed from the base plate <b>3</b> after the finish polishing and final sharpening is performed on the base plate <b>3</b>. For example, a portion of each of the surfaces <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> extending from the point <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the cutting edge <b>2</b> is removed to form a pair of first surfaces <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>a </i>(surfaces sharpened through the removal).

Table 1 and table 2 represent the results of comparison of properties of samples A, B, and C. The conditions of the cutting edges <b>2</b> of the razor blades <b>1</b> of samples A, B, and C, such as the film thicknesses of the coating layers or the cutting edge angles, were uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">A cutting performance test was performed by successively cutting an elongated wool felt piece having a uniform cross section for a certain number of times using the cutting edge <b>2</b> of each of the three types of samples (samples A, B, and C). For each sample, the initial cut resistance and the final cut resistance were measured and the increase of the cut resistance was obtained. As a result, samples A and B both exhibited smaller initial cut resistances, smaller final cut resistances, and smaller increase than sample C. Also, the initial cut resistance, the final cut resistance, and the increase of sample A were smaller than the corresponding values of sample B. It was thus demonstrated that, by forming the coating layer <b>4</b> in a layered configuration including the non-nitrided layer <b>9</b> and the nitrided layer <b>12</b> (the remaining layer <b>15</b> and the surface layer <b>18</b>) as in the case of sample A, the cut resistance was reduced and the reduced cut resistance was maintained, thus improving durability.</p>
