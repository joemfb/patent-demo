<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a fluid mixing device used for a gene analysis and the like and, in particular, to a fluid mixing device constructed as a micro chip.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a field referred to as a &#x3bc;TAS (Total Analysis System), a flow channel and a storage tank are formed in a substrate made of glass or plastics (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;micro chip&#x201d;) and a sample or a reagent is tested or analyzed by treating the sample or the reagent in the flow channel and the storage tank.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the sample or the reagent is tested or analyzed by the use of the micro chip, the sample or the reagent is supplied to the flow channel and the storage tank of the micro chip from the outside of the micro chip. Further, the sample or the reagent supplied to the flow channel and the storage tank has pressure applied thereto from the outside of the micro chip, whereby the flow of the sample or the reagent is controlled and the treatment of stirring or mixing the sample or the reagent is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to apply pressure to the sample or the reagent from the outside of the micro chip, the micro chip, a unit for supplying pressure for controlling an operation, and a unit for supplying a sample or a reagent are connected to each other by a tube or the like (see JP 2005-345463 A (patent document 1) and JP 2007-187616 A (patent document 2)).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a related micro chip mixing first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>that includes a sample or a reagent to be tested or analyzed with second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>that is different from first liquid <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the micro chip has first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>for supplying first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>and second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>for supplying second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>that is different from first liquid <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Further, in the micro chip is formed mixing tank <b>9</b> for mixing first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>with second liquid <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, the micro chip is provided with first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>for feeding first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>from first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>to mixing tank <b>9</b>, and at a position different from a position where first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>is formed, the micro chip is provided with second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b </i>connecting second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>to mixing tank <b>9</b>. First supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>and second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>are connected respectively to a liquid supply unit (not shown) supplying liquid and a pressure supply unit (not shown) supplying pressure for controlling an operation through a tube.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When pressure applied to first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>is increased, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is fed to mixing tank <b>9</b> through first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a</i>. In the case where the amount of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>that is fed is more than an allowance of mixing tank <b>9</b> or in the case where vibration is applied to the micro chip, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is fed to second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>through second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b </i>that is connected to mixing tank <b>9</b> and that is different from first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>is supplied with second liquid <b>1</b><i>b</i>, so that first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is mixed with second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>in second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Depending on the purpose of the test or the analysis, there is a case where the mixing of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>with second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>in a place other than mixing tank <b>9</b> is not allowed. Thus, second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b </i>is provided with second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>preventing first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>fed to mixing tank <b>9</b> from flowing toward second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>through second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, similarly, first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>is also provided with first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>preventing second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>from flowing toward first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>from mixing tank <b>9</b> through first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a</i>. In this way, by appropriately providing respective mixing tank flow channels <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>with first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>and second valve <b>5</b><i>b</i>, it is possible to prevent first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>from mixing with second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>in a place other than mixing tank <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As the valve preventing the flow from the mixing tank to the supply tank as described above, there is employed a passive valve utilizing flow resistance or a valve using a flexible material such as a diaphragm.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The passive valve utilizing flow resistance has a structure such that a flow channel is provided with a portion having a reduced cross-sectional area to make a flow resistance value very large, thereby making liquid flow only when the liquid is fed by pressure exceeding this flow resistance value (see JP 2003-190751 A (patent document 3) and JP 2006-142448 A (patent document 4)).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the example of the related micro chip shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a case where passive valves are employed as first and second valves <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b </i>will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the case where first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is fed from first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>to mixing tank <b>9</b> through first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a</i>, pressure exceeding the flow resistance value of first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>is applied to first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a</i>. As a result, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>passes through first valve <b>5</b><i>a</i>. First liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is fed to mixing tank <b>9</b> in the state where the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is reduced by first valve <b>5</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the case where the amount of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>that is fed exceeds the allowance of mixing tank <b>9</b>, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is fed from mixing tank <b>9</b> toward second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>for supplying second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>through second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b</i>. When the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>at second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>is less than the flow resistance value of second valve <b>5</b><i>b</i>, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is stopped at second valve <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Thus, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is not fed from mixing tank <b>9</b> toward second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the case where a passive valve is used as a valve preventing a flow from a mixing tank to a supply tank, the passage of liquid through the valve is controlled only by the pressure of the liquid. This eliminates the need for providing a physical force or an electric signal for opening or closing the valve from the outside of the micro chip, which results in providing an advantage of easing the handling of the micro chip.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a valve using a flexible material such as a diaphragm, the flexible material is deformed by the physical force or the electric signal provided from the outside of the micro chip to thereby open or close a flow channel.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the example of the related micro chip shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a case will be described in which valves using a flexible material are employed as first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>and second valve <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the case where first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is fed from first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>to mixing tank <b>9</b> through first mixing thank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a</i>, first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>is opened and second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>is closed by a physical force or an electric signal provided from the outside of the micro chip. Thus, even in the case where the amount of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>that is fed exceeds the allowance of mixing tank <b>9</b>, the feed of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>from mixing tank <b>9</b> to second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>is stopped by second valve <b>5</b><i>b</i>. As a result, the feed of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>to second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the case where the valve preventing the flow from the mixing tank to the supply tank is formed of a flexible material, the flow channel is opened or closed by deformation of the flexible material. This can reduce the possibility that the liquid leaks from the valve and hence can provide high reliability in the control of liquid (see JP 2003-139660 A (patent document 5) and JP 2003-139662 A (patent document 6)).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the above example, description has been made on the assumption that as a method for controlling liquid in a supply tank, the feed of the liquid is not controlled but the pressure of the liquid is controlled. In addition to controlling the pressure of the liquid, controlling the liquid can be also performed by the amount of liquid that is fed by the use of a syringe pump or the like capable of controlling the amount of liquid that is fed in the supply tank. Even if the syringe pump is used, the amount of liquid that is fed and the capacities of the flow channel, the supply tank, and the mixing tank cannot be sufficiently controlled, so that it is surely thought that the amount of liquid that is fed to the mixing tank exceeds the allowance of the mixing tank to thereby cause the flow of the liquid from the mixing tank to the supply tank. Thus, even in the case where a flow rate is controlled by the use of the syringe pump or the like, a valve is required.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the related micro chip shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the case where a valve preventing the flow from the mixing tank to the supply tank is constructed by the use of a passive valve, the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>needs to be equal to or more than a flow resistance value of first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>and to be less than a flow resistance value of second valve <b>5</b><i>b</i>. In other words, this requires high accuracy pressure control and may reduce the operability of the micro chip.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the case where the control of pressure to be applied to first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>does not satisfy a required accuracy, there is a possibility that the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is insufficient for the flow resistance value of first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>or exceeds the flow resistance value of second valve <b>5</b><i>b</i>. In other words, there is a possibility that feeding the liquid to mixing tank <b>9</b> and preventing the flow of the liquid to the second supply tank <b>2</b> are not normally performed to thereby reduce the reliability of the micro chip.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, in the case where the valve that prevents the flow of the liquid from the mixing tank to the supply tank is constructed of a flexible material, there is a need to provide an external mechanism applying a force to the flexible material from the outside of the micro chip. Thus, the connection of the external mechanism to the micro chip is increased to thereby make the handling of the micro chip cumbersome, which may reduce productivity. Further, since the external mechanism is newly provided, there is also presented a problem in which the maintenance and the inspection of the external mechanism are newly required.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a fluid mixing device that includes a valve that prevents a flow from a mixing tank to a supply tank and that is not reduced in productivity and maintainability and is improved in operability and reliability even if high accuracy pressure control is not used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In order to achieve the object described above, a fluid mixing device of the present invention includes a mixing tank, a plurality of supply tanks, mixing tank flow channels, valves, and branch flow channels. The mixing tank mixes at least two liquids. Each of the supply tanks is provided for each of the at least two liquids and supplies each liquid to the mixing tank. Each of the mixing tank flow channels connects each of the supply tanks to the mixing tank. Each of the valves is arranged in each of the mixing tank flow channels. Each of the branch flow channels is connected to each of the mixing tank flow channels and is connected from the one mixing tank flow channel to the valve in the other mixing tank flow channel. Further, when the valve has pressure applied thereto from the liquid having passed through the branch flow channel, the valve closes the mixing tank flow channel.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the construction described above, before the liquid passes through one mixing tank flow channel and is fed to the mixing tank, the liquid passes through the branch flow channel and is fed to the valve provided in the other mixing tank flow channel, and the valve closes the other mixing tank flow channel. Thus, this construction can prevent the liquid from flowing from the mixing tank to the other mixing tank flow channel.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The valve that prevents the flow from the mixing tank to the mixing tank flow channel is physically closed by the liquid, so that as compared with a passive valve using utilizing flow resistance, the valve can prevent the flow from the mixing tank to the mixing tank flow channel by a lower accuracy pressure control, which can improve operability and reliability. Further, the valve is opened or closed by the liquid in the fluid mixing device, so that it is not necessary to provide a mechanism operating the valve from the outside of the fluid mixing device, which can make it simple to connect the micro chip to an external mechanism and hence can improve productivity and maintainability.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the fluid mixing device of the present invention, the fluid mixing device includes a valve that prevents the flow from the mixing tank to the supply tank and is not reduced in productivity and maintainability and is improved in operability and reliability even if high accuracy pressure control is not used.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate examples of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view of micro chip <b>10</b> in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Micro chip <b>10</b> is a chip that mixes first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>such as a sample or a reagent, which is an object to be tested or analyzed, with second liquid <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which is different from first liquid <b>1</b><i>a</i>, in mixing tank <b>9</b>. In micro chip <b>10</b>, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is fed to mixing tank <b>9</b> and then second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>is fed to mixing tank <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Micro chip <b>10</b> has first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>for supplying first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>and second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>for supplying second liquid <b>1</b><i>b</i>. Further, micro chip <b>10</b> has first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>for feeding first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>from first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>to mixing tank <b>9</b> and has second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b </i>connecting second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>to mixing tank <b>9</b> at a position different from a position where first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>is provided. First supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>is connected to a liquid supply unit (not shown) supplying first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>from the outside of micro chip <b>10</b> and to a pressure supply unit (not shown) that increases the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>by a tube or the like. Similarly, second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>is also connected to a pressure supply unit and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, in first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>is arranged first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>that prevents a flow from mixing tank <b>9</b> to first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a</i>, and similarly, in the second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>is arranged second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>that prevents a flow from mixing tank <b>9</b> to second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">First valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>is connected to second branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>b </i>branched from second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b </i>between second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>and second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b</i>. First valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>is constructed in a closing structure by a flexible material such as a diaphragm. When first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>has pressure applied thereto from second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>fed through second branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>b</i>, first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>is deformed, whereby the communication between mixing tank <b>9</b> and first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>is blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Similarly, second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>is connected to first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a </i>branched from first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>between first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>and first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a</i>. When first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>passes through first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a </i>and flows into second valve <b>5</b><i>b</i>, communication between mixing tank <b>9</b> and second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b </i>is blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>that selects a flow channel through which a flowing-in liquid is made to pass by the pressure of the flowing-in liquid is arranged at a branch point between first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>and first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, second flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>b </i>is arranged at a branch point between second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b </i>and second branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Here, the concrete construction of first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>and second flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>b </i>will be described. The flow channel selection mechanism has one input flow channel corresponding to a flow channel portion that communicates with a supply tank side of a mixing tank flow channel and a plurality of output flow channels corresponding to flow channel portions that communicate with a mixing tank side of the mixing tank flow channel and with a branch flow channel, respectively. Further, the flow channel selection mechanism has passive valves arranged in the respective output flow channels, the passive valves being different form each other in flow resistance value.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic view to illustrate a flow channel selection mechanism. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, input flow channel <b>12</b> is branched into output flow channel <b>13</b> and output flow channel <b>14</b> at connection portion <b>17</b>. Output flow channel <b>13</b> includes passive valve <b>15</b> having a specified flow resistance value X. Output flow channel <b>14</b> includes passive valve <b>16</b> having a flow resistance value Y larger than the flow resistance value X of passive valve <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, if the pressure of liquid <b>11</b> fed to input flow channel <b>12</b> is less than the flow resistance value X, liquid <b>11</b> does not pass through passive valve <b>15</b> and passive valve <b>16</b>. If liquid <b>11</b> has a pressure that is the flow resistance value X or more and that is less than the flow resistance value Y, liquid <b>11</b> does not pass through passive valve <b>16</b> but passes through only passive valve <b>15</b>. Further, when the pressure of liquid <b>11</b> to be supplied is increased and then the pressure of supplied liquid <b>11</b> reaches the flow resistance value Y or more, the supplied liquid <b>11</b> passes through passive valve <b>15</b> and passive valve <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>provided in micro chip <b>10</b> in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, input flow channel <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is connected to first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>side of first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Output flow channel <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) including passive valve <b>15</b> having a flow resistance value Xa is connected to first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a</i>, and output flow channel <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) including passive valve <b>16</b> having a flow resistance value Ya larger than the flow resistance value Xa is connected to mixing tank <b>9</b> side of first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Similarly, in second flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>b</i>, input flow channel <b>12</b> is connected to second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>side of second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b</i>. Output flow channel <b>13</b> including passive valve <b>15</b> having a flow resistance value Xb is connected to second branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>b</i>, and output flow channel <b>14</b> including passive valve <b>16</b> having a flow resistance value Yb larger than the flow resistance value Xb is connected to mixing tank <b>9</b> side of second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this regard, there is no need to make a difference between the flow resistance values Xa, Ya of first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the flow resistance values Xb, Yb of second flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, a method for mixing first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>with second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>in mixing tank <b>9</b> of micro chip <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">First, a method for feeding first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>from first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>to mixing tank <b>9</b> will be described. Here, it is assumed that the pressure of second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>in second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>is not increased by a pressure supply unit arranged outside micro chip <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the means of the pressure supply unit or the like that is provided outside micro chip <b>10</b> and that is connected to micro chip <b>10</b> by a tube or the like increases the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a</i>, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>passes through first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>from first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>and reaches first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a</i>. The pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>is less than the flow resistance value Xa, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>remains in first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>because the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is also less than the flow resistance value Ya.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, the pressure supply unit gradually increases the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a</i>. When the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>reaches a value that is the flow resistance value Xa or more and that is less than the flow resistance value Ya, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>flows only to first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a </i>side from first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>and flows to second valve <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>connected to first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a </i>is deformed by the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>to thereby close second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b</i>. Further, second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>has a closing mechanism, so that first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>remains in second valve <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After deformation of second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>by the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is finished and then the interior of second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>is brought into a saturated state by first liquid <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the pressure supply unit further increases the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>reaches the flow resistance value Ya. Thus, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>remaining in first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>starts to flow to first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>side toward mixing tank <b>9</b>. Then, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>reaches first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>provided in first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>from first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">First valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>is a valve closing first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>by the pressure of second liquid <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which is similar to second valve <b>5</b><i>b</i>. In the assumption described above, the pressure of second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>in second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>is not increased, so that first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>does not close first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Thus,</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">First liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>passes through first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>and reaches mixing tank <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the amount of inflow of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>becomes larger than the allowance of mixing tank <b>9</b> or vibration or the like is applied to micro chip <b>10</b> from the outside, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>starts to flow from mixing tank <b>9</b> toward second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>through second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b</i>. Then, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in mixing tank <b>9</b> reaches second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>provided in second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the process for feeding first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>to mixing tank <b>9</b>, the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is increased, so that first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>flowing into second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>works in such a way as to close second valve <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Thus, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b </i>remains in second valve <b>5</b><i>b</i>, so that first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is not fed to second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When a sufficient amount of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is fed to mixing tank <b>9</b>, the pressure supply unit decreases the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a state where the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is decreased to a value that is equal to or more than the flow resistance value Xa of first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>and that is less than the flow resistance value Ya, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>does not flow from first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>to first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>but will continue to flow to first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a</i>. In other words, in this state, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>continues to close second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>in second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is decreased to a value equal to or less than the flow resistance value Xa of first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a</i>, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>does not flow to first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a </i>from first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a</i>. Thus, second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>opens second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b</i>. In this way, the feeding of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>to mixing tank <b>9</b> is finished.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a case where first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the same amount as the allowance of mixing tank <b>9</b> remains in mixing tank <b>9</b>, a portion of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in mixing tank <b>9</b> is discharged by another means, which will not be described here in detail, to thereby secure a space into which second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>different from first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>can flow.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>in the second mixing tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>is fed to mixing tank <b>9</b>. By the same procedure as a procedure for feeding first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>to mixing tank <b>9</b>, second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>can be fed to mixing tank <b>9</b> without causing second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>or a mixture of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>and second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>to flow from mixing tank <b>9</b> to first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Specifically, when the pressure of second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>in second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>reaches a value that is equal to or more than the flow resistance value Xb of second flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>b </i>and that is less than the flow resistance value Yb, second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>is fed to first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>through second branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>b</i>. As a result, first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>closes first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thereafter, when the pressure of second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>is further increased and reaches more than the flow resistance value Yb of second flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>b</i>, second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>starts to flow from second flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>b </i>toward mixing tank <b>9</b> through second mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>b </i>and reaches second valve <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>is a valve that is closed by the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>flowing into second valve <b>5</b><i>b</i>. The pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is decreased when the feeding of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is finished, so that second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>is opened. Thus, second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>having reached second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>passes through second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>and is fed to mixing tank <b>9</b>. As a result, second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>is mixed with first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>for the first time in mixing tank <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the case where second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>is mixed with first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>and then second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>is further fed to mixing tank <b>9</b>, whereby the allowance of mixing tank <b>9</b> is exceeded, second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>or the mixture of second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>and first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>passes through first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>and flows toward first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a</i>. Since first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>in first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a </i>is closed, the mixture stops at first valve <b>5</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When a sufficient amount of second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>is fed to mixing tank <b>9</b>, the pressure of second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>is decreased to thereby finish feeding second liquid <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As described above, in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>and second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>are fed to mixing tank <b>9</b> by the supply of pressure to first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>in first supply tank <b>2</b><i>a </i>and by the supply of pressure to second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>in second supply tank <b>2</b><i>b</i>, whereby first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is mixed with second liquid <b>1</b><i>b</i>. Further, by increasing the pressure of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the pressure of second liquid <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the valves preventing the flow of the liquid from the mixing tank to the supply tanks are physically closed. Thus, the exemplary embodiment of the present invention does not require a pressure control of high accuracy that controls the pressure of liquid to be fed to a range that is between the upper and lower limits of the flow resistance value of the valve, the pressure control being required in the case where a passive valve is used for a valve to prevent the flow of the liquid from the mixing tank to the supply tank.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the valves that prevent the flow from the mixing tank to the supply tank are opened or closed by the pressures of first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>and second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>that flow in micro chip <b>10</b>, so that an operation from the outside of the micro chip is not required in order to open or close the valves. Thus, there is no need to provide a mechanism for operating the valve outside the micro chip and hence a cumbersome operation is not required when a tube is connected to the micro chip. There is no need to provide a mechanism for operating the valve, so that maintenance and inspection work can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to the micro chip of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the micro chip is provided with valves that prevent the flow from the mixing tank to the supply tank, so that even if high accuracy pressure control of is not used, productivity and maintainability are not reduced and operability and reliability can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In micro chip <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a </i>intersects second branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>b</i>. A method for easily realizing a flow channel like this can be realized by bonding a plurality of sheets to each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exploded view in perspective to illustrate an exemplary embodiment of flow channels that intersect each other. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, micro chip <b>10</b> has sheets <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> formed of a flexible material such as a diaphragm. Sheet <b>19</b> is laminated on sheet <b>18</b> and sheet <b>20</b> is laminated on sheet <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Each of the sheets is divided into portions that are bonded to the adjacent sheet and portions that are not bonded to the adjacent sheet. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, shaded portions are portions that are not bonded to the adjacent sheet and the liquid flows into the portions that are not bonded to the adjacent sheet. In other words, a flow channel through which the liquid flows, a tank in which the liquid is stored, and a valve closing the flow channel are formed by a structure such that a portion in which the sheets are not bonded to each other is surrounded by a portion in which the sheets are bonded to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The respective constructions of the supply tank, the mixing tank flow channel, the flow channel selection mechanism, and the mixing tank that are formed on sheet <b>18</b> are the same as the respective constructions in the schematic view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, so that descriptions related to them will be omitted. Valves <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b </i>closing the mixing tank flow channels <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>are formed on sheet <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">At an end portion on a side opposite to a side connected to first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a </i>of first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a </i>branched from first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a</i>, sheet <b>19</b> arranged in the center has first hole <b>7</b><i>a </i>cut out. Thus, liquid flowing through first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a </i>passes through first hole <b>7</b><i>a </i>and flows between sheet <b>19</b> and sheet <b>20</b>. In other words, first hole <b>7</b><i>a </i>functions as a through hole.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, first branch flow channel <b>8</b><i>a </i>connecting first hole <b>7</b><i>a </i>to second valve <b>5</b><i>b </i>is formed between sheet <b>19</b> and sheet <b>20</b>. Thus, first liquid <b>1</b><i>a </i>passes through first flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>a</i>, branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a</i>, first hole <b>7</b><i>a</i>, and branch flow channel <b>8</b><i>a </i>and then reaches second valve <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Similarly, second liquid <b>1</b><i>b </i>passes through second flow channel selection mechanism <b>6</b><i>b</i>, branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>b</i>, hole <b>7</b><i>b</i>, and branch flow channel <b>8</b><i>b </i>and then reaches first valve <b>5</b><i>a </i>for closing first mixing tank flow channel <b>3</b><i>a</i>. According to the construction described above, there can be realized a micro chip in which first branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>a </i>intersects second branch flow channel <b>4</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In this regard, a non-flexible material can be also used for a portion of the three sheets <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b> in micro chip <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, if the mechanism described above can be operated even by the non-flexible material. For example, a non-flexible sheet can be also used for sheet <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Here, the specific construction of passive valve <b>15</b> and passive valve <b>16</b> in the flow channel selection mechanism in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will be described by the use of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a section view of a flow channel of a micro chip.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in micro chip <b>21</b>, sheet <b>22</b> made of a flexible material has sheet <b>23</b> laminated thereon, sheet <b>23</b> being also made of a flexible material. A portion in which sheet <b>22</b> is not bonded to sheet <b>23</b> is made flow channel <b>24</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is shown a state where liquid is introduced into micro chip <b>21</b> from the outside and where the pressure of the liquid is held at a specified value.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a section view when the deformation of sheet <b>22</b> is simulated by the use of FEM (Finite Element Method). When it is assumed that the flow channel width L of micro chip <b>21</b> is 500 &#x3bc;m and that the thickness of micro chip <b>21</b> is 200 &#x3bc;m, the deformation of sheet <b>22</b> or sheet <b>23</b> in the state where flow channel <b>24</b> is encapsulated with liquid and where pressure is applied to the liquid is simulated by the use of FEM. The deformation of sheet <b>22</b> is vertically symmetric to the deformation of sheet <b>23</b>, so that only sheet <b>22</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a section view when the deformation of sheet <b>22</b> is simulated by the use of FEM, which is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is assumed that the flow channel width L is 1000 &#x3bc;m. The conditions other than the flow channel width L in the simulation are the same as those in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is compared with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, although the same pressure is applied to the liquid in flow channel <b>24</b>, the deformation of sheet <b>22</b> is smaller in the example, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and is narrower in the flow channel width L, than in the example which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and is wider in the flow channel width L. In other words, the amount of deformation of the flexible material is smaller in the example which is narrower in flow channel width L and hence the cross-sectional area of the flow channel is made smaller, which results in making flow resistance larger. In this way, when a narrow portion is formed in the middle of the flow channel, the flow resistance of the flow channel before and after the narrow portion can be determined at various values.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, passive valve <b>15</b> and passive valve <b>16</b> of the flow channel selection mechanism can have their flow resistance values set thereto by the use of the principle described above. When the flow channel in passive valve <b>16</b> is made narrower than the flow channel in passive valve <b>15</b>, the flow resistance value Y of passive valve <b>16</b> is made larger than the flow resistance value X of passive valve <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, in the description of the operation of the micro chip shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it has been described that the pressure of the liquid is gradually increased by the pressure supply unit. However, it is also possible to provide an operation to gradually increase the pressure of the liquid by providing an obstacle, whose flow resistance is made large, between the supply tank and the mixing tank flow channel.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is shown the case where the micro chip is provided with two mixing tank flow channels. However, even in the case where a micro chip is to be provided with three or more mixing tank flow channels, the micro chip can be realized in the same way. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an exemplary example of the present invention in the case where a micro chip is provided with three mixing tank flow channels. The constituent elements denoted by the reference signs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are the same as those in the exemplary example of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, so that their descriptions will be omitted here.</p>
