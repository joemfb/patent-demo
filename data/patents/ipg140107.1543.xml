<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A thermoplastic injection molding system and method of use is described for molding parts from heated plastics and other organic resins. The machine uses heat sources located along the barrel to heat the source material while an auger screw transports the source material in the barrel. This transport step does not shear the source material, nor does it use friction to produce the heat necessary to melt the source material. The material becomes substantially liquid or melted during the heating process, and the melted material is forced, by the auger screw, into a chamber whereupon a plunger, situated concentrically with the auger screw, injects the material from the chamber into a mold. Sensors located along the barrel and in the chamber ensure consistency between mold cycles. The controller dynamically adjusts the injection molding process to achieve more consistent and reliable molded parts.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to thermoplastic molding methods and apparatus, and more particularly pertains to methods and apparatus for injection molding thermoplastic.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Injection molding machines are expensive to purchase, require expensive factory space and substantial quantities of electrical power. Additionally, set-up and operation of injection molding machines is a highly subjective trade, wherein there are significant set-up charges each time a tool is set. Starts and stops of such machines can be very expensive and there are always technicians and/or operators directly involved in such activities. The general practice on start up of an injection molding machine is provide an initial machine configuration (e.g., screw rotation rate, operable screw barrel temperature, injection pressure, etc.), then a &#x201c;purging&#x201d; process is performed where an operator first confirms that the injection molding machine is not connected to a mold, and then commences to process plastic but discarding the resulting plastic melt until the operator judges that the output plastic looks hot enough and appears to be of a low enough viscosity to commence molding test parts. Subsequently, a plurality of test parts are produced for inspection and/or analysis to thereby determine whether the machine is configured appropriately to successfully produce parts having the intended characteristics (e.g., fully conforming to the intended part shape, density, elasticity, etc.). Accordingly, the machine settings are generally fixed for mass producing the part.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above described injection molding practice has substantial problems in that various part affecting parameters can change during the part mass production. For example, the operator settings may not be adequate for keeping the injection machine in a state for maintaining part consistency. In particular, it may not be possible to adequately determine whether the plastic is sufficiently uniformly heated so that acceptable parts can be produced therefrom. Additionally, since patches of plastic raw material inherently vary in their composition, variation in part production may be necessary dependent upon variation in the plastic raw material. Furthermore, the various injection molding parameters (whether settable by an operator or not) are generally interrelated with respect to producing acceptable parts. For instance, (a) nozzle injection pressure and plastic flow rate are inversely related, (b) plastic flow rate and plastic temperature are generally directly related, and (c) changes in screw rotation may generally be directly related to plastic temperature, although such may depend on the degree to which plastic heating is performed by shearing of the plastic in the screw barrel. Accordingly, it is very difficult to effectively and consistently configure a conventional injection molding machine to produce acceptable quality parts, and for very small quantities of parts the overhead for configuring such a machine can unacceptably expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have an injection molding system and method of operation that is substantially more cost effective to manufacture and operate. Additionally, it is desirable for such a system and method to be less dependent upon operator trial and error to configure such systems for consistently producing acceptable quality parts.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A thermoplastic injection molding system and method of use is disclosed for molding parts from heated plastics and other organic resins, wherein the system includes an injection molding machine and a controller for controlling the machine such that when the controller is supplied with input from various machine sensors providing real time measurements related to the characteristics of the plastic or resin (collectively referred to a &#x201c;plastic&#x201d; hereinbelow) in the injection molding machine, the controller dynamically adjusts the injection molding process to achieve more consistent and reliable molded parts.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The injection molding machine disclosed herein includes a screw for transporting the solid unmolded plastic material (e.g., pellets) from a storage container or hopper to an injection zone or chamber for collecting melted plastic in preparation for injecting the melted plastic therein into mold. The screw is configured within a barrel or cylinder in a manner that substantially prevents the plastic being conveyed therein from being sheared, and in particular, prevents such shearing between the barrel and the screw. Accordingly, the rotation of the screw when conveying plastic requires substantially less torque than prior art injection molding machines having a screw that shears the plastic. In particular, the tolerances and configuration of the screw within the barrel are such that the gaps between the inside diameter of the barrel and the outside diameter of the screw are small enough so that the plastic pellets cannot be sheared therebetween. Moreover, the barrel (and plastic therein) is heated, insufficient heat is applied to allow the plastic to deform into such gaps and be sheared, and insufficient heat is applied to induce the plastic to adhere to the screw flutes or the inside of the barrel for substantially an entire length of the screw. Thus the present injection molding machine uses substantially less energy to rotate the screw. Furthermore, the screw can be easily removed from the barrel since both the screw and barrel are substantially free of adhered to plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to the screw being primarily a conveyance mechanism for the plastic pellets, the screw can be designed for efficient and effective conveyance rather than for shearing. Moreover, a result of such a screw design in the present injection molding machine is that the pellets compact within the barrel as they travel toward and ultimately enter plastic melting zones of the present injection machine. Such compaction has a particular advantage of effectively providing a barrier for preventing melted plastic from leaking or flow backward in the injection molding machine. Accordingly, a valve for preventing such flow back is unnecessary. However, in the event that such compaction is diminished enough so that there is plastic melt flow back, there may be one or more thermocouples or other heat sensors for detecting an inappropriate increase in heat, and providing such information to the controller (e.g., a computer system specifically configured for controlling the production of parts by the present injection molding machine, and/or programmable logic controller), wherein one or more of the following may be initiated by the controller: an operator may be alerted, the screw rotation rate at least temporarily increased, shutting down the mold injection machine (e.g., in the event that there are insufficient plastic pellets in the hopper), activating a pellet jam breaking mechanism for jams in the hopper, and/or activating a mechanism for automatically feeding additional pellets to the hopper.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The hereinabove described screw and a corresponding extent of the barrel may be considered as a first zone of the injection molding machine, wherein there is a series linearly aligned injection molding machine zones for transforming the plastic into a melt acceptable to mold parts. At the end of this first zone (e.g., substantially where the plastic pellets compact), a second zone commences wherein one or more heat sources (controlled by the controller) are active for heating the plastic within this zone so that the plastic becomes flowable. In general, the increase in heat over that of the first zone may be only a few degrees above the heat applied in the first zone (e.g., an increase in temperature in a range of 25-250&#xb0; F.). The heat sources may be one or more of a resistance, inductance or ultrasonic heat source. These heat sources are positioned and arranged so that the heat generated affects the plastic, within a relatively short portion of the screw, and substantially at the termination of the screw flutes, so that the plastic becomes flowable. More specifically, the plastic becomes sufficiently flowable (due to pressure of additional upstream plastic moving into this second zone) to flow downstream through heating channels of a third zone described hereinbelow. Since most plastics do not conduct heat well, the second zone (also known as the &#x201c;transition zone&#x201d; herein) may be configured so that there is an increase in heated surface area for contacting the plastic within this second zone. In one embodiment, such an increase in heated surface area may be at least partially due to a heated annular interior barrel wall that serves as an intermediary barrel portion for connecting the barrel interior of the first zone to the downstream third zone having a barrel interior of reduced cross sectional dimension. In particular, the portion of the barrel extent for the first zone may have a first diameter in a range of, e.g., 2 inches to 10 inches, and the interior dimension of the third zone may have a diameter in a range of, e.g., 40% to 60% less. Such a heated wall provides a substantial increase in surface area for transmitting heat to the adjacent plastic. Moreover, such a wall can be configured to be substantially perpendicular to the general helical path of the plastic to thereby induce a buildup of plastic (and corresponding pressure which may be in a range of 100-5000 psi (pounds per square inch)) adjacent to and in contact with this wall for facilitating heat transfer to the plastic. Additionally, the terminal end of the screw within the second zone may terminate in a substantially convex shape (e.g., a truncated conical surface which forces the plastic closer the heated wall). In one embodiment, this terminal end of the screw may also radiate heat via, e.g., one of the heat sources identified hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is worthwhile to note that since sufficient heat to induce adherence of the plastic to internal machine surfaces only commences in the second zone, and since this zone is of short length (relative to the screw length and the length of the machine) any plastic that adheres to the internal machine surfaces in this second zone (e.g., due to a machine shutdown or heat interruption) will not be so substantial that the screw cannot be readily extracted from the barrel. In particular, the linear extent of the total barrel residing in the second zone may be only 2% to 10% of the length of the screw, and there may be few (if any) screw portions (e.g., attenuated screw flutes) in this second zone where there could be a sufficient buildup of resolidified plastic that would substantially inhibit the screw from being extracted without damaging some portion of the machine or without disassembling the barrel screw combination from the remainder of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the third zone following the second or transitional zone, the flowable plastic is forced by pressure buildup in the second zone, to flow through one or more (preferably a plurality of) channels of this zone, wherein such channels conduct the plastic through the length of this third zone, and into a fourth or injection zone described hereinbelow. The channels may be distributed circumferentially about an extension of the screw shaft, wherein in at least one embodiment this extension includes an injection plunger that reciprocates along the rotational axis of the screw for repeatedly injecting melted plastic into a mold. Each channel may extend parallelly to the shaft axis between a receiving opening for receiving plastic, and an exit opening from which the plastic exits. The third zone is also heated by one or more of the heat sources for continuing to elevate the temperature of the plastic provided therein. Moreover, since the channel(s) may substantially increase the heated barrel surface area in contact with the plastic, the plastic in the channel(s) liquefies, or substantially reduces its viscosity so that it may flow into the injection zone (when not prevented) at a rate in direct proportion to the number of screw rotations realized within the system. The temperature increase in the plastic due the heat imparted via the channel(s) may be in a range of 25-250&#xb0; F. Note that the heat sources for this third zone may be external to the portion of the barrel for the third zone, embedded within the barrel, and/or provided by the extension to the screw shaft (such extension may have a length of, e.g., 1.5 inches to 12 inches depending on the size and plastic processing capacity of the present injection mold machine).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In at least some embodiments, the shaft extension extends (along the axial length of the barrel) substantially the entire length of the third zone. However, when the plunger is fully retracted into the screw shaft, the exit opening(s) of the channel(s) opens into the injection zone so that melted plastic can exit the channel(s) and into this injection zone. Thus, since the melted plastic is typically under pressure (e.g., a range of 100-1000 psi) in the channel(s), and there is a reduced pressure in the injection zone (e.g., ambient atmospheric pressure), plastic will flow out of the channels and into the injection zone whenever such a pressure differential exists. However, when the plunger extends into the injection zone for forcing plastic into a mold, such extension closes the channel exit opening(s) so that there is substantially no backwards flow of plastic from the injection zone into the channel(s) due to the plunger induced pressure increase in the injection zone. Accordingly, the plunger serves a dual purpose of both forcing melted plastic into the mold, and also iteratively opening and closing the channels to the injection zone. So, in particular, the present injection mold machine requires no separate valve for metering the plastic melt into the injection zone.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The fourth or injection zone (also identified as a &#x201c;plastication zone&#x201d;) includes an injection chamber for receiving plastic from the channels, and an injection tube through which plastic flows from the injection chamber to an injection nozzle which is attached to the mold for providing plastic therein. As with other plastic conveying portions of the present injection molding machine, the injection chamber and the injection tube are connected so that the melted plastic flows generally in a straight path along the axis of the barrel. Thus, this linear arrangement prevents plastic pressure drops which can occur where the pressurized liquid plastic is constrained to abruptly flow in substantially different directions (e.g., around a 90 degree corner).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The injection zone also includes one or more of the heat sources for providing additional heat to the plastic provided therein. As with the heat sources in the other zones, the heat sources for the injection zone are controlled by the controller (e.g., a computer system specifically configured for controlling the production of parts by the present injection molding machine, and/or programmable logic controller),</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is worthwhile to note that in one embodiment of the present injection mold machine, a vacuum controlled break valve is provided for control of gas (e.g., air) entering the injection zone. In particular, the vacuum break valve allows air to enter the injection chamber when the injection plunger lowers the pressure within the fourth zone (in particular, the injection chamber) due to the plunger retracting from the injection chamber and into the screw shaft extension. In at least one embodiment, the vacuum break valve is provided along a shaft of the plunger, wherein this plunger shaft reciprocates into and out of the screw shaft. Accordingly, when a lower pressure (e.g., lower than ambient atmospheric pressure) occurs in the injection chamber, the vacuum break valve opens to introduce air into the injection chamber as will be described further hereinbelow. During plunger retraction (toward and/or into the screw shaft), the vacuum break valve remains open until (or just before) the plunger retracts sufficiently so that the channels are open to the injection chamber, and then the valve closes hereby preventing the melted plastic entering the chamber from exiting via the valve.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is additionally worthwhile to note that when plastic is urged under pressure into the injection chamber, the heated gas (e.g., air) therein readily escapes as a backflow product through, e.g., the channel(s). Such gas backflow is facilitated in the present injection molding machine since the screw does not tightly fit within the barrel, and thus, gas can escape into the barrel (via the channel(s)) as plastic enters the injection chamber. Empirical evidence indicates that when the present injection molding machine is operating for molding acceptable parts, the pressure in the channels is effective for rapidly filling of the injection chamber with melted plastic. Accordingly, it is believed that the melted plastic enters the injection chamber at sufficient velocity to fill this chamber with melted plastic beginning with the opposite end of the chamber from the chamber end that repeatedly provides the plastic via the channel(s). Accordingly, since the exit opening for providing plastic from the injection chamber to the injection tube is located in this opposite end of the injection chamber, when the high velocity plastic commences to fill the chamber, it does so from the chamber opposite end. Consequently, the gas within the injection chamber is displaced from this opposite chamber end thereby substantially preventing gas pockets from being trapped within the plastic proximate exit opening. Moreover, since it is believed that the melted plastic collects within the chamber from this opposite end first, the gas within the chamber is forced to travel backward toward the channel opening(s) as the melted plastic under pressure injects into the injection chamber. In some embodiments, such channel opening(s) may be shaped to facilitate the melted plastic filling the injection chamber from the opposite end to the chamber end having the channel opening(s). In particular, such channel opening(s) may be shaped to direct the melted plastic into particular portions of the injection chamber. For example, the channel opening(s) may be shaped so that when the channel(s) initially opens, melted plastic is directed generally toward the interior of the opposite end of the chamber, and as the channel opening(s) widens, the melted plastic may be generally directed to a portion of the axial centerline of the plunger reciprocation wherein this portion is progressively closer to the channel opening(s). Accordingly, the gas backflow may be generally along or adjacent to the chamber sides providing relatively direct backflow paths to the channel open(s).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, it is aspect of the present injection molding machine, that since such escaping gas is heated to substantially the temperature of the injection chamber, this gas may be reused to facilitate the heating of the plastic in the second and/or the third zones. Alternatively/additionally, such heated gas may also be recirculated back into the injection chamber via the vacuum break valve described above. Accordingly, the recycling/reuse of the heat within the escaping gas increases the efficiency of the present injection molding machine.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further note that in one embodiment, there may be backflow vents separate from the above described channels, wherein such backflow vents do not conduct melted plastic into the injection chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The injection tube of the fourth zone may be of reduced cross sectional area in comparison to the injection chamber, and additionally may be of sufficient length to contain at least one volume of plastic from the injection chamber, but generally less than two such volumes. Accordingly, since the injection tube has an increased surface area (relative to volume) in comparison to the injection chamber, and is also heated, the plastic therein is acceptably liquefied for mold injection. However, due to the relatively small volume of plastic therein, the energy consumption of the injection molding machine is reduced over similar prior art injection molding machines.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The fourth zone may also include a programmable nozzle valve at or proximate to the injection nozzle, wherein this valve opens to release melted plastic in a mold cavity when there is sufficient pressure within the injection nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is an aspect of the present injection molding machine that the controller mentioned hereinabove receives various sensor readings indicative of plastic temperatures, plastic pressures, and plastic viscosity. In particular, the controller receives the following measurements from the injection molding machine:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0022">(a) A pressure measurement from a screw pressure sensor at the end of the screw opposite the screw end terminating in the second zone. When the screw rotates to push the plastic pellets forward, there is a corresponding back pressure induced to push the screw in the opposite direction from the direction to pellets move. Such back pressure is related to the quantity of pellets being moved by the screw, and more importantly, the quantity of pellets being compacted in the second zone. Accordingly, unless a predetermined back pressure is sensed by the controller from the screw pressure sensor providing such pressure measurements, the activation of the plunger will not commence, or if already reciprocating, the plunger may cease to reciprocate until a threshold pressure is detected by the controller from the screw pressure sensor.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0023">(b) A temperature sensor in the first zone for monitoring the temperature of the plastic pellets and/or the barrel in this zone. Accordingly, the controller controls the one or more first zone heating devices so that the pellets are heated just below their softening or deforming temperature in the first zone.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0024">(c) A chamber pressure sensor for sensing pressure within the injection chamber. Unless there is at least a predetermined pressure within the injection chamber, the injection plunger will not be activated to send a plastic pressure wave into the injection tube and consequently cause melted plastic to be injected into a mold cavity. Accordingly, the present injection molding machine only forms parts when an appropriate pressure is registered by this pressure sensor.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0025">(d) A tube temperature sensor located in the injection tube, at or proximate to the nozzle. Unless the plastic and/or the injection tube is determined to be of a threshold temperature (e.g., specific to the plastic), the plunger will not be activated, and the nozzle valve will not be opened to allow plastic to be injected into a mold cavity.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0026">(e) A tube pressure sensor located in the injection tube, at or near the nozzle. Unless the plastic is determined to have a threshold pressure within the injection tube (such pressure obtained from the most recent injection(s) of plastic via the plunger), the nozzle valve will not be opened to allow plastic to be injected into a mold cavity. Accordingly, the plunger may be activated a plurality of times between openings of the nozzle valve or activated only with nozzle valve opening depending on the pressure requirements for the plastic within the injection tube. In some embodiments, the controller may use the tube pressure for determining a length of time the nozzle valve may be allowed to be open since the pressure on the melted plastic in combination known viscosity characteristics of the plastic at the tube temperature can be used to determine the amount of plastic that will be injected into a mold cavity.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">It is a further aspect of the present injection molding system that it may achieve plastic and resin plastication through the conduction of electrically generated heat as opposed to pressure induced shear heat generation methods currently used by most injection molding machines. The conduction of electrically generated heat provides a process of plastication that is more accurate than shear generated heat. Additionally, since there is also a reduced pressure applied to the plastic (due to the lack or substantially reduced shearing), the injection molding machine may be used to mold parts from non-traditional materials (e.g., bio-based resins of any type, metal injection molding feedstock, and liquid silicone) that would degrade under shearing, and may be used to produce part with enhanced performance characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">It is a further aspect of the present injection molding system and method of use that there may be continuous material plastication that preserves the plastic/resin quality with exact application of prescribed levels of heat to known volumes of plastic/resin. This method dramatically reduces the force and strength requirements for the subsequent injection process (via the plunger), thereby allowing a more accurate and responsive delivery of melted plastic/resin into an injection mold cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">It is a further aspect of the present injection molding system and method of use that integrated pressure and temperature sensors may be used by the controller to accurately quantify the output of the present injection molding machine, and in particular during the injection molding cycle for perfecting changes to the injection molding process in order to affect parts being produced. This is accomplished even when variations in the raw material are present. Moreover, such real time mold injection process changes are provided by an injection mold controller that is data-driven from measurements obtained from sensors provided in the injection molding machine. In particular, such a data-driven machine and method results in various components of the present injection molding machine having activations that are more asynchronous to one another than the lock step or a predetermined non-deviating sequence of steps prevalent in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">It is a further aspect of the present injection molding system and method that this system can initiated without an operator present (assuming the proper mold is connected to the injection molding machine, and this machine is appropriately clean). Moreover, the presently disclosed injection molding system and method can also operate unattended for molding parts. Thus, activation and operation of the present injection molding system may be performed automatically and remotely such as via a communications network (Internet) activation, wherein the present injection molding system and method remain unattended while producing the desired parts.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">The above described aspects of the present injection mold system and method were combined at least in part due to the recognition of the longstanding unmet drawbacks in various prior art injection molding machines and methods. Moreover, even relatively recent supposedly improvements in plastic injection mold technology have substantial drawbacks. For example, the following recent references have been considered, and are incorporated herein by reference:

    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0032">U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0021860 by Clock et. al. filed Jul. 24, 2001, wherein an injection molding apparatus is disclosed that includes: an extruder configured to receive and compound raw materials, a plunger disposed longitudinally within the extruder, and a mold positioned at the outlet end of the extruder and configured to receive the compounded raw materials. The extruder includes first and second screws intermeshed with each other along at least a portion of the length thereof. The plunger is typically positioned longitudinally within a bore defined within the first screw and is translatable within the bore. The method for using the apparatus includes adding at least one material to the extruding unit proximate a first end thereof, compounding the material, transporting the material to an outlet port proximate a second end of the extruding unit, and transferring the material from the outlet port to the mold via a reciprocating action of the plunger relative to the first screw. The Clock application discloses a check ring for preventing back flow of the liquid plastic out of an injection chamber. Such a check ring: can be unreliable, and introduce inaccuracies into the quantity of the plastic injected into a mold due to both the variability in the closing by the check ring as well as the restrictions to plastic flow therethrough. Note that such impedances to plastic flow are magnified in that such check rings are typically heat sinks; thus, causing the plastic to flow less readily. Moreover, it appears that the Clock's plunger (also a heat sink having sizable plastic contacting surface area) must rotate with the screw. Accordingly, since it is irregularly shaped (e.g., there are flutes therein), there is unnecessary drag on the motor rotating the screw. Additionally, since the check ring is not monitored during operation for determining if it is performing properly, there can be significant variability in parts produced, and for which machine configurations settable by the operator may have an unpredictable (if any) effect.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0033">U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0020943 by Leopold et. al. filed May 9, 2001, wherein a molding machine is disclosed for molding microparts containing between 0.001 to 3.5 cubic centimeters of plastic shot volume includes a plasticizing portion operatively connected to an injection portion and a mold portion. A valve member is provided to open and close the connection between the plasticizing portion and the injection portion. A linear motor member is associated with the injection portion to permit molding times of presumably 0.01 seconds at pressures up to about 100,000 psi during injection of the molten plastic into the mold portion. Leopold discloses using a valve for apparently allowing melted plastic to flow into a bore for injection into a mold. Moreover, Leopold also needs an additional valve at his injection nozzle. There are reliability problems with such valves since a temperature decrease of the plastic in or around such valves can cause these valves to malfunction due to an increase in the viscosity or solidification of the plastic. Moreover, such valves are particularly problematic if the plastic includes one or more filler materials that may be fibrous since such valves may fail to fully close and/or open due to fiber build up or compaction in or around the valves.</li>

<p id="p-0043" num="0055">The above-identified references each have their own corresponding drawbacks that make them at most partially useful in addressing injection molding machine related problems.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0056">An embodiment of the presently disclosed injection molding system <b>12</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein a controller <b>16</b> is shown together with the injection molding machine <b>20</b> that the controller <b>16</b> controls. The injection molding machine <b>20</b> will be first described hereinbelow, followed by a description of the controller <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0057">In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a cross sectional view of an embodiment of the injection molding machine <b>20</b> is shown. The machine <b>20</b> includes a material hopper <b>24</b> for providing plastic material (e.g., plastic pellets) to the machine <b>20</b>, wherein the pellets, by gravity, enter a substantially vertical escapement <b>28</b> below the hopper <b>24</b>. The escapement <b>28</b> may be an opening in a throat block <b>32</b> which may be a metal block (e.g., cube or other shape) acceptable for providing support and stability to the material hopper <b>24</b> attached thereto as well as various components of the machine <b>20</b>. In particular, the throat block <b>32</b> includes generally horizontal barrel opening <b>36</b> therethrough which intersects with the escapement <b>28</b>. The barrel opening <b>36</b> is fitted with a barrel <b>40</b> that extends horizontally beyond the throat block <b>32</b> out one of the sides of throat block <b>32</b>. The throat block <b>32</b> also includes a plurality of water channels <b>42</b> for circulating coolant (e.g., water or other suitable coolant) therein since, as will become evident from the description hereinbelow, excessive heat from the plastication of the pellets may transfer into throat block <b>32</b> and heat the pellets in the escapement <b>28</b> or the hopper <b>24</b> excessively (e.g., wherein the pellets might be soft). The barrel <b>40</b> provides the structural support within which the pellets are transformed into a suitable liquid state for injection into a mold <b>46</b>. The barrel <b>40</b> includes a first stage <b>44</b> extending substantially through the throat block <b>32</b> and out of the throat block to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This first stage <b>44</b> is coincident in extent (along the axis <b>112</b>) with the first zone described in the Summary section hereinabove, and accordingly such an extent may be also referred to as the first zone <b>44</b>. A cross section of the first stage <b>44</b> (in a direction traverse to the cross section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, a cylindrical shape may be preferred. The first stage <b>44</b> may have a cylindrical interior extending therethrough. The first stage <b>44</b> terminates outside the throat block <b>32</b> at an interior annular wall <b>48</b> which reduces the interior of the barrel <b>40</b>. From this annular wall <b>48</b> and extending further away from the throat block <b>32</b> is a second stage <b>52</b> of the barrel <b>40</b>, this second stage being coincident in extent (along the axis <b>112</b>) with the second zone described in the Summary section hereinabove, and accordingly such an extent may be also referred to as the second zone <b>52</b>. This second stage <b>52</b> may have a generally cylindrical shaped interior which has center axis collinear with a center axis of the first stage <b>44</b>. However, instead of having a smooth cylindrical interior surface as the first stage has, the second stage <b>52</b> includes a plurality of channels <b>56</b> in its interior side wall <b>58</b> (a representative cross section of the second stage <b>52</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), wherein these channels extend outwardly from the center axis and such channels may be distributed about the circumference of the second stage. Since the channels <b>56</b> extend through the horizontal length of the second stage <b>52</b>, the second stage terminates with channel openings at each end of the second stage. The end of the second stage distal from the first stage <b>44</b> is integral with a third stage <b>60</b> which has therein a cylindrical injection chamber <b>64</b> that may be of the same diameter as the second stage (excluding the channels <b>56</b>), this third stage being coincident in extent (along the axis <b>112</b>) with the third zone described in the Summary section hereinabove, and accordingly such an extent may be also referred to as the third zone <b>60</b>. The injection chamber <b>64</b> has a horizontal center axis that is collinear with the center axes of the first and second stages <b>44</b> and <b>52</b>. The injection chamber <b>64</b> extends away from the second stage <b>52</b> until a second diameter reducing annular interior wall <b>68</b> is reached, wherein a central opening <b>72</b> in the wall <b>68</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) may have a center point on the center axis of the injection chamber <b>64</b>. From this second annular wall <b>68</b>, a fourth stage <b>76</b> of the barrel <b>40</b> commences which includes an injection tube <b>78</b> that extends from an opening <b>72</b> in the second wall <b>68</b> to a nozzle end <b>80</b> of the machine <b>20</b>, wherein the nozzle end is configured for attaching to the plastic injection mold <b>46</b> and injecting melted plastic therein as one skilled in the art will understand. Note that this fourth stage is coincident in extent (along the axis <b>112</b>) with the fourth zone described in the Summary section hereinabove, and accordingly such an extent may be also referred to as the fourth zone <b>76</b>. In comparison to the diameter of the injection chamber <b>64</b>, the injection tube <b>78</b> includes a substantially reduced diameter cylindrical interior. Moreover, near or substantially at the nozzle end <b>80</b>, there is a nozzle valve <b>82</b> which opens and closes under the direction of the controller <b>16</b>. The nozzle valve <b>82</b> remains closed until a desired plastic consistency and pressure is detected within the injection tube <b>78</b>. Once such conditions occur in the injection tube <b>78</b>, and assuming the mold <b>46</b> is in a state wherein plastic can be accepted, the nozzle valve <b>82</b> is opened by the controller <b>16</b> for providing plastic to the mold cavity <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0058">The barrel <b>40</b> also includes an opening <b>84</b> for receiving plastic pellets from the escapement <b>28</b>. Such pellets enter the barrel <b>40</b> and are retained between the flights <b>88</b> of an auger screw <b>92</b> (also &#x201c;screw&#x201d; herein) provided within the barrel. The screw <b>92</b> is preferably concentric or coaxial with the barrel <b>40</b>. The screw <b>92</b> includes a shaft <b>96</b> from which one or more helical flights <b>88</b> project outwardly therefrom, and such flights <b>88</b> extend from generally below the escapement <b>28</b> through the first stage <b>44</b> of the barrel <b>40</b>. The shaft <b>96</b> also extends horizontally in the opposite direction from the escapement <b>28</b>, wherein a thickened shaft portion <b>100</b> adjacent to the throat block <b>32</b> is secured thereabout with a bearing <b>104</b>, which is provided within a mounting plate <b>108</b>, which is fixedly attached to the adjacent side of the throat block <b>32</b>. Accordingly, the bearing <b>104</b> supports and maintains alignment of the screw <b>92</b> within the barrel <b>40</b> so that the screw can rotate about a center axis <b>112</b> of the barrel, this center axis including the center axes for each of the first, second, third, and fourth stages of the barrel as described hereinabove. In particular, the screw <b>92</b> diameter within the barrel <b>40</b> is smaller than the interior diameter of the first stage by a tolerance of approximately 0.01 to 0.08 inches so that the screw can rotate freely within barrel when there is no plastic in the barrel to impede such free rotation. Note that the tolerance between the interior of the first stage <b>44</b> and the screw <b>92</b> may be dependent upon the intended size of the plastic pellets to be provided in the material hopper <b>24</b> since such tolerance is intended to be small enough so that such pellets cannot be caught and sheared between the interior surface of the first stage <b>44</b> and the portions (apexes) of the auger screw flights <b>88</b> that rotate closest to the first stage interior surface. Accordingly, the tolerance range above is believed appropriate for pellets that are approximately 0.125 inches in width, height and depth, pellets being a standard size for use in injection molding machines.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0059">The shaft <b>96</b> also extends beyond the mounting plate <b>108</b>, wherein a pulley <b>116</b> is also secured thereabout. For rotating the screw <b>92</b>, a belt (not shown) is provided in the annular recess <b>120</b> of the pulley <b>116</b> and also provided about a pulley of a drive motor (also not shown) for rotating the pulley <b>116</b> and consequently the screw <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0060">The screw <b>92</b> has a central bore <b>124</b> therethrough, the center axis of the bore is coincident with the center axis <b>112</b>. Within the bore <b>124</b> there is an injection plunger <b>160</b> (having a plunger head <b>132</b> and a plunger shaft <b>136</b>), and a plunger shank <b>140</b>. The plunger shank <b>140</b> extends from the screw <b>92</b> rearward beyond the pulley <b>116</b>. Prior to exiting the screw <b>92</b>, the plunger shank <b>140</b> and the interior surface of the bore <b>124</b> are intermeshed via mating gear teeth <b>142</b> or another mechanism for both supporting the shank <b>140</b> within the bore <b>124</b>, and for allowing the shank to shift along the center axis <b>112</b> under the urging of the motor (or pneumatic cylinder, hydraulic cylinder) <b>144</b> to which the shank end attaches via a bearing <b>148</b>. In another embodiment, instead of mating gear teeth <b>142</b>, a bearing that allows the shank <b>140</b> to move in the axial direction relative to the bore <b>124</b> and provide support for the shank <b>140</b> within the bore <b>124</b> may replace the mating gear teeth <b>142</b>. Accordingly, the bearing <b>148</b> allows the shank <b>140</b> to rotate with the rotation of the screw <b>92</b> by the pulley <b>116</b>. However, when activated (by the controller <b>16</b>, also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, and described hereinbelow) the motor <b>144</b> shifts the shank along the center axis <b>112</b> either for pushing the shank further into the screw, or for extending further rearward outside of the screw. In particular, the extent that the shank <b>140</b> may shift in either direction does not disengage the shank from the interior of the bore <b>124</b> at the shift mechanism <b>142</b>. Moreover, length of such a shift (in either direction) may be identical to the travel of the plunger head <b>132</b> in the injection chamber <b>64</b> as will be further described hereinbelow. The shank <b>140</b> attaches, at a second end thereof opposite to the shank end attached to the motor <b>144</b>, to a receptacle <b>152</b>. In one embodiment, the receptacle <b>152</b> may be threaded and the second end of the shank <b>140</b> may have corresponding threads (e.g., male-female junction). In particular, the receptacle <b>152</b> may threadably mate with the end of the shank <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0061">The sleeve <b>156</b> also projects beyond the fluted end of the screw <b>92</b>. The portion of the sleeve <b>156</b> that extends beyond the end of the screw <b>92</b> is within a fine tolerance of the interior surface of the second stage <b>52</b> of the barrel <b>40</b>. More precisely, the smallest interior diameter of the second stage interior side wall <b>58</b> may be within a tolerance of approximately 0.01 inches of the outer diameter of the sleeve <b>156</b>. Thus, the sleeve <b>156</b> forms a rotatable inner most side of each channel <b>56</b> in the second stage <b>52</b>. In the present embodiment, the exterior surface of the sleeve <b>156</b> forming the inner most channel sides may be highly polished or otherwise provided with a coating that substantially prevents melted or softened plastic from adhering thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0062">The sleeve <b>156</b> and the plunger head <b>132</b> are sealed together (such combination also referred to as plunger <b>160</b>), and may be considered as an embodiment of the &#x201c;shaft extension&#x201d; referred in the Summary section hereinabove. An outside diameter of the sleeve <b>156</b> may be within a fine tolerance of the inside diameter of the injection chamber <b>64</b>, e.g., within a range of 0.005 to 0.001, so that this sleeve <b>156</b> and plunger head <b>132</b> combination can enter the injection chamber (via an urging by the motor <b>144</b>) for injecting melted plastic from the injection chamber into the injection tube <b>78</b>, and also via an opposite urging by the motor <b>144</b>, the plunger <b>160</b> can retract out of the injection chamber <b>64</b> once the plunger <b>160</b> reaches its full extension into the injection chamber <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0063">The plunger head <b>132</b> includes a one way vacuum break valve <b>164</b> (e.g., a poppet style valve) for opening and providing a gas (e.g., air) or other fluid substance therethrough when a reduced atmospheric pressure occurs in the injection chamber <b>64</b> relative to a pressure on an opposite side of this valve, and remaining closed otherwise. When the valve <b>164</b> opens, the gas provided to the injection chamber <b>64</b> comes, in one embodiment, from within the bore <b>124</b>, and more particularly, from within a plunger vent <b>168</b> within the plunger shaft <b>136</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). However, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that such gas may come from a backflow of gas (i.e., in an opposite direction from the flow of plastic toward the nozzle end <b>80</b>) through the channels <b>56</b>. The vacuum break valve <b>164</b> may be configured for opening when there is a pressure differential between sides of the valve in a range of 2 to 1,000 psi. Accordingly, when the plunger <b>160</b> retracts back into the screw <b>92</b>, the vacuum break valve <b>164</b> opens so that the retraction of the plunger does not cause the melted plastic within the injection tube <b>78</b> to withdraw back into the injection chamber <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0064">The injection molding machine <b>20</b> also includes a plurality of heat sources (e.g., such heat sources may generate heat via electrical resistance, electrical inductance, microwave or ultrasonic energy) distributed about and in contact with (or proximate to) various portions of the barrel <b>40</b>. In particular, one or more such heat sources <b>172</b> may surround the barrel <b>40</b> in a later or terminal portion of the barrel first stage <b>44</b> near the commencement of the barrel second stage <b>52</b>, and continue to surround barrel <b>44</b> in substantially the second stage <b>52</b>. The heat sources <b>172</b> (under the control of the controller <b>16</b>) preheat the plastic pellets to a point just below the softening point of the plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0065">The heat sources <b>172</b> (under the control of the controller <b>16</b>) heat the plastic pellets therein to a temperature where they become at least soft and deformable for flowing into the channels <b>56</b> due to the pressure exerted on such deformable pellets from additional pellets moving into the second stage <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0066">The steps performed by the controller <b>16</b> for appropriately activating and deactivating the heat sources <b>172</b> are described hereinbelow in the section entitled &#x201c;Controller Operation&#x201d;. Note that in one embodiment, an additional heat source <b>176</b> (not shown in figures) may be placed on a different location of the barrel <b>44</b> and controlled by controller <b>16</b>. Note that in such an embodiment of the controller <b>16</b> the heat sources <b>172</b> and <b>176</b> are activated and deactivated in unison by the same processing in the controller <b>16</b>. That is, the controller may not distinguish between the heat sources <b>172</b> and <b>176</b>. In another embodiment, heat sources <b>172</b> and <b>176</b> may be activated, for example, in a serial or sequential manner.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0067">An additional one or more heat sources <b>180</b> may surround the barrel <b>40</b> in substantially its third stage <b>60</b> and fourth stage <b>76</b>. The heat sources <b>180</b> (under the control of the controller <b>16</b>) further heat the plastic in the injection chamber <b>64</b> and the injection tube <b>78</b> so that the temperature of the plastic is above a minimum threshold to be injected into the mold cavity <b>83</b>. The steps performed by the controller <b>16</b> for appropriately activating and deactivating the heat sources <b>180</b> are also described hereinbelow in the section entitled &#x201c;Controller Operation&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0068">The injection molding machine <b>20</b> also includes a plurality of sensors for communicating measurements related to plastic processing to the controller <b>16</b>. In one embodiment of the injection molding machine <b>20</b>, there is a screw <b>92</b> pressure sensor (denoted &#x201c;PT<b>1</b>&#x201d; herein) attached, e.g., to the screw end between the pulley <b>116</b> and the motor <b>144</b>, wherein this sensor measures the forces on the screw, wherein such forces are substantially along the center axis <b>112</b>, and induced by the compaction of the plastic in first and second barrel stages <b>44</b> and <b>52</b>. Accordingly, such for forces are in the direction for pushing the screw <b>92</b> out of the end of the barrel <b>40</b> provided in the throat block <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0069">The injection molding machine <b>20</b> also includes a plurality of sensors for communicating measurements related to plastic processing to the controller <b>16</b>. In one embodiment of the injection molding machine <b>20</b>, there is a screw <b>92</b> pressure sensor or pressure transducer (denoted &#x201c;PT<b>1</b>&#x201d; herein) attached, e.g., to the screw <b>92</b> end between the pulley <b>116</b> and the motor <b>144</b>, wherein this sensor measures the pressure on the screw, wherein such pressure is substantially along the center axis <b>112</b>, and induced by the compaction of the plastic in first and second barrel stages <b>44</b> and <b>52</b>. Accordingly, such for pressure may be considered a force in a direction for pushing the screw <b>92</b> out of the end of the barrel <b>40</b> provided in the throat block <b>32</b>. A temperature sensor (denoted &#x201c;TC<b>1</b>&#x201d; herein) is attached to the barrel <b>40</b> (more particularly, the third stage thereof) for detecting temperatures in the injection chamber <b>64</b>. The sensor TC<b>1</b> may be a thermocouple as one skilled in the art will understand. Also attached to the barrel third stage is a pressure sensor or pressure transducer (denoted &#x201c;PT<b>2</b>&#x201d; herein) for measuring the pressure within the injection chamber <b>64</b>. Downstream from the sensor PT<b>2</b> is another pressure sensor or pressure transducer (denoted &#x201c;PT<b>3</b>&#x201d; herein), wherein this sensor measures the pressure within the injection tube <b>78</b>.

Referring to the controller <b>16</b>, it includes a main controller <b>204</b> that performs that high level control functionality for controlling the injection molding machine <b>20</b>. A flowchart of the processing performed by the main controller <b>204</b> is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> described hereinbelow. The main controller <b>204</b> activates a plurality of subcontrollers that may perform their tasks asynchronously from one another. In particular, subcontroller <b>304</b> is provided for controlling the heat source(s) <b>172</b> for heating the first and second zones <b>44</b> and <b>52</b>. A subcontroller <b>308</b> is provided for controlling the heat source(s) <b>180</b> for heating the third and fourth zones <b>60</b> and <b>76</b>. A subcontroller <b>312</b> is provided for controlling the screw <b>92</b> rotation during startup of the injection molding machine <b>20</b>, and more particularly, prior to injection molding machine entering a plastic processing state where processed plastic is flowing through the injection molding machine appropriately for making parts. A subcontroller <b>316</b> is provided for controlling the screw <b>92</b> rotation once plastic is flowing through the injection molding machine appropriately for making parts. A description of each of these subcontrollers is provided hereinbelow. However, prior to providing such descriptions, a description of the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> representing the processing performed by the main controller <b>204</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in step <b>404</b>, the controller <b>16</b> receives input for activating the injection molding system <b>12</b>. Such activation may be from an operator at the injection molding system <b>12</b>, or an operator that is remote from the location of the system <b>12</b>. Moreover, since the controller <b>16</b> can be remote from the injection molding machine <b>20</b> (e.g., in communication therewith via a communications network such as the Internet), the operator may reside at the controller site, or at the injection molding machine site. Alternatively/additionally, the operator may not reside at the site for either the controller <b>16</b> or the injection molding machine <b>20</b>, but instead may communicate with controller via a communications network. Moreover, the input received may be from another computational system such as an inventory management system that automatically requests additional parts to be produced by the injection molding system <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0072">Note that such input may include a type of material to be supplied to the injection molding machine <b>20</b>, an identification(s) of the part(s) to be molded, the quantity of parts to be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0073">In step <b>408</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the controller identifies from the input received the type of material to supply to the injection molding machine <b>20</b>. Such identification may be precisely identified in the input, or may be only generally identified (e.g., by a plastics chemical family, or by required part functionality such as elasticity, compression strength, biodegradable, acceptable for retention in a human body, non-toxic if ingested, etc. In one embodiment, such material may be automatically supplied to the hopper <b>24</b> for commencing to produce the parts desired, and the desired mold <b>46</b> may be automatically attached to the injection molding machine <b>20</b>, e.g., once the mold is located in an inventory of molds <b>46</b>. Subsequently, in step <b>412</b>, a database management system <b>410</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) may be accessed for determining the injection molding machine <b>20</b> parameters to use in molding the desired parts.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0074">In step <b>416</b>, the subcontroller <b>304</b> is activated for controlling the heat source(s) <b>172</b> for heating the second and third zones <b>44</b> and <b>52</b>. The input to the subcontroller <b>304</b> may include a desired start temperature range for readings from the temperature sensor TC1 as determined for plastic to be processed; the range of temperatures may be, e.g., +/&#x2212;10 degrees F., and the range may be a set point range identified as the range [set_pt_low, set_pt_hi] wherein set_pt_low is a low set point for the readings from TC<b>1</b>, and set_pt_hi is a high set point for these readings. Psuedo-code representative of the processing performed by the subcontroller <b>304</b> is as follows:</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0076">Referring to the subcontroller <b>304</b> psuedo-code hereinabove, process <b>1</b> and process <b>2</b> may be activated for being performed simultaneously. However, note that process <b>2</b> can override process <b>1</b> to force the heat source(s) <b>172</b> to heat zones <b>44</b> and <b>52</b>. It is believed that an important aspect of the controller <b>16</b> is the use of the pressure measurements from the sensors PT<b>1</b> and PT<b>2</b> to modulate the heat delivered to the first and second zones <b>44</b> and <b>52</b>. In particular, the computation of &#x201c;Delta<b>12</b>&#x201d; provides a quantitative index as to whether plastic viscosity in screw <b>92</b> is high, and/or the plastic is not flowing through channels <b>56</b> into the injection chamber <b>64</b>. For example, if the value Pt<b>1</b> is high relative to the value of Pt<b>2</b>, then there is substantial pressure in the first and second zone <b>44</b> and <b>52</b> for pushing the screw <b>92</b> out the rear end of the injection molding machine <b>20</b>, and little (if any) plastic in the injection chamber <b>64</b>. Accordingly, this is indicative of the plastic in the second and third zones <b>52</b> and <b>60</b> not being hot enough to proper flow through the channel <b>56</b> and into the injection chamber <b>64</b>. Thus, in this case, any deactivation of the heat source(s) <b>172</b> is overridden by process <b>2</b>. Note that it may be important for the reading of PT<b>1</b> and PT<b>2</b> to be taken substantially simultaneously, and that the readings of PT<b>2</b> be taken when the pressure in the injection chamber <b>68</b> is not being impacted by the movement of the plunger <b>160</b> into or out of the injection chamber. Accordingly, such reading are only taken when the controller <b>16</b> detects that the plunger is fully retracted from the injection chamber <b>64</b>. The use of the Boolean variable &#x201c;Delta<b>12</b>_Not_Measured&#x201d; assists in making sure the readings are taken at a proper time.</p>

As described in the pseudo-code following. Note that the input for this subcontroller is: a desired start temperature range for readings from the temperature sensor TC<b>2</b> (for heat sources <b>180</b>) for plastic to be processed, the range of temperatures (e.g., +/&#x2212;10 degrees F.) creating a set point range, i.e., a range: [set_pt_low2, set_pt_hi2] for the readings from TC<b>2</b>.</p>
