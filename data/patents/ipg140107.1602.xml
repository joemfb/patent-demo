<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/121,433, filed on Dec. 10, 2008.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to the field of power tools.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the power tool field, various types of sanding apparatuses such as power belt sanders, power drum sanders, and power rasps are all known. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,410,412, 7,381,118, 7,338,348. 7,235,005, 7,179,158, and 7,083,508&#x2014;the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated within&#x2014;each disclose examples of conventional belt sanders.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, there currently does not exist a single power tool that is capable of performing the functions of a belt sander, a drum sander, and a rasp. Thus, a craftsman who is in need of all three functionalities must separately purchase a conventional belt sander, a conventional drum sander, and a conventional power rasp. Not only is this costly from a monetary perspective, but it is also costly from a storage perspective.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims. Furthermore, in the detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Generally speaking, embodiments provide for an interchangeable, multi-purpose sanding system that allows a single- or variable-speed handheld sanding apparatus to interchangeably serve as multiple sanding tools. The multiple sanding tools may include, but are not limited to, a belt sander, a drum sander, and a power rasp.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a sanding apparatus <b>10</b> in accordance with an embodiment that has been configured as a belt sander. Generally, the sanding apparatus includes a motor housing <b>24</b> having a motor disposed therein, a front handle <b>22</b> and a rear handle <b>20</b>. The motor is operable to drive a drive mechanism. In one embodiment, the drive mechanism includes a drive cylinder <b>12</b>, which enables the drive mechanism to translate power from the motor into rotational motion of the drive cylinder <b>12</b>. The drive cylinder <b>12</b> is operable to couple with and drive a plurality of sanding devices, including a sanding belt <b>14</b> and/or a plurality of interchangeable drums. In one embodiment, the drive mechanism is coupled to one end of the drive cylinder, while permitting the sanding belt <b>14</b> or interchangeable drum to be slid over or removed from the other end of the drive cylinder <b>12</b>. The drive mechanism may additionally or alternatively incorporate a solid shaft, a compressible rubber cylinder, a pneumatic cylinder, splines, keys, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the drive cylinder <b>12</b> serves as a belt sander roller, which is in frictional contact with a sanding loop <b>14</b>. Thus, the drive mechanism causes the drive cylinder <b>12</b> to rotate, thereby also causing the sanding loop <b>14</b> to also rotate. The sanding apparatus may also include one or more substantially permanently mounted and freely rotatable rollers, for example, at location <b>26</b>. Accordingly, in the configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sanding apparatus <b>10</b> may be used as a belt sander.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The sanding loop <b>14</b> may be removed from the sanding apparatus <b>10</b> so that the sanding apparatus <b>10</b> may be re-configured as another sanding tool. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the drive cylinder <b>12</b> comprises an expandable mandrel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, a sanding drum <b>16</b> may be slid over and secured to the drive cylinder <b>12</b>. Subsequently, bolt <b>28</b> may then be screwed into hole <b>30</b>, which then causes the drive cylinder <b>12</b> to expand, thereby securing the sanding drum <b>16</b> into place. In such as configuration, the drive cylinder <b>12</b> causes the sanding drum <b>16</b> to rotate. Accordingly, in the configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the sanding apparatus <b>10</b> may be used as a drum sander.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Similarly, the sanding drum <b>16</b> may be removed from the drive cylinder <b>12</b> (e.g. by loosening bolt <b>28</b>) so that the sanding apparatus <b>10</b> may be re-configured as another sanding tool. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a rasp drum <b>18</b> may be slid over the drive cylinder <b>12</b> and secured into place (e.g. by tightening bolt <b>28</b>). In such as configuration, the drive cylinder <b>12</b> causes the rasp drum <b>18</b> to rotate. Accordingly, in the configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the sanding apparatus <b>10</b> may be used as a power rasp.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition to the illustrated expanding mandrel, the attachment and detachment of the interchangeable drums may be implemented in a number of other ways. For example, the drums and/or drive cylinder <b>12</b> may include a latch, cartridge, or other type of quick-connect mechanism to enable convenient connection to and disconnection from the drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, embodiments provide for a hand-held sanding apparatus that may be re-configured into different sanding tools, such as a belt sander, a drum sander, and a power rasp. Such an apparatus according to various embodiments save a would-be purchaser the added cost of having to purchase two or more separate sanding apparatuses. Moreover, because only a single sanding apparatus is needed in order to perform multiple sanding operations, the sanding apparatus of various embodiments therefore provides improved portability over conventional sanding apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The previous description of the disclosed embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. Various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein.</p>
