<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 of European patent application no. 09179628.4, filed on Dec. 17, 2009, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a token comprising an improved physical unclonable function. The invention further relates to an integrated circuit comprising the token, to a method of randomizing the token and a system for randomizing the token. The invention further relates to a computer program product for causing a processor to perform the method of randomizing the token.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A token is a physical element which has unique properties which enable the token to be used for identification and authentication purposes, and for the generation of encryption/decryption keys. Such tokens are known in the art and typically comprise a physical object that comprises the unique physical element which enables a probing device to probe the unique physical element and to obtain a unique response from this unique physical element caused by the probing. The unique physical element is also often referred to as the physical unclonable function or physical random function or physical one-way function. This unique response from the physical unclonable function may be used by the probing device to generate a specific bit string which may indicate that the token is authentic. Alternatively, the bit string may be used, for example, to encrypt or decrypt data. Many different examples of physical unclonable functions are known in the art, such as three-dimensional optical media comprising scattering elements which are distributed randomly and which generate a unique scattering distribution when illuminated with, for example, a laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Physical unclonable functions may also be constituted by a capacitor comprising a dielectric medium arranged between the electrodes of the capacitor, in which the dielectric medium comprises a distribution of conducting particles. Such physical unclonable functions are, for example, known from WO 2007/069190 titled, &#x201c;On-Chip Estimation of Key-Extraction Parameters for Physical Tokens,&#x201d; of Geert Schrijen et al. (published Jun. 21, 2007). Because both the distribution of the conducting particles in the dielectric medium and the shape of the individual conducting particles are substantially random, the capacitance measured from the capacitor being the physical unclonable function is also substantially random. A benefit when using the physical unclonable function constituted by a capacitor is that it enables the physical unclonable function to be relatively easily embedded in a chip, for example, on a smart card and used, for example, in secure transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A problem with such known physical unclonable functions constituted by a capacitor is that a bandwidth within which the randomness of the capacitance varies is relatively limited.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the invention to provide a token comprising a capacitance based physical unclonable function in which the bandwidth within which the randomness of the capacitance varies is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention is defined by the independent claims. The dependent claims define advantageous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first aspect, the invention relates a token comprising a physical unclonable function and comprising probing means for probing the physical unclonable function to obtain a unique response in response to the probing,</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">the physical unclonable function comprising a capacitor comprising a dielectric medium being arranged at least partially between the electrodes of the capacitor and being configured for contributing to a capacitance value of the capacitor, the dielectric medium comprising conducting particles substantially randomly dispersed in the dielectric medium, the conducting particles comprising a phase changeable material being changeable between a first structural state having a first conductivity and a second structural state having a second conductivity different from the first conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As indicated before, a token is a physical element which has unique properties which enable the token to be used for identification and authentication purposes, and for the generation of encryption/decryption keys. The token, also often referred to as security token, hardware token, authentication token, cryptographic token, and software token typically acts as an electronic key and may, for example, be used in addition to or in place of a password to prove that a person is who he claims to be. The unique property may, for example, be a randomized capacitance value of a capacitor integrated in the token. By scanning the capacitor via a read-out circuit, the unique property may be captured and used for identification. Examples of tokens are, for example, a banking card, a smart card, or a device comprising a randomized physical parameter which is specific for the device, or specific for the integrated circuit on the device, or specific for the capacitor read-out circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Phase changeable material is a material which, upon a trigger, may alter its structural state, for example, from a crystalline state into an amorphous state. The phase changeable material is configured for altering the structural state while maintaining dispersed in the dielectric medium. To alter the structural state, the phase changeable material may, for example, be heated to above a threshold temperature causing the phase changeable material to melt. Typically the rate of cooling after having been molten determines the resulting structural state of the phase changeable material. The rate of cooling may strongly vary throughout the dielectric material and typically randomly varies throughout the dielectric material which causes the changing of the phase of the phase changeable material after heating above the threshold temperature to become substantially random within the dielectric medium. Such phase changeable materials, for example, comprise chalcogenide material which is also commonly used in re-writable compact discs (CD) and re-writable digital video discs (DVD). Chalcogenide materials comprise, for example, Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5 </sub>and many other Ge<sub>k</sub>In<sub>l</sub>Sb<sub>m</sub>Te<sub>n </sub>combinations, in which k, l, m and n may be in a range between 0 and 100.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The effect of the token according to the invention is that an additional element of complexity is added to the physical unclonable function constituted by a capacitor. Due to the difference in conductivity and due to the changeability of this difference in conductivity, the randomness of the capacitance of the physical unclonable function is substantially enhanced. When heating the phase changeable material to a temperature above the threshold temperature, the subsequent rate of cooling is strongly determined by the surroundings of the conducting particle comprising the phase changeable material. For example, the location of a first conducting particle in the dielectric medium comprises a surrounding of a first conducting particle which may, for example, enhance the cooling speed of the first conducting particle resulting in the phase changeable material in this first conducting particle, after having been through the heating and cooling phases, to end up in an amorphous state which result in a relatively low conductivity. A second conducting particle has different surroundings such that, for example, the thermal energy may not easily flow away from this second conducting particle which results in a reduced cooling speed and consequently in a crystalline state having relatively high conductivity. As the surroundings of the individual conducting particles is almost impossible to actively influence, it becomes substantially unpredictable which of the conducting particles comprising phase changeable materials will change from a crystalline state into an amorphous state and vice versa. As a result of the change of the structural state of the individual conducting particle, the conductivity of this individual particle changes which alters the overall capacitance of the physical unclonable function.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the known physical unclonable functions based on a capacitor, the capacitance is based only on the randomness of the distribution of the conducting particles dispersed in the dielectric medium between the electrodes of the capacitor. However, the distribution of the particles in the dielectric medium of the known physical unclonable functions is fixed, and because the distribution of the particles in the dielectric medium relates to the capacitance distribution of other three dimensional capacitors on the chip, a smart hacker may find out the capacitance distribution of the chip and may hack the stored data in it. In the physical unclonable function according to the invention the distribution of the conducting particles is substantially random, comparable with the known physical unclonable functions, but on top of that the conductive properties of the individual conducting particles may be altered and this altering of the conductive properties of the individual conducting particles may be performed substantially randomly. After having heated the phase changeable material to above the threshold temperature, the structural state to which the phase changeable material returns is depending strongly on the local surroundings of the individual conducting particles which makes the changing of the phase changeable material substantially unpredictable substantially increasing the randomness of the physical unclonable function and enhancing the security of the physical unclonable function. In addition, because the different phase typically also has different conductive properties, the range over which the capacitance of the capacitor constituting the physical unclonable function varies increases.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment of the token, the difference between the first conductivity and the second conductivity is at least one order of magnitude, and/or at least two orders of magnitude, and/or at least three orders of magnitude. When the first conductivity is at least one order of magnitude larger than the second conductivity, the conductivity of the first structural state is at least 10 times (=10<sup>1</sup>) better than the conductivity of the second structural state. This change in conductivity is relatively limited which requires good measurement techniques and relatively large capacitor to produce a noticeable difference in the dielectric constant of the capacitor. When the first conductivity is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the second conductivity, the conductivity of the first structural state is at least 100 times (=10<sup>2</sup>) better than the conductivity of the second structural state. This change of at least two orders of magnitude enable the dimensions of the capacitor constituting the physical unclonable function to be reduced while still obtaining a significant change in dielectric constant of the capacitor. When the first conductivity is at least three orders of magnitude larger than the second conductivity, the conductivity of the first structural state is at least 1000 times (=10<sup>3</sup>) better than the conductivity of the second structural state. This change of at least three orders of magnitude increase the randomness and bandwidth of the capacitor while enabling the dimensions of the capacitor to remain limited. The difference between the first conductivity and second conductivity may result in an overall change of the dielectric constant and as such determines the range within which the capacitance value of the capacitor may vary and consequently determines the range and bandwidth in the randomness which may be expected in the capacitance value of the capacitor. A relatively large bandwidth of randomly defined capacitance values of the capacitor generates a larger range in randomness of the capacitance value in the token and consequently a more secure token.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment of the token, the phase changeable material in the first structural state comprises a conductive material and in the second structural state comprises a dielectric material. Phase changeable materials which change from a conductive material into a dielectric material and vice versa have an even higher difference between the first conductivity and the second conductivity than the previously mentioned three orders of magnitude because the dielectric material substantially behaves as an insulator. Such materials are, for example, known as chalcogenide materials used in re-writable compact discs and DVDs. This huge difference in conductivity of the phase changeable material in the first structural state and the second structural state enable a significant increase in randomness and bandwidth of the physical unclonable function, while the capacitor may still be integrated in an integrated circuit. A further effect of the embodiment in which the second structural state comprises a dielectric material is that the dielectric permittivity of the capacitor changes. If the phase changeable material transforms into a non-conducting state (such as the dielectric material) the phase changeable material will behave like an isolator strongly influencing the dielectric permittivity of the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment of the token, the first structural state is a crystalline state of the phase changeable material, and the second structural state is an amorphous state of the phase changeable material. Such phase changeable material may, for example, be chalcogenide material which is also commonly used in re-writable compact discs (CD) and re-writable digital video discs (DVD). Chalcogens are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table. The term chalcogenide is more commonly reserved for sulfides, selenides, and tellurides, for example, Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5 </sub>and many other Ge<sub>k</sub>In<sub>l</sub>Sb<sub>m</sub>Te<sub>n </sub>combinations, in which k, l, m and n may be in a range between 0 and 100. Phase changeable material may, for example, also and alternatively comprise Se. Also materials like AgInSbTe may be suitable as phase changeable material. Also other less common materials such as InSe, SbSe, SbTe, InSbSe, InSbTe, GeSbSe, GeSbTeSe, and AgInSbSeTe may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment of the token, the dielectric medium surrounding the conducting particles is configured for allowing the phase changeable material to also change a shape of the phase changeable material when changing from the first structural state to the second structural state and/or vice versa. The dielectric medium may, for example, comprise Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, HfO<sub>2 </sub>particles which will cause the whole dielectric medium to expand and contract during heating and cooling cycle, depending on thermal expansion coefficient of the different materials present in the dielectric medium. This determines the final state which is &#x201c;freezed-in&#x201d; when the dielectric medium is cooled. During the heating and cooling some rearrangement of the particles and/or coalescence could take place changing the overall dielectric properties. Moreover, in the matrix there will be always some space/grain boundaries that allow reshaping/restructuring of the phase change materials.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Typically when changing from the crystalline phase to the amorphous phase and/or vice versa, not only the conductivity of the phase changeable material changes but also&#x2014;if possible&#x2014;the shape of the particle constituted by the phase changeable material. The electric field which propagates between the electrodes of the capacitor depends very much on the shape of the individual conducting particles dispersed in the dielectric medium. For example, relatively sharp corners of a conducting particle typically comprise a relatively high flux density. Every time the shape of the conducting particles changes, an additional uncertainty and/or randomness in the parasitic capacitance of the capacitor occurs which further enhances the randomness of the capacitance value of the physical unclonable function constituted by the capacitor. Alternatively, the dielectric medium which may comprise a polymer matrix which may be deformable and which may, for example, allow the conducting particles to change their shape or form between the first structural state and the second structural state.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment of the token, a protective layer covers the electrodes of the capacitor, the protective layer comprising the dielectric medium. Such a protective layer may, for example, comprise a deformable resist layer having conducting particles dispersed in the resist layer. These conducting particles comprise phase changeable material. The protective layer may be spin coated on the surface comprising the electrodes of the capacitor. In an embodiment of the token also a protective dielectric layer can be applied over the electrodes to avoid large electrical contact between the electrodes if, for example, the metallic/phase change loading is relatively large.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment of the token, at least a part of the conducting particles and/or at least a part of the dielectric medium further comprise absorption material configured for absorbing a predefined range of electromagnetic radiation for heating the conducting particles. The absorption material may enhance the heating of the conducting particles and/or of the dielectric medium to more easily heat the conducting particles comprising the phase changing material to a temperature above the threshold temperature causing the phase changeable material in the conducting particles to melt and subsequently, while cooling down, resulting in one of the first or second structural state. The absorption material may be present, for example, in all conducting particles to enhance the local heating of the conducting particles while ensuring that the dielectric medium is not heated too much. Alternatively, the absorption material may only be present in part of the conducting particles which may, for example, be mixed with conducting particles not having the absorption material. This mixture of the two different conducting particles further enhances the randomness in the physical unclonable function of the token. Even further alternatively, the absorption material may be present in the dielectric medium. Furthermore, by adapting and/or controlling the power and/or duration of the irradiation of the capacitor based physical unclonable function with the electromagnetic radiation, a further variation and uncertainty is added to the capacitance of the capacitor based physical unclonable function further improving the randomness of the physical unclonable function and consequently the security of the token.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment of the token, at least a part of the conducting particles and/or at least a part of the dielectric medium further comprise heat extraction material configured for enhancing the extraction of heat away from the conducting particles. The presence of heat extraction material may locally change the cooling rate of individual conducting particles in the dielectric medium which greatly alters the final state of the phase change material.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment of the token, the conducting particles comprise a size distribution for absorbing a predefined range of electromagnetic radiation for heating the conducting particles. A particle size distribution of the conducting particles comprising the phase change material causes a variation in the absorption of the electromagnetic radiation. For a broad particle size distribution the heating and cooling rates will be different under illumination, physical heating and high current conditions. Moreover small particles tend to coalesce when molten which will increase randomness.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment of the token, the token comprises altering means for altering the structural state of at least a part of the conducting particles in the dielectric medium for altering the capacitance value of the capacitor. These altering means may comprise, for example, a heating wire arranged near the dielectric medium for at least heating a part of the dielectric medium, and consequently a part of the conducting particles dispersed in the dielectric medium. These altering means may also comprise means for forcing a relatively high current through the capacitor which causes an electrical breakdown which may modify the structural state of the phase changeable material which changes the overall capacitance. This altering means may be seen as a safety regulation which may, for example, be used as a self-destruct element of the token. When the token is tampered with, for example, extensively probed to find regularities in the particle distribution in the token, the token may activate the altering means to alter the structural state of part of the phase changeable material in part of the conducting particles which results in a different capacitance value of the physical unclonable function. The token, when probed with a probing device to verify its authenticity, will sense a different capacitance and as such will no longer accept the token as authentic. When, for example, the physical unclonable function is part of a bank card, the hacker may try to tamper with the capacitance to unveil its secret and its code to abuse the bank card. The capacitance value together with a code, for example, a bank account number may be the unique combination which enables the owner to access his/her bank account. As soon as the token activate the altering means, the token changes its capacitance which results in a change in the unique combination between the capacitance value and the bank account number, and consequently destroys the authenticity of the token which makes the bank card unusable for the hacker. Consequently, abuse of the bank card is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment of the token, the altering means comprises local heating means for locally increasing the temperature of the at least a part of the conducting particles above a threshold temperature for altering the structural state of the at least a part of the conducting particles. These local heating means may, for example, be positioned above or below the capacitor. Alternatively, a conductive heating line may be arranged in between the combs of a capacitor or the conductive heating line may be constituted of multiple lines to create a random change in the local heating, for example, via randomly choosing a heating line from the multiple lines.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment of the token, the altering means comprises means for applying a relatively high current through the capacitor for at least partially causing an electrical breakdown for modifying at least a part of the structural state of the phase changeable material.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment of the token, the altering means comprises local cooling means for locally adapting a cooling rate of the conducting particles for altering the structural state of the at least part of the conducting particles. Local cooling means may be constituted by including a Peltier element. Alternatively local cooling means, for instance, metallic or dielectric particles may be added to the dielectric medium which may function as local cooling means which actively that conduct heat. The phase changeable material which is close to these particles will experience a larger, locally enhanced cooling rate than phase changeable material which is not close to these heat conducting.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a second aspect, the invention relates to an integrated circuit comprising the token according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a third aspect, the invention relates to a method of randomizing a token, the token comprising a physical unclonable function comprising a capacitor comprising a dielectric medium arranged at least partially between the electrodes of the capacitor and being configured for contributing to a capacitance value of the capacitor, the dielectric medium comprising conducting particles substantially randomly dispersed in the dielectric medium, the conducting particles comprising a phase changeable material being changeable between a first structural state having a first conductivity and a second structural state having a second conductivity different from the first conductivity, the method comprising a step of altering the structural state of at least a part of the conducting particles in the dielectric medium for altering the capacitance value of the capacitor. The phase changeable material is configured for altering the structural state of the phase changeable material while maintaining dispersed in the dielectric medium. The change of the phase of a conducting particle changes the conductivity of that specific conducting particle and may also change the dielectric permittivity. Furthermore, whether a particle changes from, for example, a crystalline phase into an amorphous phase depends on the immediate surroundings of the conducting particle which is substantially random.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment of the method, the step of altering the structural state of the at least a part of the conducting particles comprises the steps of
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0030">heating the at least part of the conducting particles above a threshold temperature, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0031">cooling down the at least part of the conducting particles to below a further threshold temperature to generate the first structural state and/or the second structural state.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">The heating may be done such that all conducting particles absorb sufficient heat to heat up to above the threshold temperature or that only a few, for example, the smallest conducting particles heat up to above the threshold temperature. After having been heated, the cooling down may be a forced cooling down to below the further threshold temperature or the cooling threshold temperature in which the heated conducting particles are predominantly changed to an amorphous state. The cooling threshold temperature may be similar than the threshold temperature, but typically is different than the threshold temperature for heating. The cooling threshold temperature is a temperature under which the state of the phase changeable material will not change anymore. Because the direct surroundings of an individual conducting particle determines the cooling speed and consequently the structural state of the individual conducting particle after cooling, it is almost impossible to ensure that all conducting particles in which the temperature exceeded the threshold temperature will end up in the amorphous state further adding to the randomness of the change of capacitance of the capacitor. The conducting particles or a specific part of the conducting particles may, for example, also comprise specific absorption material which may ensure that the conducting particles more easily absorb the heating which may, for example, be applied by providing electromagnetic radiation within a predefined range of electromagnetic radiation to the dielectric medium. Consequently, the heating of the conducting particles may be influenced and the mixture of strongly absorbing conducting particles mixed with less absorbing conducting particles may be used to further enhance the randomness of the token comprising the physical unclonable function. Alternatively the heating of the conducting particles may be influenced by using conducting particles having a specific range of particles size which each require a specific amount of heat before reaching the threshold temperature thus enhancing the randomness of the token. Finally, also the surrounding medium of the conducting particles may be used to influence the heating rate and cooling rate and as such enhance the randomness of the token.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">In an embodiment of the method, the step of heating the at least part of the conducting particles comprises applying a condensed beam of electromagnetic radiation to at least a part of the dielectric medium comprising the at least part of the conducting particles. A benefit of this embodiment is that sources for emitting the condensed beam of electromagnetic radiation are readily available and allow a relatively cost-effective way of heating the at least part of the dielectric medium. Furthermore, using, for example, lasers, enable the condensed beam of electromagnetic radiation to be applied locally as the focus of the condensed beam may be made relatively small. As only part of the dielectric medium is illuminated and as it may not be apparent which part is illuminated, the use of the condensed beam of electromagnetic radiation further enhances the randomness of the capacitance value in the capacitor based physical unclonable function.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">In an embodiment of the method, the step of heating the at least part of the conducting particles comprises applying a varying condensed beam of electromagnetic radiation to at least a part of the dielectric medium comprising the at least part of the conducting particles. Varying the applied power or varying the time during which the condensed beam of electromagnetic radiation is applied to the dielectric medium may alter the rate of change from the first structural state to the second structural state in the dielectric medium of the capacitor based physical unclonable function, again enhancing the randomness.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">In an embodiment of the method, the step of heating the at least part of the conducting particles comprises applying a plurality of condensed beams of electromagnetic radiation, each of the plurality of condensed beams illuminating a corresponding part of the dielectric medium comprising the at least part of the conducting particles, the plurality of condensed beams are applied to the dielectric medium in a randomized pattern of the plurality of condensed beams. Again both the plurality of condensed beams and the applying of the condensed beams in a randomized pattern enhance the randomness of the capacitance value of the capacitor based physical unclonable function. Furthermore, the plurality of condensed beams may, for example, comprise electromagnetic radiation having different wavelengths. For example, part of the conducting particles may comprise absorption material absorbing a first range of electromagnetic radiation and a further part of the conducting particles may comprise a further absorption material absorbing a second range of electromagnetic radiation, different from the first range of electromagnetic radiation. By applying a plurality of condensed beams in which one or some of the condensed beams emit electromagnetic radiation having a different wavelength a further enhancement of the randomness may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">In an embodiment of the method, the step of heating the at least part of the conducting particles comprises applying a heating current through a heating wire arranged near at least a part of the dielectric medium comprising the at least part of the conducting particles. This embodiment has as an advantage that the heating wire may be applied relatively easily. When using a plurality of heating wires, one or a selection of these heating wires of the plurality of heating wires may be chosen substantially randomly to enhance the randomness of the physical unclonable function.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">In an embodiment of the method, the step of heating the at least part of the conducting particles comprises applying a heating current through a mesh of heating wires. In such an embodiment, the selected heating wires in the mesh of heating wires used for applying the heating current may be selected substantially randomly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">In an embodiment of the method, the step of heating the at least part of the conducting particles comprises applying a relatively high current through the capacitor for at least partially causing an electrical breakdown for modifying at least a part of the structural state of the phase changeable material. The applying of the relatively high electrical current changes the state of the phase changeable material which is the basic principle of the phase change memory SET and RESET cycle used in re-writable CD or DVD. In the current embodiment of the method, the electrical current will flow substantially only at locations where the crystalline phase changeable material particles touch and where the remaining dielectric material in between the capacitor electrodes is so small that electrical breakdown occurs. The phase changeable material around the current path will get heated and a randomized change in capacitance will occur.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">In an embodiment of the method, the step of cooling down the at least part of the conducting particles comprises applying forced cooling means for increasing the cooling speed of the at least part of the dielectric medium comprising the at least part of the conducting particles. The forced cooling down may cause the heated conducting particles to be predominantly changed to, for example, the amorphous structural state. However, because the direct surroundings of an individual conducting particle determines the cooling speed and consequently the structural state of the individual conducting particle after cooling, it is almost impossible to ensure that all conducting particles in which the temperature exceeded the threshold temperature will end up in the amorphous state further adding to the randomness of the change of capacitance of the capacitor. Still, using this forced cooling down may shift the range of possible capacitance values within the total range of possible capacitance values allowing to use the full range of possible capacitance values of the capacitor based physical unclonable function. Distributing heat conducting particles in the dielectric medium may further enhance the forced cooling of the at least part of the conducting particles. Applying such heat conducting particles in a substantially random distribution further enhances the randomness of the token.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">In an embodiment of the method, the step of cooling down the at least part of the conducting particles comprises applying forced cooling means in a substantially randomized pattern for enhancing the cooling of the corresponding part of the dielectric medium comprising the at least part of the conducting particles. Local forced cooling means may, for example, comprise a Peltier element, for example, arranged in a pattern of Peltier elements which allow local applying of forced cooling of the conducting particles. Alternatively, the dielectric medium may be in thermal contact with conducting elements connected to a heat sink for extracting thermal energy from the corresponding parts of the dielectric medium which are in contact with the conducting elements. The conducting elements may be arranged in a specific distribution which may be substantially random, also enhancing the randomness via the cooling of the at least part of the conducting particles.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">In a fourth aspect, the invention relates to a system for randomizing a token, the token comprising a physical unclonable function comprising a capacitor comprising a dielectric medium arranged at least partially between the electrodes of the capacitor and being configured for contributing to a capacitance value of the capacitor, the dielectric medium comprising conducting particles substantially randomly dispersed in the dielectric medium, the conducting particles comprising phase changeable material being changeable between a first structural state having a first conductivity and a second structural state having a second conductivity different from the first conductivity, the system comprising randomizing means for altering the structural state of at least a part of the conducting particles in the dielectric medium for altering the capacitance value of the capacitor.</p>

The benefit when using a Peltier element is that the cooling may be easily electronically controlled and may even be controlled to vary substantially randomly.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">In an embodiment of the system, the randomizing means further comprises cooling means for cooling the heated part of the conducting particles to below the threshold temperature, the cooling means comprising a pattern of selectable Peltier elements for applying forced cooling.

Together with, for example, a distribution of heat conducting particles in the dielectric medium the forced cooling of the at least part of the conducting particles may be further enhanced. Applying such heat conducting particles in a substantially random distribution further enhances the randomness of the token.</p>

As the surroundings of the individual conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>; <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B, <b>40</b>C is almost impossible to actively influence, it becomes substantially unpredictable which of the phase changeable material in the conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>; <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B, <b>40</b>C will change from a crystalline state into an amorphous state and vice versa. As a result of the change of the structural state of the individual conducting particle <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>; <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B, <b>40</b>C, the conductivity of this individual particle changes which alters the overall capacitance of the physical unclonable function <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> a first embodiment of the physical unclonable function <b>10</b> is shown in which two conductors <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>C form the electrodes <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B of a capacitor <b>20</b>. The dielectric medium <b>30</b> surrounding the two electrodes <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B determines the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>20</b>. In the schematic arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, only part of the electrodes <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B is shown and the capacitor may be constituted by electrodes <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B having any possible shape, even having a specific three-dimensional shape. The dielectric medium <b>30</b> contributes to the capacitance value of the capacitor. The dielectric medium comprises conducting particles <b>40</b> comprising the phase changeable material. The phase changeable material comprises, for example, the first structural state which is a crystalline state of the phase changeable material, and the second structural state which is an amorphous state of the phase changeable material. Such phase changeable material may, for example, be chalcogenide material which is also commonly used in re-writable compact discs (CD) and re-writable digital video discs (DVD). Chalcogens are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table. The term chalcogenide is more commonly reserved for sulfides, selenides, and tellurides, for example, Ge2Sb2Te5 and many other GekInlSbmTen combinations, in which k, l, m and n may be in a range between 0 and 100. Phase changeable material may, for example, also and alternatively comprise Se. Also materials like AgInSbTe may be suitable as phase changeable material. Also other less common materials such as InSe, SbSe, SbTe, InSbSe, InSbTe, GeSbSe, GeSbTeSe, and AgInSbSeTe may be used. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> the dashed arrows indicate a possible path between the electrodes <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B of the capacitor <b>20</b>. By altering the conductive characteristics of the conducting particles <b>40</b>, the possible path between the electrodes <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B may be adapted which alters the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>20</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> in which a part of the phase changeable material in the conducting particles <b>40</b> comprises a first structural state <b>40</b>A and a part of the phase changeable material in the conducting particles comprise a second structural state <b>40</b>B. The first structural state <b>40</b>A is, for example, a crystalline state <b>40</b>A of the phase changeable material having a relatively high conductivity. The second structural state <b>40</b>B is, for example, an amorphous state <b>40</b>B of the phase changeable material having a relatively low conductivity. The rate of cooling of the individual conducting particles <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B determines in which structural state the individual conducting particles <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B are freezed-in after having been heated above the threshold temperature Tth. This rate of cooling is, for example, determined by the immediate surroundings of the individual conducting particles <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B which is substantially random. As such, the change of the structural state of the individual conducting particles <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B after having been heated above the threshold temperature Tth is also substantially random.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is an embodiment of the physical unclonable function <b>14</b> in which the dielectric medium <b>32</b> surrounding the conducting particles <b>40</b>B, <b>40</b>C is configured for allowing the phase changeable material to also change a shape of the phase changeable material when changing from the first structural state to the second structural state and/or vice versa. The dielectric medium <b>32</b> may, for example, comprise Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, ZrO2, HfO2 particles which will cause the dielectric medium <b>32</b> to expand and contract during heating and cooling cycle, depending on thermal expansion coefficient of the different materials present in the dielectric medium <b>32</b>. This heating and cooling cycle not only determines the final structural state of the conducting particles <b>40</b>B, <b>40</b>C, but also the specific shape of the phase changeable material and as such the specific shape of the conducting particle <b>40</b>C which is &#x201c;freezed-in&#x201d; when the dielectric medium <b>32</b> is cooled. During the heating and cooling some rearrangement of the particles <b>40</b>B, <b>40</b>C and/or coalescence could take place changing the overall dielectric properties. Also some of the present space/grain boundaries may allow reshaping and/or restructuring of the phase change material in the conducting particles <b>40</b>B, <b>40</b>C. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> the conducting particles <b>40</b>B indicated with reference number <b>40</b>B are indicated to have an amorphous structural state, which the conducting particles <b>40</b>C indicated with reference number <b>40</b>C are indicated to have a crystalline structural state. As indicated with the dashed arrows, the changing of the structure and/or shape of the conducting particles <b>40</b>C in the dielectric medium <b>32</b> changes the path between the two electrodes <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B which subsequently change the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>20</b>. For example, relatively sharp corners of a conducting particle <b>40</b>C typically comprise a relatively high flux density. Every time the shape of the conducting particles <b>40</b>B, <b>40</b>C changes, an additional uncertainty and/or randomness in the parasitic capacitance value of the capacitor <b>20</b> occurs which further enhances the randomness of the capacitance value of the physical unclonable function <b>14</b> constituted by the capacitor <b>20</b>., the</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">The dielectric medium may alternatively comprise a polymer matrix <b>32</b> which may be deformable and which may, for example, allow the conducting particles <b>40</b>B, <b>40</b>C to change their shape or form between the first structural state and the second structural state.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> is an embodiment of the physical unclonable function <b>16</b> in which the dielectric medium <b>30</b> comprises absorption material <b>50</b> (not shown) and/or in which at least a part of the conducting particles comprise absorption material <b>50</b>. The absorption material <b>50</b> may be mixed in the material constituting the conducting particles <b>42</b> and/or the absorption material <b>50</b> may be applied as a layer at the outer surface of the conducting particles <b>42</b>. The absorption material <b>50</b> is configured for absorbing a predefined range of electromagnetic radiation for heating the conducting particles <b>42</b>. The absorption material <b>50</b> may be used to locally enhance the heating of the conducting particles <b>42</b> and/or of the dielectric medium <b>30</b> to more easily heat the conducting particles <b>42</b> comprising the phase changing material to a temperature above the threshold temperature Tth causing the phase changeable material in the conducting particles <b>42</b> to melt and subsequently, while cooling down, resulting in one of the first or second structural state. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> comprises a first type of conducting particles <b>40</b> not comprising the absorption material <b>50</b> and comprises a second type of conducting particles <b>42</b> which do comprise the absorption material <b>50</b>. By mixing the first type of conducting particles <b>40</b> and second type of conducting particles <b>42</b> the mixture of the two different conducting particles further enhances the randomness in the physical unclonable function <b>16</b> of the token.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">Alternatively, the dielectric medium <b>30</b> may further comprise heat extraction material (not shown) configured for enhancing the extraction of heat away from the conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. The presence of heat extraction material may locally change the cooling rate of individual conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> in the dielectric medium <b>30</b> which greatly alters the final state of the phase change material.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> the conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> further comprise a size distribution. This size distribution of the conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> also results in a predefined absorption range of electromagnetic radiation for heating the conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. A particle size distribution of the conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> which comprise the phase change material causes a variation in the absorption of the electromagnetic radiation of the individual conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. For example, particles having, for example, a maximum dimension may not absorb sufficient heating energy to achieve the threshold temperature Tth when a predefined amount of heat is applied to the dielectric medium <b>30</b>. So for a specific particle size distribution the heating and cooling rates will be different depending on the particle sizes of the individual conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and the particle sizes of the surrounding conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. A further effect enhancing the randomness of the size distribution is that relatively small conducting particles <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> tend to coalesce when molten which will increase randomness.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a simplified representation of a token <b>100</b> according to the invention. The token <b>100</b> comprises the physical unclonable function <b>18</b> according to the invention comprising the capacitor <b>22</b> having two electrodes <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>C which both have a comb-like structure arranged opposite to each other. This comb-like structure enhances the interaction surface between the two electrodes <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>C which enhance the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>22</b>. Dielectric medium <b>30</b> may be applied over the two electrodes <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>C which are spaced apart. Part of the dielectric medium <b>30</b> will be positioned between the electrodes <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>C to determine the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>22</b>. The token <b>100</b> further comprises probing means <b>110</b> being contact pads which may be used by a sensing device to sense the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>22</b> constituting the physical unclonable function <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">In the embodiment of the token <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the token <b>100</b> comprises altering means <b>120</b> for altering the structural state of at least a part of the conducting particles <b>40</b> in the dielectric medium <b>40</b> for altering the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>22</b>. The altering means <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> comprises a heating wire <b>120</b> arranged near the dielectric medium <b>30</b> for at least heating a part of the dielectric medium <b>30</b>. Consequently a part of the conducting particles <b>40</b> dispersed in the dielectric medium <b>30</b> will be heated to, for example, above the threshold temperature Tth which enables the heated conducting particles <b>40</b> to alter its structural state, depending on the local cooling rate in the dielectric medium <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">Alternatively, a conductive heating line <b>120</b> may be arranged in between the combs <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>C of the capacitor <b>22</b> or the conductive heating line may be constituted of multiple lines (not shown) to create a random change in the local heating, for example, via randomly choosing a heating line from the multiple lines. Further alternatively, the altering means <b>120</b> may comprise means for forcing a relatively high current through the capacitor <b>22</b> (not shown) which may cause a partial electrical breakdown which may modify the structural state of the phase changeable material which changes the overall capacitance value of the capacitor <b>22</b>. Even further alternatively, the altering means <b>120</b> may comprise local cooling means for locally adapting a cooling rate of the conducting particles for altering the structural state of the at least part of the conducting particles.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">The altering means <b>120</b> may be used as a safety regulation which may, for example, be used as a self-destruct element of the token <b>100</b>. When the token <b>100</b> is tampered with, for example, extensively probed to find regularities in the particle distribution in the token <b>100</b>, the token <b>100</b> may activate the altering means <b>120</b> to alter the structural state of part of the phase changeable material in part of the conducting particles <b>40</b> which results in a different capacitance value of the physical unclonable function <b>18</b>. The token <b>100</b>, when probed with a probing device to verify its authenticity, will sense a different capacitance and as such will no longer accept the token <b>100</b> as authentic. When, for example, the physical unclonable function <b>100</b> is part of a bank card <b>300</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), a hacker may try to tamper with the capacitance <b>22</b> to unveil its secret and its code to abuse the bank card <b>300</b>. The capacitance value together with a code, for example, a bank account number may be the unique combination which enables the owner to access his/her bank account. As soon as the token <b>100</b> activates the altering means <b>120</b>, the token <b>100</b> changes its capacitance value of the physical unclonable function <b>18</b> which results in a change in the unique combination between the capacitance value and the bank account number, and consequently destroys the authenticity of the token <b>100</b> which makes the bank card <b>300</b> unusable for the hacker. Consequently, abuse of the bank card <b>300</b> may be prevented.</p>
