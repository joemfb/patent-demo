<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The exemplary embodiments of this invention relate generally to semiconductor devices and, more specifically, relate to porous dielectric materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section endeavors to supply a context or background for the various exemplary embodiments of the invention as recited in the claims. The content herein may comprise subject matter that could be utilized, but not necessarily matter that has been previously utilized, described or considered. Unless indicated otherwise, the content described herein is not considered prior art, and should not be considered as admitted prior art by inclusion in this section.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is widely known that the speed of propagation of interconnect signals is one of the most important factors controlling overall circuit speed as feature sizes are reduced and the number of devices per unit area increases. Throughout the semiconductor industry, there is a strong drive to reduce the dielectric constant (k) of the interlayer dielectric (ILD) materials such as those existing between metal lines, for example. As a result of such reduction, interconnect signals travel faster through conductors due to a concomitant reduction in resistance-capacitance (RC) delays.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Porous ultra low-k (ULK) dielectrics have enabled capacitance reduction in advanced silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) back end of line (BEOL) structures. However, the high level of porosity required (e.g., to achieve k values of 2.4 and lower) create issue in terms of dielectric material damage or loss due to plasma exposures (e.g., reactive ion etch (RIE), strip, dielectric barrier etch) and wet cleans (e.g., post RIE dilute hydrofluoric (DHF) cleans). Additionally, penetration of metals used in the liner layer (e.g., Ta, TaN) or the seed layer (e.g., Cu, Ru) into the pores of the dielectric can occur when porosity is high and the material is characterized by a high degree of pore connectivity. This leads to degradation of the dielectric break down strength and degradation of the leakage characteristics of the dielectric. All of these issues collectively cause reliability degradation in BEOL structures made using highly porous ULK dielectrics.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various prior art techniques combat the above-identified issues in different manners. In one example, there are techniques to partially repair dielectric damage from plasma exposures. See, e.g., Y. S. Mor, T. C. Chang, P. T. Liu, T. M. Tsai, C. W. Chen, S. T. Yan, C. J. Chu, W. F. Wu, F. M. Pan, W. Lur, and S. M. Sze, &#x201c;Effective repair to ultra-low-k dielectric material (k.apprx.2.0) by hexamethyldisilazane treatment,&#x201d; <i>J. Vac. Sci. Technol., B</i>, vol. 20, pp. 1334-1338, 2002. In another example, there have been attempts to seal surface-connected pores to prevent metal penetration. See, e.g., R. J. O. M. Hoofman, V. H. Nguyen, V. Arnal, M. Broekaart, L. G. Gosset, W. F. A. Besling, M. Fayolle, and F. Iacopi, &#x201c;Integration of low-k dielectric films in damascene processes,&#x201d; in <i>Dielectr. Films Adv. Microelectron</i>., M. Baklanov, K. Maex, and M. Green, Eds. New-York: Wiley, 2007, pp. 199-250. However, these techniques require deposition of additional layers which can increase the effective dielectric constant of the integrated BEOL structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Although the design of a low-k dielectric material with desirable properties for implementation is demanding enough, the complexity of modem semiconductor manufacturing processes adds further complications. Some of these are a direct result from trying to utilize SiO<sub>2</sub>-based processes with porous, low-k dielectric materials that are considerably less forgiving. In this regard, adding porosity may not result in redeeming values (e.g., improved characteristics) other than lowering the dielectric constant. Critical damage to the low dielectric porous material can occur at different stages of the integration process, including: hard-mask deposition, reactive ion etch, photo-resist strip, liner deposition, chemical mechanical polishing, and cap deposition, as non-limiting examples.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Potential solutions present themselves in the form of pore sealing approaches. To date, two pore sealing techniques have been explored. The first interposes an additional layer between the ILD and the barrier layer. The deposition can be accomplished by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or spin-on techniques, as non-limiting examples, and the material can be organic or inorganic in nature. The inherent k-value of this material will have a direct effect on the overall dielectric constant and for this reason materials with relatively low dielectric constants are preferred. Many different materials have been reported, ranging from SiO<sub>2 </sub>to organic polymers. The drawback of this approach lies in the introduction of new interfaces which may impact adhesion. In addition, the additional layer at the via bottom could adversely affect the cap-open step and result in damage to the line bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Alternatively, pore sealing can be effected by plasma exposure so as to selectively damage and densify the outer few nanometers of the via/line sidewalls. By fine-tuning and careful selection of plasma chemistries, it is possible to control densification and plasma damage. Unfortunately, this approach works best for microporous materials, while mesoporous materials are easily damaged deep into the ILD (due to interconnectivity) with limited pore sealing success.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another approach addresses the pore sealing problem from a different perspective. These are so-called &#x201c;solids first&#x201d; or &#x201c;porosity last&#x201d; alternative integration schemes typically using templating porogens (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,451,712). These integration schemes can be further subdivided into post-etch burnout (PEBO) or post-chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) burnout (PCBO) of the porogen. PEBO requires sidewall densification, possibly through porogen decomposition during etch, to subsequently facilitate uniform deposition of liner and metal. PCBO can only be implemented with a top hardmask that is permeable to the porogen decomposition products or by polishing off the top hardmask fully in the CMP step. However, due to temperature limitations dictated by the porogen, process temperatures during damascene processing are limited to below the decomposition temperature of the porogen. In addition, ILD shrinkage during the final porogen burnout is preferably less than 1% in order to maintain integrity of the interconnect structures. Such a target value may be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, pore sealing is a difficult process and becomes more difficult as pore diameter increases into the supermicroporous and mesoporous range (&#x3e;1.5-2 nm), as is typically the case to achieve a dielectric constant k&#x2266;2.4. In this size regime, to date PEBO and PCBO schemes appear to be the only hope. However, the requirements associated with these strategies (e.g., shrinkage, special permeable caps) make these approaches challenging to implement with current integration processes. Plasma sealing currently appears to be the preferred route. This technique requires that the pore size remain in the microporous regime with a pore size below 1.5 nm, even at high porosities, which is difficult to achieve.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One prior art technique, as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,324, introduces a secondary component into the void fraction of a porous medium (low dielectric constant film) in order to temporarily improve the mechanical properties such that the porous film has mechanical characteristics of a much stiffer film. Once a process operation such as a chemical mechanical polishing process, which requires greater mechanical strength than that provided by the porous film alone, is completed, the secondary component is removed by displacement or dissolution.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another prior art technique, as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 7,303,989, impregnates the pores of a zeolite low-k dielectric layer with a polymer and forms an interconnect structure therein. This mechanically strengthens the dielectric layer and prevents metal deposits within the pores.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Below, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-13</figref>, is described one, non-limiting exemplary embodiment illustrating how filling the pores of a porous dielectric film (e.g., a low-k or ULK dielectric film) may be beneficial for processing carried out on the wafer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a flowchart illustrating one non-limiting example of such a method and is further referred to below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-13</figref>. It is noted that the described exemplary method is for forming a single-damascene interconnect structure. In other exemplary embodiments, a different structure may be formed and/or utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (step <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a semiconductor wafer <b>200</b> that has a previous interconnect layer <b>212</b> deposited on top is first coated with an ILD layer <b>210</b> of a porous material containing empty pores (e.g., an organosilicate), for example, deposited by the best known techniques. As an example, the ILD layer <b>210</b> may be suitably formed of single or dual damascene wiring with a high electrical conductivity material (e.g., copper, aluminum, alloys thereof) embedded in a suitable ILD (porous or nonporous) and optionally capped with a diffusion barrier dielectric (e.g., SiN, NBLOK). Detailed make up of layer <b>212</b> is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-12</figref> for purposes of clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (step <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the pores of the porous dielectric are homogeneously refilled with a filling material (e.g., an organic polymer <b>214</b>). There is an excess layer of the organic polymer <b>214</b> that forms at the surface of the filled ILD film <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (step <b>103</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the excess of organic polymer <b>214</b> that was deposited on top of the filled ILD film <b>230</b> is then removed by a suitable method, such as plasma etch, RIE strip, wet dissolution or gentle polishing. Care should be exercised not to remove the polymer from the filled pores in the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> (step <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a hardmask layer <b>216</b> is deposited on top of the filled ILD layer <b>230</b>, for example, using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) or spin-on techniques. The hardmask <b>216</b> can be formed of a suitable material including, as non-limiting examples, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiN, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, SiC, SiCOH or another suitable hardmask material as known in the art. The hardmask layer <b>216</b> may further be formed by more than one layer of material, though the total thickness preferably should be less than 250 nm and, more preferably, less than 100 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (step <b>105</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a photoresist layer <b>218</b> is applied to the top of the hardmask layer <b>216</b>, exposed to generate a desired pattern, developed and then baked (e.g., at a temperature on the order of 200&#xb0; C. or less).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (step <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the hardmask layer <b>216</b> and the filled ILD layer <b>230</b> are etched (e.g., in a plasma etching process) to remove them in those regions defined by openings in the photoresist pattern <b>218</b> on top of the hardmask layer <b>216</b>, creating the opening <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (step <b>107</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), any remnants of the resist layer <b>214</b> are removed by a strip process. It should be noted that this is the step where the porosity of the organosilicate is exposed to the strip process chemistry used to remove the photo-resist and damage would otherwise occur to the pores of the filled ILD layer <b>230</b> if they were not filled with the polymer. Without first filling the pores, after such an exposure the dielectric constant and the leakage current of the ILD increase significantly. In contrast, as the ILD is in a nonporous hybrid state enriched in carbon due to the refill material now present in the original pores, little or no damage occurs to the filled ILD layer <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> (step <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a liner material is deposited to form a liner layer <b>222</b> on top of the hardmask layer <b>216</b>. The liner layer <b>222</b> may be comprised of a material such as TaN, TiN, Ti, Ta, or various combinations thereof, as non-limiting examples, for achieving adhesion and diffusion barrier properties.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At this stage, in some exemplary embodiments a seed layer (e.g., copper) is deposited on top of the liner layer <b>222</b> (not shown). The seed layer may be deposited by sputtering, for example, and may be used to facilitate subsequent electroplating.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> (step <b>109</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the etched opening <b>220</b> is filled with a metal <b>224</b>, such as copper, for example. The metal may be formed by electroplating, for example, and overfills the opening <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> (step <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), after the etched opening <b>220</b> is filled with the metal <b>224</b>, the electronic structure <b>200</b> is planarized (e.g., by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process) to achieve a planar surface with a metal inlaid structure. In this CMP step, polishing is performed until all of the excess metal, liner and hardmask on top of the filled ILD layer <b>230</b> are removed, thus exposing at least a top surface of the filled ILD layer <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> (step <b>111</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the filling material (e.g., the organic polymer) is removed from the pores, for example, by decomposing it using a thermal curing or a thermal curing assisted by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, as non-limiting examples.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (step <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a cap layer <b>226</b> of an insulating material (e.g., silicon carbide, silicon nitride, silicon carbonitride, combinations thereof) is deposited on top in order to prevent diffusion of the metal and to protect the electronic device <b>200</b> (e.g., from mechanical abrasion or other damage).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, by filling the pores of the porous ILD (e.g., with a polymer, an organosilicate) damage to the ILD (e.g., to the pores of the ILD) can be avoided during processing of the structure. Also as noted above, much of the potential for damage stems from the strip process chemistry used to remove the photo-resist. Without filling the pores, the dielectric constant and the leakage current of the ILD may be adversely affected (e.g., significantly increased).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Filling of the pores is not a simple task. First, the temperature must be controlled. That is, in order to achieve any amount of pore-filling the temperature must be raised to enable the material (e.g., a polymer) to penetrate into the porous material. By the same turn, the temperature must remain below the decomposition temperature of the filling material. Second, achieving homogeneous filling of the porous material is even more difficult. Unless the proper conditions are utilized, the pore-filling will not be homogeneous.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Inhomongeneous filling of the porous material is very undesirable because it yields a material having regions with different properties throughout its thickness. These variations would cause severe issues, such as: differences in etch rate leading to uncontrolled etch depth and profile, and differences in resistance to plasma exposure affecting the electrical integrity of the film. Such variations are likely to have adverse effects on the properties and/or operation of the final structure.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is noted that the references herein to &#x201c;homogeneous&#x201d; filling of the pores with a material refer to a substantially thorough, complete and uniform filling of the pores. That is, homogeneous filling will result in the filled porous material being substantially uniform in composition and, thus, properties. Accordingly, &#x201c;inhomogeneous&#x201d; filling results in the filled porous material being non-uniform in composition and properties.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with the above, exemplary embodiments of the invention enable homogeneous filling of the porous material to provide an improved structure. As an example, homogeneous filling may be realized by utilizing appropriate conditions and/or characteristics, such as a temperature in the appropriate range based at least on the filling material (e.g., polymer) and the pore size, for example. Generally, with the same filling material a smaller pore size will need a higher temperature (i.e., greater energy to push the filling material into the smaller pores). It should further be noted that the conditions for homogeneous filling are dependent on the type or composition of the porous material.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Various examples are described immediately below. These examples are further illustrative of suitable conditions that enable homogeneous pore-filling and, for example, show that a narrow range of temperatures enable homogeneous pore-filling at least for pore sizes from about 1.5-8 nm <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> show x-ray reflectivity scans of intensity (counts) as a function of incident angle (&#x3c9;, degrees). It should be noted that the symbols (triangle, square) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> are not data points in and of themselves and are merely indicia provided to distinguish among the lines of the graphs.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The following examples use a solution of 5 wt. % poly(methyl methacrylate) (weight average molecular weight (Mw)=4700 g/mol) in PGMEA (referred to as &#x201c;Poly-1&#x201d;) and a solution of 15 wt. % poly(ethylene glycol) (Mw=18500 g/mol) in water (referred to as &#x201c;Poly-2&#x201d;). Material details for the low-k materials, POCS-1 and POCS-2, are provided in Table 1 below. POCS-1 and POCS-2 are names used here to identify two porous films having different properties. To prepare these reference porous films, a microelectronic grade formulation composed of a thermally stable organosilicate oxycarbosilane polymer (OCS) and a thermally decomposable organic polymer was used. The ratio of the organic to the organosilicate oxycarbosilane was such that films where the organic polymer has been decomposed reproducibly have a porosity of 36% and 45.5%, respectively, as measured by both nitrogen adsorption (BJH-KJS method) and ellipsometric porosimetry using toluene as the adsorbent (Kelvin model). The density and thickness were obtained using X-ray reflectivity and the refractive index using spectro-reflectometry. POCS-1 and POCS-2 were synthesized by spin-coating the above formulation on an 8-inch silicon wafer, applying first a post-applied bake on a hot plate at 85&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes and then curing the film in a Yield Engineering Systems Inc. (YES&#xae;) polyimide bake oven at 250&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes using a 5&#xb0; C./min ramp. The film was then cured at 400&#xb0; C. for 7 minutes under UV irradiation. This last step leads to the densification of the organosilicate network and the complete removal of the porogen. These two materials were selected to demonstrate that refilling is possible for materials having a pore size between about 1.5 and at least 8 nm.</p>

In some exemplary embodiments, maximum homogeneous filling may be obtained by heating the structure for about or less than 1 minute.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Another exemplary embodiment of the invention provides an electronic structure that has a layer of damage-free porous dielectric material formed therein for electrical insulation which includes a pre-processed electronic substrate, a layer of porous dielectric material that has a porosity between about 25 vol. % and about 80 vol. % formed and patterned on the pre-processed electronic substrate, and a conductive metal filling the pattern formed in the layer of porous dielectric material.

The conductive metal filling the pattern may comprise copper, aluminum, silver or gold forming a single damascene (e.g., comprising wiring lines only) or a dual damascene (e.g., comprising wiring lines and contact vias) interconnect structure.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Another exemplary embodiment of the invention provides a process which eliminates the problem of damage to the porous structure during the dielectric material patterning, etching, metal filling and/or CMP process steps. One exemplary method patterns a material where the pores have been refilled with an organic material leading to a non-porous structure during these processes such that the problem of damage to the porous structure and penetration of metallic or other processing chemical species into pores can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention, structures can be built with porous low k materials such as silicate materials (e.g., silica, hydrogensilsesquioxane, methylsilsesquioxane, oxycarbosilane and copolymers thereof), as a non-limiting example. In some exemplary embodiments, the porosity is interconnected to ensure a good refilling of the pores with the polymeric material. This is generally the case for porosity &#x3e;25%. The problems encountered in the conventional prior art damascene method are solved by taking advantage of the nonporous nature of the pores refilled dielectric material during processing steps, thus preventing any damage to the porous structure during integration.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In many cases, current low dielectric constant materials considered for k&#x2266;2.4 are first deposited with a chemical composition containing a silicate or an organosilicate and various amounts of a second phase polymeric material, which is a pore-forming agent, referred to as &#x201c;porogen&#x201d; in the art. These composite materials are then made into a porous film with a dielectric constant in a range between about 1.4 and about 2.4 after removing the porogen phase. The word &#x201c;about&#x201d; used in this writing indicates a range of values. For example, such an exemplary range may be of +/&#x2212;10% from the average value given. The second phase polymeric material, or the pore forming agent, is a material that is usually a long chained organic polymer which can be decomposed and volatilized and driven from the matrix material, i.e. the organosilicate, after the film has been cured in a curing process, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Another exemplary embodiment of the invention provides a method that can be carried out by first spin-coating a film onto the surface of a silicon wafer and then furnace curing the film at about 400&#xb0; C. Instead of a simple thermal cure; the film can also be directly treated in a UV chamber at 350 to 400&#xb0; C. for 1 to 15 minutes to effect a shorter UV radiation assisted thermal process. The film formed may comprise a cross-linked organosilicate where the porogen has been fully removed. The film is usually deposited to a thickness, for example, between about 50 nm and about 1000 nm, or preferably between about 150 nm and about 400 nm, as non-limiting examples. This film has reached its maximum shrinkage if no further treatment at temperatures higher than the cure temperature is performed. A polymer then may be spin-coated onto the porous film and the film is cured on a hot plate at temperatures, for example, between 100&#xb0; C. and 250&#xb0; C., preferably 200 to 250&#xb0; C., as non-limiting examples. The polymer is designed such that it infiltrates into the pores of the cured porous dielectric film below forming an organic/organosilicate hybrid dielectric film. The excess of polymer on top the hybrid dielectric film is then removed by using typical photoresist strip conditions such as plasma ashing, for example. A hardmask material is then deposited on top of the hybrid film. The hardmask material may comprise at least one of SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, SiC and SiCOH. The hardmask layer deposition should be conducted at a temperature below the decomposition temperature of the organic polymer filling the pores, preferably at 300&#xb0; C. or below, as a non-limiting example. The hardmask may be comprised of more than one layer of material, however, the total thickness is usually less than 250 nm, for example, and more preferably less than 100 nm, as a non-limiting example. The hardmask layer can be deposited by PECVD or spin on methods, as non-limiting examples. In the case of the PECVD hardmask, the deposition temperature should be lower than the organic polymer decomposition temperature. In the case of a spin-on hardmask, the solvent used to spin-coat the hardmask layer should be carefully chosen so as not to remove the organic polymer from the pores of the organosilicate during spin-coating. The curing temperature of the spin-on hardmask should also be lower than the decomposition temperature of the organic polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this exemplary embodiment, a photoresist layer is then applied on top of the hardmask layer and exposed and baked (e.g., at a temperature of about 200&#xb0; C. or less). Next, the hardmask layer is etched in a plasma reactive ion etching process to remove the hardmask and the organosilicate material in the regions defined by the photoresist pattern. This may be followed by one or more of the usual integration steps of photo-resist strip, liner deposition, seed copper deposition and plated copper deposition. The excess of copper, as well as the hardmask layers, is then polished using CMP leaving the interconnect pattern inlaid in the hybrid dielectric layer. Since the hybrid dielectric film is a nonporous film made of an organosilicate film with an organic polymer that blocks all the pores, there is no damage to the organosilicate matrix during all of the different integration steps described above. Finally, the full structure is heated to a temperature higher than the decomposition temperature of the organic polymer (e.g., 400&#xb0; C. to 425&#xb0; C.) for a time period long enough to drive out the second phase polymeric material from the organosilicate matrix resulting in a porous low-k dielectric film in the finished interconnect structure. As non-limiting examples, the void content in the final porous dielectric film may be between about 25 vol. % and about 80 vol. %, or preferably between about 25 vol. % and about 60 vol. %, commensurate with the starting porous organosilicate film before refilling. The final curing temperature can also be lower than 400&#xb0; C. if the thermal removal treatment is assisted by UV irradiation, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The weight average molecular weight of the organic polymeric materials used to refill the pores should be below 10,000 g/mol, preferably below 5,000 g/mol to enable full penetration into the porous structure. Examples of suitable decomposable polymers have been described above.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In further exemplary embodiments, the polymer is generated in situ inside the pores, for example, by using ring opening polymerization starting from monomers such as lactones, butyrolactones, valerolactones, caprolactones and lactides, as non-limiting examples. In other exemplary embodiments, radical initiated polymerization is used starting from monomers such as acrylates, methacrylates and styrenes, as non-limiting examples. This exemplary method enables the use of very low molecular weight precursors to be infiltrated into the pores in a facile manner and converted to a polymer inside the pores by an in situ polymerization process.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Another exemplary embodiment of the invention includes a method for forming a porous dielectric material layer that is used to form a dual damascene interconnect in a semiconductor structure and is performed by refilling of the pores after thermal curing of the dual damascene organosilicate ILD before hardmask deposition and decomposition of the organic polymer after direct CMP, similar to the above description for a single damascene structure.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is noted that the temperature for the refill may depend, at least in part, on the nature (composition) of the porous material. For example, if the surface of the porous material has a good affinity for the filling material (e.g., a polymer), the penetration temperature will be lower since less energy is needed to drive the filling material into the pores.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some exemplary embodiments, the filling material may comprise a low molecular weight material. As an example, a low molecular weight may be considered to correspond to a molecular weight of the material (e.g., a polymer) between about 100 g/mol and about 5,000 g/mol. Polymers may be synthesized in a wide range of molecular weights and, thus, any suitable polymer may be utilized in conjunction with the exemplary embodiments of the invention. For example, polystyrene may be synthesized with a molecular weight ranging from 100 to 20,000,000 g/mol or more.</p>
