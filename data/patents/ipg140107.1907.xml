<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provision Application Ser. No. 61/359,554 filed Jun. 29, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Historically, after complete removal of a disc from between adjacent vertebrae, the adjacent vertebrae were fused together. This &#x201c;spinal fusion&#x201d; procedure, which is still in use today, is a widely accepted surgical treatment for symptomatic lumbar and cervical degenerative disc disease. More recently, disc arthoplasty may be utilized to insert an artificial intervertebral disc implant into the intervertebral space between adjacent vertebrae. Such a disc implant allows limited universal movement of the adjacent vertebrae with respect to each other. The aim of total disc replacement is to remove pain generation (caused by a degenerated disc), restore anatomy (disc height), and maintain mobility in the functional spinal unit so that the spine remains in an adapted sagittal balance. Sagittal balance is defined as the equilibrium of the trunk with the legs and pelvis to maintain harmonious sagittal curves and thus the damping effect of the spine. In contrast with fusion techniques, total disc replacement preserves mobility in the motion segment and attempts to mimic physiologic conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A distractible intervertebral implant configured to be inserted in an insertion direction into an intervertebral space that is defined between a first vertebral body and a second vertebral body is disclosed. The implant may include a first implant body and a second implant body. The first implant body may define an outer surface that is configured to face the first vertebral body, and an opposing inner surface that defines a rail. The second implant body may define an outer surface that is configured to face the second vertebral body, and an inner surface that defines a recess configured to receive the rail of the first implant body. The second implant body is configured to move along the vertical direction as the second implant body is translated over the first implant body and the rail is received by the recess, so as to distract the first and second vertebral bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another embodiment, the implant may include a first implant body and a second implant body. The first implant body may include a pair of first side regions, and may define an outer surface that is configured to face the first vertebral body. The second implant body may also include a pair of second side regions. Each second side region may have an anterior end that angles toward the first implant body as the anterior end extends in a direction opposite the insertion direction. The second implant body may define an outer surface that is configured to face the second vertebral body. The anterior ends of the second implant body are configured to contact the first side regions of the first implant body as the second implant body is translated over the first implant body to thereby cause the outer surface of the second implant body to move away from the outer surface of the first implant body.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment, a method for inserting an intervertebral implant into an intervertebral disc space defined between first and second vertebral bodies is disclosed. The method may include the step of inserting a first implant body into the intervertebral space such that as the first implant body is being inserted at least one of the first and second vertebral bodies moves away from the other vertebral body. The first implant body may include an outer surface that faces the first vertebral body, and an inner surface. The method may further include inserting a second implant body into the intervertebral space by sliding the second implant body over the inner surface of the first implant body. The second implant body may cause at least one of the first and second vertebral bodies to move away from the other as the second implant body is being inserted. The second implant body may include an outer surface that faces the second vertebral body.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, an intervertebral space <b>11</b> is defined between a superior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>a </i>and an inferior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The superior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>a </i>generally defines an inferior endplate <b>13</b><i>a </i>or superior surface of the intervertebral space <b>11</b>, and the adjacent inferior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>b </i>defines a superior endplate <b>13</b><i>b </i>or inferior surface of the intervertebral space <b>11</b>. Thus, the intervertebral space <b>11</b> is disposed between the vertebral bodies <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The vertebral bodies <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>can be anatomically adjacent vertebral bodies, or can remain after a discectomy has been performed that removed a vertebral body from a location between the vertebral bodies. As illustrated, the intervertebral space <b>11</b> is illustrated after a discectomy, whereby the disc material has been removed or at least partially removed to prepare the intervertebral space <b>11</b> to receive a disc implant that can achieve height restoration. The intervertebral space <b>11</b> can be disposed anywhere along the spine as desired. Moreover, the superior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be considered a first or a second vertebral body and the inferior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be considered a first or a second vertebral body.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Certain terminology is used in the following description for convenience only and is not limiting. The words &#x201c;right&#x201d;, &#x201c;left&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper&#x201d; designate directions in the drawings to which reference is made. The words &#x201c;inner&#x201d; or &#x201c;distal&#x201d; and &#x201c;outer&#x201d; or &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; refer to directions toward and away from, respectively, the geometric center of the implant and related parts thereof The words, &#x201c;anterior&#x201d;, &#x201c;posterior&#x201d;, &#x201c;superior,&#x201d; &#x201c;inferior,&#x201d; &#x201c;medial,&#x201d; &#x201c;lateral,&#x201d; and related words and/or phrases are used to designate various positions and orientations in the human body to which reference is made and are not meant to be limiting. The terminology includes the above-listed words, derivatives thereof and words of similar import.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, an intervertebral implant, such as a distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b>, can be inserted into the intervertebral space <b>11</b> along a longitudinal insertion direction I, which can be a posterior direction in accordance with the illustrated embodiment or any other direction as desired. The distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> is described herein as extending horizontally along a longitudinal direction &#x201c;L&#x201d; and lateral direction &#x201c;A&#x201d;, and vertically along a transverse direction &#x201c;T&#x201d;. Unless otherwise specified herein, the terms &#x201c;lateral,&#x201d; &#x201c;longitudinal,&#x201d; and &#x201c;transverse&#x201d; are used to describe the orthogonal directional components of various components. It should be appreciated that while the longitudinal and lateral directions are illustrated as extending along a horizontal plane, and that the transverse direction is illustrated as extending along a vertical plane, the planes that encompass the various directions may differ during use. For instance, when the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> is implanted into the intervertebral space <b>11</b> the transverse direction T extends generally along the superior-inferior (or caudal-cranial) direction, while the plane defined by the longitudinal direction L and lateral direction A lie generally in the anatomical plane defined by the anterior-posterior direction, and the medial-lateral direction. Accordingly, the directional terms &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; and &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; are used to describe the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> and its components as illustrated merely for the purposes of clarity and illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> includes a first or inferior implant body <b>18</b> and a second or superior implant body <b>14</b> that is coupled to the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. The distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> can further include at least one first fixation member <b>22</b>, illustrated as a first screw that couples the inferior implant body <b>18</b> to the inferior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and at least one second fixation member, such as second and third fixation members <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> illustrated as screws, that couple the superior implant body <b>14</b> to the superior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>a</i>. It should be understood that the fixation members <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>30</b> may be also be configured as nails, blades, or graft. The distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> defines an anterior end <b>42</b> and an opposed posterior end <b>46</b>. The anterior end <b>42</b> defines a trailing end of the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> along the direction of insertion I, and the posterior end <b>46</b> defines a leading end of the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> along the direction of insertion I.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> may be partially or entirely formed from a metal, polymer, ceramic, allograft, or other artificial biomaterials such as beta-tricalcium phosphate. Suitable biocompatible materials or combinations of materials, may include PEEK, porous PEEK, carbon fiber-reinforced PEEK, titanium and titanium alloys, stainless steel, ceramic, polylactic acid, tantalum, magnesium, allograft, or other artificial biomaterials. The distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> presents an outer surface <b>19</b> that can be coated with any suitable material, such as hydroxyl apatite, beta-tricalcium phosphate, anodic plasma chemical treated titanium, or other similar coatings that improve osseointegration of the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b>. As shown, the assembled implant <b>10</b> may be generally rectangular in shape, though it should be understood that all geometries are imaginable.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> the inferior implant body <b>18</b> includes a body portion <b>34</b> that defines a lower or inferior, or outer, engagement surface <b>38</b> configured to contact or otherwise face the superior endplate <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the inferior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>b</i>, an opposing inner surface <b>40</b>, an anterior end <b>42</b>, and an opposing posterior end <b>46</b>. The body portion <b>34</b> further includes a plurality of engagement features <b>50</b>, illustrated as teeth, that extend transversely out from engagement surface <b>38</b> and can be angled toward the anterior end <b>42</b> of the body portion <b>34</b>. The engagement features <b>50</b> allow the inferior implant body <b>18</b> to easily translate along a posterior direction over the superior endplate of the inferior vertebral body during insertion of the inferior implant body <b>18</b> while at the same time provides immediate primary stability allowing the inferior implant body <b>18</b> to resist anterior migration. In other words, the engagement features <b>50</b> allow the inferior implant body <b>18</b> to easily slide in one direction, but if it were to slide in a second opposite direction, the teeth <b>50</b> would catch on the superior endplate <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the inferior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>b </i>to thereby prevent migration of the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. It should be understood that the engagement features <b>50</b> can be shaped in any manner as desired, such as teeth, spikes, pyramids, cones, undefined geometries, rough surface topography, or independent bodies such a metal spikes that are embedded into the body portion <b>34</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref>, the body portion <b>34</b>, such as the inner surface <b>40</b>, includes a middle region <b>54</b> and a first side region <b>58</b> extending from opposite sides of the middle region <b>54</b>. The middle region <b>54</b> protrudes higher in the transverse vertical direction (or outwardly toward the superior implant body <b>14</b>) with respect to the first side regions <b>58</b>, and thus provides a longitudinally elongate rail that the superior implant body <b>14</b> can translate longitudinally along. In this way, the inner surface <b>40</b> of the body portion <b>34</b> defines the rail. In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, the anterior end <b>62</b> of the middle region <b>54</b> is angled upwards toward the superior implant body <b>14</b> as it extends toward the posterior end <b>46</b> of the body portion <b>34</b>, and the posterior end <b>66</b> of the middle region <b>54</b> is angled upwards toward the superior implant body <b>14</b> as it extends toward the anterior end <b>42</b> of the body portion <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the body portion <b>34</b> defines a bore <b>72</b> that extends through the anterior end <b>62</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the bore <b>72</b> is configured to receive the first fixation member <b>22</b>. The first fixation member <b>22</b> can include a shaft <b>23</b> and a head <b>25</b> that is dimensioned larger than the shaft <b>23</b>. The bore <b>72</b> can likewise include a shaft-receiving region sized to receive the shaft <b>23</b>, and a head receiving region sized to receive the head <b>25</b> when the fixation member <b>22</b> is fully received by the bore <b>72</b>. The bore <b>72</b> can further be tapered and elongate along an angle toward the posterior end <b>46</b> of the body portion <b>34</b>, such that the fixation member <b>22</b> is also elongate along the angle toward the posterior end <b>46</b> of the body portion <b>34</b> when received in the bore <b>72</b>. The bore <b>72</b> can include a locking mechanism that engage a locking mechanism of the first fixation member <b>22</b>, for instance a thread, a locking pin, a ratchet, a rough surface, etc. along one or both of the shaft <b>23</b> and the head <b>25</b>. It should be understood that at least one or both of the shaft <b>23</b> and the head <b>25</b> can be substantially smooth and devoid of the locking mechanism. Likewise, at least one or both of the shaft-receiving region and the head-receiving region can be substantially smooth and devoid of the locking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The middle region <b>54</b> further defines a top surface <b>76</b> and opposed side surfaces <b>78</b> that extend down from the top surface <b>76</b>. The side surfaces <b>78</b> extend toward each other as they extend down from the top surface <b>76</b>. That is, as the side surfaces <b>78</b> extend down from the top surface <b>76</b>, the direction in which the side surfaces <b>78</b> extend includes a lateral component that extends toward the other side surface <b>78</b>. Therefore, the side surfaces <b>78</b> and the top surface <b>76</b> define a dovetail shaped locking member. It should be understood, however, that the middle region may include configurations other than a dovetail shaped locking member. For example, the middle region may define an L-shaped locking member, a greater angulation longitudinal ratchet, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the first side regions <b>58</b> include conical recesses <b>80</b> at their anterior ends. As shown, the conical recesses <b>80</b> are angled up as they extend toward the posterior end <b>46</b> of the body portion <b>34</b>. As will be described later, the conical recesses <b>80</b> allow the second and third fixation members <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> to be inserted into the superior implant body <b>14</b> of the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> at a specified angle.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The inferior implant body <b>18</b> can further include at least one graft window <b>90</b> such as a plurality of graft windows <b>90</b> that extend through at least one or more of the middle region <b>54</b> and the first side regions <b>58</b>. Generally, each graft window <b>90</b> is elongate in the longitudinal direction, though it should be understood that any shape may be desired. The graft windows <b>90</b> are configured to receive autogenous bone graft or bone graft substitute such as Chronos, or DBM. For instance, the graft windows <b>90</b> may be pre-filled with the bone graft.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref>, and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>E the superior implant body <b>14</b> may be translated, for instance longitudinally, along the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. As shown, the superior implant body <b>14</b> includes a body portion <b>134</b> that defines an upper or superior, or outer, engagement surface <b>138</b> configured to contact or otherwise face the inferior endplate <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the superior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>a</i>, an opposing interior surface <b>140</b>, an anterior end <b>142</b>, and an opposing posterior end <b>146</b>. The body portion <b>134</b> further includes a plurality of engagement features <b>150</b> that extend transversely out from the engagement surface <b>138</b> and can be angled toward the anterior end <b>142</b> of the body portion <b>134</b>. The engagement features <b>150</b> allow the superior implant body <b>14</b> to easily translate along a posterior direction under the inferior endplate of the superior vertebral body during insertion of the superior implant body <b>14</b> while at the same time provides immediate primary stability allowing the superior implant body <b>14</b> to resist anterior migration. In other words, the engagement features <b>150</b> allow the superior implant body <b>14</b> to easily slide in one direction, but if it were to slide in a second opposite direction, the engagement features <b>150</b> would catch on the inferior endplate <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the superior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>a </i>to thereby prevent migration of the superior implant body <b>14</b>. It should be understood that the engagement features <b>150</b> can be shaped in any manner as desired, such as teeth, spikes, pyramids, cones, undefined geometries, rough surface topography, or independent bodies such a metal spikes that are embedded into the body portion <b>134</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref>, the body portion <b>134</b>, such as the inner surface <b>140</b>, includes second side regions <b>154</b> that define a longitudinally elongate middle recess <b>158</b> configured to receive the longitudinally elongate rail of the body portion <b>34</b>. The middle recess <b>158</b> extends into the body portion <b>134</b> from an inferior side of the superior implant body <b>14</b>, and generally acts as a groove or channel that receives the middle region <b>54</b> of the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. As shown, the middle recess <b>158</b> receives the middle region <b>54</b> of the inferior implant body <b>18</b> as the superior implant body <b>14</b> translates along the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. An anterior end <b>162</b> of the middle recess <b>158</b> defines a conical recess <b>166</b> that is angled downwards. That is, the anterior end <b>162</b> of the middle recess <b>158</b> extends down as it extends toward the posterior end <b>146</b> of the body portion <b>134</b>. Additionally, the anterior end <b>162</b> of the middle recess <b>158</b> defines a conical recess <b>166</b> that angles downward as it extends toward the posterior end <b>146</b> of the body portion <b>134</b>. As will be described, the conical recess <b>166</b> enables the first fixation member <b>22</b> to be removed from the inferior implant body <b>18</b> of the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> if so desired.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The middle recess <b>158</b> further defines a top surface <b>168</b> and opposing side surfaces <b>170</b> extending down from the top surface <b>168</b>. The side surfaces <b>170</b> extend toward each other as they extend down from the top surface <b>168</b>. That is, as the side surfaces <b>170</b> extend down from the top surface <b>168</b>, the direction in which the side surfaces <b>170</b> extend includes a lateral component that extends toward the other side surface <b>170</b>. Therefore, the side surfaces <b>170</b> and the top surface <b>168</b> define a dovetail shaped channel that receives the dovetail shaped middle region <b>54</b> of the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. It should be understood, however, that the middle recess may include configurations other than a dovetail shaped channel. For example, the middle recess may define an L-shaped channel, a greater angulation longitudinal ratchet, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The second side regions <b>154</b> each include an anterior end <b>172</b> and a posterior end <b>176</b> that are angled downwards. That is, the anterior end <b>172</b> of the second side regions <b>154</b> includes a surface that extend down or otherwise toward the inferior implant body <b>18</b> as they extend toward the posterior end <b>146</b> of the body portion <b>134</b>, and the posterior end <b>176</b> of the second side regions <b>154</b> extend down or otherwise toward the inferior implant body <b>18</b> as they extend toward the anterior end <b>142</b> of the body portion <b>134</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the body portion <b>134</b> defines a bore <b>180</b> that extends through each anterior end <b>172</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, each bore <b>180</b> is configured to receive one of the second and third fixation members <b>26</b> and <b>30</b>. Like the first fixation member <b>22</b>, the second and third fixation members can include a shaft <b>23</b> and a head <b>25</b> that is dimensioned larger than the shaft <b>23</b>. The bores <b>180</b> can likewise include a shaft-receiving region sized to receive the shaft <b>23</b>, and a head receiving region sized to receive the head <b>25</b> when the fixation members <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> are fully received by the bores <b>180</b>. The bores <b>180</b> can further be tapered and elongate along an angle toward the posterior end <b>146</b> of the body portion <b>134</b>, such that the fixation members <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> are also elongate along the angle toward the posterior end <b>146</b> of the body portion <b>134</b> when received in the bores <b>180</b>. The bores <b>180</b> can include locking mechanisms that engage locking mechanisms of the second and third fixation members <b>26</b> and <b>30</b>, for instance threads, locking pins, ratchets, rough surfaces, etc. along one or both of the shafts <b>23</b> and the heads <b>25</b>. It should be understood that at least one or both of the shafts <b>23</b> and the heads <b>25</b> can be substantially smooth and devoid of the locking mechanisms. Likewise, at least one or both of the shaft-receiving regions and the head-receiving regions can be substantially smooth and devoid of the locking mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3D</figref>, the superior implant body <b>14</b> can further include at least one graft window <b>190</b> such as a plurality of graft windows <b>190</b> that extend through at least one or more of the second side regions <b>154</b> as well as through the portion of the body portion <b>134</b> in which the recess <b>158</b> is defined. Generally, each graft window <b>190</b> is elongate in the longitudinal direction, though it should be understood that any shape may be desired. The graft windows <b>190</b> are configured to receive autogenous bone graft or bone graft substitute such as Chronos, or DBM. For instance, the graft windows <b>190</b> may be pre-filled with the bone graft.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the second and third fixation members <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> may be inserted into the bores <b>180</b> of the superior implant body <b>14</b> once the superior implant body <b>14</b> is fully slid onto the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. The second and third fixation members <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> extend at an angle toward the posterior end of the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b>. The second and third fixation members <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> engage the inferior endplate of the superior vertebral body to thereby securely attach the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> to the superior vertebral body.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4E</figref>, when the superior implant body <b>14</b> is fully slid onto the inferior implant body <b>18</b>, the graft windows <b>190</b> of the superior implant body <b>14</b> align with the graft windows <b>90</b> of the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. Therefore, the graft windows <b>90</b> and <b>190</b> define transverse channels that extend through the assembled implant <b>10</b>. The graft windows <b>190</b> may be pre-filled with the bone graft.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref>, the superior implant body <b>14</b> lockingly engages the inferior implant body <b>18</b> with respect to at least one or both of relative rotation and relative translation along a direction angularly offset with respect to the longitudinal insertion direction I when the recess <b>158</b> of the superior implant body <b>14</b> has received the rail of the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. In that regard, the dovetail shaped recess <b>158</b> of the superior implant body <b>14</b> engages the dovetail shaped middle region <b>54</b> of the inferior implant body <b>18</b> when the inferior implant body <b>18</b> is received by the superior implant body <b>14</b> to create a form fit between the superior and inferior implant bodies <b>14</b> and <b>18</b>. This form fit eliminates rotational degrees of freedom between the superior and inferior implant bodies <b>14</b> and <b>18</b>. Other interlocking features between the superior implant body <b>14</b> and the inferior implant body <b>18</b> are envisioned to prevent translation in the longitudinal direction, such as a snap-action mechanism (e.g. PE-inlay or Prodisc-L). A third body (e.g. splint, pin, screw, bolt, glue) that is inserted after intraoperative assembly of the superior and inferior implant bodies <b>14</b> and <b>18</b> may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C-4E</figref>, the bores <b>72</b> and <b>180</b> are conical in shape. The conical shaped bores <b>72</b>, <b>180</b> are configured to prevent the fixation members <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>30</b> from being over inserted into the bores, and allow for angle stable fixation. The angle stable fixation prevents the fixation members not only from being over inserted but also from backing out. Thus, as each bore <b>72</b> and <b>180</b> receives its respective fixation members <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>30</b> the heads of the fixation members <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>30</b> will eventually abut the walls of the bores <b>72</b> and <b>180</b> to thereby prevent further insertion of the fixation members <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>30</b>. Such a configuration allows for a more stable fixation of the fixation members <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>30</b>. Furthermore, the angle stable connection between the fixation member's head and its counter part allow it to bear a bending moment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> may include marker pins <b>200</b>, which may be used in case of a radiolucent base material that would not be visible in fluoroscopy/x-ray equipment. As shown, marker pins <b>200</b> may be buried within the body portion <b>34</b> of the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. The marker pins <b>200</b> may be radioopaque to allow easy identification of the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> in fluroscopique images. It should be understood that the implant <b>10</b> may include any number of pins <b>200</b>, and that the pins <b>200</b> may also be buried within the superior implant body <b>14</b>. Furthermore, instead of radiopaque marker pins <b>200</b>, it may be possible to use polymers, ceramics, or biomaterials that include barium sulfate, or a similar substance. Barium sulfate (that is either homogeneously or inhomegeneously distributed in the base material) allows to make a radiopaque base material visible under fluoroscopy/x-ray equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref>, both the inferior implant body <b>18</b> and the superior implant body <b>14</b> may act as distractors as they are individually slid into the intervertebral space <b>11</b>. As shown, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, as the inferior implant body <b>18</b> is positioned within the intervertebral space <b>11</b> at least one of the superior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the inferior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>b </i>moves away from the other such that the superior and inferior vertebral bodies are separated by a first distance F<sub>1</sub>. The first distance F<sub>1 </sub>may be substantially equal to the transverse height of the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. Once the inferior implant body <b>18</b> is properly positioned and attached to the inferior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the superior implant body <b>14</b> may be slid or otherwise translated over the inferior implant body <b>18</b> and into the intervertebral space <b>11</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the angled posterior ends <b>176</b> of the superior implant body's second side regions <b>154</b> contact respective second side regions <b>58</b> of the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. Because of the angled posterior ends <b>176</b> of the superior implant body <b>14</b>, the superior implant body <b>14</b> will move toward the superior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>a </i>as the superior implant body <b>14</b> is slid over the inferior implant body <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B-5D</figref> to thereby cause at least one of the superior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the inferior vertebral body <b>12</b><i>b </i>to move away from the other such that the vertebral bodies are separated by a second distance F<sub>2 </sub>that is greater than the first distance F<sub>1</sub>. In this way, continuous distraction is achieved until the superior implant body <b>14</b> is fully assembled with the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the superior implant body <b>14</b> may move a distance H in an upward direction once it has been fully slid onto the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. The distance H as well as the degree of distraction may depend on the angle at which the posterior ends <b>176</b> extend toward the anterior end of the superior implant body <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In operation, the inferior implant body <b>18</b> is first inserted into the intervertebral space. Once properly placed, the first fixation member <b>22</b> may be inserted into the bore <b>72</b> of the inferior implant body <b>18</b> and driven into the inferior vertebral body. Next the superior implant body <b>14</b> is pushed into the intervertebral space or otherwise slid over the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. During insertion of the superior implant body <b>14</b>, the superior implant body <b>14</b> slides over the inferior implant body <b>18</b>. As described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref>, as the superior implant body <b>14</b> is sliding onto the inferior implant body <b>18</b>, the superior implant body <b>14</b> moves up toward the superior vertebral body. Therefore, a continuous distraction of the inferior and superior vertebral bodies is achieved until the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> is fully assembled. The superior implant body <b>14</b> interlocks with the inferior implant body <b>18</b> and builds a solid construct. The assembled implant <b>10</b> withstands translation and rotation in all six degrees of freedom.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Once the assembled implant <b>10</b> is properly positioned, the second and third fixation members <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> may be inserted into the bores <b>180</b> of the superior implant body <b>14</b>. The second and third fixation members <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> engage the inferior endplate of the superior vertebral body to thereby securely attach the superior implant body <b>14</b> and therefore the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> to the superior vertebral body.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Because the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> may be placed into the intervertebral space <b>11</b> by first inserting the inferior implant body <b>18</b> and then the superior implant body <b>14</b>, the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> may be inserted into the intervertebral space <b>11</b> either from the anterior end of the patient or from the posterior end of the patient. In other words, by positioning the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> in pieces rather than as a fully assembled construct the surgeon will be capable of accessing the intervertebral space <b>11</b> from the posterior end of the patient which is usually difficult, due to the limited amount of space. It should be understood that any surgical approach (i.e. anterior, antero-lateral, lateral, extraforaminal, transforaminal, and posterior) may be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be appreciated that the distractable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> described herein can be configured so as to provide a range of numerous possible geometries and angular relationships. For example, while the superior implant body <b>14</b> is described as having angled posterior ends that cause the superior implant body <b>14</b> to move upwards and thereby act as a distractor, it is possible to include an angled anterior end on the inferior implant body <b>18</b> to cause the superior implant body <b>14</b> to distract as it is inserted. Furthermore, it is envisioned that the superior implant body <b>14</b> could be inserted into the intervertebral space prior to the insertion of the inferior implant body <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the broad inventive concept thereof. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that the structure, features, and methods as described above with respect to any of the embodiments described herein can be incorporated into any of the other embodiments described herein unless otherwise indicated.
