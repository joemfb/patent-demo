<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a solid electrolytic capacitor and a manufacturing method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Following the digitization, miniaturization, and speed-up of electronic devices in recent years, there has been an increasing demand for capacitors for use in electronic devices that are small in size, large in capacitance, and low in impedance in a high-frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a capacitor that can respond to such a demand, there is a solid electrolytic capacitor having a conductive polymer layer (solid electrolyte layer).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This type of solid electrolytic capacitor is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent (JP-B) No. 2940059 (first related-art document). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrating a solid electrolytic capacitor similar to that disclosed in the first related-art document, the solid electrolytic capacitor comprises an anode (<b>61</b>) formed by a proximal portion <b>61</b> of a metal member <b>60</b> made of a valve metal, a dielectric layer (not illustrated) in the form of a valve metal oxide film formed at the surfaces of the anode <b>61</b>, a cathode (<b>80</b>) in the form of a conductive polymer layer <b>80</b> formed on the anode <b>61</b> through the dielectric layer, and an anode lead (<b>63</b>) formed by a distal portion <b>63</b> of the metal member <b>60</b>. In the figure, symbol <b>90</b> denotes a later-described resist.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The conductive polymer layer <b>80</b> is formed by immersing the proximal portion <b>61</b> of the metal member <b>60</b> in a monomer solution containing, for example, a derivative of pyrrole or a derivative of thiophene and a supporting electrolyte to thereby carry out electrolytic polymerization, chemical polymerization, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Herein, as disclosed in the first related-art document, the tape-like resist <b>90</b> is formed at an intermediate portion <b>62</b> between the proximal portion <b>61</b>, which will serve as the anode <b>61</b>, and the distal portion <b>63</b>, which will serve as the anode lead <b>63</b>, of the metal member <b>60</b>. The resist <b>90</b> serves to prevent penetration of the monomer solution to the distal portion <b>63</b> of the metal member <b>60</b> while the proximal portion <b>61</b> of the metal member <b>60</b> is immersed in the monomer solution. The reason for preventing the penetration of the monomer solution to the distal portion <b>63</b> is to prevent occurrence of a leakage current between the cathode <b>80</b> and the anode lead <b>63</b> due to formation of a film of a conductive polymer contained in the monomer solution on the surfaces of the anode lead <b>63</b> when the solid electrolytic capacitor is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the metal member <b>60</b> has a roughened surface layer <b>60</b><i>a </i>in order to obtain a large capacitance by increasing the facing area between the anode <b>61</b> and the cathode <b>80</b>. Therefore, there is a possibility that gaps exist between the roughened surface layer <b>60</b><i>a </i>at the intermediate portion <b>62</b> of the metal member <b>60</b> and the tape-like resist <b>90</b>. Consequently, there is a possibility that when the proximal portion <b>61</b> of the metal member <b>60</b> is immersed in the monomer solution, the monomer solution penetrates to the distal portion <b>63</b> of the metal member <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2000-243665 (second related-art document) discloses a measure for preventing the penetration of a monomer solution more securely than that disclosed in the first related-art document. This measure is, namely, a forbidden band formed on the surfaces of an intermediate portion of a metal member between its proximal portion to serve as an anode and its distal portion to serve as an anode lead. As one example of this forbidden band, the second related-art document teaches a combination of a separation groove formed by partly removing a roughened surface layer of the metal member so as to expose the body of the metal member and a resist formed on the separation groove.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, even with the combination of the separation groove and the resist disclosed in the second related-art document, there is a possibility that the monomer solution penetrates to the distal portion of the metal member through minute gaps between the surface of the separation groove and the resist.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, there is also a possibility that the monomer solution creeps up the surface of the resist to reach the distal portion of the metal member. The creeping-up of the monomer solution remarkably occurs when immersing the metal member in the monomer solution so as to exceed the proximal portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Herein, if the separation groove and the resist are prolonged, it may be more difficult for the monomer solution to penetrate or creep up. However, as a result of prolonging the separation groove and the resist, the redundant intermediate portion that does not serve either as the anode or as the anode lead is enlarged in the metal member. This is not preferable because it leads to an unnecessary increase in size of a solid electrolytic capacitor, that is, to a reduction in volumetric efficiency of a solid electrolytic capacitor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is an object of this invention to solve the above problems and to provide a solid electrolytic capacitor with a small leakage current and yet with excellent volumetric efficiency and a method of manufacturing such a solid electrolytic capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an aspect of this invention, there is provided a solid electrolytic capacitor manufacturing method comprising the steps of forming a roughened surface layer at a surface of a metal member made of a valve metal and having a proximal portion, a distal portion, and an intermediate portion between the proximal portion and the distal portion, forming a valve metal oxide film at a surface of the roughened surface layer, removing the roughened surface layer from the distal portion of the metal member and from part of the intermediate portion adjacent to the distal portion, forming a resist on the distal portion and the intermediate portion of the metal member, forming a conductive polymer layer of a conductive polymer on the proximal portion of the metal member, and removing the resist and a surface layer portion of the metal member from the distal portion of the metal member, whereby forming an anode formed by the proximal portion of the metal member, a cathode formed by the conductive polymer layer and facing the anode, a dielectric layer formed by the valve metal oxide film and interposed between the anode and the cathode, and an anode lead formed by the distal portion of the metal member.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The distal portion and the intermediate portion of the metal member may be arranged at each of both ends of the proximal portion, so that the anode lead includes a first anode lead and a second anode lead.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect of this invention, there is provided a solid electrolytic capacitor manufactured by the solid electrolytic capacitor manufacturing method.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to still another aspect of this invention, there is provided a solid electrolytic capacitor comprising an anode made of a valve metal and having a roughened surface layer at a surface thereof, a dielectric layer made of a valve metal oxide and formed on the anode, a cathode in the form of a conductive polymer layer formed on the dielectric layer, an anode lead formed adjacent to and integrally with the anode, and a resist made of an insulating material and delimiting the anode and the anode lead. The anode and the anode lead have a first stepped portion having both surfaces each cut in a thickness direction and covered with the resist. The anode lead has a second stepped portion having both surfaces each cut deeper in the thickness direction than the first stepped portion.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0033">Through the above processes, there are formed an anode formed by the proximal portion of the metal member, a cathode formed by the conductive polymer layer and facing the anode, a dielectric layer formed by the valve metal oxide film and interposed between the anode and the cathode, and an anode lead formed by the distal portion of the metal member.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0035">Hereinbelow, a description will be given of a solid electrolytic capacitor manufacturing method according to a first embodiment of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0036">At first, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an aluminum foil is prepared as a metal member <b>10</b> made of a valve metal.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0037">The valve metal may be, instead of aluminum, one of tantalum, niobium, zirconium, titanium, a complex of at least two of these valve metals, and an alloy of at least two of these valve metals. The metal member <b>10</b> may be in the form of a plate or a wire instead of the foil.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038">A roughened surface layer <b>10</b><i>a </i>is formed at the surfaces of the metal member <b>10</b>. The roughened surface layer <b>10</b><i>a </i>is formed by electrolytic etching of the surfaces of the metal member <b>10</b>. The roughened surface layer <b>10</b><i>a </i>may be formed by adhesion of valve metal powder to the surfaces of the metal member <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0039">The metal member <b>10</b> has a proximal portion <b>11</b>, a distal portion <b>13</b>, and an intermediate portion <b>12</b> between the proximal portion <b>11</b> and the distal portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040">Further, an aluminum oxide film is formed as a valve metal oxide film <b>20</b> at the surfaces of the roughened surface layer <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">The aluminum oxide film is formed by immersing the aluminum foil in an electrolyte maintained at a predetermined temperature, applying a predetermined voltage thereto, and maintaining the state for a predetermined time. This process is also called anodic oxidation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">Then, as shown by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a roughened surface layer <b>10</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, i.e. part of the roughened surface layer <b>10</b><i>a</i>, is removed from the distal portion <b>13</b> of the metal member <b>10</b> and from part of the intermediate portion <b>12</b> adjacent to the distal portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043">What is noteworthy in this invention is that the roughened surface layer is removed not only at the intermediate portion of the metal member, but is removed both at part of the intermediate portion and at the distal portion.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">The roughened surface layer <b>10</b><i>a </i>is removed by laser cutting. The roughened surface layer <b>10</b><i>a </i>may be removed by mechanical cutting by the use of a router or the like, instead of the laser cutting.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0045">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a resist <b>40</b> is formed on the distal portion <b>13</b> and the intermediate portion <b>12</b> of the metal member <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0046">What is noteworthy in this invention is that the resist is formed not only at the intermediate portion of the metal member, but is formed both at the intermediate portion and at the distal portion.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047">The resist <b>40</b> is formed by coating a fluid silicone agent by screen printing and then curing it. The resist <b>40</b> may be formed by bonding a silicone tape, instead of coating the silicone agent. Alternatively, the resist <b>40</b> may be formed by coating an electrically insulating thermosetting or thermoplastic resin by screen printing and then curing it. The thermosetting resin and the thermoplastic resin are, for example, an epoxy resin and a polyester-based resin, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, a conductive polymer layer <b>30</b> of a conductive polymer is formed on the proximal portion <b>11</b> of the metal member <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">The conductive polymer layer <b>30</b> is formed by a chemical polymerization method, an electrolytic polymerization method, or a solution immersion method. These forming methods each include a process of immersing part or the whole of the metal member <b>10</b>, including at least the proximal portion <b>11</b>, in a monomer solution containing a derivative and a supporting electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0050">The conductive polymer is formed by adding one of an electron acceptor and an electron donor to one of polyacetylene, polyparaphenylene, polyaniline, polythiophene, polyparaphenylenevinylene, polypyrrole, and derivatives of these conductive polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">Note that the monomer solution may have penetrated to the distal portion <b>13</b> of the metal member <b>10</b> through minute gaps between the intermediate portion <b>12</b> and the resist <b>40</b> or may have crept up the surfaces of the resist <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">Then, as shown by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, a resist <b>40</b>&#x2032;, i.e. part of the resist <b>40</b>, and surface layer portions <b>13</b>&#x2032; of the metal member <b>10</b> are removed from the distal portion <b>13</b> of the metal member <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">The resist <b>40</b> formed on the distal portion <b>13</b> and the surface layer portions <b>13</b>&#x2032; of the distal portion <b>13</b> are removed by laser cutting. Although the removal of these portions can also be performed by mechanical cutting by the use of a router or the like, the laser cutting is preferable because precise removal dimensions are required.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">What is noteworthy in this invention is that the conductive polymer caused by the monomer solution having penetrated or crept up near the distal portion <b>13</b> of the metal member <b>10</b> is completely removed and thus the surfaces of the distal portion <b>13</b> are perfectly pure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">In the manner described above, a two-terminal type solid electrolytic capacitor element illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is manufactured. This solid electrolytic capacitor element comprises an anode (<b>11</b>) formed by the proximal portion <b>11</b> of the metal member <b>10</b>, a cathode (<b>30</b>) formed by the conductive polymer layer <b>30</b> and facing the anode <b>11</b>, a dielectric layer (<b>20</b>) formed by the valve metal oxide film <b>20</b> and interposed between the anode <b>11</b> and the cathode <b>30</b>, and an anode lead (<b>13</b>) formed by the distal portion <b>13</b> of the metal member <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">Further, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a cathode lead layer <b>46</b> formed of a graphite layer <b>46</b><i>a </i>and a silver layer <b>46</b><i>b </i>is further formed on the cathode <b>30</b> of this solid electrolytic capacitor element. If necessary, an anode terminal <b>48</b> and a cathode terminal <b>47</b> are respectively bonded to the anode lead <b>13</b> and the cathode lead layer <b>46</b> of this solid electrolytic capacitor element. Further, this solid electrolytic capacitor element, except part of the anode terminal <b>48</b> and part of the cathode terminal <b>47</b>, is incorporated in a package <b>49</b> made of an epoxy resin or the like, so that a solid electrolytic capacitor is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">A solid electrolytic capacitor according to this invention may be not only a solid electrolytic capacitor incorporating a single solid electrolytic capacitor element as described above, but also a stacked solid electrolytic capacitor incorporating a plurality of stacked solid electrolytic capacitor elements.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0083">As is clear from the table, with respect to the two-terminal type solid electrolytic capacitor elements achieving the same volumetric efficiency of 75%, Sample 1 (first embodiment of this invention) is smaller in leakage current as compared with Sample 3 (comparative example). On the other hand, with respect to the two-terminal type solid electrolytic capacitor elements exhibiting similar leakage currents, Sample 1 (first embodiment of this invention) is excellent in volumetric efficiency as compared with Sample 4 (comparative example). In this manner, this invention accomplishes both the small leakage current and the excellent volumetric efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0084">Further, with respect to the three-terminal type solid electrolytic capacitor elements, Sample 2 (second embodiment of this invention) is small in leakage current, while, Sample 5 (comparative example) fails due to a short circuit between the cathode and the anode lead and thus cannot be put to practical use.</p>
