<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, a disclosed method for managing an MCDN includes monitoring respective average values of a maximum data transfer rate and a current data transfer rate over a plurality of MCDN clients coupled to an MCDN node, and determining, by a server, a ratio of the average current data transfer rate to the average maximum data transfer rate. When the ratio is less than a predetermined threshold, the method may further include designating the MCDN node as a degraded node. The method may still further include subjecting the degraded node to enhanced surveillance by an MCDN operator.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments, the method may include determining the ratio based on a current data transfer rate and a maximum data transfer rate for a given MCDN client. The monitoring may be performed for upstream data transfer and/or downstream data transfer. The enhanced surveillance may result in the following network operations for the degraded node: triggering additional measurements, broadcasting an alarm over the MCDN, initiating a service call, performing a network diagnostic, assessing physical network connections, determining line characteristics for individual MCDN clients coupled to the degraded node, or a combination thereof. The average values may be monitored for a network segment between the MCDN node and an MCDN client, and/or a network segment between the MCDN node and a central office of the MCDN operator. The method may further include determining the maximum data transfer rate for a network segment between the MCDN node and an MCDN client by an arbitration process associated with a reinitialization of customer premises equipment (CPE) at the MCDN client and coupled to the network segment. The method may still further include determining the current data transfer rate by monitoring network usage associated with respective MCDN clients. In response to receiving a service call request from a user of an MCDN client coupled to the MCDN node, the method may also include notifying the user that the degraded node has been identified, including notifying the user of a status of the enhanced surveillance.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further aspect, a disclosed computer system for monitoring an MCDN includes a processor, coupled to memory media. The memory media may include processor instructions executable to determine an average maximum bit rate and an average current bit rate for a group of MCDN clients associated with an MCDN node. When a ratio of the average current bit rate to the average maximum bit rate is less than about fifty percent (50%), the processor instructions may be executable to designate the MCDN node as a degraded node and increase a mitigation priority for the MCDN node.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In particular embodiments, the memory media may include processor instructions executable to notify at least one user of the group of MCDN clients of an indication that the MCDN node is a degraded node. The processor instructions to notify the at least one user may be executable in response to receiving a service request from an MCDN client within the group of MCDN clients. A determined bit rate may be associated with network traffic between the MCDN node and the group of MCDN clients. A determined bit rate may be associated with network traffic between the MCDN node and a central office of an MCDN provider. The processor instructions to increase the mitigation priority may further include processor instructions to perform the following network operations for the degraded node: trigger additional measurements, broadcast an alarm over the MCDN, initiate a service call, perform a network diagnostic, assess physical network connections, determine line characteristics for individual MCDN clients coupled to the degraded node, or a combination thereof. The memory media may further include processor instructions executable to designate the MCDN node as a normal node when the ratio is greater than about fifty percent (50%), and lower the mitigation priority for the MCDN node.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet another aspect, a disclosed computer-readable memory media includes executable instructions for monitoring an MCDN. The instructions may be executable to monitor average values for a maximum bit rate and a current bit rate for a group of MCDN clients associated with an MCDN node. When the ratio of an average current bit rate to an average maximum bit rate is less than about fifty percent (50%), the instructions may be executable to designate the MCDN node as a degraded node and/or increase a mitigation priority for the MCDN node. The instructions may further be executable to notify at least one user of the group of MCDN clients of an indication that the MCDN node is a degraded node. The average values may be queried from the MCDN node. The average values may be queried from an MCDN database server. The instructions to increase the mitigation priority result in the following network operations for the degraded node: trigger additional measurements, broadcast an alarm over the MCDN; initiate a service call, perform a network diagnostic, assess physical network connections, determining line characteristics for individual MCDN clients coupled to the degraded node, or a combination thereof. The additional measurements may include recording current bit rates associated with the MCDN node in real time. The average values are monitored for upstream bit rates and/or downstream bit rates.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the following description, details are set forth by way of example to facilitate discussion of the disclosed subject matter. It should be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the field, however, that the disclosed embodiments are exemplary and not exhaustive of all possible embodiments.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Access network <b>130</b> demarcates clients <b>120</b> and service provider <b>121</b>, and provides at least one connection path between clients <b>120</b> and service provider <b>121</b>. In some embodiments, access network <b>130</b> is an Internet protocol (IP) compliant network. In some embodiments, access network <b>130</b> is, at least in part, a coaxial cable network. It is noted that in some embodiments of MCDN <b>100</b>, access network <b>130</b> is owned and/or operated by service provider <b>121</b>. In other embodiments, a third party may own and/or operate at least a portion of access network <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In IP-compliant embodiments of access network <b>130</b>, access network <b>130</b> may include a physical layer of unshielded twisted pair cables, fiber optic cables, or a combination thereof. MCDN <b>100</b> may include digital connections between clients <b>120</b> and a node (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in access network <b>130</b> while fiber, cable or another broadband medium connects service provider resources to the node. In other embodiments, the broadband cable may extend all the way to clients <b>120</b>. In certain embodiments, fiber optic cables may be provided from the node in access network <b>130</b> to each individual client <b>120</b>. The connections between access network <b>130</b> and clients <b>120</b> may include digital subscriber line (DSL) connections. In particular embodiments, the connections may be DSL-compliant twisted pair or another type of galvanic loop (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, switching network <b>140</b> provides connectivity for service provider <b>121</b>, and may be housed in a central office or other facility of service provider <b>121</b>. Switching network <b>140</b> may provide firewall and routing functions to demarcate access network <b>130</b> from the resources of service provider <b>121</b>. In embodiments that employ DSL-compliant connections, switching network <b>140</b> and/or access network <b>130</b> may include elements of a DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM) that multiplexes many subscriber DSLs to backbone network <b>170</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, backbone network <b>170</b> represents a private network including, as an example, a fiber based network to accommodate high data transfer rates.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a block diagram of selected elements of an embodiment of MCDN <b>400</b> is depicted. In MCDN <b>400</b>, selected elements of one embodiment of access network <b>430</b> are depicted in further detail. Access network <b>430</b> is shown implementing a DSL architecture, which may represent any of a number of different DSL technologies, such as Asymmetric DSL (ADSL), Very High Speed DSL (VDSL), VDSL2, and other variants thereof, among others. In certain embodiments, access network <b>430</b> represents access network <b>130</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). It is noted that like numbered elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> represent components discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, MCDN <b>400</b> includes switching network <b>140</b>-<b>1</b>, which may be one instance, segment, or portion of switching network <b>140</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). For example, switching network <b>140</b>-<b>1</b> may represent elements of switching network <b>140</b> providing MCDN service to a particular geographic region or area. As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, switching network <b>140</b>-<b>1</b> represents infrastructure of MCDN service provider <b>121</b>, which may correspond to the provider's central office, from where network service for a particular MCDN segment is provided. Accordingly, switching network <b>140</b>-<b>1</b> is shown with network termination (NT) links <b>412</b> (also referred to as uplinks) to a respective plurality of DSLAMs <b>410</b>. Specifically, NT link <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> provides an uplink for DSLAM <b>410</b>-<b>1</b>, NT link <b>412</b>-<b>2</b> provides an uplink for DSLAM <b>410</b>-<b>2</b>, and so on for a plurality of uplinks, up to NT link <b>412</b>-X for DSLAM <b>410</b>-X, where X represents a number of DSLAMs <b>410</b> which are uplinked to switching network <b>140</b>-<b>1</b>. Each individual DSLAM <b>410</b> may provide service for a certain number of MCDN clients, as will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, DSLAM <b>410</b>-<b>1</b> is shown in further detail including additional elements, which have been omitted in the depiction of DSLAM <b>410</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>410</b>-X for clarity. It will be understood that DSLAM <b>410</b>-<b>1</b> is generally representative for any given DSLAM <b>410</b>, and that a particular DSLAM <b>410</b> may be variously configured with different numbers of elements and sub-elements, as desired. As used herein, DSLAM <b>410</b> represents an &#x201c;MCDN node&#x201d; or simply &#x201c;node,&#x201d; while elements included within DSLAM <b>410</b> are referred to as an &#x201c;MCDN sub-node&#x201d; or &#x201c;sub-node.&#x201d; NT links <b>412</b> thus represent an uplink between an MCDN node serving a given plurality of MCDN clients <b>120</b> and switching network <b>140</b>, representing other portions of MCDN <b>400</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, DSLAM <b>410</b>-<b>1</b> includes a number of shelves <b>420</b>, shown as shelf <b>420</b>-<b>1</b>, shelf <b>420</b>-<b>2</b>, and so on, up to shelf <b>420</b>-N, where N represents a number of shelves <b>420</b> included within DSLAM <b>410</b>-<b>1</b>. It is noted that different DSLAMs <b>410</b> may be equipped with a different number of shelves <b>420</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, shelf <b>420</b>-<b>1</b> is shown in further detail including additional elements, which have been omitted from the depiction of shelf <b>420</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>420</b>-N for clarity. Shelf <b>420</b> may generally represent an equipment rack for accommodating a number of cards <b>422</b> and may provide a connection bus for terminating, powering, and interconnecting cards <b>422</b>. DSLAM <b>410</b> may further include equipment (not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) for bundling network connections from a plurality of cards <b>422</b>, also known as line termination (LT) cards, via shelves <b>420</b> to at least one NT link <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, shelf <b>420</b>-<b>1</b> may include representative card <b>422</b>-<b>1</b>, card <b>422</b>-<b>2</b>, and so on up to card <b>422</b>-M, where M represents a number of cards <b>422</b> that may be accommodated in shelf <b>420</b>-<b>1</b>. It is noted that different shelves <b>420</b> may accommodate a different number of cards <b>422</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, card <b>422</b>-<b>1</b> is shown in further detail including additional elements, which have been omitted from card <b>422</b>-<b>2</b> and card <b>422</b>-M for clarity. Card <b>422</b>-<b>1</b> is shown with a number of ports <b>424</b> for providing service to individual MCDN clients <b>120</b> via respective LT links <b>426</b>. LT link <b>426</b> may represent a DSL connection (i.e., signal loop) to the premises of client <b>120</b>. Specifically, port <b>424</b>-<b>1</b> is linked to client <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> via LT link <b>426</b>-<b>1</b>, port <b>424</b>-<b>2</b> is linked to client <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> via LT link <b>426</b>-<b>2</b>, and so on, up to port <b>424</b>-P linking client <b>120</b>-P via LT link <b>426</b>-P, where P represents a number of ports that card <b>422</b>-<b>1</b> is configured to provide. It is noted that LT link <b>426</b> may terminate at client <b>120</b> via GW <b>123</b>, such that multimedia content <b>360</b> is delivered via LT link <b>426</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Card <b>422</b>-<b>1</b> may further include additional elements (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) for providing connections from ports <b>424</b> to shelf <b>420</b> (for example, via a bus backplane) and ultimately to NT link <b>412</b>. It is also noted that different cards <b>422</b> may be configured with different numbers of ports <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In review, the elements of MCDN <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> represent an MCDN architecture suitable for providing DSL network service to a community of clients <b>120</b> via DSLAM <b>410</b>. A large number of DSLAMs <b>410</b> may be installed to provide service to a number of neighborhoods, cities, and other localities. Accordingly, client <b>120</b> may be coupled to MCDN <b>400</b> via port <b>424</b>, card <b>422</b>, shelf <b>420</b>, and DSLAM <b>410</b>. The MCDN architecture represented by MCDN <b>400</b> may thus allow MCDN service provider <b>121</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to individually address and communicate with nodes, sub-nodes and MCDN clients <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The physical implementation of LT link <b>426</b> may involve various cabling and termination elements, which may be routed and bundled in a number of different configurations. LT link <b>426</b> may thus be exposed to, or come in proximity to, a number of different sources of electromagnetic interference. When LT link <b>426</b> represents a galvanic connection, or includes galvanic elements, transmission line effects may increase the susceptibility of LT <b>426</b> to environmental noise. Electromagnetic interference resulting in noise may originate from sources internal or external to the MCDN, and may become coupled to an MCDN signal transmitted via LT link <b>426</b>. When the MCDN signal is degraded (i.e., a signal-to-noise ratio is reduced), this is referred to herein as &#x201c;signal impairment&#x201d; or &#x201c;network impairment.&#x201d; In MCDN <b>400</b>, signal impairment may be introduced to the MCDN signal of a given client <b>120</b> via any element in the MCDN architecture, including GW <b>123</b>, LT link <b>426</b>, port <b>424</b>, card <b>422</b>, shelf <b>420</b>, DSLAM <b>410</b>, and other elements (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Furthermore, as evident from MCDN <b>400</b>, clients <b>120</b> may have their MCDN signals coupled together through any shared or proximate element in the MCDN architecture where signal impairment is introduced, as noted above. Thus, equipment associated with MCDN client <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> may cause signal impairment for a number of other MCDN clients <b>120</b>. It is noted that a user of MCDN client <b>120</b> may experience a degradation in network performance that may be the result of signal impairment or another cause. Other causes of network degradation may include upstream issues, such as, but not limited to: equipment failure within DSLAM <b>410</b>, network traffic congestion at DSLAM <b>410</b>, network traffic congestion at NT link <b>412</b>, and network issues at switching network <b>140</b>, among various causes.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Service provider <b>121</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may provide various types of support for users of MCDN clients <b>120</b> in order to manage performance of MCDN <b>400</b> and maintain a desired quality of service. For example, a user of MCDN client <b>120</b> may report an issue with network performance to service provider <b>121</b> and may request service to remediate a particular network connection. Service provider <b>121</b> may then perform network diagnostics to determine a cause of the reported issue. The diagnostics may include assessments of network infrastructure, such as the MCDN architecture described above with respect to MCDN <b>400</b>. The diagnostics may involve determining whether an issue with NT link <b>412</b> has been reported. When NT link <b>412</b> has been found to be operating normally, the network diagnostics may then focus on DSLAM <b>410</b> providing service to the reporting MCDN client <b>120</b>. The network diagnostics may attempt to identify whether a signal impairment is associated with the reported issue. In an attempt to locate a source of or a contributor to the signal impairment, a service ticket may be generated, which may result in a network technician to be dispatched on site to client <b>120</b> or DSLAM <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In instances where a network impairment affects a number of different clients <b>120</b>, any one or more of the affected clients <b>120</b> may generate service calls. Certain clients <b>120</b> that are affected may not generate any service calls. Furthermore, a particular client <b>120</b> may be a source or contributor to network impairment for a community of clients <b>120</b>, which may not be evident to the affected users or to service provider <b>121</b>, who is receiving and processing the service calls (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Thus, the administration of customer service to clients <b>120</b> may result in redundant service tickets and an over-usage of constrained field support resources, without providing any direct benefit to clients <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">During operation of MCDN <b>400</b>, maximum data transfer rates and current data transfer rates may be monitored for MCDN <b>400</b>, or selected portions thereof, such as for network segments associated with one or more DSLAMs <b>410</b>. In one embodiment, application server <b>150</b> may query DSLAM <b>410</b> and store a record of data transfer rate values using database server <b>190</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A maximum data transfer rate (i.e., bit rate) may be determined during a reinitialization of LT link <b>426</b> between CPE at client <b>120</b> and port <b>424</b>. The reinitialization may include an arbitration process, during which a maximum bit rate for LT link <b>426</b> is established. The maximum bit rate may be recorded at client <b>120</b> and/or at DSLAM <b>410</b>. The maximum bit rate may change after a subsequent reinitialization. A current data transfer rate may be recorded in real time by client <b>120</b> and/or DSLAM <b>410</b>, based on effective network traffic or network usage associated with respective MCDN clients <b>120</b>. It is noted that data transfer rates may be determined for upstream traffic (i.e., from client <b>120</b> to DSLAM <b>410</b> and beyond) and/or for downstream traffic (i.e., from DSLAM <b>410</b> to client <b>120</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The record of data transfer rate values may be accessed for one or more MCDN clients <b>120</b>. A server may be used to analyze the accessed record in order to determine whether a ratio of a current bit rate to a maximum bit rate falls below a predetermined threshold value. The ratio may be determined for MCDN clients <b>120</b> associated with one or more MCDN nodes (e.g., DSLAM <b>410</b>). In certain embodiments, the threshold value may be about fifty percent (50%), for example between forty-eight percent (48%) and fifty-two percent (52%), or between forty-five percent (45%) and fifty-five percent (55%). When an MCDN node is determined to have a ratio below the predetermined threshold value, the MCDN node may be designated as a &#x201c;degraded node,&#x201d; and then be subject to further scrutiny, such as enhanced surveillance by an MCDN operator. It is further noted that the monitoring of data transfer rates may result in a ratio that is greater than the predetermined threshold value for the MCDN node. In this instance, the MCDN node may be designated as a &#x201c;normal node,&#x201d; which may indicate that the MCDN node is operating within an acceptable performance range. A degraded node may be associated with a higher value for a &#x201c;mitigation priority,&#x201d; which may be used by the MCDN service provider to prioritize and/or classify MCDN nodes for network service operations. A normal node may be associated with a lower mitigation priority.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this manner, network impairment may be detected before becoming evident to MCDN clients <b>120</b> and/or MCDN service provider <b>121</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), such that negative impacts to network performance may be proactively identified and rectified, resulting in significant advantages for all stakeholders associated with MCDN <b>400</b>. The methods described herein may also enable MCDN service provider <b>121</b> to allocate constrained resources for network service operations to degraded nodes, while limiting resources allocated to normal nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is noted that the determined ratio may be associated with a particular MCDN sub-node included in DSLAM <b>410</b>-<b>1</b>. In one embodiment, the determined ratio may be associated with a particular shelf <b>420</b> or card <b>422</b>, and is collectively obtained for all representative MCDN clients associated with the particular shelf <b>410</b> or card <b>422</b>. In other embodiments, the determined ratio is specific to a given MCDN client, such as client <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>, and is thus correspondingly associated with port <b>424</b>-<b>1</b>, LT link <b>426</b>-<b>1</b>, and/or CPE at client <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> (i.e., gateway <b>123</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>)). In certain embodiments, the determined ratio may be associated with a device parameter associated with a particular network device, such as a CPE device or port <b>424</b>. Thus, the detected network impairment may be associated with at least one MCDN node and/or MCDN sub-node.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A number of MCDN clients <b>120</b> associated with the degraded node(s) may then be subjected to enhanced surveillance, such as further network diagnostics. The enhanced surveillance may result in one or more additional network operations being performed on the degraded node, such as, but not limited to, triggering additional measurements, broadcasting an alarm over the MCDN, initiating a service call, performing a network diagnostic, assessing physical network connections, and determining line characteristics for individual MCDN clients coupled to the degraded node. Examples of line characteristics may include specific counters or measures for: electromagnetic interference; code violations; errored time; severely errored time; loss of signal; loss of frame; unavailable time; uplink driven link reinitializations; and failed reinitializations, among other values.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The results of the enhanced surveillance may result in localization of a source of the network impairment. The source may be one of the MCDN clients <b>120</b> in the community, or may be associated with multiple MCDN clients <b>120</b>, such as card <b>422</b> or shelf <b>420</b>. The source may be determined to be external to MCDN <b>400</b>, such as a piece of equipment operated by an external entity. The source of the network impairment may also be a transmission line coupled to DSLAM <b>410</b>, such as LT link <b>426</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The enhanced surveillance may include issuing a field service ticket for dispatching a work crew to a DSLAM associated with a degraded node. The service ticket may result in further diagnosis of the DSLAM, or identification of an external source of the network impairment. The results of the network diagnostic may be recorded, for example, along with the service ticket and/or with other documentation.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When a service request from a user of MCDN client <b>120</b> is received, for example, while network diagnostics on the degraded node are being performed, at least one user of a group of MCDN clients <b>120</b> associated with the degraded node may be notified that an impairment has been identified and/or is under investigation. In certain embodiments, a priority of subsequent service requests by MCDN clients associated with a degraded node may be modified. For example, when enhanced surveillance of the degraded node is being performed, incoming service requests may be lowered in priority until the network impairment has been remediated. In this manner, incoming service requests may be efficiently combined (or reduced) to reduce network maintenance workload, while improving the quality of service to clients <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an embodiment of method <b>500</b> for managing performance of an MCDN is illustrated in flow chart form. In one embodiment, method <b>500</b> may be performed by network performance monitoring and management <b>710</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) in conjunction with MCDN <b>100</b> and <b>400</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>). Method <b>500</b> may also involve functionality provided by DSLAM <b>410</b> and CPE <b>122</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>). It is noted that certain operations described in method <b>500</b> may be optional or may be rearranged in different embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In method <b>500</b>, respective average values, for one or more MCDN clients coupled to an MCDN node, of a maximum data transfer rate and a current data transfer rate may be monitored (operation <b>502</b>). The MCDN clients may be associated with one or more MCDN nodes. A ratio of the current data transfer rate to the maximum data transfer rate may be determined (operation <b>504</b>). A server may be used to determine the ratio. The ratio may be determined using the average values for a plurality of MCDN clients, or for values for individual MCDN clients. Then, a decision may be made whether the ratio is less than about one-half (&#xbd;) (operation <b>505</b>). If the result of operation <b>505</b> is NO, then the MCDN node may be designated as a normal node and a lower mitigation priority may be set for the MCDN node (operation <b>506</b>). If the result of operation <b>505</b> is YES, then the MCDN node may be designated as a degraded node and a higher mitigation priority may be set for the MCDN node (operation <b>507</b>). The mitigation priority may be set based on a value of the ratio determined in operation <b>504</b>, or other factors associated with network impairment.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, enhanced surveillance may be initiated for degraded nodes with a high mitigation priority (operation <b>508</b>). It is noted that, in operation <b>508</b>, a selection may be made among degraded nodes based on the mitigation priority. For example, degraded nodes with higher (or highest) mitigation priorities may be selected for enhanced surveillance. Then, a service request from a user of an MCDN client coupled to the degraded node may be received (operation <b>510</b>). The user may be notified that the degraded node has been identified (operation <b>512</b>). In certain embodiments, the service request may be associated with a service ticket, which may be used to combine service requests from other MCDN clients. The user may be notified of a status of the enhanced surveillance.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an embodiment of method <b>600</b> for managing performance of an MCDN is illustrated in flow chart form. In one embodiment, method <b>600</b> may be performed by recording historical network service parameters <b>708</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) in conjunction with MCDN <b>100</b> and <b>400</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>). Method <b>600</b> may also involve functionality provided by DSLAM <b>410</b> and CPE <b>122</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>). It is noted that certain operations described in method <b>600</b> may be optional or may be rearranged in different embodiments. It is further noted that while method <b>600</b> is described in terms of one or more MCDN clients coupled to an MCDN node, it will be understood that multiple instances of method <b>600</b> may be executed, either concurrently or simultaneously or in a combination thereof, for a plurality of MCDN clients and/or MCDN nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Method <b>600</b> may begin with obtaining maximum bit rates for one or more MCDN clients coupled to an MCDN node (operation <b>602</b>). Current bit rates for the MCDN clients may be obtained (operation <b>604</b>). Bit rates may be obtained by querying a DSLAM (or a sub-node therein) and/or by querying an MCDN client (or CPE associated therewith). Bit rates may also be queried from an MCDN database server, which is configured to collect a record of historical data transfer values for the MCDN clients. Individual and/or average maximum bit rates may be determined (operation <b>606</b>). Individual and/or average current bit rates may be determined (operation <b>608</b>). A ratio of the current bit rates to the maximum bit rates may be calculated for individual and/or average values (operation <b>610</b>). It is noted that individual values refer to values for a given MCDN client, while average values represent averages over a plurality of MCDN clients.</p>
