<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Positioning systems generally utilize natural or manmade signals to determine location. These positioning systems typically determine the location for the individual positioning system. However, these positioning systems are subject to errors in the position determination due to interference and limitations in the architecture/components when using an individual positioning system. Thus, a need exists in the art for improved position optimization systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Position optimization methods and apparatuses include technology that, generally, enables collaboration between cooperative users to generate a better absolute position estimate for each user utilizing relative positions shared among a group of users. The technology can include an optimization of each user's estimated positions in 3-dimensional space using relative position information from the group of users. The technology exchanges relative position information and/or identification information amongst the group of users and the computing devices of the group of users, collectively or individually, can refine the absolute positions of the users based on the exchanged relative and/or absolute position information.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One approach is a system that provides position optimization. The system includes a first device and a second device. The first device includes a first position determination module configured to determine position information associated with the first device, a first communication module configured to transmit the position information associated with the first device, transmit optimized position information associated with the first device, receive position information associated with the second device, and receive optimized position information associated with the second device, and a first position optimization module configured to automatically and iteratively optimize the position information associated with the first device based on the position information associated with the second device and the optimized position information associated with the second device. The second device includes a second position determination module configured to determine the position information associated with the second device, a second communication module configured to transmit the position information associated with the second device, transmit the optimized position information associated with the second device, receive the position information associated with the first device, and receive the optimized position information associated with the first device, and a second position optimization module configured to automatically and iteratively optimize the position information associated with the second device based on the position information associated with the first device and the optimized position information associated with the first device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another approach is a method for optimizing a position determination. The method includes (a) receiving, by a device, position information from at least one other device; (b) modifying, by the device, an initial position based on the position information from the at least one other device to form a refined position; (c) transmitting, by the device, the refined position to the at least one other device; and (d) revising, by the device, the refined position based on refined position information received from the at least one other device to form a final position.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another approach is a computer program product for optimizing a position determination. The computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product includes instructions being operable to cause a data processing apparatus to: receive position information from at least one other device; modify an initial position based on the position information from the at least one other device to form a refined position; transmit the refined position to the at least one other device; and revise the refined position based on refined position information received from the at least one other device to form a final position.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In other examples, any of the approaches above can include one or more of the following features.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some examples, the system includes a plurality of other devices, each of the plurality of other devices including a position optimization module configured to automatically and iteratively optimize position information based on received position information and received optimized position information, wherein the received position information and the received optimized position information received from the first device, the second device, the plurality of other devices, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other examples, the optimized position information associated with the first device includes optimized position locations of the first device and the second device and the optimized position information associated with the second device includes optimized second position locations of the first device and the second device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some examples, the first position optimization module is further configured to automatically and iteratively optimize the position information associated with the first device based on a plurality of optimized position information, the plurality of optimized position information received from a plurality of devices; and wherein the second position optimization module further configured to automatically and iteratively optimize the position information associated with the second device based on the plurality of optimized position information.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In other examples, the first device is a first mobile device and the second device is a second mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some examples, the method further includes (e) determining, by the device, if the refined position is less than a position tolerance; and (f) repeating, by the device, steps (c), (d), and (e) based on the determination in step (e).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In other examples, the method further includes (a-2) receiving, by a second device, additional position information from the at least one other device or the first device; (b-2) modifying, by the second device, an initial position of the second device based on the additional position information from the at least one other device or the first device to form a refined position of the second device; (c-2) transmitting, by the second device, the refined position of the second device to the other plurality of devices or the first device; and (d-2) revising, by the second device, the refined position based on additional refined position information received from the at least one other device or the first device to form a final position.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other examples, the method further includes separating, by the device, the modifying steps (b) and (b-2) and the revising steps (d) (d-2) based on resource availability of a plurality of device; and transmitting, by the device, the separation of the modifying steps and the revising steps to the plurality of devices.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some examples, the resource availability includes processor availability, memory availability, network availability, power availability, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In other examples, the position information includes a position of the at least one other device, a range between the at least one other device and the device, a directional vector between the at least one other device and the device, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The position optimization techniques described herein can provide one or more of the following advantages. An advantage of the technology is that the position optimization described herein uses position collaboration between group users to refine and improve individual absolute position estimates, thereby increasing the efficiency of the positioning systems and increasing the accuracy of the position determination. Another advantage of the technology is that the position optimization described herein can use other positioning systems (e.g., GPS) and optimizes the position determination from the other positioning systems, thereby increasing the accuracy of the technology and decreasing the cost to deploy the technology.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another advantage of the technology is that the position optimization described herein can use localized or distributed processing to balance resource usage, thereby increasing the flexibility of the technology across multiple platforms (e.g., mobile devices, fixed-position devices, battery-operated devices, etc.). Another advantage of the technology is that the position optimization described herein can be utilized on multiple, non-stationary (dynamic), non-homogenous platforms, thereby increasing the available environments for use of the technology and decreasing the implementation costs of the technology.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The position optimization method and apparatus includes technology that, generally, optimizes a group of user's estimated positions in 3-dimensional space (e.g., absolute position in 3-dimensional space) using relative position information from a group of users (i.e., where is a user relative to the other users). The technology exchanges relative position information and/or identification information amongst the group of users and the computing devices of the group of users, collectively or individually, can refine the absolute positions of the users (i.e., where is a user in a global coordinate system) based on the exchanged relative and/or absolute position information. In other words, the technology can determine the associated computing devices initial position, refine the initial position to form a refined position based on the exchanged position information, and refine the refined position to form a final position based on the refined positions exchanged among the group of users. The technology advantageously utilizes position information from a group of users, thereby reducing the complexity and cost associated with correcting errors and uncertainty in global positioning systems and reducing the potential for interference to the global positioning systems. The technology can also determine a user's absolute position when that user only has relative position knowledge to one or more users and does not have access to a global positioning system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The technology can refine individual absolute position estimates (also referred to an initial position) using group knowledge of relative location (i.e., where is a computing device relative to the other computing devices) to improve the absolute position determination in 3-dimensional space, thereby advantageously increasing the accuracy of the positioning systems. The technology can be utilized to improve the accuracy of other positioning systems and/or when other positioning systems are inaccurate and/or unavailable via the collaboration among the group of users.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The technology generally utilizes a positioning system (e.g., GPS, EGNOS, etc.) and a set of computing devices. Each of the computing devices in the set of computing devices is associated with a member within a group of collaborative users (also referred to as group of users). Each of the computing devices includes a positioning system receiver (e.g., receives information to determine absolute position information), a user-to-user communication transceiver (e.g., receives and/or transmits position information), and a processor for determining and optimizing an absolute position of the computing device. In some examples, one or more of the computing devices in the set of computing devices include a positioning system receiver and a user-to-user communication transceiver and another computing device determines and optimizes the absolute position for the one or more computing devices. In other examples, one or more of the computing devices in the set of computing devices include a user-to-user communication transceiver and another computing device estimates and optimizes the absolute position for the one or more computing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, in operation, each of the user's computing devices determines an optimized position estimate of the computing device utilizing absolute and relative position information from the other cooperative computing devices within the group. The user's computing device determines a relative position with respect to some or all other members of the group (e.g., computing device A is 10 meters from computing device B, 45 meters southeast of computing device C, etc.). In general, the relative position between users is determined in a three dimensional space. The relative position information can be distance only (e.g., 10 meters, 1,000 meters, etc.) or a directional connected graph (e.g., range, azimuth angle, and elevation angle). Each user's computing device can iteratively refine the respective absolute position estimate based on the relative and absolute positions of the group of users. For example, the user's computing device can begin with an initial position location, optimize the initial position location to generate a refined position location, and optimize the refined position location to generate a final position location.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As another example, in operation, the technology generally updates absolute position estimates of user's computing devices based on the relative positions between the computing devices within a group. In other words, the technology determines measured absolute position estimates for each computing device and calculates, by one or more of the computing devices, relative positions between the computing devices. The technology then compares the calculated relative positions to the measured relative positions. The technology minimizes an error between the calculated and measured relative positions using a variety of methods that update the absolute position estimates such the absolute position estimates are better matches to the measured relative positions. The error minimization methods can include: (1) iterative refinement, and/or (2) group constrained.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, each of the computing devices determines an optimized position estimate for each member of the group using an iterative refinement method. The iterative refinement process can require a plurality of iterations between the group members to determine the respective absolute positions for each of the group members in which the absolute position of one or more members is updated sequentially. The relative position information is advantageously used to refine absolute position estimates for all users that is more accurate than any individual solution, thereby increasing the efficiency of the positioning aspects of the technology.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In other examples, one or a subset of the user's computing devices determines the absolute position for each of the group members via group constrained processing. In this example, new absolute positions for all users are simultaneously obtained. In some examples, each of the user's computing devices determines the absolute position for each of the group members via the group constrained processing. The group constrained processing is utilized to determine the absolute positions for all or part of the group members at the same time. In other words, in the group constrained processing, a best absolute position for a subset or all of the group members is determined simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some examples, the processing (e.g., iterative refinement, group constrained, etc.) can either be localized to a single computing device that provides a solution to all members within the group and/or distributed amongst a subset or all computing devices that collaborate to solve for the optimized solution. For example, a fixed computing device attached to a non-battery power source processes all parts of the position optimization for all members. As another example, the processing of the parts of the position optimization is split between the computing devices with the largest battery lives (e.g., 90% battery life capacity remaining, 60 watt-hours, etc.) and/or any other computing resource (e.g., available memory, fastest processor, etc.).</p>
