<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a power transmitting device for a hybrid vehicle including an internal combustion engine and an electric motor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is a power transmitting device for a hybrid vehicle that is capable of combining motive power output from an internal combustion engine and motive power output from an electric motor and transmitting the combined motive power to driving wheels and capable of performing a regenerative operation in an electric motor. As this type of approach, there has been conventionally known a method of decelerating or accelerating the motive power input from the output of the internal combustion engine and once transmitting the motive power to two shafts parallel to an output shaft of the internal combustion engine and thereafter returning the motive power to an output shaft coaxial with the output shaft of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, the transmission described in Patent Document 1 has two shafts parallel to an output shaft of an internal combustion engine. Each of the two shafts is connected to the output shaft of the internal combustion engine via a clutch, and an electric motor is connected to one end of one of the two shafts (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;first shaft&#x201d;). In addition, on the first shaft, there is disposed a synchronizer, which selectively connects a plurality of even-numbered stage gears to the first shaft. On the other of the two shafts (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;second shaft&#x201d;), there is disposed a synchronizer, which selectively connects a plurality of odd-numbered stage gears and reverse stage gears to the second shaft. The gears fixed to the output shaft are engaged with the even-numbered stage gears and the odd-numbered stage gears in common.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-89594</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The transmission described in Patent Document 1, however, has a disadvantage that the length of the transmission increases in the axial direction according to the number of stages and therefore it is difficult to install the transmission in the case of a small space for housing the transmission in the vehicle. Particularly, when the engine is mounted transversely (the shaft length is oriented in the vehicle width direction) in an FF layout vehicle, it is difficult to install the transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above background, the present invention has been made. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a power transmitting device for a hybrid vehicle, which includes an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, the power transmitting device capable of reducing the axial length.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a power transmitting device for a hybrid vehicle having an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, the power transmitting device including: a first main input shaft, which is disposed parallel to an internal combustion engine output shaft, to which motive power is input from the internal combustion engine, and which is connected to the internal combustion engine output shaft by placing a first make-and-break device in a connected state; a second main input shaft, which is disposed coaxially with the first main input shaft and connected to the internal combustion engine output shaft by placing the second make-and-break device in a connected state; an intermediate input shaft disposed parallel to the first main input shaft; a sub input shaft disposed parallel to the intermediate input shaft; an output shaft, which is disposed parallel to the first main input shaft and outputs motive power to a driven unit via a counter shaft; a first gear group, which is disposed on the first main input shaft and is composed of a plurality of gears selectively connected to the output shaft via a first synchronizer; a second gear group, which is disposed on the sub input shaft and is composed of a plurality of gears selectively connecting the sub input shaft to the output shaft via a second synchronizer; a third gear group, which is fixed to the output shaft and is composed of a plurality of gears engaged with the gears of the first gear group and the gears of the second gear group in common; and a differential rotation mechanism composed of a first rotating element, a second rotating element, and a third rotating element so as to be rotatable differentially with respect to one another, wherein: the first rotating element is connected to the first main input shaft and the electric motor; the second rotating element is connected to the first gear group; the third rotating element is connected to a fixing mechanism capable of placing the third rotating element in a fixed state; and the second rotating element decelerates the motive power transmitted from the first rotating element by using a reaction force from the third rotating element, which is placed in the fixed state by the fixing mechanism (First aspect of the invention).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the first aspect of the invention, with the fixing mechanism operated so as to place the third rotating element in the fixed state and the first synchronizer operated so as to connect any gear of the first gear group to the output/input shaft, the first make-and-break device is placed in the connected state, and then the motive power of the internal combustion engine is transmitted to the first rotating element via the first main input shaft and/or the motive power of the electric motor is transmitted to the first rotating element. At this time, the second rotating element of the power combining mechanism decelerates and outputs the motive power, which has been transmitted to the first rotating element. Then, the motive power is output to the driven unit via the first sub input shaft and the output shaft. In this manner, in the first aspect of the invention, the vehicle is able to start and run with the first synchronizer and the second synchronizer placed in the neutral state. Therefore, in the case of having the same number of variable speed gear pairs as those of the transmission described in Patent Document 1, the power transmitting device has one more variable speed stage, thereby enabling a reduction in the axial length.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, in the above state, the electric motor is able to perform the regenerative operation by using the motive power transmitted from the internal combustion engine to the first rotating element via the first main input shaft. In this manner, in the first aspect of the invention, the vehicle is able to start and run with the first synchronizer and the second synchronizer placed in the neutral state while the electric motor performs the regenerative operation. Therefore, it is possible to achieve a mode of the start and running different from the mode of the start and running described in the preceding paragraph. Further, the electric motor performs the regenerative operation in this mode, and therefore the mode is favorable in the case where the battery charge level drops down or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides a power transmitting device for a hybrid vehicle having an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, the power transmitting device including: a main input shaft, to which motive power is input from the internal combustion engine; a first sub input shaft, which is disposed parallel to the main input shaft and is selectively connected to the main input shaft via a pair of reduction gears by a first make-and-break device; a second sub input shaft, which is disposed parallel to the main input shaft and selectively connected to the main input shaft via a pair of speed increasing gears by a second make-and-break device; an output shaft, which is disposed coaxially with the main input shaft and outputs motive power to a driven unit via a counter shaft; a first gear group, which is disposed on the first sub input shaft and is composed of a plurality of gears selectively connected to the first sub input shaft via a first synchronizer; a second gear group, which is disposed on the second sub input shaft and is composed of a plurality of gears selectively connected to the second sub input shaft via a second synchronizer; a third gear group, which is fixed to the output shaft and is composed of a plurality of gears engaged with the gears of the first gear group and the gears of the second gear group in common; and a differential rotation mechanism composed of a first rotating element, a second rotating element, and a third rotating element so as to be rotatable differentially with respect to one another, wherein: one of the first sub input shaft and the second sub input shaft is connected to the first rotating element and the other is able to transmit motive power to the output shaft without using the differential rotation mechanism; the first rotating element is connected to the main input shaft; the third rotating element is connected to the electric motor; and the second rotating element combines motive power transmitted from the first rotating element with motive power transmitted from the third rotating element and transmits the combined motive power to the output shaft (Second aspect of the invention).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the second aspect of the invention, the first make-and-break device or the second make-and-break device is set to the connected state so that the first sub input shaft or the second sub input shaft connected to the first rotating element (hereinafter, the sub input shaft is referred to as &#x201c;connected sub input shaft&#x201d;) is connected to the main input shaft. In addition, with the first synchronizer and the second synchronizer set to the neutral state in which the first sub input shaft and the second sub input shaft are not connected to any gear, the motive power is input from the internal combustion engine to the main input shaft and the electric motor performs the power operation so that the third rotating element rotates. At this time, the second rotating element of the differential rotation mechanism combines the motive power transmitted from the internal combustion engine to the first rotating element via the connected sub input shaft with the motive power transmitted from the electric motor to the third rotating element and transmits the combined motive power to the output shaft, and the combined motive power is output to the driven unit. In this manner, in the second aspect of the invention, the vehicle is able to start and run with the first synchronizer and the second synchronizer placed in the neutral state. Therefore, in the case of having the same number of variable speed gear pairs as those of the transmission described in Patent Document 1, the power transmitting device has one more variable speed stage, thereby enabling a reduction in the axial length.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, in the above state, the motive power transmitted from the internal combustion engine to the first rotating element via the connected sub input shaft is also able to be distributed to the second rotating element and the third rotating element. At this time, the motive power is output to the driven unit via the second rotating element and the electric motor performs the regenerative operation via the third rotating element. In this manner, in the second aspect of the invention, the vehicle is able to start and run with the first synchronizer and the second synchronizer placed in the neutral state while the electric motor performs the regenerative operation. Therefore, it is possible to achieve a mode of the start and running different from the mode of the start and running described in the preceding paragraph. Further, the electric motor performs the regenerative operation in this mode, and therefore the mode is favorable in the case where the battery charge level drops down or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, in the second aspect of the invention, preferably the main input shaft is disposed parallel to the internal combustion engine output shaft, to which motive power is input from the internal combustion engine, and is composed of a first main input shaft connected to the internal combustion engine output shaft by placing the first make-and-break device in a connected state and a second main input shaft, which is disposed coaxially with the first main input shaft and is connected to the internal combustion engine output shaft by placing the second make-and-break device in the connected state, and any one of the first main input shaft and the second main input shaft is connected to the first rotating element, by which any one of the first sub input shaft and the second sub input shaft is connected to the first rotating element.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this case, the first main input shaft and the second main input shaft constituting the main input shaft are disposed coaxially with each other. Therefore, the first make-and-break device and the second make-and-break device are able to be disposed adjacent to each other, thereby enabling the power transmitting device for a hybrid vehicle to be further downsized. Moreover, a device, which operates the first make-and-break device and the second make-and-break device, is able to be used in common, thereby enabling a reduction in cost.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, in the second aspect of the invention, preferably the power transmitting device has a reverse gear mechanism, which selectively connects the pair of reduction gears and the pair of speed increasing gears to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this case, the first make-and-break device or the second make-and-break device is set to the connected state so that the connected sub input shaft is connected to the main input shaft. In addition, with the first synchronizer and the second synchronizer set to the neutral state in which the first sub input shaft and the second sub input shaft are not connected to any gear and the reverse gear mechanism connected, the motive power is input from the internal combustion engine to the main input shaft and the motive power is applied from the electric motor to rotate the third rotating element. At this time, the second rotating element of the differential rotation mechanism combines the motive power in the reverse rotation direction transmitted from the internal combustion engine to the first rotating element via the connected sub input shaft with the motive power transmitted from the electric motor to the third rotating element and transmits the combined motive power to the output shaft, and the combined motive power is output to the driven unit. In this manner, in this invention, the vehicle is able to move backward with the first synchronizer and the second synchronizer placed in the neutral state. In addition, the reverse gear mechanism is able to be disposed parallel to the main output shaft as described above. This enables a reduction in the axial length by the reverse stage in comparison with the transmission described in Patent Document 1.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Moreover, in the above state, the motive power transmitted from the internal combustion engine to the first rotating element via the connected sub input shaft is also able to be distributed to the second rotating element and the third rotating element. At this time, the motive power is output to the driven unit via the second rotating element and the electric motor performs the regenerative operation via the third rotating element. In this manner, in this invention, the vehicle is able to move backward with the first synchronizer and the second synchronizer placed in the neutral state while the electric motor performs the regenerative operation. Therefore, it is possible to achieve a mode of moving backward different from the mode of moving backward described in the preceding paragraph. Further, the electric motor performs the regenerative operation in this mode, and therefore the mode is favorable in the case where the battery charge level drops down or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover, in the first and second aspects of the invention, preferably at least one of the first make-and-break element and the second make-and-break element is a dry clutch.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">This enables a reduction in make-and-break time and a reduction in size of the make-and-break elements in comparison with the case where the first make-and-break element and the second make-and-break element are wet clutches. A shock caused by a change in motive power generated by engine braking or the like is able to be reduced by controlling the electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, in the first and second aspects of the invention, preferably the differential rotation mechanism is a planetary gear unit coaxially having a sun gear, a ring gear, and a carrier, which rotatably supports a plurality of planetary gears engaged with the sun gear and the ring gear between the sun gear and the ring gear, as three single-pinion type rotating elements, and the first rotating element is the sun gear, the second rotating element is the carrier, and the third rotating element is the ring gear.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this case, the differential rotation mechanism is able to be formed in a simple configuration, thereby enabling downsizing and a decrease in cost. Further, the configuration enables a distribution of the motive power and an increase in transmission efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Moreover, in the first and second aspects of the invention, preferably the gears of the first gear group engage with the gears of the third gear group to form a plurality of odd-numbered speed gear pairs and the gears of the second gear group engage with the gears of the third gear group to form a plurality of even-numbered speed gear pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this case, a state in which the vehicle starts and runs with the first synchronizer and the second synchronizer placed in the neutral state is able to be defined as a first speed stage.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Moreover, in the first and second aspects of the invention, preferably the gears of the first gear group engage with the gears of the third gear group to form a plurality of even-numbered speed gear pairs and the gears of the second gear group engage with the gears of the third gear group to form a plurality of odd-numbered speed gear pairs.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, in the first and second aspects of the invention, preferably a part or all of a rotating body, a static part, and an armature winding, which constitute the electric motor are disposed so as to be superposed over the differential rotation mechanism in a direction perpendicular to the direction of axis of the output shaft.</p>

Then, the motive power output from the engine <b>2</b> is transmitted to the driving wheels <b>4</b> and <b>4</b> passing through the first main input shaft <b>11</b>, the sun gear <b>9</b><i>s</i>, and the carrier <b>9</b><i>c </i>and thereafter through the third speed gear pair <b>20</b>, the output shaft <b>17</b>, and the like, by which the first speed stage is established. Therefore, if the power transmitting device has the same number of variable speed gear pairs as that of the transmission described in Patent Document 1, the power transmitting device has one more variable speed stage, thereby enabling a reduction in the axial length. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a collinear diagram with the forward direction and the reverse direction represented by &#x201c;+&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2212;,&#x201d; respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Subsequently, the operation of the power transmitting device <b>50</b> according to this embodiment will be described. The power transmitting device <b>50</b> has a wide variety of operation modes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> visually illustrate the operating states of the power transmitting device <b>50</b> in the various operation modes. In these diagrams, the first clutch C<b>1</b>, the second clutch C<b>2</b>, and the auxiliary device clutch <b>33</b> are each represented by a thick line in the case where the operating state of each of the first clutch C<b>1</b>, the second clutch C<b>2</b>, and the auxiliary device clutch <b>33</b> is the connected state (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;ON state&#x201d;), while the clutches C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, and <b>33</b> are each represented by a normal solid line in the case where the operating state is the disconnected state (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;OFF state&#x201d;). Moreover, in the respective operation modes, the constituents of the power transmitting device <b>50</b>, which rotate with being connected to other constituents, are represented by thick lines.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In this embodiment, the main operation modes of the power transmitting device <b>50</b> include an engine running mode in which the vehicle runs with only the engine <b>2</b> as a power generation source of the vehicle, an EV running mode in which the vehicle runs with only the electric motor <b>3</b> as a power generation source of the vehicle, and an HEV running mode in which the vehicle runs with both of the engine <b>2</b> and the electric motor <b>3</b> driven. The HEV running mode includes an assist running mode (combined running mode) in which the vehicle runs with the output from the electric motor <b>3</b> added to the output from the engine <b>2</b> and a regenerative running mode in which the vehicle runs with the output from the engine <b>2</b> supplied to the electric motor <b>3</b> while the electric motor <b>3</b> performs the regenerative operation. In the regenerative running mode, the battery <b>7</b> is charged by the regenerative operation of the electric motor <b>3</b>. In the EV running mode, the electric motor <b>3</b> outputs motive power by consuming the electric energy accumulated in the battery <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Further, in this embodiment, the ECU <b>8</b> sets requested power (requested driving force) of the vehicle by using a predetermined map or the like on the basis of an accelerator manipulated variable, a vehicle speed, or the like of the vehicle and selects each running mode or variable speed stage according to the requested power. Further, the ECU <b>8</b> controls the power transmitting device <b>1</b> according to the selected running mode, variable speed stage, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">For example, the ECU <b>8</b> selects the assist running mode when the motive power output from the engine <b>2</b> and input to the differential rotation mechanism <b>9</b> (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;appropriate operating power&#x201d;) is less than the requested power when the engine <b>2</b> is operated in an appropriate operating region such as, for example, a region in which the fuel consumption is favorable. In this instance, the ECU <b>8</b> controls the battery <b>7</b> to supply the motive power to offset the shortage against the requested power. If there is a need to operate the electric motor <b>3</b> at an output or speed exceeding the rated output or the maximum rpm in order to offset the shortage, however, the electric motor <b>3</b> is operated at the rated output or the maximum rpm and the output from the engine <b>2</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Moreover, when the appropriate operating power exceeds the requested power, the ECU <b>8</b> selects the regenerative running mode to charge the battery <b>7</b> with differential motive power (energy) obtained by decreasing a transmission loss caused by gears or the like from the appropriate operating power. Also when the charge level (SOC) of the battery <b>7</b> is low, the ECU <b>8</b> selects the regenerative running mode in order to advance the charge of the battery <b>7</b> and increases the output from the engine <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">[Startup at First Speed Stage, Running]</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an operating state of a power transmitting device <b>50</b> at a first speed stage (a pseudo first speed stage). The first speed stage is a variable speed stage having a gear ratio lower than that of a second speed stage described later. In the advancing state of the first speed stage, the ECU <b>8</b> sets the first clutch C<b>1</b> to the ON state and sets (activates or maintains) the first synchronizer S<b>1</b>, the second synchronizer S<b>2</b>, and the reverse synchronizer SR to the neutral state.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Thereby, the motive power (rpm Ne) from the output shaft <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>2</b> is transmitted to the sun gear <b>9</b><i>s </i>via the first clutch C<b>1</b> and the first main input shaft <b>51</b>, but motive power is not transmitted from the first sub input shaft <b>53</b> and the second sub input shaft <b>54</b> to the output shaft <b>57</b>. At this time, the output shaft <b>57</b> is connected to the axles <b>31</b> and <b>31</b> via the counter shaft <b>64</b>. Therefore, if the driving wheels <b>4</b> and <b>4</b> remain stationary, the frictional resistances thereof inhibit the carrier <b>9</b><i>c </i>from rotating even if the carrier <b>9</b><i>c </i>begins to rotate by the forward rotation of the sun gear <b>9</b><i>s</i>. Therefore, as indicated by the solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the ring gear <b>9</b><i>r </i>rotates in the reverse direction at rpm Nr and the electric motor <b>3</b> performs the regenerative operation to charge the battery <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In this manner, the electric motor <b>3</b> performs the regenerative operation when the engine <b>2</b> is in an idling state and runs idle, which enables the battery <b>7</b> to be charged with the motive power output from the engine <b>2</b> as electric energy, which leads to energy saving. Further, although conventionally a clutch has been provided with a sliding mechanism to absorb the motive power generated by the engine <b>2</b>, the present invention eliminates the need to provide the sliding mechanism in the first clutch C<b>1</b> and the second clutch C<b>2</b>, thereby enabling a reduction in size of the clutches C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a collinear diagram with the forward direction indicated by &#x201c;+&#x201d; and the reverse direction indicated by &#x201c;&#x2212;.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In this state, the ECU <b>8</b> causes the battery <b>7</b> to supply electric power to the stator <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the electric motor <b>3</b> to rotate the rotating magnetic field generated in the stator <b>3</b><i>b </i>in the forward direction. This transmits a torque acting so as to rotate the rotor <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the forward direction from the stator <b>3</b><i>b</i>, by which the motive power acts in a direction that causes the ring gear <b>9</b><i>r </i>to rotate in the forward direction. Then, the planetary gear <b>9</b><i>p </i>rotates in the forward direction by means of the motive power for the engine <b>2</b> to rotate the sun gear <b>9</b><i>s </i>in the forward direction and the motive power for the electric motor <b>3</b> to rotate the ring gear <b>9</b><i>r </i>in the forward direction, and as indicated by the long dashed short dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the carrier <b>9</b><i>c </i>rotates in the forward direction against the frictional resistances. By interlocking with the forward rotation of the carrier <b>9</b><i>c</i>, the output shaft <b>57</b> rotates in the forward direction and thereby the axles <b>31</b> and <b>31</b> rotate in the forward direction. Thereby, the driving wheels <b>4</b> and <b>4</b> rotate in the advancing direction of the vehicle in the advancing state at the first speed stage in which the motive power of the engine <b>2</b> is combined with the motive power of the electric motor <b>3</b>. In this manner, the power transmitting device <b>50</b> is able to start and run the vehicle at the first speed stage in the assist running mode.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">On the other hand, if the motive power (the rpm Ne) from the output shaft <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>2</b> increases from the above state, the carrier <b>9</b><i>c </i>rotates in the forward direction against the frictional resistances with the ring gear <b>9</b><i>r </i>rotating in the reverse direction as indicated by the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The output shaft <b>57</b> rotates in the forward direction by interlocking with the forward rotation of the carrier <b>9</b><i>c </i>and the axles <b>31</b> and <b>31</b> rotate in the forward direction. At this time, the ring gear <b>9</b><i>r </i>rotates in the reverse direction and therefore the electric motor <b>2</b> is in the regenerative operation state, by which the battery <b>7</b> is charged. Thereby, the electric motor <b>3</b> performs the regenerative operation, while the driving wheels <b>4</b> and <b>4</b> rotate in the advancing direction of the vehicle in the advancing state at the first speed stage only with the motive power of the engine <b>2</b>. In this manner, the power transmitting device <b>50</b> is able to start and run the vehicle at the first speed stage in the regenerative running mode.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Therefore, the power transmitting device <b>50</b> is able to start and run the vehicle at the first speed stage in different running modes, namely the assist running mode and the regenerative running mode. As a result, the power transmitting device <b>50</b> is able to use the running mode at the startup properly according to the requested power, the charge level of the battery <b>7</b>, or the like. Along with the sun gear <b>9</b><i>s</i>, the first main input shaft <b>51</b> rotates in the forward direction and the motive power is transmitted to the input shaft <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the auxiliary device <b>5</b> via the pair of reduction gears <b>55</b>, the first sub input shaft <b>53</b>, the belt mechanism <b>71</b>, and the auxiliary device clutch <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In this manner, the power transmitting device is able to be started and run with the first synchronizer S<b>1</b> and the second synchronizer S<b>2</b> placed in the neutral state. Therefore, if the power transmitting device has the same number of variable speed gear pairs as that of the transmission described in Patent Document 1, the power transmitting device has one more variable speed stage, thereby enabling a reduction in the axial length.</p>

<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Thereby, the motive power from the output shaft <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>2</b> is transmitted to the first main input shaft <b>51</b> via the second clutch C<b>2</b>, the second main input shaft <b>52</b>, the pair of speed increasing gears <b>56</b>, the second sub input shaft <b>54</b>, and the pairs of reverse gears <b>69</b> and <b>70</b>, and the first main input shaft <b>51</b> rotates in the reverse direction.

<p id="p-0238" num="0237"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates the operating state of the power transmitting device <b>50</b> at the third speed stage in the EV running mode. At the third speed stage in the EV running mode, the ECU <b>8</b> sets the first clutch C<b>1</b> and the second clutch C<b>2</b> to the OFF state, the first synchronizer S<b>1</b> to the third speed stage established state, and the second synchronizer S<b>2</b> and the reverse synchronizer SR to the neutral state, and sets the electric motor <b>3</b> so as to cause the rotor <b>3</b><i>a </i>to rotate in the forward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Thereby, when the ring gear <b>9</b><i>r </i>rotates in the forward direction along with the rotor <b>3</b><i>a</i>, the carrier <b>9</b><i>c</i>, which receives the rotation torque from the ring gear <b>9</b><i>r</i>, begins to rotate in the forward direction. Further, the carrier <b>9</b><i>c </i>is connected to the sun gear <b>9</b><i>s </i>via the output shaft <b>57</b>, the third speed gear pair <b>59</b>, the first sub input shaft <b>53</b>, the pair of reduction gears <b>55</b>, and the first main input shaft <b>51</b>, and therefore the sun gear <b>9</b><i>s </i>begins to rotate in the forward direction. Thereby, the carrier <b>9</b><i>c </i>rotates in the forward direction and the rotation torque thereof is transmitted to the driving wheels <b>4</b> and <b>4</b> via the output shaft <b>57</b>, the pair of counter gears <b>65</b>, the counter shaft <b>64</b>, the differential gear unit <b>30</b>, and the axles <b>31</b> and <b>31</b>. Thus, the driving wheels <b>4</b> and <b>4</b> rotate in the advancing direction of the vehicle only with the motive power of the electric motor <b>3</b>. At this time, the output shaft <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>2</b> is disconnected from the first main input shaft <b>51</b> and the second main input shaft <b>52</b>. Therefore, in the EV running mode, the motive power is not transmitted from the electric motor <b>3</b> to the output shaft <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>2</b> and thus the engine <b>2</b> is prevented from remaining in drive.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Further, although not illustrated, the engine <b>2</b> is able to be started by the ECU <b>8</b> through setting the first clutch C<b>1</b> to the ON state when the vehicle is running at the third speed stage in the EV running mode.

Thereby, the combined motive power of the engine <b>2</b> and the electric motor <b>3</b> is transmitted to the driving wheels <b>4</b> and <b>4</b>, by which the third speed stage in the assist running mode is set.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Moreover, the engine <b>2</b> is able to be started by the ECU <b>8</b> through setting the first clutch C<b>1</b> to the ON state and setting the second synchronizer S<b>2</b> to the second speed stage established state or to the fourth speed stage established state when the vehicle is running at the third speed stage in the EV running mode. At this time, the third speed stage in preparation for the second speed stage or the third speed stage in preparation for the fourth speed stage in the HEV running mode is set.</p>

<p id="p-0243" num="0242"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates the operating state of the power transmitting device <b>50</b> at the fifth speed stage in the EV running mode. At the fifth speed stage in the EV running mode, the ECU <b>8</b> sets the first clutch C<b>1</b> and the second clutch C<b>2</b> to the OFF state, the first synchronizer S<b>1</b> to the fifth speed stage established state, and the second synchronizer S<b>2</b> and the reverse synchronizer SR to the neutral state, and sets the electric motor <b>3</b> so as to cause the rotor <b>3</b><i>a </i>to rotate in the forward direction.

<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, in the power transmitting device <b>80</b>, there is disposed a third speed gear <b>53</b><i>b</i>, which is connectable to a first sub input shaft <b>53</b>A via a first synchronizer S<b>1</b>A in the first sub input shaft <b>53</b>A, and is disposed a second speed gear <b>54</b><i>b</i>, which is connectable to a second sub input shaft <b>54</b>A via a second synchronizer S<b>2</b>A in the second sub input shaft <b>54</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Further, a first gear <b>57</b><i>a </i>is fixed to an output shaft <b>57</b>A. The first gear <b>57</b><i>a </i>engages with the third speed gear <b>53</b><i>b </i>and a second speed gear <b>54</b><i>b </i>in common, thereby constituting a third speed gear pair <b>59</b> and a second speed gear pair <b>62</b>, respectively. Moreover, the output shaft <b>57</b>A and the second sub input shaft <b>54</b>A are connected to each other via an even-numbered speed gear train <b>61</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Although the power transmitting device <b>80</b> does not have a fourth speed stage and a fifth speed stage, the power transmission of other variable speed stages and the like is the same as those in the power transmitting device <b>50</b> and therefore the description thereof is omitted here.
