<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from PCT/EP2009/062572, filed 29 Sep. 2009, which claims priority from European Application EP 08165487.3, filed 30 Sep. 2008.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a method and system for monitoring subsidence and/or rising of a waterbottom, such as an ocean floor, sea- or riverbed and/or the bottom of a lake.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is often desirable to accurately monitor subsidence and/or rising of a waterbottom for example in an area with tectonic activity and/or where crude oil and/or natural gas is produced from an underwater oil and/or natural gas containing formation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such case it is desirable to measure subsidence and/or rising of a large area of the waterbottom with high resolution and accuracy in the order of centimeters, or better. It would be possible to install an array of pressure sensors, which measure the ambient water pressure at the waterbottom to monitor subsidence and/or rising thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, tidal variations of waterdepth, variations of atmospheric pressure, waves and currents will generate significant variations of the measured pressure and if the pressure sensors are installed in a deepwater area, for example at a waterdepth of several kilometers the pressure sensors must be capable of withstanding pressure variations of several hundreds of Bar, whereas they must measure pressure variations with an accuracy in the order of 0.001 Bar in order to monitor a vertical waterbottom movement in the order of one centimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is known from French patent 2661744 to measure seabed subsidence with a series of pressure sensors arranged in a pressure resistant tube which is filled with a low pressure fluid. Other subsidence monitoring systems are known from Japanese patent 60235012, French patent 2749473, U.S. Pat. No. 4,145,817, UK patent 2224845, International patent application WO01/42818.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A problem with the system known from French patent 2661744 is that during installation the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid within the tube may damage the highly sensitive pressure sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system for monitoring subsidence and/or rising of a waterbottom using adequately protected pressure sensors that are able to monitor any vertical waterbottom movements with an accuracy in the order of centimeters even at large waterdepth of up to several kilometers and/or in an area with significant currents, tidal depth variations and/or wave impact, and wherein the tube can be installed at a significant waterdepth without the risk of damage to the pressure sensors due to the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid within the tube.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with the invention there is provided a method of monitoring subsidence and/or rising of a waterbottom, the method comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0010">arranging a plurality of pressure sensors in the interior and at different points along the length of a sealed pressure resistant protective tube, which tube is filled with a fluid and provided with valves which are configured to divide the interior of the sealed pressure resistant protective tube into a series of sealed longitudinally spaced segments;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0011">lowering the tube onto the waterbottom while the valves are closed and divide the interior of the tube into a series of longitudinally spaced segments;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0012">opening the valves after installation of the tube on the waterbottom while the fluid pressure in the interior the tube is substantially lower than the hydrostatic pressure of the water surrounding the tube; and</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0013">deducing any subsidence and/or rising of the waterbottom from any variation of the fluid pressures measured by the pressure sensors at different moments in time.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">The sealed pressure resistant protective tube may be filled with a liquid having a pressure between 0.1 and 10 Bar and may be arranged at the bottom of an ocean, sea, lake, or river having a depth between 10 and 10.000 meter.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">The pressure sensors may be configured to measure a pressure difference of less than 0.001 bar.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">The pressure resistant tube may be at least partly, or fully, filled with an aqueous liquid having a density of between 0.5 and 1.5 kg/cm<sup>3 </sup>and the sensors are connected to a waterbottom subsidence monitoring system, which is configured to determine subsidance and/or rise of the waterbottom of less than 1 cm. The waterbottom subsidence monitoring system according to the invention may be used in a region where hydrocarbon fluid is produced from an underwater hydrocarbon fluid containing formation to measure waterbottom subsidence and/or rising associated with the production of hydrocarbon fluids from the formation and/or injection of water and/or other fluids into the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0017">Accordingly, in accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of producing hydrocarbon fluid from an underwater hydrocarbon fluid containing formation, wherein subsidence and/or rising of the waterbottom associated with the production of hydrocarbon fluids from the formation and/or injection of water and/or other fluids into the formation is monitored by the system and method according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0018">In the method and system according to the invention the use of a pressure resistant tube which is preferably filled with a low pressure liquid, such as water, allows the use of sensitive pressure sensors which are able to monitor pressure variations in the order of 0.001 Bar, which may be associated with a waterbottom subsidence in the order of 1 cm, at a waterdepth of several kilometers where the ambient water pressure near the waterbottom may be several hundred Bar.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">These and other features, embodiments and advantages of the method and system according to the invention are described in the claims, abstract and the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment in which reference is made to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DEPICTED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is shown a sealed pressure resistant protective tube <b>1</b> comprising a series of longitudinally spaced pressure sensors <b>2</b>, which tube <b>1</b> is being lowered through a body of water <b>14</b>, such as an ocean, sea, lake or river with a depth of several hundreds of meters or kilometers, to the waterbottom <b>3</b> from a ship <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">The pressure sensors <b>2</b> are configured to transmit the measured pressure via a pair of fiber optical, electrical or other signal transmission cables <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> to a subsidence monitoring system <b>6</b> mounted on a ship or oil and/or gas production platform <b>7</b>, which floats at the water surface <b>8</b> and is used to produce crude oil and/or natural gas from a subsea oil and/or gas reservoir <b>9</b>. In order to protect the sensitive pressure sensors <b>2</b> against pressure variations during installation due to the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid in the interior of the protective tube <b>1</b> a series of valves <b>10</b> is arranged in the tube adjacent to the pressure sensors <b>2</b>, which valves <b>10</b> are closed during the descent and installation of the tube <b>1</b> onto the waterbottom <b>3</b> and which are opened after the tube lies on the waterbottom <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a longitudinal sectional view of the protective tube <b>1</b> lying on the water bottom <b>3</b>. A string of pressure sensors <b>2</b> is connected to a single optical cable <b>5</b> whereby the individual pressure sensors <b>2</b> are connected to each other or to the fibre optic cable <b>5</b> by means of optical connectors <b>11</b> which are placed in a protective pipe <b>20</b>. This modular approach allows flexibility in making up the sensing system and will assist transportation, deployment and sensor/spares inventory management. The protective tube <b>1</b> comprises a series of bulkheads <b>12</b> in which the valves <b>10</b> are arranged, which valves <b>10</b> are opened once the protective tube <b>1</b> fully lies on the waterbottom <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">The valves <b>10</b> may be electromagnetic valves <b>10</b> which consume a low amount of energy when they are opened and/or closed, such as valves described in Camcon's International patent application WO2006048616. These electromagnetic valves may be actuated by a optical signals transmitted through a fiber optical cable, which signals are converted into electric signals for opening and/or closing the valves <b>10</b> by opto-electrical converters located near the valves which convert the optical signals into electrical signals which actuate and power the valves <b>10</b>. When the valves <b>10</b> are opened the interior <b>13</b> of the protective tube <b>1</b> forms a continuous fluid channel, which is filled with a low pressure liquid, such as water, of which the pressure is maintained between 0.1 and 10 Bar by a pump (not shown), so that the pressure sensors <b>2</b> monitor hydrostatic pressure differences in the low pressure liquid, which has a much lower pressure than the body of water <b>14</b> surrounding the tube, allows the use of sensitive pressure sensors <b>2</b> that are able to monitor pressure variations of less than about 0.001 Bar, which corresponds to the pressure of a watercolumn of about 1 cm, so that subsidence of less than 1 cm of any section of the protective tube <b>1</b> can be measured, even if the protective tube lies on the bottom <b>3</b> of a body of water <b>14</b>, such as an ocean, with a waterdepth of several kilometres, where the water pressure near the waterbottom is several hundred Bar.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> depict a fibre optic sensor <b>2</b> according to the invention comprising a housing <b>21</b>, which is also referred to as the pressure cell <b>21</b>. The upper wall of the housing <b>21</b> defines a diaphragm <b>22</b>. The housing comprises a bottom cap <b>23</b>, which is sealed and secured in a recess at the bottom of the housing <b>21</b> and in the interior <b>24</b> of the housing a coupon is arranged, which defines a strain-decoupled mechanism <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">The geometry of the sensor diaphragm <b>22</b> is defined as a thick plate membrane, with a flat surface on both sides, having an aspect ratio a/b close to 1, where a and b are the inside length and width of the diaphragm.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">The diaphragm <b>22</b> is responsive to an external force such as pressure and also temperature, while the strain-decoupled mechanism <b>25</b> is responsive only to temperature by way of thermal expansion, not affected by an external force or pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">The diaphragm <b>22</b> and the strain-decoupled mechanism <b>25</b> are preferably made out of the same type materials or materials that have nominally the same mechanical properties, and in particular thermal expansion, which will enhance the temperature compensation of the pressure measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-4</figref> a plurality of optical fibres <b>26</b>,<b>27</b> extend through the interior <b>24</b> of the sensor housing <b>21</b>. The first optical fibre <b>26</b> is bonded to the diaphragm <b>22</b>. The second optical fibre <b>27</b> is bonded to the strain-decoupled mechanism <b>25</b>, e.g. a dedicated coupon or the inner sidewall of the sensor housing <b>21</b>. The optical fibres <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are bonded to the host specimen, i.e. the diaphragm <b>22</b> and the coupon <b>25</b> or inner side wall, by means of a suitable adhesive such as epoxy resin, polyimide adhesive, silica-filled epoxy compound, an organically modified ceramic, glass solder, ceramic cement or sprayed alumina, or electro-deposited or sputtered metal (for high temperature) etc. to ensure that, over the full operating range of the optical sensor, e.g. from &#x2212;20 to 800 degrees Celsius, the optical fibres <b>26</b> an <b>27</b> will stay in intimate contact with the host specimen <b>22</b> and <b>25</b> and that the strains in the host specimen <b>22</b> and <b>25</b> are transferred directly to the optical fibres attached to them with minimal long-term creep.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">The first and the second optical fibres <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> each contain at least one Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG). The Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) has a refractive index variation that provides maximum reflectivity at a central wavelength, which will shift due to induced strain in the fibre e.g. by pulling, pushing or bending the optical fibre. The reflectivity of an FBG wavelength depends on the overall length of the grating, the periodicity of the grating, the &#x2018;normal&#x2019; refractive index of the core and the modulated refractive index.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">The pressure sensing FBG P<sub>FBG </sub>in the first optical fibre <b>26</b> is fixed to the diaphragm <b>22</b> at a predetermined location near the centre of the diaphragm <b>22</b> where the strain, caused by the deflection of the diaphragm <b>22</b>, resulting from an external force or pressure at the outside of the sensor housing <b>21</b>, is maximal and symmetrically distributed, and the mechanical behaviour of the diaphragm <b>22</b> is predictable and repeatable.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">The temperature sensing FBG T<sub>FBG </sub>in the second optical fibre <b>27</b> is fixed to the strain-decoupled mechanism <b>25</b> (e.g. a coupon or inner side wall) at a predetermined location unaffected by induced mechanical strain due to an external force or pressure outside of the sensor housing <b>21</b> including the diaphragm <b>22</b>. This ensures that the strain on the temperature sensing FBG T<sub>FBG </sub>in the second optical fibre <b>27</b> is solely related to the thermal expansion of the host specimen, i.e. the coupon <b>25</b> or inner side wall. The measured strain is a temperature compensation means for the pressure grating P<sub>FBG </sub>in the first optical fibre <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">The strain-decoupled mechanism <b>25</b> (e.g. a coupon or the inner surface of the sensor housing) will mechanically protect the optical fibre <b>27</b> going through the sensor housing, in particular against shock and vibration, and importantly avoid the effects of shock and vibration being measured by the temperature sensing FBG, as might be the case if the temperature sensing was located in loose fibre.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">The wavelength of an FBG has an intrinsic temperature sensitivity related to the thermo-optic coefficient of the optical fibre <b>26</b>,<b>27</b>. The pressure and temperature sensing FBGs P<sub>FBG </sub>and T<sub>FBG </sub>are of identical manufacture and have thermo-optic coefficients that are nominally the same or at least similar to avoid common drift problems.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">Another aspect of the invention is a means to increase the pressure resolution of the pressure cell <b>2</b>, and/or to adjust the measurement range by pressurizing the inside of the sensor housing <b>21</b> with a suitable fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">For instance, the pressure resolution of a standard pressure cell can be increased or decreased by pressurizing the inside of the sensor housing at a pressure equal to one half of the maximum operating pressure of the cell. In this configuration, the pressure cell is pressurized with a pressure equal to the expected minimum-point of the sensor operation. Then, a very sensitive diaphragm <b>22</b> is used in order to measure variations between the reference minimum-point pressure and the upper and lower working pressures of the medium in contact. For instance, if the sensor is required to operate between 90 and 110 m H<sub>2</sub>O, then a the reference pressure is set at 90 m H<sub>2</sub>O, and a diaphragm <b>2</b> with a 20 m H<sub>2</sub>O range is used. Equally, if the pressure sensor <b>2</b> is required to operate between 990 and 1010 m H<sub>2</sub>O, then the reference pressure is set at 990 m H<sub>2</sub>O, and a diaphragm <b>22</b> with a 20 m H<sub>2</sub>O range is used.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">Another aspect of the invention is a means to prevent the diaphragm displacement exceeding a preset figure. In order to avoid yielding the diaphragm <b>22</b> whilst the sensor is in an environment above or below its working pressure range, a mechanical stop is introduced at one or either side of diaphragm to prevent overloading and permanent deformation of the diaphragm <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">Another aspect of the invention is a means to prevent or minimize oxidation and/or chemical reactions with undesirable effects by using an inert gas or other suitable material in the interior <b>24</b> of the sensor housing <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">It is also preferred to use nominally matching wavelengths for the pressure and the temperature FBG P<sub>FBG </sub>and T<sub>FBG</sub>. This enables to further optimise the temperature-compensating scheme, since the pressure and temperature FBGs can be written at nominally the same wavelength in the optical fibres <b>26</b>,<b>27</b>. Experimental data shows that using nominally the same wavelength for both pressure and the temperature FBG can eliminate the effect of common-mode drift in the FBG interrogator on the final pressure result.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">Either a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) or a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) interrogation scheme can be used in the method and sensor assembly according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">In a WDM interrogation scheme a plurality of pressure and temperature sensors PFBG and T<sub>FBG </sub>may be multiplexed on two fibres <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, each sensor having two FBG of nominally matched wavelengths, which can be the same as other cells.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-4</figref> with two fibres <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> lends itself well to use in a 2-channel WDM system where the channels share the same wavelength discriminating means.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">The Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) interrogation scheme as well as the TDM scheme would also work on a single fibre that passes through the sensor string in one direction and back through the sensor string in another direction after passing round a u-bend so long as the FBGs are selected so as not to overlap in wavelength during the operation of the sensor. An aspect of the invention is an optimized WDM interrogation scheme wherein the expected wavelength shift during the operation of the sensor is accounted for. For example, at a pressure lower than the operating pressure the grating spectra will overlap but at the operating pressure range, the FBGs will have moved apart sufficiently for them to be differentiated by wavelength. This optimized WDM interrogation scheme allows for FBGs to be closer in wavelength and so permit more FBGs to be measured on a single fibre. If a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) measurement system is used then it is preferred to use a plurality of sensors that are multiplexed on one&#x2014;when a mini-bend or turnaround is used&#x2014;or two fibres <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, with each sensor having two FBG and all FBGs of nominally matched wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">In the pressure sensor assembly according to the invention alternating P and T FBGs may be used on the sensing fibres <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> for redundancy in case measurement data from one fibre <b>26</b>,<b>27</b> is completely lost, in which case P &#x26; T information will still be collected, albeit at half the spatial resolution and less measurement certainty.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">In the pressure sensor assembly according to the invention pairs of optical fibres <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, for example the first and second optical fibre <b>26</b>,<b>27</b>, may be interconnected by using a minibend or another means of optical splicing or fibre turnaround, to create a double-ended optical fibre <b>26</b>,<b>27</b>, which will allow the FBGs to be interrogated from both ends of the optical fibre, providing redundancy and improved reliability to the sensing system. A suitable minibend is disclosed in International patent application WO2005/014976.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">In the sensor assembly according to the invention a plurality of optical fibres <b>26</b>,<b>27</b> may extend through the interior <b>24</b> of the sensor housing <b>21</b> for single or double-ended distributed sensing of e.g. temperature or strain utilising Rayleigh, Raman or Brillouin scattering, etc. in combination with one or more pressure cells in a single optical cable <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">The array of optical sensors may be connected to one or more suitable fibre optic interrogation and readout systems. Or several arrays may be connected to one fibre optic interrogation and readout unit using a suitable optical switch.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">Some of the improvements and advances of various preferred aspects of the method and pressure sensor assembly over the assemblies known from the cited prior art references are summarized below.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">It is preferred to use in the sensor assembly according to the invention a sensor housing <b>21</b> comprising a tube or a box with a thick plate membrane having a flat surface on both sides, or a parallel faced diaphragm <b>22</b>, with an aspect ratio close to one.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">An advantage of an aspect ratio close to one over an aspect ratio other than close to one is that the area of maximum tensile strain is well defined and concentrated at the centred at the diaphragm <b>22</b>, which makes the solution predictable and practical.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">If the aspect ratio is larger the tensile strain is small and almost zero at the centre of the diaphragm <b>22</b> in the axis of the longer dimension, this being the axis where strain measurement would be most practical.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">It is preferred that in the method according to the invention a pressure cell <b>2</b> is used, which is internally pressurized to increase the resolution and/or shift/adjust the measurement range.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">It is also preferred to use in the method and sensor assembly according to the invention a pressure cell <b>2</b>, which is filled with a suitable mix of fluids and/or other materials to allow high sensing sensitivity at elevated ambient pressures.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">It is also preferred to use an inert gas or other suitable material inside the pressure sensor <b>2</b> to minimize oxidation and chemical reactions with undesirable effects.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">It is furthermore preferred to use a hydrogen getter of a suitable material inside the pressure sensor <b>2</b> to absorb undesirable chemicals that may be harmful to the mechanical or optical performance of the pressure sensor <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">It is furthermore preferred to provide the pressure sensors <b>2</b> with substantially rectangular housings <b>21</b> that are configured such that stress on the housing <b>21</b> due to pull and/or push forces exerted by the protective pipe <b>20</b> is inhibited and to allow calibration of the pressure sensors <b>2</b> in a mechanical clamp assembly instead of in a high pressure vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">Advantages of the use of strain-decoupling substrate, coupon or other mechanism <b>25</b> for the temperature grating involving bonding to a strain-isolated substrate over a free FBG measuring air temperature are that:

</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0069">Advantages of the use of nominally matched wavelengths for the pressure and temperature FBG over a using different wavelength FBGs are that:</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0070">i) any wavelength measurement uncertainty of the instrumentation resulting in drifts common to all wavelengths is cancelled out. The only remaining source of wavelength measurement error that can compromise the accuracy of pressure measurements is a differential error, the effect of which is greatly reduced since the difference in wavelength between the pressure-sensing FBG and the temperature-sensing FBG is minimised.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0071">ii) the temperature sensitivity of the two FBGs (which varies with wavelength) are substantially the same at a given wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0072">Use of the above features i and ii together allow more precise temperature compensation to be made by measuring the differential wavelength between the two FBGs in each sensor than is the case when the FBG wavelengths are not nominally matched.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0073">It is preferred to place the pressure and temperature grating on separate optical fibres <b>26</b>,<b>27</b>, bonded on the diaphragm <b>22</b> and a strain-decoupling mechanism <b>25</b> made out of the same type of material, with the temperature grating having nominally the same wavelength as the pressure grating, which enables providing a direct measurement of the temperature shift and thermal expansion of the diaphragm <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0074">An advantage of the optional use of a double-ended sensing fibre over having the sensing fibres terminate at the end of the sensor string is that each array could be interrogated from both ends such that redundancy is added in the case of a fibre break or connector terminal degradation.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0075">An advantage of the optional use of alternating P and T FBGs on the two sensing fibres <b>26</b>,<b>27</b> is that if connection to one fibre is completely lost P &#x26; T information still is available, albeit at half the spatial resolution and with less measurement certainty.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0076">An advantage of the connection in accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention of individual pressure sensors into a string using optical connectors (with the optical connectors either rated to well conditions or protected from well Pressure conditions with a protective housing) assists in deployment and sensor/spares inventory management.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0077">It will be understood that any type of pressure sensors may be arranged in the protective tube and that any type of wired or wireless data transmission system may be used to transmit the pressure data generated by the pressure sensors to a seabed subsidence monitoring at surface.</p>
