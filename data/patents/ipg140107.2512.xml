<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Yeast cells are transformed with an exogenous xylose isomerase gene. Additional genetic modifications enhance the ability of the transformed cells to ferment xylose to ethanol or other desired fermentation products. Those modifications include deletion of non-specific or specific aldose reductase gene(s), deletion of xylitol dehydrogenase gene(s) and/or overexpression of xylulokinase.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates to certain genetically modified yeast species.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Because of the gradual depletion of world-wide petroleum and natural gas feedstocks, a desire on the part of oil-importing nations to decrease their dependence on foreign sources of oil, and a desire to establish a more sustainable basis to the economy, much effort is being devoted to the production of fuels and organic chemicals and plastics from alternative feedstocks. Fermentation processes offer the possibility of producing a variety of fuels and chemicals from naturally-occurring sugar sources. For example, ethanol is produced in significant quantity by fermenting glucose, most typically glucose obtained by hydrolysing corn starch. A yeast species, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, is a common biocatalyst for fermenting glucose to ethanol.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These sugars represent a relatively expensive carbon source. Biomass, i.e. plant matter hydrolysate, offers the possibility of being a particularly inexpensive source of carbon. Biomass consists mainly of cellulose and hemicellulose. Cellulose can be broken down into hexose sugars, typically glucose. Most yeasts, including <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, metabolise hexose sugars quite efficiently. Hemicellulose, on the other hand, is rich in pentose sugars such as xylose, so efficient carbon utilization requires that these pentose sugars be metabolised as well. Very few yeast efficiently metabolize xylose to ethanol or other desirable fermentation products. So, in order to exploit the full economic potential offered by using biomass carbon sources, it is necessary to provide a biocatalyst that can efficiently convert xylose to desirable fermentation products.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various bacteria are capable of metabolising xylose into fermentation products, but these generally produce a mixture of products, rather than a single predominant product as is usually desired. The common by-products are sometimes toxic to the bacteria. Even though certain bacteria have been metabolically engineered to perform homoethanolic fermentions, bacteria tend to perform poorly in the harsh environment of lignocellulosic hydrolysates, which are a common source of xylose-rich substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some yeast species such as <i>S. cerevisiae </i>are known to ferment hexose sugars predominantly into ethanol, rather than the mixtures of products typically produced by bacteria. Some yeasts have other characteristics that make them good candidates for various types of fermentation process, such as resistance to low pH environments, resistance to certain fermentation co-products such as acetic acid and furfural, and resistance to ethanol itself.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Most yeast species metabolise xylose (if at all) via a complex route, in which xylose is first reduced to xylitol via a xylose reductase (XR) enzyme. The xylitol is then oxidized to xylulose via a xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) enzyme. The xylulose is then phosphorylated via an XK enzyme. This pathway operates inefficiently in yeast species because it introduces a redox imbalance in the cell. The xylose-to-xylitol step uses NADH as a cofactor, whereas the xylitol-to-xylulose step uses NADPH as a cofactor. Other processes must operate to restore the redox imbalance within the cell. This often means that the organism cannot grow anaerobically on xylose or other pentose sugar.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Nonetheless, attempts have been made to introduce exogenous XR and XDH genes into yeast species such as <i>S. cerevisiae </i>in order to achieve conversion of xylose to ethanol. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,382, WO 95/13362 and WO 97/42307. The engineered yeast did not produce ethanol efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other organisms can isomerise xylose into xylulose and then phosphorylate the xylulose to xylulose 5-phosphate, which then is further metabolised through the cell's central carbon pathway. The isomerization is promoted by a catalytic enzyme, xylose isomerase (XI) and the phosphorylation is catalysed by a xylulokinase (XK) enzyme. This pathway is common in bacteria, but relatively rare in eukaryotic species such as yeast. It does not create the redox imbalance created in the xylose-to-xylitol-to-xylulose pathway, and thus is in principle a more efficient anaerobic mechanism. An anaerobic fungus, <i>Piromyces </i>sp. E2 (ATCC 76762), is known to possess a gene that expresses an active XI enzyme.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, no wild type or recombinant yeast species has had the capacity to efficiently produce desirable fermentation products from xylose or other pentose sugar feedstocks. An attempt to introduce the <i>Piromyces </i>sp. E2 XI gene into <i>S. cerevisiae </i>resulted in very slow growth on xylose and did not result in reported ethanol production. See Kuyper et al., &#x201c;High-Level Functional Expression of a Fungal Xylose Isomerase: The Key to Efficient Ethanolic Fermentation of Xylose by <i>Saccharomyces Cerevisiae</i>?&#x201d;, FEMS Yeast Research 1574 (2003) 1-10, and WO 03/062430A1.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A yeast species that can efficiently ferment xylose and other pentose sugars into a desired fermentation product is therefore very desirable.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The genetically modified yeast of the invention is made by performing certain genetic modifications to a host yeast cell.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A suitable host yeast cell contains at least one native gene that produces an active enzyme that is capable of catalyzing the conversion of D-xylose to xylitol. These may be specific to the xylose xylitol reduction, or may be non-specific (i.e., operate on a range of pentose sugars). Enzymes produced by such genes are variously referred to by EC number 1.1.1.21, and formally as alditol:NAD(P) 1-oxidoreductase). The enzyme encoded by such genes generally has the following activity: D-xylose+NAD(P)H=xylitol+NAD+(i.e. it can use either NADPH or NADH as redox cofactors, or both). A gene expressing a xylose reductase enzyme is referred to herein as a &#x201c;xylose reductase gene&#x201d;, or an &#x201c;XR gene&#x201d;. In some instances, specific XR genes are designated &#x201c;XYL1&#x201d; genes herein.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The term &#x201c;native&#x201d; is used herein with respect to genetic materials (e.g., a gene, promoter or terminator) that are found (apart from individual-to-individual mutations which do not affect its function) within the genome of the unmodified cells of that species of yeast.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A host yeast cell capable of converting D-xylose to xylitol will generally have the native ability to further convert xylitol to D-xylulose. This is generally accomplished by expressing a xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) enzyme that is encoded by a gene referred to herein as a &#x201c;xylitol dehydrogenase gene&#x201d; or an &#x201c;XDH gene&#x201d;. Enzymes encoded by such genes are variously referred to by EC number 1.1.1.9, commonly as xylitol dehydrogenase and systematically a xylitol:NAD+2-oxidoreductase (D-xylulose-forming). These genes generally have the following activity: xylitol+NAD(P)+=D-xylulose+NAD(P)H (although NAD+ is by far the preferred substrate, some do use NADP+). Specific XDH genes are designated &#x201c;XYL2&#x201d; genes herein. A suitable host cell has one or more native genes that produce a functional aldose reductase or xylose reductase enzyme and a functional XDH enzyme. An enzyme is &#x201c;functional&#x201d; within the context of this invention if it is capable of performing its usual or intended role. A gene is &#x201c;functional&#x201d; within the context of this invention if it expresses a functional enzyme.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Another suitable host yeast cell has the ability to transport xylose across its cell wall or membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Another suitable host yeast cell is one that naturally grows on xylose, such as one having an active natural pathway from xylulose-5-phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. In this invention, the pathway from xylulose-5-phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is considered to be active if at least 10% of glucose-based sugars are metabolized by the wild type cell through the hexose monophosphate pathway. Preferably, at least 20, more preferably at least 30%, especially at least 40% of ribulose-5-phosphate is metabolised through this pathway.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Suitable host cells include, for example, yeast cells of the genera <i>Kluyveromyces, Candida, Pichia, Hansenula, Trichosporon, Brettanomyces, Pachysolen and Yamadazyma</i>. Yeast species of particular interest include <i>K. marxianus, K. lactis, K. thermotolerans, C. sonorensis, C. methanosorbosa, C. diddensiae, C. parapsilosis, C. naeodendra, C. balnkii, C. entomophila, C. scehatae, P. tannophilus </i>and <i>P. stipitis. K. marxianus, C. sonorensis, C. scehatae, Pachysolen tannophilus </i>and <i>Pichia stipitis </i>are examples of yeast cells that grow on xylose. They have a natural xylulose-5-phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate pathway, natural functional aldose and/or xylose reductase genes, active xylitol dehydrogenase genes, and natural ability to transport xylose through the cell wall or membrane. Preferred host cells include those of the species <i>K. marxianus, K. lactis, K. thermotolerans, C. sonorensis </i>and <i>C. methanosorbosa. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The host cell may contain genetic modifications other than those specifically described herein. For example, the host cell may be genetically modified to produce (or not produce) a particular type of fermentation product by further metabolizing xylulose-5-phosphate and/or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Specific examples of such modifications include the deletion or disruption of a native pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) gene, and the insertion of exogenous genes such as an L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH) or D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) gene. Methods for making modifications of these types are described, for example, in WO 99/14335, WO 00/71738, WO 02/42471, WO 03/102201, WO 03/102152 and WO 03/049525. These modifications may be present in the host cell prior to further modifying the host cell as described herein, or may be done simultaneously with or after such further modifications as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Genetically modified yeast cells of certain aspects of the invention include a functional, exogenous xylose isomerase (XI) gene that is preferably integrated into the genome of the host cell. In this context, &#x201c;exogenous&#x201d; means (1) the XI gene is not native to the host cell, (2) the XI gene is native to the host cell, but the genome of the host cell has been modified to provide additional functional copies of the native XI gene, or (3) both (1) and (2). Examples of suitable XI genes include XI genes native to Piromyces species E2 (such as the <i>Piromyces </i>sp. E2 xylA encoding gene sequence in Genbank (Assession # AJ249909)) and <i>Cyllamyces aberensis </i>as well as those obtained from other anaerobic fungi. Nucleotide sequences for the Piromyces species E2 and <i>Cyllamyces Aberensis </i>XI genes are identified as SEQ. ID. NOs. 58 and 151, respectively. Deduced amino acid sequences for proteins produced by these XI genes are identified as SEQ. ID. No. 59 and 152, respectively. A suitable bacterial XI gene is native to <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i>. The nucleotide sequence for this <i>B. thetaiotamicron </i>XI gene is identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 162. The deduced amino acid sequence for the enzyme produced by this gene is identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 163. Suitable XI genes include those that are at least 60%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% homologous to SEQ. ID. NOs. 58 or 151. Suitable XI genes include those that encode for enzymes that are at least 60%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% homologous to SEQ. ID. NOs. 59 or 152. Some suitable xylose isomerase genes are no greater than 95% or no greater than 90% homologous to SEQ. ID. NO. 58 or encode an enzyme that is no greater than 95% or no greater than 90% homologous to SEQ. ID. NO. 59. Other suitable xylose isomerase genes are bacterial xylose isomerase genes that are at least 60, 80, 90, 95, 98 or 99% homologous to SEQ. ID. NO. 162 and/or produce an enzyme that is at least 60, 80, 90, 95, 98 or 99% homologous to SEQ. ID. NO. 163.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Percent homology of amino acid sequences can conveniently computed using BLAST version 2.2.1 software with default parameters. Sequences having an identities score and a positives score of at least XX %, using the BLAST version 2.2.1 algorithm with default parameters are considered at least XX % homologous. Particularly suitable xylose isomerase genes include those that encode for an enzyme that has an identities score of at least 60%, compared with SEQ. ID. NO. 163, an identities score of less than 95%, compared with SEQ. ID. NO. 59, and a positives score of less than 97%, compared with SEQ. ID. NO. 59.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The exogenous XI gene is under the control of a promoter and a terminator, both of which are functional in the modified yeast cell. As used herein, the term &#x201c;promoter&#x201d; refers to an untranscribed sequence located upstream (i.e., 5&#x2032;) to the translation start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 1 to 1000 bp, preferably 1-500 bp, especially 1-100 bp) and which controls the start of transcription of the structural gene. Similarly, the term &#x201c;terminator&#x201d; refers to an untranscribed sequence located downstream (i.e., 3&#x2032;) to the translation finish codon of a structural gene (generally within about 1 to 1000 bp, more typically 1-500 base pairs and especially 1-100 base pairs) and which controls the end of transcription of the structural gene. A promoter or terminator is &#x201c;operatively linked&#x201d; to a structural gene if its position in the genome relative to that of the structural gene such that the promoter or terminator, as the case may be, performs its transcriptional control function.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Promoters and terminator sequences may be native to the yeast cell or exogenous. Promoter and terminator sequences that are highly homologous (i.e., 90% or more, especially 95% or more, most preferably 99% or more homologous) in their functional portions to functional portions of promoter and terminator sequences, respectively, that are native to the cell are useful as well, particularly when the insertion of the exogenous gene is targeted at a specific site in the cell's genome.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A suitable promoter is at least 90%, 95% or 99% homologous to a promoter that is native to a yeast gene. A more suitable promoter is at least 90%, 95% or 99% homologous to a promoter for a gene that is native of the host cell. Particularly useful promoters include promoters for yeast pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), xylose reductase, (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) and transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) genes, especially from such genes as are native to the host cell.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A suitable terminator is at least 90%, 95% or 99% homologous to a terminator that is native to a yeast gene. The terminator may be at least 90%, 95% or 99% homologous to a terminator for a gene that is native of the host cell. Particularly useful terminators include terminators for yeast pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), xylose reductase, (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) or iso-2-cytochrome c (CYC) genes, or a terminator from the galactose family of genes in yeast, particularly the so-called GAL10 terminator. A <i>S. cerevisiae </i>GAL10 terminator and a <i>S. cerevisiae </i>CYC1 terminator have been shown to be effective terminators for exogenous XI genes in yeast.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The use of native (to the host cell) promoters and terminators, together with respective upstream and downstream flanking regions, can permit the targeted integration of the XI gene into specific loci of the host cell's genome, and for simultaneous integration the XI gene and deletion of another native gene, such as, for example, an XR, XDH or PDC gene.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A poly-his(tidine) tail may be present at the 3&#x2032; end of the XI gene. A method for accomplishing this is described in Example 3 below. The presence of the poly-his tail may diminish the performance of the XI gene, however. The poly-his tail is not critical to the invention and may be omitted if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The exogenous XI gene may be integrated randomly into the host cell's genome or inserted at one or more targeted locations. Examples of targeted locations include the loci of a gene that is desirably deleted or disrupted, such as an XR, XDH or PDC gene. In some embodiments, integration of the XI gene adjacent to the site of a native PDC gene appears to be related to improved performance of the modified yeast cell in producing fermentation products. Integration at the PDC locus may be accomplished with or without deletion or disruption of the native PDC gene, but it is preferred to maintain the native PDC gene intact and functional, particularly when a desired fermentation product is ethanol or other product that is a pyruvate metabolite.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Targeted integration can be accomplished by designing a vector having regions that are homologous to the upstream (5&#x2032;-) and downstream (3&#x2032;-) flanks of the target gene. Either of both of these regions may include a portion of the coding region of the target gene. The XI cassette (including associated promoters and terminators if different from those of the target gene) and selection markers (with associated promoters and terminators as may be needed) will reside on the vector between the regions that are homologous to the upstream and downstream flanks of the target gene.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The genetically modified yeast cell may contain a single copy or multiple copies of the exogenous XI gene. If multiple copies of the exogenous XI gene are present, from 2 to 10 or more copies may be present, such as from about 2-8 or from about 2-5 copies. Multiple copies of the exogenous XI gene may be integrated at a single locus (so they are adjacent each other), or at several loci within the host cell's genome. In an embodiment of particular interest, multiple copies of the exogenous XI gene are incorporated at or adjacent to the locus of a native PDC gene, with or without deletion or disruption of the native PDC gene. It is possible for different exogenous XI genes to be under the control of different types of promoters and/or terminators.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Performance of the modified yeast, especially under anaerobic conditions, is improved by making one or more additional modifications to its genome, and/or selecting host cells having certain characteristics. These include one or more of (1) low XR (or other aldose reductase) activity, (2) low XDH activity and (3) XK overexpression.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The host cell may naturally have or be modified to have low aldose reductase activity. Such a low aldose reductase activity, measured in the manner described in Example 4E below, is suitably less than 10 mU/mg or less than 5 mU/mg. If the host cell contains one or more aldose reductase genes that produce enzymes that catalyze the conversion of xylose to xylitol, one or more of these genes is suitably disrupted or deleted. In general, the gene(s) selected for disruption or deletion are those which individually or collectively (1) account for at least 40%, preferably at least 50% of the host cell's xylose xylitol reduction activity, and/or (2) are XR genes, i.e., genes that encode an enzyme specific to the xylose xylitol reduction. It is generally preferred to delete or disrupt at least one XR gene. Deletion or disruption preferably achieves at least a 50% reduction in enzyme activity, and more preferably reduced xylose reductase activity to below 10 mU/mg or 5 mU/mg.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">By &#x201c;delete or disrupt&#x201d;, it is meant that the entire coding region of the gene is eliminated (deletion), or the gene or its promoter and/or terminator region is modified (such as by deletion, insertion, or mutation) so that the gene no longer produces an active enzyme, or produces an enzyme with severely reduced activity. The deletion or disruption can be accomplished by genetic engineering methods, forced evolution or mutagenesis and/or selection or screening. In the case of the XR or non-specific aldose reductase gene, a suitable method for accomplishing this is to clone the upstream and downstream flanking regions for the gene (which may include a portion of the coding region for the gene), produce a vector containing the cloned upstream and downstream flanks, and transform the host cell with the vector. The vector may contain other genetic material such as a marker gene or other gene that is desirably inserted into the genome of the host cell at the locus of the native XR or non-specific aldose gene (such as an XI gene, XK gene or a gene that enables the cell to produce a desired fermentation product, as an L- or D-LDH gene).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">One method of deleting the XR or non-specific aldose reductase gene is to transform the host cell with a vector containing regions that are homologous to the upstream (5&#x2032;-) and downstream (3&#x2032;-) flanks of the target gene. Such flanking sequences can be obtained, for example, by amplifying the appropriate regions by PCR using suitably designed primers and genomic DNA as the template. Either of both of these regions may include a portion of the coding region of the target gene, although the vector should not contain the entire functional portion of the gene. Such flanking sequences are generally sequences of at least 50 base pairs, or at least 100 or at least 500 base pairs. Although there is in theory no upper limit to the length of the flanking sequence, it is preferably up to about 4000 base pairs, more preferably up to about 1200 base pairs in length. The flanking sequences are each at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 98% and even more preferably at least 99% homologous to the corresponding sequences in the cell's genome. These flanking sequences may include the promoter and terminator sequences, respectively, of the target gene. The vector may in addition contain one or more selection marker cassettes (with associated promoters and terminators as may be needed) that advantageously reside between the regions that are homologous to the upstream and downstream flanks of the target gene. Such a vector can delete the target gene in a homologous recombination, inserting the selection marker gene at the locus of the deleted target gene. The vector may instead of or in addition to the selection marker cassette include another expression cassette, such as an XI expression cassette, and L- or D-LDH cassette or a xylulokinase expression cassette, all of which may include associated promoters and terminators. Vectors can also be designed to take advantage of spontaneous loopout events, such as are described in WO 03/102152.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The host cell may naturally have or be modified to have low xylitol dehydrogenase activity. Such a low xylitol dehydrogenase enzyme activity, measured in the manner described in Example 6B below, is suitably less than 2 mU/mg or less than 1 mU/mg. If the host cell contains one or more xylitol dehydrogenase genes resulting in higher xylitol dehydrogenase enzyme activities, one or more of these genes is suitably disrupted or deleted. XDH gene deletion or disruption can be performed in a way analogous to described before with respect to aldose reductase deletion or disruption. Deletion can be performed by incorporating upstream and downstream flanks of the XDH gene into a transformation vector, instead of the flanks of the XR or non-specific aldose reductase gene. As before, the vector may include one or more selection marker cassettes and/or one or more other expression cassettes. Deletion or disruption preferably achieves at least a 50% reduction in enzyme activity, and more preferably reduced xylitol dehydrogenase activity to below 2 mU/mg or 1 mU/mg.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The modified cell preferably expresses a xylulokinase enzyme having an activity of at least 100 mU/mg, such as at least 300 mU/mg or at least 500 mU/mg, measured as described in Example 5E below. The xylulokinase enzyme is referred to variously as EC 2.7.1.17 and systematically as ATP:D-xylulose 5-phosphotransferase. Its activity is generally ATP+D-xylulose=ADP+D-xylulose 5-phosphateXylulokinase (XK). Overexpression can be achieved, for example, by forced evolution (under conditions that favor selection of mutants that overexpress the enzyme), mutagenesis or by integrating one or more functional exogenous xylulokinase genes into the genome of the host cell. In this context, &#x201c;exogenous&#x201d; means (1) the XK gene is not native to the host cell, (2) the XK gene is native to the host cell, but the genome of the host cell has been modified to provide additional functional copies of the native XK gene, or (3) both (1) and (2). Suitable xylulokinase genes include yeast xylulokinase genes. A preferred example of a suitable XK gene is the <i>S. cerevisiae </i>XK gene (ScXKS1). A nucleotide sequence for the ScXKS1 gene is identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 83. The deduced amino acid sequence for the enzymes produced by the ScXKS1 gene is identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 84. Suitable XK genes include those that are at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% homologous to SEQ. ID. NO. 83. Suitable XK genes include those that encode for enzymes that are at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% homologous to SEQ. ID. NO. 84. Other suitable XK genes are native to <i>K. marxianus </i>or <i>C. sonorensis</i>, or are at least 70%, 80%, 80%, 95%, 98% or 99% homologous to either of these.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The exogenous XK gene is under the control of a promoter and a terminator, both of which are functional in the modified yeast cell. Suitable promoters and terminator sequences may be native to the host cell or exhibit a high homology (i.e., 90% or greater, especially 95% or greater, most preferably 99% or greater homology) to a native promoters or terminator. Such promoters and terminators are particularly useful when the exogenous XK gene is targeted at a specific site in the host cell's genome. Other suitable promoters and terminators are native to the organism from which the XK gene was obtained or exhibit a similarly high homology to such native promoter and/or terminators. For example, suitable promoters and terminators for the ScXKS1 gene identified above include promoters and terminators for <i>S. cerevisiae </i>genes. The promoter and/or terminators may be those native to the particular XK gene or exhibit a similarly high homology to such promoter and/and terminator.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Particularly useful promoters for the ScXKS1 gene include <i>S. cerevisiae </i>pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), xylose reductase, (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) and transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) promoters. Particularly useful terminators for the ScXKS1 gene include <i>S. cerevisiae </i>pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), xylose reductase, (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) or iso-2-cytochrome c (CYC) terminators, or a terminator from the galactose family of genes in yeast, particularly the so-called GAL10 terminator. A <i>S. cerevisiae </i>GAL10 terminator and a <i>S. cerevisiae </i>CYC1 terminator have been shown to be effective terminators for exogenous XI genes in yeast.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The exogenous XK gene may be integrated randomly into the host cell's genome, or inserted at one or more targeted locations, using methods analogous to those for inserting the XR gene, as discussed above. Examples of targeted locations include the loci of a gene that is desirably deleted or disrupted, such as an XR, XDH or PDC gene. As before, targeted integration can be accomplished by designing a vector having regions that are homologous to the upstream (5&#x2032;-) and downstream (3&#x2032;-) flanks of the target gene. Either of both of these regions may include a portion of the coding region of the target gene. The XK cassette (including associated promoters and terminators if different from those of the target gene) and selection markers (with associated promoters and terminators as may be needed) will reside on the vector between the regions that are homologous to the upstream and downstream flanks of the target gene.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The genetically modified yeast cell may contain a single copy or multiple copies (such as from 2 to 10 or more copies, from 2 to 8 or from 2 to 5 copies) of the exogenous XK gene. Multiple copies of the exogenous XK gene may be integrated at a single locus (so they are adjacent each other), or at several loci within the host cell's genome. It is possible for different exogenous XK genes to be under the control of different types of promoters and/or terminators.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Cells according to the invention that have low xylose reductase activity, low xylitol dehydrogenase activity and overexpressed xylulokinase activity are excellent hosts for screening exogenous xylose isomerase genes for activity in the host cell. These genetic modifications create a cellular environment that tends to favor xylose isomerase expression, so if a certain gene is in fact active, its activity is less likely to be suppressed by the cellular environment and therefore be measurable in the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Genetic modification of the host cell is accomplished in one or more steps via the design and construction of appropriate vectors and transformation of the host cell with those vectors. Electroporation and/or chemical (such as calcium chloride- or lithium acetate-based) transformation methods can be used. Methods for transforming yeast strains are described in WO 99/14335, WO 00/71738, WO 02/42471, WO 03/102201, WO 03/102152 and WO 03/049525; these methods are generally applicable for transforming host cells in accordance with this invention. The DNA used in the transformations can either be cut with particular restriction enzymes or used as circular DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">General approaches to transformation vector design have been discussed above in a general sense. Some specific transformation vector designs are as follows, with components listed in order of reading/transcription. All can be circularized or linearized. All may contain restriction sites of various types for linearization or fragmentation. Vectors may further contain a backbone portion (such as for propagation in <i>E. coli</i>, which are conveniently obtained from commercially available yeast or bacterial vectors.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">1. Upstream (5&#x2032;-) region of host cell XR gene; marker expression cassette, host downstream (3&#x2032;-) region of host XR gene. The marker expression cassette may be a hygromycin, Ura3 or G418 resistance expression cassette with promoters and terminators as needed. A Ura3 cassette may be a HisG-Ura3-HisG cassette. A G418 cassette may include the ScPDC1 promoter and ScGA110 terminator.</p>

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In addition to the specific selection marker genes described above, typical selection marker genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., zeocin (<i>Streptoalloteichus hindustanus </i>ble bleomycin resistance gene), G418 (kanamycin-resistance gene of Tn903), hygromycin (aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance gene from <i>E. coli</i>), ampicillin, tetracycline, or kanamycin for host cells; (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies of the cell, such as amino acid leucine deficiency (<i>K. marxianus </i>Leu2 gene) or uracil deficiency (e.g., <i>K. marxianus </i>or <i>S. cerevisiae </i>Ura3 gene); (c) supply critical nutrients not available from simple media, or (d) confers ability for the cell to grow on a particular carbon source. A xylose isomerase gene can act in this manner, allowing selection to occur on the basis of the ability to grow on xylose.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Successful transformants can be selected for in known manner, by taking advantage of the attributes contributed by the marker gene, or by other characteristics (such as ability to grow on xylose) contributed by the inserted genes. Screening can be performed by PCR or Southern analysis to confirm that the desired insertions and deletions have taken place, to confirm copy number and to identify the point of integration of genes into the host cell's genome. Activity of the enzyme encoded by the inserted gene and/or lack of activity of enzyme encoded by the deleted gene can be confirmed using known assay methods.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The genetically modified yeast cell of the invention containing the exogenous XI gene is useful to ferment pentose sugars to desirable fermentation products such as ethanol and lactic acid. Certain additional genetic modifications may be necessary to enable the yeast cell to produce certain products in acceptable yields, titers and/or productivity For example, integration of an exogenous LDH gene and deletion of native PDC genes may be necessary to obtain high lactic acid yields, as discussed before.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the fermentation process of the invention, the cell of the invention is cultivated in a fermentation medium that includes a pentose sugar. The pentose sugar is preferably xylose, xylan or other oligomer of xylose. Such sugars are suitably hydrolysates of a hemicelluose-containing biomass. The fermentation medium may contain other sugars as well, notably hexose sugars such as dextrose (glucose) fructose, oligomers of glucose such as maltose, maltotriose and isomaltotriose, and panose. In case of oligomeric sugars, it may be necessary to add enzymes to the fermentation broth in order to digest these to the corresponding monomeric sugar.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The medium will typically contain nutrients as required by the particular cell, including a source of nitrogen (such as amino acids proteins, inorganic nitrogen sources such as ammonia or ammonium salts, and the like), and various vitamins, minerals and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Other fermentation conditions, such as temperature, cell density, selection of substrate(s), selection of nutrients, and the like are not considered to be critical to the invention and are generally selected to provide an economical process. Temperatures during each of the growth phase and the production phase may range from above the freezing temperature of the medium to about 50&#xb0; C., although the optimal temperature will depend somewhat on the particular microorganism. A preferred temperature, particularly during the production phase, is from about 30-45&#xb0; C. When the cell is an engineered <i>K. marxianus</i>, it can tolerate relatively high temperatures (such as above 40&#xb0; C. and up to 50&#xb0; C., especially up to 45&#xb0; C.). Another preferred species of cell, C. sonorensis, can tolerate temperatures up to about 40&#xb0; C. This temperature range provides for the possibility of conducting the fermentation at such higher temperatures (thereby reducing cooling costs) without a significant loss of productivity. Another advantage provided by the good high temperature tolerance is that if the fermentation becomes contaminated with an undesired microorganism, in many cases the undesired microorganism can be selectively killed off by heating the fermentation medium to 40&#xb0; C. or more, especially 45&#xb0; C. or more, without significantly harming the desired cells of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">During the production phase, the concentration of cells in the fermentation medium is typically in the range of about 1-150, preferably about 3-10, even more preferably about 3-6 g dry cells/liter of fermentation medium.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The fermentation may be conducted aerobically, microaerobically or anaerobically. If desired, specific oxygen uptake rate can be used as a process control, as described in WO 03/102200. An advantage of the invention is that the genetically modified cell typically can ferment xylose anaerobically due to the expression of the XI gene and other modifications.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">When the fermentation product is an acid, the medium may be buffered during the production phase of the fermentation so that the pH is maintained in a range of about 5.0 to about 9.0, preferably about 5.5 to about 7.0. Suitable buffering agents are basic materials that neutralize lactic acid as it is formed, and include, for example, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, ammonia, ammonium hydroxide and the like. In general, those buffering agents that have been used in conventional fermentation processes are also suitable here. It is within the scope of the invention, however, to allow the pH of the fermentation medium drop from a starting pH that is typically 6 or higher, to below the pKa of the acid fermentation product, such as in the range of about 2 to about 5 or in the range of from about 2.8 to about 4.5.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In a buffered fermentation, acidic fermentation products such as lactic acid are neutralized as they are formed to the corresponding lactate salt. Recovery of the acid therefore involves regenerating the free acid. This is typically done by removing the cells and acidulating the fermentation broth with a strong acid such as sulfuric acid. A salt by-product is formed (gypsum in the case where a calcium salt is the neutralizing agent and sulfuric acid is the acidulating agent), which is separated from the acid. The acid is then recovered through techniques such as liquid-liquid extraction, distillation, absorption, etc., such as are described in T. B. Vickroy, Vol. 3, Chapter 38 of Comprehensive Biotechnology, (ed. M. Moo-Young), Pergamon, Oxford, 1985; R. Datta, et al., FEMS Microbiol. Rev., 1995; 16:221-231; U.S. Pat.

E2 xylose isomerase (PXYLA) gene is adapted from &#x201c;A method for synthesizing genes and cDNA's by polymerase chain reaction&#x201d;, by Alberto Di Donato et al., Analytical Biochemistry 212, 291-293 (1993). PAGE purified primers are ordered starting from the center of the gene to reconstruct going out. 14-16 bp overlaps are maintained for the primer sets. The primers are each 60-70 bp long. The gene was reconstructed in 17 steps.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The PCR protocol that was followed during this method used Platinum Pfx (Invitrogen, CA) as the DNA polymerase, and its buffer and MgSO<sub>4 </sub>as directed by the manufacturer. Step <b>1</b> is performed using primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 20 and SEQ. ID. NO. 21. These primers represent the center of the gene sequence. No template is required in Step <b>1</b>, as the annealing of the primers and its extension will form the core template on which subsequent PCR reactions will be built. Cycling for Step <b>1</b> is 20 cycles of 94&#xb0; C. for 1 minute, 54&#xb0; C. for 1 minute and 68&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes (with 5 additional seconds being added to each successive cycle), followed by storing at 4&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In reaction steps 2-17, Platinum Pfx (Invitrogen, CA) was used as the DNA polymerase, and its buffer and MgSO<sub>4 </sub>were used as directed by the manufacturer. 2.5 1 of the mix from each step was used as template for each subsequent step (50 1 reaction). The primer sets for each reaction are described in Table 1. The template in each case was 5 &#x3bc;l of DNA from the preceding reaction step. The cycling for steps 2-17 was 20 cycles of 94&#xb0; C. for 1 minute, 46&#xb0; C. for 1 minute and 68&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes (with 5 additional seconds being added to each successive cycle), followed by storing at 4&#xb0; C.</p>

<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Construction of Vector pCM17 (FIG. <b>10</b>) Containing the Reconstructed PXYLA Gene; Site-Directed Mutagenesis to Alter Bases on the Reconstructed Gene to Coincide with the Sequence in Genbank Database</heading>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">A plasmid containing the reconstructed PXYLA gene (Ex. 2A) was constructed by ligating a &#x2dc;1.314 kbp fragment produced in the final round of construction to a TOPOII vector (Invitrogen, CA). The reconstructed PXYLA gene differed from the Genbank sequence with respect to five bases. Each of these differences was corrected using a multi-site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Calif.), using this plasmid as the template. Three PAGE or HPLC purified, 5&#x2032; phosphorylated mutagenic primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 54, SEQ. ID. NO. 55 and SEQ. ID. NO. 56 were used to correct four of the errors. Thermal cycling parameters included a one-minute denaturation step and a one-minute annealing step, followed by an eight-minute extension. The parental strand formed during the PCR step was then digested by adding 1 &#x3bc;l DpnI enzyme to the mixture at the end of the thermocycling. The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 37&#xb0; C. and then used to transform XL10-Gold Ultracompetent <i>E. coli </i>cells supplied with the kit. The mixture was plated on Luria-Bertani+ampicillin (LBA) plates and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. The multi-site directed mutagenesis protocol was then repeated to fix the fifth error. Two PAGE or HPLC purified, 5&#x2032;-phosphorylated mutagenic primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 57 and SEQ. ID. NO. 55 were used. Two transformants were sequenced and showed 100% homology to the Genbank sequence of the PXYLA gene. One of the constructs was named pCM17 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the reconstructed PXYLA gene are identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 58 and SEQ. ID NO. 59.</p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The PXYLA gene was PCR amplified using the primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 60 and SEQ. ID. NO. 61, using pCM17 (Ex. 2B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) as a template. Thermocycling was performed by 35 cycles of 30 seconds at 94&#xb0; C., 30 seconds at 55&#xb0; C., 1.5 minutes at 72&#xb0; C., followed by a final incubation for 8 minutes at 72&#xb0; C. using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA). The PCR product was digested with SbfI and electrophoretically separated on a 1.0% agarose gel. A 1319 bp product was isolated and ligated to a &#x2dc;6829 bp fragment obtained by digesting pCM9 with SbfI, to construct a &#x2dc;8148 bp plasmid. A mutagenic primer identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 62 was used to pull out a stop codon which was accidentally added immediately upstream of the SbfI site, following the same protocol as described in Example Ex. 2B, to create a &#x2dc;8148 bp plasmid (pCM14, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Plasmid pCM14 contains the PXYLA gene under the control of the KmPDC1 promoter and the ScCYC1 terminator, with a poly-his tail at the 3&#x2032; end of the gene.

<heading id="h-0027" level="1">Incorporation of a Ura3 Selection Marker into the pCM14 Plasmid (Ex. 3A, FIG. <b>11</b>), with Deletion of the Hph Expression Cassette</heading>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Alani et al., in &#x201c;A method for gene disruption that allows repeated use of Ura3 selection in the construction of multiply disrupted yeast strains,&#x201d; (Genetics, 1987, 116, 541-545) has described a method of gene integration or gene disruption. This method makes use of a uracil auxotrophic yeast strain and a HisG-ScUra3-HisG repeater cassette. This cassette can be used as a selection marker to introduce genes or to disrupt genes with the advantage that the HisG cassette recombines with itself in subsequent generations. Thus the yeast cell loses the ScUra3 gene during the recombination event and this loss of ScUra3 gene restores back the yeast strain's uracil auxotrophy for subsequent transformation with the same cassette.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">A HisG-ScUra3-HisG cassette was obtained from Nancy DaSilva incorporated in a plasmid designated pNADF11 (Nancy DaSilva, UC Irvine, Calif.). The HisG-ScUra3-HisG cassette was isolated from pNADF11 bp digesting the plasmid with BamHI and EcoRI enzymes and ligating a &#x2dc;3.8 kbp fragment to a BamHI and EcoRI-digested plasmid pPUC19 (New England Biolabs, USA). The resulting plasmid is designated pVR65 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Plasmid pCM14 (Ex. 3A, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) was digested with AatII/SphI and electrophoretically separated on a 1% gel.

A &#x2dc;4293 bp HisG-ScUra3-HisG fragment was isolated and ligated to a &#x2dc;5907 bp fragment from plasmid pCM14, with the inserts isolated. The resulting vector was identified as pCM28 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). It contains the PXYLA gene (with poly-his tag) under the control of the KmPDC1 promoter and ScCYC1 terminator, and the HisG-Ura3-HisG cassette.

<heading id="h-0029" level="1">Cloning of the <i>Kluyveromyces marxianus </i>Xylose Reductase (KmXYL1) Gene and Upstream and Downstream Flanks</heading>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">A 410 bp fragment of a putative <i>K. marxianus </i>xylose reductase (KmXYL1) coding region and approximately 500 bp of the promoter has been determined by a partial genome sequencing of a similar <i>K. marxianus </i>within the G&#xe9;nolevures project (Genomic Exploration of the Hemiascomycetous Yeasts: 12. <i>Kluyveromyces marxianus </i>var. <i>marxianus </i>Bertrand Llorente, Alain Malpertuy, Ga&#xeb;lle Blandin, Fran&#xe7;ois Artiguenave, Patrick Wincker and Bernard Dujon FEBS Letters 487(1) pp. 71-75). Based upon this sequence and some of the known sequences from other yeast xylose reductase consensus, primers were designed to isolate the full KmXYL1 gene sequence and promoter. A genome walking approach was used to obtain sequences upstream and downstream of a KmXYL1 gene sequence from a wild type strain of <i>K. marxianus</i>. A genome walker kit (BD Biosciences, Paolo Alto, Calif.) was used for obtaining the sequence of the upstream and downstream flanks. Genomic DNA from <i>K. marxianus </i>was digested with restriction enzymes from the genome walker kit (Invitrogen, CA). A genomic library made with the fragments was used as template for PCR reactions.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">PCR primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 63 and SEQ. ID. NO. 64 were designed to walk both the 5&#x2032; end and 3&#x2032; end to get the xylose reductase and upstream/downstream flanking sequence. These primers were used to walk along with primers AP1 and AP2 from the genome walker kit (BD Biosciences, CA). This set of primers amplified a &#x2dc;2.5 kbp fragment upstream of the gene. The fragment was sequenced to reveal the sequence of DNA from the extreme ends of the upstream region towards the KmXYL1 gene. Similarly, primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 65 and SEQ. ID. NO. 66 were used to walk along with primers AP1 and AP2 from the genome walker kit. This amplified a &#x2dc;1.8 kbp fragment downstream of the KmXYL1 gene. The fragment was sequenced to reveal the sequence of DNA from the extreme ends of the downstream region away from xylose reductase.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The sequence information obtained from the genome walking allowed the design of primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 67 and SEQ. ID. NO. 68. These primers were used for thermocycling reactions with 500 ng of genomic DNA from <i>K. marxianus</i>. Thermocycling was performed by 30 cycles of 1 minute at 94&#xb0; C., 1 minute at 56&#xb0; C., 3 minutes at 72&#xb0; C., followed by a final incubation of 7 minutes at 72&#xb0; C. using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA). The PCR product was electrophoretically separated on a 0.8% agarose gel. A &#x2dc;3.5 kbp product was isolated and ligated into the pCRII topo-cloning vector to give plasmid pVR95 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>).</p>

This fragment includes the promoter region of the KmXYL1 gene as well as &#x2dc;300 bp of the coding region of the gene. These primers were used for thermocycling reactions with 50 ng of plasmid DNA from pVR95 (Ex. 4A, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). Thermocycling was performed by 30 cycles of 1 minute at 94&#xb0; C., 1 minute at 53&#xb0; C., 1 minute at 68&#xb0; C., and a final incubation of 8 minutes at 68&#xb0; C. using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA). The PCR product was electrophoretically separated, digested with PstI and ligated to pVR29 (Ex. 1C, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that was also digested with PstI. The plasmid obtained by this method was verified for correct orientation of the KmXYL1 gene and promoter region into the pVR29 vector.

<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 71 and SEQ. ID. NO. 72 were designed to amplify a &#x2dc;1.1 kbp fragment from pVR95. This fragment includes a region downstream of the KmXYL1 gene beyond its terminator. These primers were used for thermocycling reactions with 50 ng of plasmid DNA from pVR95. Thermocycling was performed by 30 cycles of 1 minute at 94&#xb0; C., 1 minute at 59&#xb0; C., 1 minute at 68&#xb0; C., a final incubation of 8 minutes at 68&#xb0; C. using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA). Primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 73 and SEQ ID. NO. 74 were used for thermocycling reactions with 50 ng of the first PCR product described above to amplify it. Thermocycling was performed by 30 cycles of 1 minute at 94&#xb0; C., 1 minute at 45&#xb0; C., 1 minute at 68&#xb0; C., a final incubation of 8 minutes at 68&#xb0; C. using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA). The PCR product obtained after the second thermocycling was electrophoretically separated, digested with ApaI and ligated to plasmid pCM18 that was also digested with ApaI, to form vector pCM19 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b</i>). Plasmid pCM19 contained the downstream flank of KmXYL1 gene and the upstream flank of KmXYL1 gene (together with &#x2dc;300 bp of the coding region of the gene), separated by a cassette containing the G418 gene under the control of the ScPDC1 promoter and ScGAL10 terminator. Correct orientation of the KmXYL1 downstream region with regard to the G418 resistance gene was verified.</p>

This plasmid had a non-functional gene (Delta Ura3). The plasmid was digested using KpnI and NotI and used to transform a wild type strain of <i>K. marxianus</i>. The transformants were selected on 5-FOA plates. Colonies that grew on these plates were screened using primers designed in the missing region of the Delta Ura3 gene. Primers were also designed to isolate the entire gene and those fragments were sequenced to indicate that this new shorter non-functional Delta Ura3 gene had replaced the actual native KmUra3 gene in the transformants. The successfully transformed strains were designated CD683. Strain CD683 strain did not grow Sc-Ura plates, indicating that it was a uracil auxotroph.</p>

<p id="p-0152" num="0151">A &#x2dc;<b>5</b>.<b>2</b> kbp fragment containing the upstream and downstream regions of the KmXYL1 gene with a G418 resistance expression cassette in between was obtained by digesting pCM19 with PvuII.

The transformed cells were recovered and plated on 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L yeast peptone, 50 g/L glucose (YPD)+50 &#x3bc;g/ml G418 plates and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 48-96 hrs. 96 transformants that grew on YPD+50 &#x3bc;g/ml G418 plates were replica plated on YPX (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L yeast peptone+xylose 50 g/L)+50 &#x3bc;g/ml G418 plates. 73 out of the 96 transformants failed to grow on YPX+50 &#x3bc;g/ml G418 plates, confirming their inability to use xylose as a carbon source. This inability indicates that the functional KmXYL1 gene had been deleted and replaced with the G418 cassette in a homologous recombination. Those transformants that were unable to use xylose as a carbon source were designated CD804.</p>

<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Separate baffled shake flasks (250 ml capacity) were inoculated with strains CD683 (Ex. 4C) and CD804 (Ex. 4D). Flasks were incubated at 35&#xb0; C. with shaking at 250 rpm and grown overnight. The media consisted of 20 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L peptone, and 100 g/L dextrose. After 18 hours, the cells were spun down at 4000G for 5 minutes, washed with 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer and re-suspended in 0.5 ml breaking buffer. The breaking buffer consisted of 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH7.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 40 mg phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (dissolved in 500 1 DMSO), and 4 Protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, Calif.) in a 200 ml volume. The cells were lysed mechanically using glass beads (Invitrogen, CA) and centrifuged at 14,000 G for 15 minutes. The supernatant was removed and run through a PD-10 desalting column according to the kit protocol (Amersham Bioscience). XR enzyme assay test solution consisted of 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.2 mM NADPH, 0.5 mM D-xylose in a total volume of 1 ml, to which varying amounts of enzyme solution was added and the absorbance was followed at 340 nm. NADPH usage indicates reductase enzyme activity. A blank solution without xylose was used to determine background NADPH usage.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Total protein was determined using Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cysoskeleton #ADV01) with BSA as a standard. The xylose reductase enzyme activity of strain CD683, as indicated by NADPH consumption, was 13.7 mU/mg protein. NAPDH consumption by strain CD804 was consistent with a xylose reductase activity of 4.4 mU/mg protein, rather than the expected activity of zero. This NADPH usage by CD804 is attributed to a non-specific aldose reductase enzyme that is carrying out some conversion of xylose to xylulose. Strains CD683 and CD804 are plated alongside each other on YPX plates. Strain CD804 did not show any growth on those plates at the end of 4 days while strain CD683 grew well on those plates.</p>

Plasmid pVR52 (Ex. 5B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) was also digested with XbaI and BamHI and the fragment so obtained was ligated to the &#x2dc;1.8 kbp fragment from pVR67 to form plasmid vector pVR96 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). This plasmid contains the ScXKS1 gene under the control of the ScTEF1 promoter and ScGal10 terminator. In this vector, the ATG start site of the ScXKS1 gene is about 130 bp away from the end of the ScTEF1 promoter. To reduce this distance to about 70-73 bp, primers identified as SEQ. ID.

Strain CD1065 exhibits a 10-20 hour time lag during which it consumes xylose very slowly. This is attributed to glucose repression of native xylulokinase genes. After this induction period, the xylose consumption rate increases, and strain CD1065 produces about 13 g/L ethanol after 65 hours. Strain CD861 produces ethanol much more rapidly, producing about 18 g/L ethanol after about 20 hours. Strain CD1065 produces about 3.7 g/L xylulose after about 20 hours, but xylulose concentration decreases gradually thereafter. Xylulokinase activity is about 0 for strain CD1065 and about 417 mU/mg for strain CD861. Xylose consumption rates for strain CD861 are approximately double those of strain CD1065. Xylose isomerase activity is about 0.96 U/mg for strain CD1064 and about 1.79 U/mg for strain CD861.

NO. 105 were used to amplify the region containing the KmXYL2 gene and flanks. Five transformants positive for both bands were taken forward for further analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The five selected transformants were inoculated into a liquid medium containing 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 50 g/L xylose (pH 6.5) and incubated at 35&#xb0; C. for 48 hours. 4 gcdw of each was harvested by centrifugation and re-suspended in 50 ml 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 50 g/L xylose, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 7.5 g/L CaCO<sub>3</sub>. The flasks are put into production at 35&#xb0; C. and 70 rpm shaking. Strain CD861 (Ex. 8B) is similarly cultivated to compare the effect of the KmXYL1 and KmXYL2 re-insertions.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Strain CD861 consumes essentially all the xylose in 30 hours, producing 16.1 g/L ethanol in that time. Ethanol yield for strain CD861 was 67%. The five XR+, XDH+transformants all consumed xylose much more slowly, and produced average ethanol yields of about 16%. Strain CD861 produced a xylitol yield of 10%, but the five transformants averaged a xylitol yield of 56%. Xylose reductase activity for strain CD861 was about 2 mU/mg, whereas it ranged from 126-425 mU/mg in the transformants, after 73.5 hours cultivation. Xylitol dehydrogenase activity in strain CD861 was zero, but ranged from 21 to 98 mU/mg in the transformants after 73.5 hours cultivation. The increase in activities of these enzymes indicates that the reinserted KmXYL1 and KmXYL2 genes were functional in the five transformants. Xylose isomerase activity was higher in strain CD861 (&#x2dc;131 mU/mg) than in the five transformants (&#x2dc;26-45 mU/mg). However, xylitol that was present may have inhibited xylose isomerase activity in the five XR+, XDH+transformants, resulting in an artificially low value.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">This data further indicates that the deletion or disruption of the aldose reductase/xylitol dehydrogenase pathway is beneficial in the strains having an exogenous xylose isomerase gene, under these fermentation conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Xylulokinase and xylose isomerase activities for these samples were determined as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">The samples (5-10 ml) were centrifuged and washed once with 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. After washing, the samples were resuspended into Y-PER yeast protein extraction reagent (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA free, Roche). After 20 minutes incubation at room temperature, the cells were centrifuged 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at +4&#xb0; C. Supernatant samples were collected for activity measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Xylulokinase activity was determined by a two-step protocol. In step <b>1</b>, the reaction contained 50 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 5 mM ATP, 6 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 20 mM xylulose. The background reaction was determined by adding water instead of xylose. After adding the enzyme sample, the reactions were incubated at 30&#xb0; C. for 0 and 240 seconds. After the incubation the reactions were stopped by incubating them at 95&#xb0; C. for 5 min. After reaction was stopped 40 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM PEP and 0.2 mM NADH was added to the reaction and absorbance at 340 nm was measured. After measuring the initial absorbance, a mixture of myokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase was added. This reaction was incubated further for 1 hour and absorbance at 340 nm was measured. The xylulokinase activity was calculated from the ADP production during the assays.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Xylose isomerase activity was determined by monitoring the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm at 30&#xb0; C. The reaction contains (in addition to the sample) 100 mM TES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 250 mM xylose, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.6 mM NADH and 2.5 U sorbitol dehydrogenase. The background was detected by measuring the activity without xylose. The xylose isomerase assay was performed in a Cobas Mira automated analyzer (Roche).</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Protein concentrations were determined with the Lowry method (Lowry, O. H., Rosebrough, N. J., Farr, A. L. and Randall, R. J. (1951), Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent, J. Biol. Chem. 193:265-275). Bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was used as a protein standard.</p>

The resuspended cells were transferred into a 250 ml flask containing 1.2 g CaCO<sub>3</sub>. The cultures were incubated at 30&#xb0; C. with 100 rpm shaking. Samples for HPLC (for measuring xylose consumption and ethanol, xylitol, acetate and xylulose production) and OD<sub>600 </sub>measurements were collected daily.

<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Strains Cs/T-1, -25, -34-51 and Cs/417-214/425A and -B produced 2-5 g/L ethanol, with xylitol being the main product for these strains. The wild-type <i>C. sonorensis </i>strain and strains Cs/417-201, -206, -208 and -214 did not produce ethanol under the microaerobic conditions. This indicates that both xylose isomerase and xylulokinase are needed for ethanol production under microaerobic conditions. All XR+strains also produced acetate.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Strains Cs/417-201, -206, -208, -214 and Cs/417-214/425B consumed xylose slowly and no ethanol, xylitol or acetate was produced under these microaerobic conditions. Strain Cs/417-201/425A also consumed xylose slowly and produced some xylitol. At 11 days, strains Cs/417-206 and Cs/417-214 produced 0.7 and 1.2 g/L of xylulose, respectively. This suggests that under these microaerobic conditions, xylulose accumulated in XI+strains that did not have overexpressed XK, and that the amount of xylulose accumulation depends on XI activity level.</p>

The cultivation was continued for 15 days.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Strains Cs/T-25 and -34 produced 2 g/L ethanol during the first 8 days of incubation whereas the wild-type <i>C. sonorensis </i>strain did not produce detectable ethanol. Strains Cs/417-201 and -214 also failed to produce ethanol under these conditions, indicating that both xylose isomerase and xylulokinase genes are needed to obtain anaerobic fermentation ability on xylose in these strains.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Strain Cs/417-214/425A produced &#x2dc;13 g/L ethanol after 4 days and &#x2dc;25 g/L ethanol after 11 days. Yield on xylose to ethanol was approximately 55% after 4 days and 53% after 11 days. Xylose consumption was 22-23 g/L after 4 days and 48-49 g/L after 11 days. Strain Cs/417-214/425B consumed &#x2dc;16 g/L of xylose in 4 days and produced 7 g/L ethanol. This indicates that in these strains, disruption of the native XR/XDH pathway combined with exogenous XI gene expression and XK overexpression is important to achieve good ethanol production. Disruption of both the CsXR and CsXDH genes is seen to provide the best ethanol production under anaerobic conditions.</p>

NO. 150 Phusion HF buffer and 0.2 mM of each dNTP. In this construct, the first methionine encoded as detected at the 5&#x2032; end sequence of the gene served as the initiation methionine, and an in-frame stop codon was included in addition to SbfI restriction sites. Before 3 minutes denaturation, 2 U of Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland) was added.

Plasmid pSO96 is digested with AatII and BsmBI prior to integration. 100 L of cells were plated on Sc-Ura plates and allowed to grow at 37&#xb0; C. until colonies formed. The colonies were streaked onto secondary plates of SC-Ura. The transformants were screened by PCR for the presence of the intact KmURA3 gene with primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 156 and SEQ. ID. NO. 157. A PCR screening for a &#x2dc;450 bp region upstream of the BtXYLA stop codon and just inside of the ScCYC1 terminator is performed with primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 164 and SEQ. ID. NO. 165. Of the transformants testing positive for both the native KmURA3 and BtXYLA gene, eight are selected and designated CD1089-1096, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0268">For determination of xylose isomerase activity, strains were grown at 30&#xb0; C., 250 rpm for &#x2dc;14 hours in YPD (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 100 g/L dextrose). Cells were lysed according to protocol for Y-PER (Pierce #78990). Total protein was determined using Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cysoskeleton #ADV01) with BSA as a standard. Xylose isomerase activities for strains CD806 and CD1089-1096 are as follows:</p>

<p id="p-0275" num="0275">Strains CD804, CD805 and CD806 were separately inoculated to an OD<sub>600 </sub>of 0.1 from YPD agar plates and were grown for 16 hours at 33&#xb0; C. with 250 rpm, in 250 mL baffled shake flasks containing 50 mL YPD supplemented with 50 &#x3bc;g/ml G418. After determining that residual glucose remained in each flask and that the cells were consequently in exponential growth phase, 0.5 g/L cell dry weight equivalents of each strain were harvested by centrifugation and separately resuspended in 250 mL baffled shake flasks containing 47.5 mL YP supplemented with 50 g/L D-xylose. 2.5 ml glucose isomerase (Gensweet SGI; Genencor Inc., CA) (also known as xylose isomerase) was added to the shake-flasks and the cultures were grown at 33&#xb0; C. with 70 rpm. For controls, 0.5 g/L cell dry weight equivalents of strains each of strains CD804, 805 and 806 were separately resuspended in 250 mL baffled shake flasks containing 50 mL YP supplemented with 50 g/L D-xylose where the glucose isomerase was omitted. These shake-flasks were also incubated at 33&#xb0; C. with 70 rpm. Samples were withdrawn at various time intervals and the cells were removed by filtration. Culture supernatant was analyzed for xylose, xylitol and ethanol by HPLC methods.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0276">After 25 hours, strain CD804 (Ex. 4D) had consumed 15 g/L D-xylose and produced about 4.7 g/L of xylitol and 1 g/L of ethanol from the flask containing the glucose isomerase. In contrast, strains CD805 (Ex. 5C) and CD806 (Ex. 6B) had each consumed 25 g/L D-xylose in the presence of glucose isomerase. Strain CD805 produced in this time about 1.9 g/L of xylitol and 7.1 g/L of ethanol. Strain CD806 produced in this time about 1.8 g/L of xylitol and 6.8 g/L of ethanol. Xylulose seems to be consumed by the strains at very high rates, something which is not observed in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. The non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway controls the fermentation rate of xylulose but not of xylose in <i>S. cerevisiae </i>TMB3001. FEM Yeast Res. 2002 August; 2(3):277-82. Johansson B, Hahn-Hagerdal B). Without added glucose isomerase, each of strains CD804, CD805 and CD806 consumed xylose very slowly.</p>

<p id="p-0277" num="0277">A cassette containing the KmPDC1 promoter, PXYLA gene and ScCYC1 terminator was PCR amplified using primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 166 and SEQ. ID. NO. 167, using plasmid pCM29 (Ex. 8A, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) as the template. These primers were designed to incorporate PacI and MluI restriction sites. Thermocycling conditions were an initial incubation of 94&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 94&#xb0; C. for 30 seconds, 50&#xb0; C. for 30 seconds, and 70&#xb0; C. for 3 minutes. This was followed by a final incubation at 70&#xb0; C. for 8 minutes. The product was digested with the above restriction enzymes and a 2.804 kbp fragment so obtained was ligated into fragment obtained by similarly digesting a plasmid designated pSO57 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>) (containing a pKD1 self-replication site), to yield the plasmid pCM48 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>). The transformants were restriction mapped using EcoRI and SbfI, and two were taken forward for sequencing. The entire PXYLA coding region was sequenced and verified to be identical for both transformants to the sequence on plasmid pCM29.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0278">2 &#x3bc;g of undigested plasmid pCM48 was transformed into a strain corresponding to CD806 (Ex. 6B) using to standard electroporation methods. Cells were recovered for four hours in YPX, plated on YPX plates containing 300 &#x3bc;g/ml G418 and 150 &#x3bc;g/ml hygromycin and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 days. This produced a large number of transformants. Several transformants were re-streaked onto identical plates and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for several days. Four transformants were selected and inoculated into &#x2dc;100 ml of YPX in a 250 ml-baffled shake flask and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. with 250 rpm shaking. Strain CD861 was included and biomass prepared in the same manner. After 17 hours, 2 gcdw of each was inoculated into separate 250 mL-baffled shake flasks containing 50 mL media (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L yeast peptone, 50 g/L xylose, 7.5 g/L CaCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and pH 7.0). The four transformants produced about 9-12.3 g/L ethanol after about 40 hours. The parent strain produced no ethanol.</p>
