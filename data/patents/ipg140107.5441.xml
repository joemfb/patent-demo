<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure is directed to a system for managing loading operations and, more particularly, to a system for managing loading operations of haul vehicles.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In worksites such as, for example, quarries, loading machines including wheel loaders, backhoe loaders, track-type loaders, and other types of loaders are used to load material onto haul vehicles. Because the loading machine is an integral part of the quarry operation, it is usually under control of the quarry. Typically, the haul vehicles (e.g., dump-trucks) are not owned by the quarries, but by individual customers. This usually requires quarry personnel to interact with each haul vehicle operator every time they come to the quarry to determine who the customer is and the type and the amount of material desired by the customer. Also, payload information such as, for example the desired type and amount of material for each haul vehicle, needs to be communicated to the quarry personnel who operate the loading machine. Verbal interaction between quarry personnel and haul vehicle operators can be time consuming and prone to error.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The haul vehicle typically drives into the quarry through an entrance where the haul vehicle is identified by quarry personnel. The quarry personnel then dispatch a loading machine to meet the haul vehicle at a particular site to load a desired amount of material onto the haul vehicle. To determine if the haul vehicle has been loaded with the desired amount of material, the haul vehicle is usually driven onto scales and weighed. If the haul vehicle is overloaded, some of the material must be removed. Similarly, if the haul vehicle is underloaded, more material must be added. In these overloading and underloading situations, the haul vehicle must re-cycle through the quarry, returning to the loading site so that the amount of material in the haul vehicle can be modified and to the scales so that the modified payload can be verified. This re-cycle process costs additional time, fuel, and money.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Once the final amount of the material loaded onto the haul vehicle is measured, the measurement is then used for billing and other purposes. These administrative tasks require quarry personnel to correctly match each haul vehicle with a corresponding customer so that an appropriate bill can be delivered to the haul vehicle operator before the operator leaves the quarry. These tasks can also be prone to error. For example, the quarry personnel may deliver the bill to the wrong haul vehicle operator.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One method of improving the efficiency of loading operations at a worksite is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,848,368 (&#x201c;the '368 patent&#x201d;) issued to Allen et al. The '368 patent discloses a method for controllably loading haul vehicles with a material by a mobile loading machine. Each of the haul vehicles has a identification tag located on it. An identification tag reader, located on the mobile loading machine, reads the identification tag and responsively produces a haul vehicle identification signal. The mobile loading machine accesses a customer data file, which includes at least a desired amount of material. The customer data file and the haul vehicle identification signals are compared. A load command signal is produced in response to the comparison. The mobile loading machine loads the haul vehicle in response to the load command signal. The mobile loading machine includes a payload monitoring system to determine the actual amount of material being loaded onto the haul vehicle by the mobile loading machine. The determined actual amount of material is compared with the desired amount of material. Once the value for the actual amount of material loaded onto the haul vehicle is determined, the customer data file is updated accordingly and a customer communication such as a bill including the value of the actual amount of material is prepared in response to the updated customer data file.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the method of the '368 patent may improve the efficiency of loading operations at a worksite by automating many of the quarry-related tasks, its effectiveness may be limited. Specifically, because the method of the '368 patent relies on a payload monitoring system included in the mobile loading machine, the actual amount of material loaded onto the haul vehicle may be inaccurately determined. In particular, over time, the payload monitoring system may drift away from a calibrated setting to give erroneous readings resulting in an over-reporting or under-reporting of the actual amount of material loaded onto the haul vehicle. These misreported results may persist from the payload monitoring system until the payload monitoring system is re-calibrated. Further, because each mobile loading machine may be associated with a different payload monitoring system, different measurements for the same amount of material may be reported, thus leading to inconsistent measurements of the material loaded during different loading operations at the same worksite.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method of the '368 patent may also be limited in its efficiency. In particular, because the presence of a haul vehicle may be determined by an RFID reader included in a mobile loading machine, it may be difficult to keep track of how many haul vehicles are at the worksite and how much time the haul vehicle remains at the quarry while for a loading operation. For example, two haul vehicles may be present at the quarry for loading, and each haul vehicle may be recognized by a different mobile loading machine. Because the mobile loading machines may be unaware of when the haul vehicles arrived at or left the quarry and because the presence of both haul vehicles may be unknown to either mobile loading machine, customers may be unable to accurately assess the productivity of the quarry's loading operations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disclosed system is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a loading system for use with a haul vehicle and a loading machine configured to load material onto the haul vehicle. The loading system includes an identification tag located on the haul vehicle, an identification tag reader configured to recognize the identification tag, and a transmitter configured to deliver a first signal including information related to the identification tag. The loading system also includes a transceiver configured to receive the first signal and deliver a second signal including loading information to the loading machine to initiate loading of the haul vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a method for managing loading operations of a haul vehicle at a loading site. The method includes identifying the haul vehicle at a location prior to the loading site, and responsively producing an identification signal. The method also includes determining a desired amount of material to load onto the haul vehicle based on the identification signal, and responsively producing a load command signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The disclosed loading system may provide for efficient loading of a haul vehicle through a network of communications sub-systems. The disclosed loading system may minimize or eliminate re-cycles of the haul vehicle in order to load the haul vehicle with an expected amount of material while streamlining the loading. More specifically, the disclosed loading system may recognize the haul vehicle as it enters a worksite, when it is being loaded with material, and when it is being weighed to verify the amount of material loaded onto it. The disclosed loading system may also streamline the billing process while providing a customer with information that may be helpful in making tactical decisions. That is, the disclosed loading system may monitor the loading operation and include one or more details about the loading operation on a printed communication, which may be delivered to an operator of the haul vehicle at the end of the loading operation. The amount of material loaded onto the haul vehicle may be measured by a scale, transmitted to a loading machine, and used to determine a reference value for calibrating a payload monitoring system of the loading machine. Thus, the disclosed loading system may also provide for in-situ calibration of the payload monitoring system. The operation of the disclosed loading system will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, haul vehicle <b>12</b> may enter worksite <b>10</b> through gate <b>14</b>.

Registration may include the process of obtaining information about a customer associated with haul vehicle <b>12</b>, such as the name of the customer and billing address associated with haul vehicle <b>12</b>, and storing the information in data source <b>36</b>. Registration may also include associating identification tag <b>26</b> with haul vehicle <b>12</b> by, for example, storing an identifier associated with identification tag <b>26</b> in data source <b>36</b>. Alternatively, all or a portion of the data acquired during registration may be communicated to data source <b>36</b> in any other manner. For example, the name of the customer, the billing address associated with haul vehicle <b>12</b>, and the identifier associated with identification tag <b>26</b> may be stored in data source <b>36</b> prior to haul vehicle <b>12</b> entering worksite <b>10</b>. Further, it is contemplated that all or a portion of the data acquired during registration may alternatively or additionally be stored in the memories and/or storage devices of first, second, and/or third communications sub-systems <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when haul vehicle <b>12</b> enters worksite <b>10</b>, identification tag reader <b>30</b> of first communications sub-system <b>16</b> may read identification tag <b>26</b> to determine the identifier associated with haul vehicle <b>12</b> (Step <b>200</b>). First communications sub-system <b>16</b> may then deliver the identifier to second communications sub-system <b>18</b> at scale house <b>38</b> (Step <b>202</b>). More specifically, first communications sub-system <b>16</b> may include the identifier in an identification signal, and transmit the identification signal to second communications sub-system <b>18</b> via transmitter <b>32</b>. It is contemplated that first communications sub-system <b>16</b> may additionally transmit other information to second communications sub-system <b>18</b>, such as, for example, a time-stamp.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Second communications sub-system <b>18</b> may then determine loading information based on the identifier (Step <b>204</b>). For example, second communications sub-system <b>18</b> may use the identifier to access loading information for haul vehicle <b>12</b> stored in data source <b>36</b>. The loading information may include, for example, a description of haul vehicle <b>12</b>, a type of material to be loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>, and a desired payload amount for haul vehicle <b>12</b>. Some or all of the loading information may have been previously communicated to data source <b>36</b> in the form of an electronic and/or paper customer order including, for example, the customer's desired type and amount of material <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Second communications sub-system <b>18</b> may then deliver the loading information to loading machine <b>20</b> (Step <b>206</b>). More specifically, second communications sub-system <b>18</b> may include the loading information in a load command signal and transmit the load command signal to loading machine <b>20</b> via transceiver <b>34</b>. Loading machine <b>20</b> may receive the load command signal via transceiver <b>40</b>. It should be appreciated that upon receiving the load command signal, loading machine <b>20</b> may be dispatched to load haul vehicle <b>12</b>. For example, loading machine <b>20</b> may be driven from a first location of worksite <b>10</b> (e.g., scale house <b>38</b>) to a second location (e.g., the loading site) of worksite <b>10</b>, where it may rendezvous with haul vehicle <b>12</b>. Identification tag reader <b>42</b> of loading machine <b>20</b> may read identification tag <b>26</b> to, for example, verify that haul vehicle <b>12</b> is the machine that loading machine <b>20</b> has been dispatched to load.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Loading machine <b>20</b> may then load material <b>24</b> onto haul vehicle <b>12</b> (Step <b>208</b>). For example, loading machine <b>20</b> may incrementally lift material <b>24</b> (e.g., by the bucket-full), and load it onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>. As loading machine <b>20</b> loads haul vehicle <b>12</b>, payload monitoring system <b>44</b> may determine an amount of material <b>24</b> being loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b> such that haul vehicle <b>12</b> may be loaded with about the desired amount of material <b>24</b> (e.g., as requested by the load command signal information received via transceiver <b>40</b>). In determining the amount of material <b>24</b> being loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>, payload monitoring system <b>44</b> may determine any number of other values related to the amount of payload loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>. For example, payload monitoring system <b>44</b> may monitor the number of bucket-fulls of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>, and compare the number of bucket-fulls with the amount of material <b>24</b> per bucket-full to determine the amount of material <b>24</b> being loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Loading machine <b>20</b> may then deliver payload information to second communications sub-system <b>18</b> of scale house <b>38</b> (Step <b>210</b>). More specifically, loading machine <b>20</b> may include the payload information in a payload signal and deliver the payload signal to second communications sub-system <b>18</b> via transceiver <b>40</b>. The payload information may include, for example, the identifier of haul vehicle <b>12</b>, at least one time-stamp, and/or an indication of the determined actual amount of material loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>, such as, for example, the amount of material <b>24</b> per bucket-full and the number of bucket-fulls of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>. It is contemplated that the payload information may additionally or alternatively include any other information, if desired. The payload signal may be received by second communications sub-system <b>18</b> via transceiver <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">After being loaded with material <b>24</b>, haul vehicle <b>12</b> may then proceed to scale <b>22</b>, to be weighed (Step <b>212</b>). Identification tag reader <b>50</b> of third communications sub-system <b>46</b> may read identification tag <b>26</b> to determine the identifier associated with haul vehicle <b>12</b>. The weight of mobile machine <b>12</b>, as measured by scale <b>22</b>, may be displayed on interface <b>48</b>. It is contemplated that other information may additionally or alternatively be displayed on interface <b>48</b> before, during, and/or after the weighing of haul vehicle <b>12</b>. The weight of haul vehicle <b>12</b> may also be used to verify the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>. It is contemplated that the tare weight of haul vehicle <b>12</b> may be communicated to third communications sub-system <b>46</b> in any manner such as, for example, via a wireless transmission from second communications sub-system <b>18</b>. The weight of haul vehicle <b>12</b> may be compared to the tare weight of haul vehicle <b>12</b> stored in the memory and/or storage device of third communications sub-system <b>46</b>. It should be appreciated that the weight of haul vehicle <b>12</b> may alternatively be compared to another predetermined weight of haul vehicle <b>12</b>, such as, for example, the fully loaded weight of haul vehicle <b>12</b>, to verify the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>. It is also contemplated that the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b> may alternatively be determined by second communications sub-system <b>18</b>. For example, second communications sub-system <b>18</b> may compare the weight of haul vehicle <b>12</b> as determined by scale <b>22</b> to the tare weight of haul vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The determined amount of material <b>24</b> may then be compared to the desired amount of material <b>24</b> to determine whether the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b> falls within a predetermined range of the desired amount (Step <b>214</b>). The comparison of the determined amount of material <b>24</b> and the desired amount of material <b>24</b> may be carried out by second and/or third communications sub-systems <b>18</b>, <b>46</b>. For example, second communications sub-system <b>18</b> may deliver the desired amount of material <b>24</b> to third communications sub-system <b>46</b>, and third communications sub-system <b>46</b> may compare the determined amount of material <b>24</b> to the desired amount of material <b>24</b>. Third communications sub-system <b>46</b> may deliver the results of the comparison to second communications sub-system <b>18</b> via transceiver <b>52</b>. For example, transceiver <b>52</b> may deliver a weight signal including at least an identifier of haul vehicle <b>12</b>, the weight of haul vehicle <b>12</b> to second communications sub-system <b>18</b>, and the result of the comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The operator of haul vehicle <b>12</b> may be directed based on the comparison of the determined amount of material <b>24</b> to the desired amount of material <b>24</b>. For example, if it is determined that the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b> is outside the predetermined range of the desired weight stored in the memory and/or storage device of third communications sub-system <b>46</b>, the operator may be directed to return haul vehicle <b>12</b> to loading machine <b>20</b> to correct the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b> (Step <b>216</b>). More specifically, the operator may be directed to return haul vehicle <b>12</b> to the loading site so that loading machine <b>20</b> may remove at least a portion of material <b>24</b> from haul vehicle <b>12</b> or load additional material <b>24</b> onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>. The operator may be directed by interface <b>48</b>. For example, one or more of traffic lights <b>56</b> may be illuminated to indicate that the operator should direct haul vehicle <b>12</b> to return haul vehicle <b>12</b> to loading machine <b>20</b>. It should be appreciated, however, that the operator of haul vehicle <b>12</b> may be directed in any other manner, such as, for example, by one or more messages displayed on the LED of interface <b>48</b>. It is contemplated that, upon detecting that the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b> is outside the predetermined range, third communications sub-system <b>46</b> may deliver a fault signal to second communications sub-system <b>18</b> indicating that payload monitoring system <b>44</b> of loading machine <b>20</b> may have inaccurately determined the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>. In this manner, second communications sub-system <b>18</b> may alert quarry personnel that payload monitoring system <b>44</b> may require recalibration, repair and/or replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Alternatively, if it is determined that the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b> is within the predetermined range, the loading operation may end (Step <b>218</b>). For example, the operator of haul vehicle <b>12</b> may be directed to proceed out of worksite <b>10</b>. For example, one or more of traffic lights <b>56</b> may be illuminated to indicate that the operator should direct haul vehicle <b>12</b> to proceed out of worksite <b>10</b>. It should be appreciated, however, that the operator of haul vehicle <b>12</b> may be directed in any other manner, such as, for example, by one or more messages displayed on the LED of interface <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, printer <b>54</b> may print a communication for delivery to the operator of haul vehicle <b>12</b> and/or customer associated with haul vehicle <b>12</b>. The printed communication may include, for example, an invoice or any other type of report including information related to the loading of haul vehicle <b>12</b>, such as the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b> and/or one or more time-stamps. It should be appreciated that interface <b>48</b> may further indicate that the operator may pick up the printed communication, for example, at printer <b>54</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the printed communication may be delivered to the customer in any other manner, such as, for example, via post. It should also be appreciated that printer <b>54</b> may additionally print a report for the customer including, for example, an amount of time it took to load haul vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The amount of material <b>24</b>, as determined by scale <b>22</b>, may also be used to recalibrate payload monitoring system <b>44</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary recalibration operation for payload monitoring system <b>44</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the amount of material <b>24</b>, as determined by scale <b>22</b> may be compared to the amount of material as determined by payload monitoring system <b>44</b> (Step <b>300</b>). This comparison may be carried out, for example, by loading machine <b>20</b>, second communications sub-system <b>18</b>, and/or third communications sub-system <b>46</b>. As such, it is contemplated that loading machine <b>20</b> may deliver, via transceiver <b>40</b>, the amount of material <b>24</b> as determined by payload monitoring system <b>44</b> to second communications sub-system <b>18</b> and/or third communications sub-system <b>18</b>. The comparison may be used to determine a delta value (Step <b>302</b>). The delta value may be positive or negative, and may indicate an amount by which payload monitoring system <b>44</b> may be recalibrated to obtain substantially more accurate readings of the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b>. The magnitude delta value may then be compared to a predetermined threshold to determine whether the reading of the amount of material <b>24</b> loaded onto haul vehicle <b>12</b> may be substantially accurate (Step <b>304</b>). If the magnitude of the delta value is greater than the threshold, then payload monitoring system <b>44</b> may be recalibrated (Step <b>306</b>). For example, payload monitoring system <b>44</b> may recalibrate itself by adjusting a tare weight reading of an empty bucket of loading machine <b>20</b> by the delta value. It should be appreciated, however, that the delta value may additionally or alternatively indicate that the readings of payload monitoring system <b>44</b> may be undesirably affected by other factors such as, for example, wear and tear, dust, moisture, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The disclosed loading system and method may provide for efficient control over a loading operation while minimizing the amount of re-cycles needed for the haul vehicle to be properly loaded. Specifically, because the disclosed loading system may use both a payload monitoring system included in a loading machine and a scale to measure the amount of material loaded onto the haul vehicle, the actual amount of material loaded onto the haul vehicle may be determined with an increased or maximized degree of accuracy. In particular, the measurements of the scale may verify the measurements of the payload monitoring system, thus essentially detecting inaccurate measurements of the payload monitoring system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Over time, the payload monitoring system may drift away from a calibrated setting to yield inaccurate measurements resulting in over-reporting or under-reporting of the actual amount of material loaded onto the haul vehicle. Thus, if the haul vehicle is directed to re-cycle after being weighed by the scale, the re-cycle may indicate that the payload monitoring system of the loading machine may require recalibration, repair, and/or replacement. By detecting that the payload monitoring system may require recalibration, repair, and/or replacement after as few as one inaccurate measurement, the payload monitoring system may be recalibrated, repaired, and/or replaced before making more inaccurate measurements that may lead to undesired re-cycles, thus saving time and/or money during loading operations. Further, the payload monitoring system may be recalibrated in-situ, thus reducing or eliminating recalibration costs.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further still, because multiple loading machines may be associated with respective payload monitoring systems in the disclosed loading system, inconsistent measurements among the payload monitoring systems may be partially or entirely avoided. Similarly, because the same scale may be used to measure the amount of payload loaded on a haul vehicle during each loading operation, inconsistent measurements between separate loading operations may be partially or entirely avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The disclosed loading system may further provide an efficient system for streamlining loading of a haul vehicle at a worksite. Specifically, because identification tag readers may be used to identify the haul vehicle at an entrance to the worksite and at a scale of the worksite, and because systems at the entrance to the worksite, the scale, and a loading machine of the worksite may be in communication with each other, the process of loading the haul vehicle may be efficiently monitored.
