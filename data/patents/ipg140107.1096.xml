<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an apparatus for and a method of automatically welding a flange to a guide thimble tube in the manufacturing process for the guide thimble tube, which is a major element of a nuclear fuel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A nuclear fuel assembly is an assembly of fuel elements that can be handled in one entity when loaded into and unloaded from a nuclear reactor. For example, a nuclear fuel assembly used for a light-water reactor (called a fuel assembly) is composed of a plurality of fuel rods (fuel elements) forming a bundle of a rectangular shape, at both ends of which a perforated support plate is disposed to pass coolant, and at the intermediate of which a support grid is mounted for the fuel rods to be spaced apart from each other. The individual fuel rod is formed of a hollow zicaloy tube having a length of about 4 mm, inside of which sintered uranium pellets are stacked. Typically, the fuel bundle for a boiling water reactor is formed of about 60 fuel rods and one for a pressurized water reactor is formed of about 230 fuel rods.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such fuel assembly, a skeletal structure to which fuel rod is loaded is called a &#x201c;fuel assembly skeleton.&#x201d; The fuel assembly skeleton is formed of an upper end fitting, a lower end fitting, a guide tube, an instrument tube, and so on. These components are connected to each other through a welding or other mechanical method. In the nuclear fuel assembly, the assembly skeleton functions to keep a gap between the individual fuel rods and hold them in place. The assembly skeleton forms a basic structure of the nuclear fuel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the above assembly skeleton, the guide tube is an internal structure installed inside of a nuclear reactor for the purpose of guiding of smooth entry of the control rod. The starting, interrupting and output-controlling of a nuclear reactor are carried out by entering the control rod (a neutron absorber) into the reactor core. The guide tube has important roles in determining a proper location, forming a flow path to cool the fuel properly and so on, without damaging the integrity of the fuel assembly. In addition, the guide tube serves as a path for the poison rod, the nuclear source rod and so on, as well as the control rod.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such a guide tube is fixed to under the upper end fitting and a control rod or the like is charged from the upper part of the reactor to enter the guide tube. The connection with the upper end fitting is carried out by a flange attached to one end of the guide. Thus, a flange must be attached to the guide tube.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The guide tube is structured such that its lower portion has a smaller inner diameter for various equipments charged from the upper part not to be damaged by impact when being dropped. This is to reduce the descending speed of the control rod. In addition, two flow holes are formed so that coolant water can be filled inside the guide tube.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The guide tube having the above-described structure had a sophisticated shape and thus it is very difficult to manufacture the guide tube in an automatic way. In addition, the guide tube plays a very important role in the nuclear reaction and thus must be manufactured with a great precision.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, since the welding of a flange or the like to the guide tube must be performed with a great precision, a manual manufacturing process has been carried out for the purpose of quality, which leads to a time consuming. However, considering the quantity of guide tubes to be manufactured, it must be considered a way of improving production efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A conventional welding method of connecting a flange to a guide tube is mostly performed manually. As previously mentioned, it is because the shape of the guide tube is not simple and thus an automatic welding is not easy. In particular, in order to weld a flange, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the guide tube and the flange are connected through an interference fit welding using manually-operated equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Conventionally, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, a pressure-inserting step is formed in the flange <b>2</b> and thus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>the pressure-inserting step is forcibly inserted into the tube <b>1</b>. Then, a welding is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The above welding method requires a separate pressure-fitting process and forms an internal step during the pressure inserting, thereby necessitating a separate machining process. In addition, in case of manually working on a larger amount of guide tubes, there is a concern about diseases in the musculoskeletal systems, due to the tube length of about 4000 mm and weight of about 2.5 kg.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, in terms of productivity and quality, the working time is extended and not consistent to degrade its production efficiency. In case of expediting the process in order to improve the productivity, the quality is degraded.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems in welding a flange to a guide thimble tube in the manufacturing process for the guide thimble tube, and it is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for and a method of automatically welding a flange to a guide thimble tube.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">More specifically, it is another object of the invention to provide an apparatus for and a method of automatically welding a flange to a guide thimble tube, in which the flange welding employs a butt-welding mode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>, not an interference-fitting method, thereby achieving automation.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Hereinafter, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>to <b>9</b><i>b</i>, a method of automatically welding a flange to a guide thimble tube in a nuclear fuel assembly using the automatic welding apparatus <b>100</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The method of automatically welding the flange to the guide thimble tube in the nuclear fuel assembly according to the present invention includes the steps of: supplying the flange <b>2</b>; inserting the flange <b>2</b> into the welding chamber <b>330</b> after the tube <b>1</b> is interlockingly joined to the flange <b>2</b>; sealing the inside of the welding chamber <b>330</b> to which the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> are inserted and the inside of the tube <b>1</b> from the outside; welding end surfaces of the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> into one welded surface <b>3</b> while fixing and rotating the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> after filling argon atmospheric gas after the sealing step; transferring the tube <b>1</b>, to which the flange <b>2</b> is welded, to the conveying unit <b>500</b>; laterally conveying the tube <b>1</b> transferred to the conveying unit <b>500</b> to the tremor measuring part <b>700</b>; and measuring tremor in order to judge whether or not the flange <b>2</b> has been welded to the tube <b>1</b> on the same axis within an error tolerance while rotating the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> after mounting them to the tremor measuring part <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Through the flange supplying step, the flange supplying unit <b>200</b> discharges the flange <b>2</b>, and the flange <b>2</b> is supplied coaxially with the tube <b>1</b> by conveying the conveying block <b>230</b> in the axial direction of the tube <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In order to insert the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> into the welding chamber <b>230</b>, the tube <b>1</b> is conveyed to the upper face of the tube guide <b>515</b> of the conveying unit <b>500</b>, which is mounted to interlock with the automatic welding apparatus <b>100</b>, by the conveying unit (not shown) interlocking with the welded surface processing part (not shown). The tube <b>1</b> conveyed to the upper face of the tube guide <b>515</b> is inserted into the welding position tube fixing hole <b>515</b><i>a </i>after a rolling movement in a lateral direction by the inclined upper face of the tube guide <b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The tube <b>1</b> seated on the welding position tube arms <b>522</b> formed on the gripper <b>521</b> of the axially conveying unit <b>520</b>, and then, axially conveyed toward the welding unit <b>300</b> by the gripper conveying unit including the motor <b>525</b>, the pulleys <b>526</b> and the belt <b>526</b><i>a </i>or including the pneumatic cylinder <b>524</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a </i>or <b>7</b><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The tube <b>1</b> conveyed axially is interlockingly joined with the flange <b>2</b> located on the conveying block <b>230</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b>, which are joined interlockingly with each other, are continuously conveyed by the axially conveying unit <b>520</b>, inserted into the outer circumference of the mandrel guide <b>347</b>, and then, inserted into the welding chamber <b>330</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> inserted into the welding chamber <b>330</b> stops the axial conveyance while the flange <b>2</b> is in contact with the stopper face <b>344</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>). In this instance, the welded surfaces <b>3</b> of the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>) are located below the welding torch <b>351</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">After that, the mandrel shaft <b>344</b> moves toward the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> by an action of the pneumatic cylinder <b>341</b> of the mandrel unit <b>340</b>, and then is inserted into the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b>. When the mandrel shaft <b>344</b> is inserted into the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b>, the mandrel shaft slopes <b>345</b> jut the protruding chucks <b>346</b> in a circumferential direction of the mandrel guide <b>347</b> through the chuck holes <b>346</b><i>a </i>to thereby fix the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">After the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> are fixed by the mandrel shaft <b>344</b>, by the above-mentioned sealing step, the elastic ring <b>325</b> of the chamber side sealing unit <b>320</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>to <b>4</b><i>c</i>) expands in a central direction by pneumatic pressure to thereby shield the outer circumferential surface of the tube <b>1</b> from the tube inlet <b>334</b>. At the end portion of the tube <b>1</b>, which is located outside the welding chamber <b>330</b>, the sealing bar <b>411</b> of the stopper side sealing unit <b>400</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is inserted to the inside of the tube <b>1</b> passing through the tube through hole <b>1</b>&#x2032;, and then, the sealing ring <b>412</b> expands by the pneumatic pressure to thereby shield the inside of the tube <b>1</b> from the outside, whereby it is prevented that the external air containing oxygen is introduced to the inside of the welding chamber <b>330</b>. In the above state, if a vacuum valve (not shown) and an argon valve (not shown) are used, inert gas, such as argon gas, fills the inside of the welding chamber <b>330</b> as the same time when the inside air of the welding chamber <b>330</b> is discharged, whereby chemical deformations of the tube <b>1</b> and the flange <b>2</b> by oxidation during welding can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">When filling of inert gas into the welding chamber <b>330</b> is finished, by the welding step, the servo motor <b>360</b> and the timing belt <b>301</b> rotate the mandrel <b>343</b> and mandrel shaft <b>344</b>, which fixes the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b>. While the mandrel rotates, the welding torch <b>351</b> lowers in such a way as to be adjacent to the welded surfaces <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>) of the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b>, and then, the welded surfaces <b>3</b> are welded.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">After the welding of the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> is finished, the sealing of the chamber side sealing unit <b>320</b> and the sealing of the stopper side sealing unit <b>400</b> are released, and fixation of the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> by the mandrel shaft <b>344</b> is also released, and then, the mandrel shaft <b>344</b> is returned to its original position. The tube <b>1</b> to which the unfixed flange <b>2</b> is welded is conveyed to the conveying unit <b>500</b> by the axially conveying unit <b>520</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>to <b>7</b><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">After that, the laterally conveying unit <b>510</b> laterally conveys the tube <b>1</b> conveyed to the conveying unit <b>500</b>, so that the tube <b>1</b> is located in the measuring position tube fixing hole <b>515</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Next, the tube <b>1</b> located on the measuring position tube fixing hole <b>515</b><i>b </i>is conveyed to the tremor measuring part <b>700</b> by the axially conveying unit <b>520</b>&#x2032; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>c</i>) mounted axially. The tube <b>1</b> conveyed by the axially conveying unit <b>520</b>&#x2032; stops the axial conveyance if the flange <b>2</b> is in contact with the stopper <b>730</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>). In this instance, the flange <b>2</b> is located beneath the probe <b>710</b>, and the end portion of the tube <b>1</b> welded with the flange <b>2</b> is located between the upper roller <b>723</b> and a pair of the lower rollers <b>721</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">When the end portion of the tube <b>1</b> welded with the flange <b>2</b> is located between the upper roller <b>723</b> and a pair of the lower rollers <b>721</b>, the motor <b>722</b> is moved downwardly by the conveying cylinder <b>725</b>, and the tube <b>1</b> is fixed by the upper roller <b>723</b> and the lower rollers <b>721</b>. After that, the probe <b>710</b> is moved downwardly by pneumatic pressure, and then, is in contact with the outer surface of the flange <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">After the probe <b>710</b> is in contact with the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> is fixed between the upper roller <b>723</b> and the lower rollers <b>721</b>, the upper roller <b>723</b> is rotated by the motor <b>722</b> to thereby rotate the stopper <b>730</b>, the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The probe <b>710</b> is in contact with the outer surface of the flange <b>2</b> and outputs a vertical movement width of the outer surface of the flange <b>2</b> by the rotation of the tube <b>1</b> to an external indicator (not shown). Through changes of the vertical movement width during the rotation of the flange <b>2</b>, the user can inspect whether or not the tube <b>1</b> and the flange <b>2</b> are welded on the same axis within the error tolerance. In this instance, if the vertical movement width (tremor) of the flange <b>2</b> is within the error tolerance, the next step will be carried out, but if the vertical movement width exceeds the error tolerance, the step is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">When the flange <b>2</b> is welded on the same axis with the tube <b>1</b> within the error tolerance, the tube <b>1</b> is located at the center of the conveying unit <b>500</b> by the axially conveying unit <b>520</b>&#x2032; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>). After that, the tube <b>1</b> is automatically conveyed to the inner diameter processing part (not shown) by the laterally conveying unit <b>510</b>. The inner diameter processing part is a device to make a portion, which protrudes on the inner welded surfaces <b>3</b> of the flange <b>2</b> and the tube <b>1</b> by welding, flat.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Through the above-mentioned steps, the automatic welding apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present invention can automatically weld and join the tube <b>1</b> and the flange <b>2</b>, which form the guide thimble tube. In the above steps, operations of the flange supplying unit <b>200</b>, the chamber side sealing unit <b>320</b>, the welding torch group <b>350</b>, the stopper side sealing unit <b>400</b> and the conveying unit <b>500</b> are controlled by the controlling part <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">While the present invention has been described with reference to the particular illustrative embodiment, it is not to be restricted by the embodiment but only by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.</p>
