<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to rocket engine turbopumps, and more specifically to an inter-propellant thrust seal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a rocket engine, a turbopump drives two pumps on a common rotor shaft with one pump for a liquid fuel and the second pump for a liquid oxidizer. Such fuel and oxidizer&#x2014;such as liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen&#x2014;are combustible when mixed together. Thus, inter-propellant seals are used to purge seals that separate the fuel from the oxidizer. A thrust seal is also required to balance out loads that form on the rotor shaft from blades or other fluid reaction surfaces.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An inter-propellant thrust seal for a turbopump with multiple seals that form two purge cavities in which a non-reactive gas or liquid is delivered to prevent two liquids or gases from leaking through the seals and reacting, and where the purge gas or liquid is also used to react on a thrust piston secured to the rotor shaft to provide for an axial balance from other forces that act in an axial direction on the rotor shaft. The combination of a purge fluid for the inter-propellant seals along with using the purge fluid for the thrust balance reduces parts and complexity in the turbopump in order to reduce both size and weight in the turbopump for a rocket engine.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An inter-propellant thrust seal for a turbopump in a rocket engine is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and includes a rotor shaft <b>11</b> with a thrust piston <b>12</b> rotatably secured to the rotor shaft <b>11</b>. A stationary housing <b>13</b> includes support for a forward seal <b>14</b> and an aft seal <b>15</b>. On the outside of the two seals <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> would be a fuel and an oxidizer that must not be allowed to leak passed the seals and react with one another. For example, a fuel could be outside the forward seal <b>14</b> and an oxidizer could be outside of the aft seal <b>15</b>. A sleeve <b>16</b> supports the forward seal and forms a forward purge cavity <b>19</b>. A thrust piston <b>12</b> supports the aft seal and forms an aft purge cavity <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To prevent leakages from the two reactive liquids or gases, a purge cavity is used and pressurized with a non-reactive fluid supplied through one or more purge fluid supply lines <b>17</b> into chambers <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>. The pressure of the purge fluid must be higher than the pressures of both the fuel and the oxidizer to prevent either from leaking passed the respective seal and into the purge cavities <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>. The purge fluid will leak past the seals <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and prevent the reactive fluids from leaking across the seals.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An aft purge cavity <b>18</b> also forms a pressure chamber (P<b>1</b>) for the thrust piston <b>12</b>. Because the aft purge cavity <b>18</b> is larger in cross sectional area than the forward purge cavity <b>19</b>, the pressure of the purge fluid will act on the larger surface area of the thrust piston <b>12</b> and apply an axial force to the rotor shaft <b>11</b> for axial balance. The same purge fluid for the inter-propellant seal is used for the thrust piston <b>12</b>. With this combination, the turbopump can be made lighter and with less parts. The size of the thrust piston <b>12</b> can be changed to accommodate any axial loads applied to the rotor shaft from such places as the turbine blades.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A second embodiment of an inter-propellant thrust seal for a turbopump in a rocket engine is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and includes a rotor shaft <b>21</b> with a thrust piston <b>22</b> rotatably secured to the rotor shaft <b>21</b>. A stationary housing <b>23</b> includes support for two forward seals <b>24</b> and <b>31</b> and two aft seals <b>25</b> and <b>30</b>. On the outside of the two seals <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> would be a fuel and an oxidizer that must not be allowed to leak passed the seals and react with one another. For example, a fuel could be outside the forward seal <b>24</b> and an oxidizer could be outside of the aft seal <b>25</b>. A sleeve <b>26</b> supports the forward first seal <b>24</b> and forward second seal <b>31</b> (formed by a raised portion of the sleeve <b>26</b>) forms a forward purge cavity <b>29</b>. A thrust piston <b>22</b> supports the aft first seal <b>25</b> and with a second aft seal <b>30</b> forms an aft purge cavity <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">To prevent leakages from the two reactive liquids or gases, the aft purge cavity <b>28</b> is used and vented through one or more aft vent passages <b>32</b> with a non-reactive fluid supplied through one or more purge fluid supply lines <b>27</b> into purge chambers <b>28</b> and <b>29</b>. One or more forward vent passages <b>33</b> vents fluid from the forward purge cavity <b>29</b>. The pressure of the purge cavities <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> must be lower than the pressures of both the fuel and the oxidizer and supply line <b>27</b> to prevent either from leaking passed the respective seals <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> or into the space between seals <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>. The purge fluid will leak past seals <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> and prevent the reactive fluids from leaking across the seals.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An aft purge cavity <b>28</b> also forms a pressure chamber for the thrust piston <b>22</b>. Because the aft purge cavity <b>28</b> is larger in cross sectional area than the forward purge cavity <b>29</b>, the pressure of the purge fluid will act on the larger surface area of the thrust piston <b>22</b> and apply an axial force to the rotor shaft <b>21</b> for axial balance. The same purge fluid for the inter-propellant seal is used for the thrust piston <b>22</b>. With this combination, the turbopump can be made lighter and with less parts. The size of the thrust piston can be changed to accommodate any axial loads applied to the rotor shaft from such places as the turbine blades.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment, a purge fluid is supplied through the radial purge fluid line <b>17</b> to flow across the two inner bearing surfaces and then into the two purge chambers <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> to push out any of the reactive fluids on the outsides of the two outer seals <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. The purge fluid will just mix with the two reactive fluids outside of the two outer bearings <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> embodiment, the purge fluid and any leaking reactive fluid that passes across the two outer seals <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> will be collected in the two purge chambers <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> and vented out through the two vent passages <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>. in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the purge fluid operating within the aft purge chamber <b>18</b> or <b>28</b> will produce an axial thrust on the axial thrust piston <b>12</b> or <b>22</b> and thus on the rotor shaft <b>11</b> or <b>21</b>.</p>
