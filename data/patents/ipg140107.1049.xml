<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A light weight hinged top (top) is described to be used as a container top. This particular model provides ease of use and requires significantly less material for manufacturing. A novel way of connecting the top and the container is using a fork spring which has three fingers like structures. The two outer structures are smaller than the middle one. The fork spring due to its resiliency brings the container top back to closing position thus providing self closing and self reseal ability for the top. A guide member also helps to position the top when it opens and closes. The top can be made using metal, biodegradable materials or any flexible material. The top can be used for cans or bottles.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/195,372, filed on Aug. 20, 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,215,513. The U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/195,372 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all of its teachings.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to a light weight hinged top product that has self sealing quality and method of using the product as a container top. More specifically, this disclosure relates to using a hinged self sealing container top to prevent spillage, increase storage and use less metal to make the product.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The current market provides containers with hard top cap enclosure with an opening mechanism. Some cans once they are opened have to be consumed fully or stored in a separate container. The other tops used for bottles and cans do not provide the resealing opportunity. They are also very process intensive to make. In order to save process time, use of excessive and expensive metals, there is need to find a process that is easier and user friendly.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The instant disclosure describes a low weight hinged top for a container as a product and method of using the product. In one embodiment, the container has a peripheral seam that is folded to receive the light weight hinged top and to cover the aperture of the container. In another embodiment, the peripheral seam connects with the light weight hinged top through a fork spring and a guide member. In another embodiment, the guide member enables the container and the light weight hinged top to be connected once the light weight hinged top is open. The guide member also helps realign, reclose and reseal when the pressure inside the can increases and the light weight hinged top is pushed upwards.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, the light weight hinged top is at least one of a one part top and/or two part top. In one embodiment, the two part top comprises of a panel and the dome top that can be used to seal a container filled with liquid, solid and semi-solid materials. In another embodiment, the light weight hinged top may comprise only of two part top that has no panel. In one embodiment, material that is being used to make light weight hinged top is biodegradable, synthetic (light weight hinged top for a container and container top are interchangeably used throughout the instant application). In one preferred embodiment, the light weight hinged top can be made up of aluminum and use 60-85% less aluminum than currently being used by the industry. In one embodiment, the container top should be able to withstand 40-95 PSI pressure to maintain its structural integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, the use of less material may be accomplished by reducing the size of the light weight hinged top in the two part and/or the one part design. In another embodiment, the use of less material may be achieved for the two part and/or the one part design by eliminating the opening tab currently used by the industry.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, a guide member is incorporated to provide structural integrity to the junction and provide guidance for the fork spring and the convex fold of the two part top to open and close properly. In another embodiment, the panel may be offset on one side from the peripheral seam of the container. The guide member may be longer on this side than the side where there is no offset. In another embodiment, the panel may be close to the peripheral seam without any offset on any side. The guide member in this case may be equal in length on both sides.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, as an improvement to the pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/195,372 a fork spring is used as a hinge to help keep the low weight hinged top in place. In another embodiment, the fork spring has three finger like structures. Two of the outside finger like structures on the outside is of equal length and the middle finger like structure is longer than the two outside finger like structures. In one embodiment, the fork spring has a convex fold on the fingers to receive the convex fold of the side for the one part top or the two part top. In one embodiment, the fork spring enables attachment, correct alignment and positioning of the dome top's sides relative to the peripheral seam for the container top and convex fold for the one part top and/or the two part top. In another embodiment, the fork spring prevents the dome top from completely separating from the panel. In another embodiment, when the user uses pressure to open the container from the top, the two part top separates from the peripheral seam of the container and is held in place by a fork spring. In another embodiment, the guide member helps guides the two part top and the peripheral seam to be in correct alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the two part top may comprise of a panel with an aperture and a dome top. In another embodiment, the two part top may comprise of just the dome top. In one embodiment, the dome top is convex in the center and on the two ends folds into a convex fold to receive a guide member and sit on the convex finger bend of the fork spring. In another embodiment, a fork spring forms a hinge to hold the dome top to the peripheral seam. In another embodiment, the fork spring may also be attached to the panel. In one embodiment, the peripheral seam of the container and the two part top come together to form a junction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the one part top comprises of a peripheral seamed panel with a two-fold separable seam designed as an inverted flange that integrates the dome top to the peripheral seam of the container. In one embodiment, one part top has a tear line that joins the one part top and the peripheral seam and helps seal the container. In one embodiment, the one part top is made up of two components a dome top and inverted flange that make up the separable seam. In one embodiment, the two-fold separable seam comprises of a curved lip. The curved lip helps create a weakened indentation for the inverted flange to open the dome top. The one part top separates from the container peripheral seam using a tear line and helps seal/reclose and leak proof the contents of the can once it is in closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method of using, in one embodiment is by sealing the container using the light weight hinged top. In another embodiment, a user if they need to open they will simply press on the center of the light weight hinged top downwards. The pressure, in one embodiment, separates the light weight hinged top from the peripheral seam of the container top for two part top or the one part top. The tear line in one part top, in one embodiment, around the dome top periphery is broken and the dome top separates from the panel completely. In one part top the mechanism is a bit different. In one embodiment, to open the two part top pressure is applied in the center. The guide member is loosened from the fork spring convex flange and the convex fold of the two part top. The second side of the dome top is released and the first side of the dome top is still attached to the fork spring. The only physical connection, in one embodiment, that the dome top has is with the fork spring after is has been opened. The fork spring keeps the dome top in place and helps to bring it back up when the pressure from within raises the dome top to the mating surface. Once the dome top is in position the one part top and/or the two part top using the fork spring become flush with the container peripheral folded seam the can is resealed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, a lip actuated self closing light weight hinged top is disclosed. The light weight hinged top may also perform a function of self closing because of the fork spring attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A novel product for closing a container using a light weight hinged top and the method of using the said product, disclosed herein, may be implemented in any means for achieving various aspects. Other features will be apparent from the accompanying figures and from the detailed description that follows.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Several product embodiments and method of operating the container top are disclosed. Although the present embodiments have been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring more particularly to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a top view of the two part top <b>100</b> with a container. The container <b>108</b> has an opening surrounded by a peripheral seam <b>104</b>, a panel <b>106</b> and a light weight hinged top <b>102</b>. If the container top has an offset then it is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> as <b>110</b>. The container may be a bottle, can, jar or any container that may carry solids, liquid or semisolid. The peripheral seam <b>104</b> may be raised or flush with the container <b>108</b>. The peripheral seam <b>104</b> allows the ene two part top <b>102</b> or two one part top <b>500</b> to seal the container opening by connecting and/or sealing. The one part top <b>102</b> and/or two part top <b>500</b> may be made up of a metal, biodegradable material and/or any material that can be molded to form the shape. The light weight hinged top may have an offset <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> or may not have an offset as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Further description of the one part top and two part top are described below. The one part top may cover the opening of the container by 100-90%, 90-20% and 80-25%.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a cross section view of the two part top and container <b>200</b>. The container <b>108</b> has a raised peripheral seam <b>104</b> that houses the fork spring <b>204</b>, guide members <b>202</b> and <b>208</b> along with light weight hinged top <b>102</b>. The peripheral seam <b>104</b> is curved (convex) and is a tight fit molded part to house various components. The peripheral seam <b>104</b> houses the <b>202</b>B part of the guide member and the other end <b>202</b>A of the guide member helps in opening and closing of the dome top <b>102</b> A convex end and the fork finger <b>204</b> convex end. The structure and size of the opening surrounded by the peripheral seam <b>104</b> may be as big as the standard soft drink cans or may be as small as a standard bottle top. There is no burden on the current industry to retool or change their manufacturing processes since the instant product is compliant with industry tooling and manufacturing standards. The product design is flexible to scale according to the shape and size of a container.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The guide member <b>208</b> is fixed length part and fits snugly with the folded seam <b>104</b> on one end (<b>202</b>B) and on the other end <b>202</b>A provides a guidance path for the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> when is in closed position or open position or reseals and/or recloses. The guide member <b>202</b> provides the same functionality as the guide member <b>208</b> but has additional features. The guide member <b>202</b> is housed on one end in a curved convex end <b>102</b>A of the light weight hinged top <b>102</b>. The distance and insertion of the guide member <b>202</b> and its proximal end <b>202</b>A is critical to guide the light weight hinged top during opening and closing. It also provides extra support to the fork spring <b>204</b>. The length of the guide member <b>202</b> may vary depending on whether the light weight hinged top has an offset or not. This guide member by having variable length allows the sealing of the container <b>108</b> to be more efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a light weight hinged top <b>102</b> sealing the container <b>108</b> completely. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> A the pressure <b>306</b> is being applied on the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> (one part top) to open the container top. The fork spring <b>204</b> connected side is frangible and the fork spring <b>204</b> is lowered to release the junction for the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> to severe from the fork spring hinged side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> the opening starts happening on the non fork spring hinged side and the separation happens completely on the peripheral seam <b>104</b>. Once the separation is complete the fork spring <b>204</b> holds the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> in place and the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> floats in the liquid freely with no attachment to <b>202</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. The peripheral seam <b>104</b> of the container <b>108</b> holds the guide member <b>202</b>, the fork spring <b>204</b> attached to the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> in place by using the manufactured curve fit snug. Since the fork spring <b>204</b> has three pronged grip (described later) the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> stays in place.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the closing of the two part top <b>400</b>. The pressure <b>402</b> is generated by the carbonated beverage once it is opened and the gases try and escape out (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). CO<sub>2 </sub>pressure is not present until the convex shape dome of the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> flange fully re-mates with the guide member <b>202</b> and <b>208</b> in that order. Until re-mating of the flanges on both sides after opening, pressure <b>402</b> is the sole responsibility of the resilient fork spring <b>204</b>. After flange re-mating the CO<sub>2 </sub>escapes in a controlled leak (doesn't reseal) which allows the gentle touch of the user's upper lip to easily reopen the light weight hinged top <b>102</b>. Only by agitating (shaking) the carbonated content can one create excessive CO<sub>2 </sub>which overwhelms the &#x201c;controlled leak&#x201d; and forces the mated flanges further upward into a gas tight seal by force wedge fitting the two flanges together (eliminating the controlled CO<sub>2 </sub>leak). The rising gases as shown by arrows of <b>402</b> lift the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> upwards (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). The fork spring <b>204</b> helps in retraction of the light weight hinged top <b>102</b>. The guide member <b>202</b> helps guide the upward moving light weight hinged top <b>102</b> to align and guide member <b>208</b> helps seal the container top on the other end at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. The sealing or tamper proofing may be done using chemical, mechanical or visual methods and may not be limited to just these inspection methods. For example for chemical methods one may use change of color once it is opened or the seal is compromised and one may label that if the color has changed the consumer should be aware that the content of the container <b>108</b> may be tampered with. The consumer may also realize that once they open and drink a portion of the drink and want to store the color change on the periphery of the opening may be a good indication that they have to consume that container content first as it has been opened before.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B and <b>8</b>C shows an inverted cross section and the interior view of the one part top <b>500</b>. One part top <b>500</b> is just a variation of two part top <b>100</b>. The difference is in the way it is sealed with the container <b>108</b> and how it opens using two-fold separable seam <b>510</b> (inverted flange) that comprises of a curved lip. The curved lip has multiple parts such as the breakaway parts <b>521</b>, two curved surfaces <b>522</b> and <b>523</b> beaks with a narrow indentation <b>524</b>. The one part top inverted flange <b>510</b> is a contiguous structure attached to top <b>510</b>A by joining structure <b>521</b>. The raised ridge <b>520</b> houses the joined structure of <b>521</b> and inverted flange <b>510</b>. One part top inverted flange <b>510</b> helps the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> to open and reseal the container <b>108</b>. Once the pressure <b>515</b> is applied to the indentation <b>524</b> via beaks <b>522</b> and <b>523</b>, the pressure separates bottom of the indentation <b>524</b> at <b>525</b> and the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> is separated along the tear line <b>525</b> and the fork spring structure <b>600</b> holds the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> in place with the help of peripheral seam <b>104</b>. In this architecture there are is no guide member that aids the opening and closing. While opening, the center finger <b>616</b> via its arc when going downward, guides <b>102</b> toward the center of the can to aid in tearing the remaining 180 degrees of the tear line until completely open. That is why finger <b>616</b> is straight and not curved like <b>614</b> &#x26; <b>618</b>. This arc is an important functional necessity. The one part structure two-fold separable seam inverted flange <b>510</b> is designed in such a way that it is strong enough to maintain the integrity of the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> shows the fork spring structure <b>600</b> in detail. This feature is an improvement over the pending application. The fork spring structure comprises of the fork spring <b>204</b>, an attachment section <b>611</b>. The fork spring <b>204</b> has three fingers. The side fingers are <b>614</b> and <b>618</b> which are shorter than the center finger <b>616</b>. This design of fork spring <b>204</b> enables the structure to either hold or bounce back the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> when open and closed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also depicts a person's lip <b>630</b> lowering the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> by force and opening the container to consume the content. The pressure of the lip <b>630</b> keeps the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> open and as soon and the user releases the pressure from the lip <b>630</b> the fork spring <b>204</b> brings the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> back to closed position which effectively recloses the container. The tight design of this junction and the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> enables the containers to remain closed/resealed and the contents are kept uncontaminated. The carbonated beverages do not go flat (get decarbonated and taste bad). The instant product and the method of using is novel and consumes less material to manufacture and reduce capital expenses and reduce recycling burden.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Some exemplary methods of use are stated as follows: The container <b>108</b> is filled with content of preference such as a carbonated beverage in a can or a bottle. The container is then closed using the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> either with two part top <b>100</b> or fork spring structure <b>600</b>. If the container is sealed with two part top <b>100</b> then the user just needs to apply pressure using a finger or any instrument to suppress or any other means to apply pressure to lower the light weight hinged top <b>102</b>. The light weight hinged top <b>102</b> then breaks from the cover panel completely and goes horizontally downwards and then slowly becomes angularly situated in inside the container. It is held together by the guide member <b>202</b> and fork spring <b>204</b>. The other side of the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> is released by peripheral seam <b>104</b> and guide member <b>208</b> (convex). Once the sufficient content is consumed and the container is left self closed for some time then pressure <b>402</b> created by the carbonation of the beverage would lift the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> upwards and with the help of the guide members <b>208</b> and <b>202</b>, and fork spring <b>204</b>, it is resealed into the same position when it was initially reclosed/sealed. Even if you turn the can (container) up side down the liquid would not spill out.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The container <b>108</b> when filled with carbonated beverage of choice the one part top <b>500</b> essentially works the same way until resealing. However, the light weight hinged top <b>102</b> has a slightly unique breaking point for the start. The user presses the thumb or the finger against the filled container <b>108</b> at the dome top area and the junction that contains the two fold two-fold separable seam inverted flange <b>510</b>. The two-fold separable seam inverted flange <b>510</b>, which in form of a inverted flange, breaks at its indentation <b>525</b> and separates the curved structures <b>522</b> and <b>523</b> apart to release two-fold separable seam inverted flange <b>510</b> from top <b>510</b> A. The light weight hinged top <b>102</b> is further anchored by fork spring <b>204</b>. The light weight hinged top <b>102</b> may also be used for beverages filled in bottle like structures or bottles.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, it will be appreciated that the light weight hinged top, different design fork springs, and methods of use disclosed herein may be embodied using means for achieving the various combinations of sealing and resealing the container may be achieved. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.</p>
