<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is related to a through-hole electrode substrate arranged with a through-hole electrode which passes through a front surface and rear surface of a semiconductor substrate, and is also related to a method of manufacturing the through-hole electrode substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, with the high level of integration of electronic devices and progress in miniaturization, LSI chips are becoming as small as semiconductor packaging. However, high integration via a two dimensional arrangement of chips within a package is reaching its limits. Thus, in order to improve the packaging density of chips within the package it is necessary to divide the LSI chips and stack them in three dimensions. In addition, in order to increase the operation speed of the entire semiconductor package which includes stacked LSI chips, it is necessary to reduce the distance between stacked circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, in order to meet the demands described above, a through-hole electrode substrate arranged with a conducting part which conducts a front surface and rear surface of a substrate is proposed as an interposer between LSI chips. In this type of through-hole electrode substrate, the through-hole electrode is formed by filling the through-hole with a conducting material (Cu for example) using electroplating.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a diagram which shows one example of a through-hole electrode substrate <b>10</b> which is arranged with a silicon substrate <b>11</b>, a through-hold <b>12</b> which passes through the silicon substrate <b>11</b> in the thickness direction of the substrate, an insulating layer <b>13</b> comprised of silicon dioxide SiO<sub>2 </sub>for example, formed on a top and bottom surface from an inner wall of the through-hole <b>12</b>, a through-hole electrode <b>14</b> comprised of copper (Cu), gold (Au) or multilayer plating (Cu/Ni/Au) for example, which is formed within the through-hole <b>12</b>, and a wiring layer <b>15</b> comprised of copper (Cu) for example, arranged on a top and bottom surface of each of these components.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The through-hole electrode substrate <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is manufactured by the method described below. First, from one surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> a hole which does not pass completely through the substrate is formed using a method such as RIE (Reactive Ion Etching), Deep RIE, photo-etching, or wet-etching. Next, from the other surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>, that is, the surface opposite to the one where the hole is first formed, the silicon substrate <b>11</b> is set back (thinned) using a method such as grinding and the hole passes completely through the substrate. An insulating layer <b>13</b> is formed using a method such as LPCVD (Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Disposition) on the inner surfaces of this through-hole <b>12</b> and both surfaces (top and bottom) of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>. Next, after burying a conducting material comprised from a metal material such as copper (Cu) which becomes the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> within the through-hole <b>12</b> on which the insulating film <b>13</b> is formed, the unnecessary parts of the conducting material which stick out from the through-hole <b>12</b> are removed by CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing). Then, a wiring layer <b>15</b> which becomes the wires and electrode pads is formed by patterning using copper (Cu) for example on the top and bottom surfaces of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in the through-hole electrode substrate <b>11</b> manufactured by the manufacturing method described above, a blow off phenomenon of the wiring layer <b>15</b> which occurs during an annealing process, or bumps or cracks which occur on the insulating film <b>13</b> within the through-hole <b>12</b>, have been confirmed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, Japan Laid Open Patent 2002-26520 and 2000-252599 propose methods for reducing the blow off phenomenon of the wiring layer and insulating layer bumps or cracks which occur during an annealing process in the manufacturing process of the through-hole electrode substrate described above. In the multilayer wiring substrate disclosed in Japan Laid Open Patent 2002-26520, an opening is arranged on a via island which is arranged directly above a via hole conductor which is filled with a conductive paste, and is formed so that it passes completely through the substrate, and expansion of a gas and water component which are included in the conductive paste is prevented during a heating process. In the print substrate which is disclosed in Japan Laid Open Patent 2000-252599, a hole which connects with the external atmosphere is arranged on a conducting film which covers the surface of a sealing member of a resin which is filled into a through-hole, and a gas which is discharged from the sealing member is discharged to the external atmosphere by heating during reflow.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the multilayer wiring substrate and printed circuit board proposed in Japan Laid Open Patent 2002-26520 and 2000-252599 apply to the defects which occur from the gas which is discharged from the through-hole electrode in which the through-hole is filled with a conductive paste or resin, and, as explained below, do not apply to defects which occur from the gas which is discharged from the through-hole electrode in which the through-hole is filled with a metal material forming an insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a diagram which exemplifies the phenomenon whereby the wiring layer <b>15</b> is pushed up and the blow off phenomenon. In this case, a metal material such as copper (Cu) which is filled into the through-hole <b>12</b> as a through-hole electrode <b>14</b>, is stretched, and by discharging the remaining gas (water (H<sub>2</sub>O) or hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) etc) in the metal material in the annealing process, the wiring layer <b>15</b> is pushed up and it is confirmed that the blow off phenomenon occurs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a diagram which shows a microscope photograph of a part in which the blow off phenomenon has occurred in one part of a plurality of electrode pads. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a diagram which shows a microscope photograph of a part in which a swelling phenomenon in one part of the plurality of electrode pads, and mask swelling with regards to the electrode pads occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a diagram which exemplifies the phenomenon by which cracks occur in the insulating layer <b>13</b>. In this case, in the annealing process, when a heating temperature is more than 400&#xb0; C. for example, bumps and crack occur in the insulating layer <b>13</b> due to the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between a metal material such as copper (Cu) which is filled as the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> and an insulation material such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>which is used as the insulating layer <b>13</b>, the metal material enters into the cracks and there is a possibility of short circuits occurring between through-hole electrodes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a diagram which shows an SEM photograph of a part in which bumps occur in one part of the insulating layer <b>13</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a diagram which shows an SEM photograph of a part in which cracks occur in one part of the insulating layer <b>13</b>. To prevent this occurring, when performing an annealing process on the through-hole electrode substrate <b>10</b> it is necessary to set a low heating temperature. However, the annealing process is necessary and because the gas discharge from within the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> described above occurs even at a heating temperature at which cracks are not produced, measures are required.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first embodiment of the present invention will be explained in detail below while referring to the diagrams.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Structure of a Through-Hole Electrode Substrate)</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The structure of a through-hole electrode substrate <b>100</b> related to the first embodiment will be explained while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is planar diagram of the through-hole electrode substrate viewed form the top surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is cross-sectional diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> viewed from the line A-A. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the same structural elements as in the through-hole electrode substrate <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> are attached with the same symbols. In the through-hole electrode substrate <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a resin layer <b>101</b> and a wiring layer <b>15</b> are formed on the top and bottom surfaces of a silicon substrate <b>11</b> on which an insulating layer <b>13</b> and a through-hole electrode <b>14</b> are formed. The resin layer <b>101</b> is formed by a resin material such as polyimide. That is, it is sufficient that the insulating layer has a gas discharge function. This resin layer <b>101</b> is arranged in order to externally discharge gas which is discharged from within the through-hole electrode <b>14</b>. That is, in the first embodiment, the resin layer <b>101</b> is arranged as a gas discharge part. In addition, the resin layer <b>101</b> may be an inorganic insulating layer such as a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride film. In this case, the insulating layer is used as a cover after the gas is discharged. In this way, a gas discharge state is maintained.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(Manufacturing Method of the Through-Hole Electrode Substrate)</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Next, the processes for manufacturing the through-hole electrode substrate <b>100</b> will be explained while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref> to E are diagrams which show the processes for forming a through-hole electrode in the silicon substrate <b>11</b>. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref> to E only show one through-hole electrode <b>14</b> formed in the silicon substrate <b>11</b> for the purposes of simplifying explanation. In the actual silicon substrate <b>11</b>, a plurality of through-hole electrodes with a desired hole diameter (for example, 10 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m) are formed at desired intervals according to specifications.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(1) Forming Process of a Through-Hole</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">First, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the silicon substrate <b>11</b> is etched and a hole (not shown in the diagram) which does not pass all the way through the substrate, is formed on one surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> using a method such as RIE, Deep RIE, photo-etching or wet-etching. Next, on the other surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>, that is, the surface opposite to the one where the hole is first formed, the silicon substrate <b>11</b> is set back (thinned) using a method such as grinding, and the hole <b>12</b> passes completely through the substrate. Furthermore, the formation method of the through-hole <b>12</b> is not limited to this formation method. For example, the through-hole may be formed by using RIE, Deep RIE, photo-etching or wet-etching from one surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(2) Forming Process of an Insulating Layer</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, an insulating layer <b>13</b> is formed on the inner surface of this through-hole <b>12</b> and both surfaces (upper and lower) of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>. The insulating layer <b>13</b> is comprised of an inorganic insulation layer of, for example, silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), silicon nitride (SiN) or silicon carbide (SiC). This insulating layer <b>13</b> is formed using a method such as LPCVD (Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Disposition) method, PECVD (Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition) method or sputtering method. In the case where the insulating layer <b>13</b> is formed from silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), it is possible to form the insulating layer by a thermal oxidation method or anodic oxidation method. The insulating layer <b>13</b> may be formed as a single layer or have a stacked structure of two or more layers.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the through-hole electrode substrate <b>100</b> formed by the manufacturing method described above, it was confirmed that a metal material such as copper (Cu) which was filled as the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> and gas such as water (H<sub>2</sub>O) or hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) which remains in the silicon substrate <b>11</b> were discharged by the annealing process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram which shows the results of a measurement of each discharged amount (ng/cm<sup>2</sup>) of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) which is discharged from the through-hole electrode after increasing the heating temperature. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it was discovered that the discharge amount of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) (The diamond plot in the diagram) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) (the square plot in the diagram) increased at each heating temperature, 250&#xb0; C., 300&#xb0; C. and 400&#xb0; C. Furthermore, in the case where the heating temperature is 250&#xb0; C., water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) are almost not discharged at all, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, it was confirmed that stretching occurred in the copper (Cu) which is filled as the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> and swelling (peeling) occurred in the electrode pad. In addition, in the case where the heating temperature is 300&#xb0; C. and 400&#xb0; C., the amount of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) that is discharged increases.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The reason for the increase in the amount of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) discharged is the slight gap that occurs on the border section between the insulating layer <b>13</b> and the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> after removing the plating resist <b>124</b> by a chemical process and after removing the seed layer <b>123</b> by etching. An example of the occurrence of this gap is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a photograph taken by a SEM of the border section between the insulating layer <b>13</b> and the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> after the plating resist is removed by a chemical process and after the seed layer <b>124</b> is removed by chemical etching. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows this section by &#x201c;O&#x201d; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is an enlarged photograph of this section.

It was confirmed that the gas (water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)) which is discharged from the inside of the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> builds up in the gap which is produced on this border section, the wiring layer <b>15</b> is pushed up and blow off occurs.</p>

In addition, in the resin layer <b>101</b> because the molecular structure from the molecules of the gas (water (H<sub>2</sub>O), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)) which is discharged from inside of the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> is large it is possible to externally discharge this gas. That is, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in the annealing process, the gas (water (H<sub>2</sub>O), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)) which is discharged from within the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> is externally discharged via the resin layer <b>101</b>. Furthermore, the area in which the resin layer <b>101</b> contacts with the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> which is exposed on the surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> is sufficient to be around 20-80% for example of the entire exposed area of the through-hole electrode <b>14</b>.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As a result, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of the blow off and swelling (peeling) phenomenon of the electrode pad as shown in FIG. <b>21</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As a result of this, in the case where the resin layer <b>101</b> is added to the through-hole electrode substrate <b>100</b>, in addition to the effect of externally discharging gas from the inside of the through-hole electrode <b>14</b>, it was discovered that stretching of copper (Cu) which is filled as the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> was reduced (elasticity effect).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As described above, in the through-hole electrode substrate <b>100</b> shown in the first embodiment, it is possible to externally discharge the gas discharged from within the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> which is formed by filling a metal such as copper (Cu) into the through-hole <b>12</b> which is formed in the silicon substrate <b>11</b>, by arranging the resin layer <b>101</b>.

In addition, in the first to third embodiments described above, as a process for forming the through-hole <b>12</b> in the silicon substrate <b>11</b>, forming the through-hole <b>12</b> by forming a hole (a hole with a bottom) on one surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> and setting back (thinning) the other surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>, was described. The processes however are not limited to this process. For example, the through-hole <b>12</b> which passes through the silicon substrate <b>11</b> may be formed by polishing and thinning the silicon substrate <b>11</b> and etching from one surface.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The structure of a through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> related to the fourth embodiment will be explained in detail while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a planar diagram of the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> viewed from the top surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a cross sectional diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> viewed from the line D-D.

In the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, a resin layer <b>401</b> is formed on the top and bottom surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> and inner wall of the through-hole <b>12</b>. The resin layer <b>401</b> is from a resin material such polyimide. In other words, an insulating layer having a gas discharge function is sufficient. This resin layer <b>401</b> is arranged in order to externally discharge gas which is discharged from the inside of the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> described above. That is, in the fourth embodiment, the resin layer <b>401</b> is arranged as an insulating layer and a gas discharge part. In addition, the resin layer <b>401</b> may be an inorganic insulating layer such as a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride film. In this case, the insulating layer is used as a cover after the gas is discharged. In this way, a gas discharge state is maintained.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Next, the processes for manufacturing the through-hole electrode substrate <b>100</b> will be explained while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A to 27E</figref> are diagrams which show the sequence of processes for forming a through-hole electrode on the silicon substrate <b>11</b>. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A to 27E</figref> only show one through-hole electrode <b>14</b> formed on the silicon substrate for the purposes of simplifying explanation. On the actual silicon substrate <b>11</b>, a plurality of through-hole electrodes with a desired hole diameter (for example, 10 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m) are formed at desired intervals according to specifications.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">(1) Forming Process of a Through-Hole</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">First, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, the silicon substrate <b>11</b> is etched and a hole (not shown in the diagram) which does not pass all the way through, is formed on one surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> using a method such as RIE, Deep RIE, photo-etching or wet-etching. Next, on the other surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>, that is, the surface opposite to the one where the hole is formed, the silicon substrate <b>11</b> is set back (thinned) using a method such as grinding and the through-hole <b>12</b> passes completely through the substrate. Furthermore, the formation method of the through-hole <b>12</b> is not limited to this formation method. For example, the through-hole may be formed by using RIE, Deep RIE, photo-etching or wet-etching from one surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0035" num="0000">(2) Forming Process of a Resin Layer</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>, the resin layer <b>401</b> is formed as an insulation layer on the top and bottom surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> and inner wall of the through-hole <b>12</b>. This resin layer <b>401</b> is formed using a spray coat method for example. The resin layer <b>401</b> can be formed from one or two or more of the following: epoxy resin, polyimide resin, benzocyclobutene resin, polyimide, phenol resin, silicon resin, fluorine resin, crystal polymer, polyamide-imide, polybenzoxazole, isocyanate resin, aramid, polyolefin, polyester, BT resin, polyacetal, polybutylene terephthalate, syndiotactic polystyrene, polyphenylene sulfide, polyether ether ketone, polyether nitrile, polycarbonate, polyphenylene ether polysulfone, polyethersulfone, polyarylate or polyetherimide.

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In addition, in the case of forming the above described through-hole <b>12</b> by Deep RIE, it is known that a scallop can occur in the inner walls of the through-hole <b>12</b>. In the fourth embodiment, it is possible to flatten the inner walls of the through-hole <b>12</b> and cover the scallop without any gaps by forming the resin layer <b>401</b> in the inner walls of the through-hole <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">(3) Forming Process of a Seed Layer</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</figref>, a seed layer <b>121</b> is formed on the bottom surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> on which the resin layer <b>401</b> is formed, using such as a sputtering method. Furthermore, the seed layer <b>121</b> may be formed as one layer using titanium (Ti) or as two layers using titanium (Ti) and copper (Cu). In the case of forming the seed layer <b>121</b> as two layers, it is preferred that the copper layer (Cu) be formed as a layer which contacts with the through-hole electrode <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0037" num="0000">(4) Forming Process of a Conducting Part</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27D</figref>, a conducting material (such as copper (Cu) or a copper alloy) is filled into the through-hole <b>12</b> by electroplating, the seed layer <b>121</b> of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> becomes a power supply layer and a conducting part <b>122</b> is formed. In this case, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27D</figref>, the conducting part <b>122</b> is also formed on the surface on which the seed layer <b>121</b> is formed. A sputtering method, nonelectrolytic plating method, molten metal suction method, print method or CVD method can be used to fill the copper (Cu) or copper alloy.</p>
<p id="h-0038" num="0000">(5) Forming Process of a Through-Hole Electrode</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28E</figref>, the surface on which the seed layer <b>121</b> and the conducting part <b>122</b> are formed of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> is etched using such as a CMP method, the unnecessary conducting part <b>122</b> and one part of the seed layer <b>121</b> are removed and the forming process of the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> is complete.</p>
<p id="h-0039" num="0000">(6) Forming Process of a Plating Resist</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref>, a seed layer <b>402</b> is formed on the surface on which the resin layer <b>401</b> is formed using a sputtering method. Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref>, a plating resist <b>403</b> is formed above the seed layer <b>402</b> using photolithography. Furthermore, the seed layer <b>402</b> may be formed as one layer using a seed material such as titanium (Ti) or may be formed in two layers using titanium (Ti) and copper (Cu).</p>
<p id="h-0040" num="0000">(7) Forming Process of a Wiring Layer</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</figref>, a wiring layer <b>404</b> which becomes the wires and electrode pads is formed as a power supply layer by the seed layer <b>402</b> by electrolyte plating. The wiring layer <b>404</b> may be formed using such as copper (Cu), gold (Au), multilayer plating (Cu, Ni, Au) or a copper alloy. Next, the plating resist <b>404</b> is removed by a chemical process and the seed layer <b>402</b> is removed by chemical etching from the surface on which the wiring layer <b>404</b> of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> is formed. Then the forming process of the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the case where the resin layer <b>401</b> and the wiring layer <b>404</b> is formed on the top and bottom surfaces of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> was shown, however, the resin layer <b>401</b> and the wiring layer <b>404</b> may be similarly formed on either the top or the bottom surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> by the above described process.</p>
<p id="h-0041" num="0000">(Gas Discharge Effects by a Resin Layer)</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> related to the fourth embodiment, the resin layer <b>401</b> is formed on the top and bottom surfaces of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> and the inner walls of the through-hole <b>12</b>. In addition, in the resin layer <b>401</b> because the molecular structure from the molecules of the gas (water (H<sub>2</sub>O), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)) which is discharged from inside of the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> is large it is possible to externally discharge this gas. That is, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, in the annealing process, the gas (water (H<sub>2</sub>O), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)) which is discharged from within the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> is externally discharged via the resin layer <b>401</b>. As a result, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of the blow off and swelling (peeling) phenomenon of the electrode pad as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As a result of this, in the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> described above, in the case where the resin layer <b>401</b> is formed on the top and bottom surfaces of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> and the inner walls of the through-hole <b>12</b>, in addition to the effect of externally discharging gas from the inside of the through-hole electrode <b>14</b>, it was identified that stretching of copper (Cu) which is filled as the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> was reduced (elasticity effect).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As described above, in the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> shown in the fourth embodiment, the gas which is discharged from the inside of the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> in which a metal material such as copper (Cu) is filled into the through-hole <b>12</b> which is formed in the silicon substrate <b>11</b> can be externally discharged via the resin layer <b>401</b>. In addition, it was identified that this resin layer <b>401</b> had an effect (elasticity effect) of reducing stretching of the copper (Cu) which is filled. As a result, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of the blow off, swelling (peeling) of the electrode pad and cracks, reduce the yield at the time of manufacturing the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> and improve reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Furthermore, in the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> shown in the fourth embodiment, the resin layer <b>401</b> is formed as an insulating film on the top and bottom surfaces of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> and on the inner wall of the through-hole <b>12</b>. Consequently, when forming the through-hole <b>12</b> using a Deep RIE method, it is possible to flatten the inner walls of the through-hole <b>12</b> by filling scallop gaps that occur in the inner walls of the through-hole <b>12</b> and it becomes possible to favorably fill a conducting material (copper (Cu) or a copper alloy) into the through-hole <b>12</b> using a plating method.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In addition, in the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> shown in the fourth embodiment, because the resin layer <b>401</b> is arranged as an insulating layer and a gas discharge part, the number of processes in its forming can be reduced compared to the process for forming the insulating layer <b>13</b> and resin layer <b>101</b> in the through-hole electrode substrate <b>100</b> shown in the first embodiment. An example of each forming process of the insulating layer <b>13</b>, the resin layer <b>101</b> and the resin layer <b>401</b> are compared in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, <b>30</b>A shows an example of a forming process of the insulating layer <b>13</b> and the resin layer <b>101</b> by the first embodiment, and <b>30</b>B shows an example of the forming process of the resin layer <b>401</b> by the fourth embodiment. In this case, it is possible to reduce the processes related to PECVD (Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition) in the forming process of the resin layer <b>401</b> by the fourth embodiment compared to the forming process of the insulating layer <b>13</b> and the resin layer <b>101</b> by the first embodiment. In particular, in the forming process of the through-hole electrode using the PECVD process it is necessary to form a thick insulating layer <b>13</b> in order to secure insulating properties which results in an increase in manufacturing costs. Therefore, in the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> shown in the fourth embodiment, it is possible to reduce manufacturing costs compared to the through-hole electrode substrate <b>100</b> shown in the first embodiment due to a reduction in PECVD processes.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Furthermore, in the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> shown in the fourth embodiment, because the resin layer <b>401</b> is formed as an insulation layer on the top and bottom surfaces of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> and on the inner walls of the through-hole <b>12</b>, it is no longer necessary to form the resin layer <b>101</b> and gas discharge holes <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> so as to match the exposed opening position of the through electrode <b>14</b>, the same as resin layer <b>101</b> and gas discharge holes <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> formed in the through-hole electrode substrates <b>100</b> to <b>300</b> shown in the first to third embodiments described above. As a result, it is possible to form the resin layer <b>401</b> even when the diameter of the through-hole electrode <b>14</b> is small. In addition, in the through-hole electrode substrate <b>400</b> shown in the fourth embodiment, it is possible to easily form the resin layer <b>401</b> without consideration for resolution limits of the resin layer <b>401</b> and deviations from the opening position of the through-hole electrode <b>14</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A lower layer wire <b>503</b><i>d </i>is formed in the lower layer substrate <b>503</b><i>a </i>so that the solder balls <b>502</b> and the through-hole electrode <b>503</b><i>f </i>of the interposer <b>503</b><i>b </i>are electrically connected.
