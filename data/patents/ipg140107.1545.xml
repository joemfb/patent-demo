<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a device for forming containers and a method of damped closing of a mould carrier unit and a base mould carrier of a blow mould for forming containers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Blowmoulding/stretchmoulding machines and plants for forming plastic containers made for example from a preform are widely known from the prior art. These plants have a multiplicity of devices (also called blowing stations) for blowing and stretching containers which comprise at least one mould carrier unit consisting of two mould carriers and a base mould.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such a blowmoulding machine for production of containers is described for example in U.S. 2008/0063742 A1.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The base mould which in conventional stretch-blowmoulding machines is arranged on a base mould carrier is moved by a corresponding lift device in the direction of the mould carrier unit during closing of this mould carrier unit, so that the mould carrier unit and the base mould finally move towards or against each other such that they form a wall surrounding the container to be moulded. The mould carrier unit then surrounds the side walls of the containers to be formed while the base mould covers the base area of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">During this targeted and usually unbraked and very fast movement of the base mould in the direction of the mould carrier unit, often a collision occurs between the base mould and the individual mould carriers whereby the individual components can be damaged. Consequently a perfect seal of the inner area, in which the container is formed, against the outer area formed by the wall comprising base mould and mould carrier unit, no longer exists.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus it is necessary to brake the movement of the base mould against the mould carrier unit in a controlled manner, for example with an impact-damping device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such impact-damping devices are described for example in WO 2006/032503 A2, wherein the machine disclosed here for moulding plastic comprises an impact-damping device as well as a moulding device and an actuator device. This impact-damping device comprises a pneumatic cylinder arranged between the swage and/or the die, and the respective activation device which moves the swage and the die into position. These impact-damping devices allow the maintaining of a constant pressure applied to the swage and die, and prevent for example overpressure which can be generated by damage to the moulding device. Consequently these impact-damping devices are merely pressure-regulating elements which do not however control the movement of the elements coming together, here the swage and die.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For merely even reduction of a closing speed for example EP 0 425 388 B1 describes a shock absorber which is adapted to receive a deceleration shaft arranged next to a lowering rod on a closing plate in a rotation injection moulding machine with a corresponding closing device to reduce the movement of the closing plate. However, here the contact between the closing elements is not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Consequently the object of the present invention is to avoid such a collision of the base mould or base mould upper edge and mould carrier units or mould carrier lower edge in order to extend the useful life of the base mould and mould carrier and consequently be able to form containers more economically and efficiently.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The object is achieved by the present invention by means of a device for forming containers and a method for damped closing of a mould carrier unit and a base mould carrier of a blow mould for forming containers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The device according to the invention for forming containers has at least one mould carrier unit to hold blowmoulding parts and a base mould carrier for holding a base mould and a base mould carrier lift device for moving the base mould carrier in conjunction with the movement of the mould carrier unit, wherein the mould carrier unit comprises at least two mould carriers which surround the container to be processed at least during a moulding process and wherein the base mould carrier by means of the base mould covers a base area of the container to be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore the device according to the invention is characterised in that the base mould carrier lift device comprises at least one first damping element for damping and limiting the substantially vertical movement of the base mould carrier in relation to the mould carrier unit. The damping element which can be constructed of several pieces serves firstly to damp the movement of the base mould carrier in relation to the mould carrier unit and preferably secondly also to form an end stop for this movement.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Consequently the device according to the invention comprises a mould carrier holder with a mould carrier unit arranged rotatably or swivellably thereon, with at least two mould carriers and a base mould carrier lift device with base mould carrier arranged thereon for carrying or moving the base mould.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Advantageously a movement of at least one mould carrier and the base mould carrier are coupled together for at least part of the time during opening and/or closing of the blow mould or mould carrier unit.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The base mould carrier lift device in a preferred embodiment has a base unit mobile in relation to a main retaining element and a base carrier immobile in relation thereto, wherein the base mould carrier is itself arranged mobile in relation to the base carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term immobile here refers in particular to a transport device which transports the entire device. Preferably a multiplicity of such devices can be provided on a common transport device and in particular on a common blow wheel rotating about a specified axis. In addition the device according to the invention can also have a stretch rod which expands the plastic preforms along their longitudinal direction during the moulding process. Advantageously therefore the device according to the invention is part of a blowing station which serves to transform plastic preforms into plastic containers. This blowing station advantageously has a blowing nozzle which expands the plastic preforms into plastic containers. Advantageously the plant described here is a stretch-blowmoulding machine.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The opening and closing of the blow moulds can take place via control curves (arranged stationary) but also via electric or magnetic drives.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus the base mould carrier is arranged on the mobile base unit in order to move the base mould in the direction of the mould carrier unit on closing of the mould carrier unit.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In contrast, the mould carrier unit is arranged preferably swivellably on one mould carrier holder, wherein the mould carrier holder and the base mould carrier lift device are connected together, particularly preferably rotationally stationary.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">This means that the mould carrier holder and the base mould carrier lift device are preferably formed either from a cohesive or common material or connected together by for example screw or weld connections, such that for example a movement of the mould carrier holder in relation to the base mould carrier lift device is not possible.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first damping element used for damping and/or limiting the substantially vertical movement of a base mould carrier in relation to the mould carrier unit is preferably arranged on the base carrier of the base mould carrier lift device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus the damping element itself is preferably immobile for example via a retaining block mounted on the base mould carrier lift device so that damping and/or limiting of the movement of the base mould carrier and consequently of the base mould is possible by a further mobile element, the movement of which is consequently reduced and/or hindered and/or slowed by the damping element.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Consequently for example a retaining finger, which is coupled with the base unit of the base mould carrier lift device and moves with this, comprises a stop body, in particular stop bolt, which meets the damping element in the closing process of the mould carrier unit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus by the movement of the base mould carrier or the mobile base unit, the retaining finger with its stop bolt arranged thereon moves substantially upward when the mould carrier unit closes. As a result the stop bolt, which preferably interacts directly with the first damping element, is first slowed in its vertical movement by the first damping element, for example by the stop bolt meeting a pressure force opposing the movement direction, and for example limited after a defined movement.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a further preferred embodiment a curve lever which is arranged on at least one of the at least two mould carriers and can be moved by the mould carrier has a curve roller which is arranged mobile in a base curve.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When the mould carriers are moved towards each other i.e. the mould carrier unit closes, there is also a specified, preferably substantially horizontal movement of the curve lever which is connected preferably rotationally stationary and immobile with the right-hand mould carrier. As a result the curve roller arranged on the curve lever rolls preferably in or along a guide rail of a base curve, whereby the base curve is drawn or guided or moved upward in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Consequently the base unit of the base mould carrier lift device is connected with the base curve for movement transfer such that the base unit and the base mould can be moved substantially vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a further preferred embodiment at least one mould carrier of the mould carrier unit comprises a second damping element, preferably acting damping substantially horizontally, to damp the movement of the closing mould carrier unit. Preferably the first and/or the second damping element has a spring which can itself damp or limit the movement or as a secondary element support a primary element e.g. the hydraulic shock absorber, in damping and/or limiting the movement.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Accordingly the first and/or second damping element is for example a shock absorber.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore a method is claimed for damped closing of a mould carrier unit and a base mould carrier of a blow mould for forming containers, wherein during movement of a base unit a damping element, which is connected with an immobile base carrier of a base mould carrier lift device, damps the movement of the base unit in that a stop body or stop bolt connected with a mobile base unit of the base mould carrier lift device is moved against the damping element.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It would however also be possible conversely for the damping element to be connected with the mobile base unit and the stop body or stop bolt to be connected with the immobile base carrier.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a mould carrier unit <b>1</b> with right-hand mould carrier <b>1</b><i>a </i>and left-hand mould carrier <b>1</b><i>b </i>in a closed position. I.e. the two mould carriers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>engage with each other by means of gripper or holding elements <b>5</b> arranged on each mould carrier <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>in order to enclose a container to be worked or formed. Thus the retaining elements <b>5</b> form a locking mechanism. A blow mould which is held by the mould carrier <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>is not shown here.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The two mould carriers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>are preferably arranged swivellable or rotatable about a common axis on a mould carrier holder <b>2</b> shown here merely in extract, in order to allow a movement for opening or closing the mould carrier unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">On the right-hand mould carrier <b>1</b><i>a </i>is also attached a curve lever <b>3</b> with a curve roller <b>4</b> attached to the curve lever <b>3</b>. The curve lever <b>3</b> extends substantially in the vertical direction below the right-hand mould carrier <b>1</b><i>a </i>downward from this and at the same time in the direction of the second mould carrier <b>1</b><i>b</i>. Thus the curve lever <b>3</b> substantially describes an L-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the right-hand mould carrier <b>1</b><i>a </i>already seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown in more detail. Also the right-hand mould carrier <b>1</b><i>a </i>has a damping element <b>20</b> which extends substantially horizontally in the direction of the left-hand mould carrier (not shown here). Consequently the damping element <b>20</b>, which for example can be a shock absorber, is arranged on the face <b>6</b> of the right-hand mould carrier <b>1</b><i>a </i>such that on the movement of the two mould carriers <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>directed towards each other, it can damp the closing movement of the mould carrier unit <b>1</b> to prevent an impact of the two mould carriers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, in that the swivel movement of the two mould carriers <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>about the mould carrier holder (not shown here) is braked. The damping element <b>20</b> is arranged opposite the swivel axis of the mould carriers <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>so that consequently the container to be processed (not shown here) lies between the swivel axis and the damping element <b>20</b> for at least part of the time.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is however also possible for the damping element to be arranged on the left-hand mould carrier <b>1</b><i>b</i>. The damping element could also be arranged on the same side as said swivel axis in relation to the container.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the damping element <b>20</b> is arranged relatively centrally in relation to the vertically extending length of the right-hand mould carrier <b>1</b><i>a</i>. It is however also conceivable for the damping element <b>20</b> to be arranged in the upper or lower area of the face <b>6</b>. Furthermore it is possible that instead of one damping element, two or more damping elements <b>20</b> can be arranged which are distributed along the face <b>6</b> of the right-hand mould carrier and/or along the face of the left-hand mould carrier (not shown here).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The principle sketches of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> each show a mould carrier holder <b>30</b> with base mould carrier lift device <b>31</b> arranged thereon in different views.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus the principle sketch in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a side view of the mould carrier holder <b>30</b> and the base mould carrier lift device <b>31</b> which is composed of a base unit <b>32</b> mobile substantially vertical to the mould carrier <b>30</b> and a correspondingly rigid base carrier <b>33</b> immobile in relation to the mould carrier <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">On the base carrier <b>33</b> is arranged a first damping element <b>34</b> for damping and/or limiting the movement of the base unit <b>32</b> which moves up and down substantially in the vertical direction (double arrow P) as the mould carrier unit (not shown here) is closed or opened. This movement of the base unit <b>32</b> or base mould carrier <b>35</b> which transports the base mould (not shown here) in the direction of the mould carrier unit on closing of the mould carrier unit or away from the mould carrier unit on opening of the mould carrier unit, is damped and/or limited by a stop bolt <b>38</b> connected via a retaining finger <b>39</b> with the moving base <b>32</b> and interacting with the damping element <b>34</b>. The precise sequence during this damping is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The stop bolt <b>38</b> or stop body <b>38</b> extends consequently preferably in a substantially vertical direction through a region of the retaining finger <b>39</b> and a region of the base carrier <b>33</b> up to the damping element <b>34</b> with which it interacts for damping and/or limiting of the movement. Preferably the retaining bolt here thus also extends parallel to the swivel axis of the mould carrier unit.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A base curve <b>36</b> with a guide rail <b>37</b> running in the base curve <b>36</b> is also arranged on the mobile base unit <b>32</b>. By engagement and corresponding movement of the curve roller along the curve lever (neither shown here) in the base curve <b>36</b> or guide rail <b>37</b> or guide groove <b>37</b>, a vertical lift movement can be achieved of the base unit <b>32</b> and consequently the base mould carrier <b>35</b> and hence the base mould (not shown here).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a principle sketch of the structure according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> but in front view. The component structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has been turned to the right by around 90&#xb0; for the view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows clearly that the base curve <b>36</b> has a guide rail <b>37</b> or a guide groove <b>37</b> which extends in a first region <b>37</b><i>a </i>at a defined angle in the direction of the left-hand mould carrier (not shown here) and accordingly comprises a first region <b>37</b><i>a </i>running obliquely downwards. The second region <b>37</b><i>b </i>of the guide rail <b>37</b> runs substantially horizontal to the image plane which corresponds approximately to the support surface of the base mould carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Consequently on a closing movement of the base carrier unit (not shown here), the curve roller of the curve lever which is arranged for example rotationally stationary or rigidly on the right-hand mould carrier (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is guided in the guide rail <b>37</b> of the base curve <b>36</b> such that the base curve <b>36</b> is forced into an upward directed movement. The gradient of the base rail <b>37</b> of the base curve <b>36</b> consequently defines the deflection or speed with which the base curve is moved up or down.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Consequently a steep gradient of the guide rail <b>37</b> or first region <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the guide rail <b>37</b> means the rapid movement of the base curve <b>36</b> upward or downward.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">After the curve roller has now been moved or pushed or rolled along the first region <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the guide rail <b>37</b>, the curve roller now reaches the second region <b>37</b><i>b </i>of the base curve <b>36</b>. While the curve roller is rolling along the second region <b>37</b><i>b</i>, there is no further upward movement of the base curve <b>36</b> and consequently no further upward movement of the base mould carrier <b>35</b>. Now the mould carriers are merely connected together such that the base form is held in the mould carrier unit and is completely surrounded by this in order consequently to form an interior sealed against the environment, in which the containers can be blown and stretched.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In other words the upward movement of the base unit <b>32</b> by the closing of the mould carrier unit and the downward movement of the base unit <b>32</b> by the opening of the mould carrier unit are initiated in that the curve lever respectively lifts and lowers the base unit <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a principle sketch of the damping element <b>34</b> according to an embodiment of the invention, wherein the damping element <b>34</b> can be a pneumatic, hydraulic or mechanical shock absorber. The damping element <b>34</b> is arranged rotationally stationary and immobile or rigidly on a retaining block <b>40</b> so that the position or situation of the damping element <b>34</b> cannot be changed even in relation to the retaining block <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A stop bolt <b>38</b> which interacts with the damping element <b>34</b> to damp and/or limit the substantially vertical movement of the base unit is also arranged rotationally stationary or immobile or rigidly on a retaining finger <b>39</b>. The stop bolt <b>38</b> is connected with the retaining finger <b>39</b> for example via a hexagonal nut <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">If now because of the movement described above, the base curve (not shown here) is moved upward, there is also an upward movement of the base unit <b>32</b> together with the base mould carrier and base mould (neither shown here). Consequently the retaining finger <b>39</b> is also moved upward whereby the stop bolt <b>38</b> with damping element <b>34</b>, depending on its structure, counteracts or moves against the damping element <b>34</b> whereby the mass of the base unit <b>32</b> is braked before reaching its end position.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">If for example the damping element <b>34</b> is a hydraulic shock absorber, the stop bolt <b>38</b> constitutes a piston guided in the cylinder of the shock absorber which must displace a liquid medium, for example oil, against a defined resistance when the piston, i.e. the stop bolt <b>38</b>, is also moved upward in the cylinder of the shock absorber on an upward movement of the base unit <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It is also possible that the damping of the stop bolt is achieved for example by a compression spring such as for example in mechanical shock absorbers. The spring is fitted for example in the cylinder of the damping element <b>34</b> such that this is tensioned (compressed) on an upward movement of the base unit <b>32</b> and relaxed on a downward movement. A defined movement limitation is then possible for example via this spring if this e.g. runs to block and consequently no further compression of the spring is possible. Thus an upward movement of the base unit is also limited at this point.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As a result of the damping described above of the movement of the base unit <b>32</b>, an overshoot of the base unit <b>32</b> before it reaches its end position can be prevented, while also an end stop is created, limiting the movement of the base unit <b>32</b> by the damping element <b>34</b> of the device according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The applicant reserves the right to claim all features disclosed in the application documents as essential to the invention where novel individually or in combination in relation to the prior art.</p>
