<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to amino acid sequences that are directed against (as defined herein) Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa B Ligand (RANK-L, also called tumor necrosis factor-related, activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE), osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF), osteoprotegerin ligand (OPG-L) or tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11)), as well as to compounds or constructs, and in particular proteins and polypeptides, that comprise or essentially consist of one or more such amino acid sequences (also referred to herein as &#x201c;amino acid sequences of the invention&#x201d;, &#x201c;compounds of the invention&#x201d;, and &#x201c;polypeptides of the invention&#x201d;, respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention also relates to nucleic acids encoding such amino acid sequences and polypeptides (also referred to herein as &#x201c;nucleic acids of the invention&#x201d; or &#x201c;nucleotide sequences of the invention&#x201d;); to methods for preparing such amino acid sequences and polypeptides; to host cells expressing or capable of expressing such amino acid sequences or polypeptides; to compositions, and in particular to pharmaceutical compositions, that comprise such amino acid sequences, polypeptides, nucleic acids and/or host cells; and to uses of such amino acid sequences or polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells and/or compositions, in particular for prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, such as the prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic purposes mentioned herein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other aspects, embodiments, advantages and applications of the invention will become clear from the further description herein.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Remodelling (turnover) of bone is the process by which the adult skeleton is continually being resorbed (removed) and formed (replaced). Bone remodeling involves the synthesis of bone matrix by osteoblasts and its resorption by osteoclast cells. Osteoclasts, derived from hematopoetic cells, are unique forms of tissue macrophages that have the capacity to resorb bone tissue. Osteoblasts are specialized fibroblasts that have the capacity of secreting bone collagen. There is an exquisite coordination among the activities of these bone cells that link the processes of bone formation and bone resorption.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Bone remodelling is controlled by a balance between RANK-L/RANK and the RANK-L decoy receptor OPG. RANK-L and its receptor RANK are essential for the development and activation of osteoclasts. OPG, a secreted protein, is an effective inhibitor of osteoclast maturation and osteoclasts activation. In normal bone homeostasis, RANK-L and OPG participate in a cytokine axis that tightly controls the generation of osteoclasts from monocyte precursors. RANK-L, expressed by osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells, binds to its functional receptor, RANK, to stimulate differentiation of osteoclasts from precursor cells and the proliferation and activity of mature osteoclasts. OPG, which is expressed by osteoblasts, stromal cells, dendritic cells, and megakaryocytes, limits this process by acting as a soluble decoy receptor for RANK-L.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The TNF family molecule RANK-L is encoded by a single gene (rankl) at human chromosome 13q14. RANK-L mRNA is expressed at highest levels in bone and bone marrow, as well as in lymphoid tissues (lymph node, thumus, spleen, fetal liver, and Peyer's patches) (Anderson et al. 1997, Nature 390: 175-179; Wong et al. 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272: 25190-25194; Lacey et al. 1998, Cell 93: 165-176; Yasuda et al. 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95: 3597-3602). Alternative splicing of RANK-L mRNA allows expression as a type II transmembrane glycoprotein of either 316 or 270 amino acids or as a soluble ligand of 243 amino acids (Kong et al. 1999, Nature 397: 315-323; Nagai et al. 2000, Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 269: 532-536). In addition, RANK-L can be released from its membrane bound state by metalloproteinases, including TNF-alpha convertase (Lum et al. 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274: 13613-13618). All four isoforms of RANK-L associate into trimeric molecules capable of triggering osteoclastogenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">RANK (receptor activator of NFkappaB also known as TRANCE-R, ODAR, or TNFRSF11A), expressed on preosteoclastic cells, is the sole receptor on these cells for RANK-L (Li et al. 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97: 1566-1571). RANK activation by RANK-L is followed by its interaction with TNF receptor-associated (TRAF) family members, activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and c-Fos, JNK, c-src, and the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB (Anderson et al. 1997, Nature 390: 175-179; Hsu et al. 1999, Proc. Acad. Sci. USA 96: 3540-3545).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">OPG (osteoprotegerin; &#x201c;protector of the bone&#x201d;; also known as osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (OCIF)) is a soluble, 110-kDa, disulfide-linked, homodimeric glycoprotein produced and released by activated osteoblast cells (Simonet et al. 1997, Cell 89: 309-319) with homology to the TNF receptor family, that functions as a decoy receptor for RANK-L and competes with RANK for RANK-L binding. Consequently, OPG is an effective inhibitor of osteoclast maturation and osteoclast activation (Simonet et al. 1997, Cell 89: 309-319; Lacey et al. 1998, Cell 93: 165-176; Kong et al. 1999, Nature 397: 315-323), thereby reducing bone resorption.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A more detailed overview of the OPG/RANK-L/RANK system as the mediator of bone formation and destruction is presented in Khosla, (2001 Endocrinology 142: 5050-5055), Holstead Jones et al. (2002, Ann Rheum. Dis. 61 (Suppl II): ii32-ii39), Bezerra et al. (2005, Brazilian J. Med. Biol. Res. 38: 161-170) and McClung (2006, Current Osteoporosis Reports 4: 28-33).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Several bone disorders occur when there is an imbalance between the resorption and formation components of bone remodeling activity (uncoupling of bone homeostasis). Imbalances between osteoclast and osteoblast activities can arise from a wide variety of hormonal changes or perturbations of inflammatory and growth factors, such as e.g. an altered balance between OPG and RANK-L. When bone resorption is greater than bone formation, there is a net loss of bone over time. This can eventually result in low bone mass (osteopenia) or osteoporosis. When bone formation exceeds resorption, there is a net increase in bone mass (osteopetrosis).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Excessive bone loss or destruction due to higher RANK-L, lower OPG or both has been implicated in many disease states, including post-menopausal osteoporosis (Eghbali-Fatourechi et al. 2003, Journal of Clinical Investigation 111: 1221-1230; Tsangari et al. 2004, Bone 35: 334-342; Abdallah et al. 2005, Calcified Tissue International 76: 90-97), primary hyperparathyroidism (Stilgren et al. 2004, Bone 35: 256-265; Johnell et al. 2005, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research 20: 1185-1194), Paget's disease of bone (Reddy 2004, Journal of Cellular Biochemistry 93: 688-696), metastatic bone disease (Brown 2004, Cancer Treatment and Research 118: 149-172), myeloma (Okada et al. 2003, Clinical and Experimental Metastasis 20: 639-646), rheumatoid arthritis (Crotti et al. 2002, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 61: 1047-1054) and several other metabolic or inflammatory bone and joint disorders (Locklin et al. 2001, Bone 28 (Suppl.): S80; Lewiecki 2006, Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 6: 1041-1050).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Pharmacological agents to decrease risk of fracture have been available for more than ten years. Anticatablolic drugs (oestrogens, bisphosphonates, calcitonin and selective oestrogen receptor modulators) decrease bone resporption, while anabolic agents, such as recombinant human parathyroid hormone (PTH), increase bone formation and bone size. The biophosphonate class of drugs is the one most often used for the treatment of osteoporosis. Although this drug class is generally very safe, oral dosing is complex and has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse events in a small percentage of clinical practice patients. Clinical trials are evaluating increasing intervals of intravenous biphosphonate dosing.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The recent discovery of the OPG/RANK-L/RANK system as pivotal regulatory factors in the pathogenesis of bone diseases and disorders like osteoporosis provides unique targets for therapeutic agents. In laboratory animals and in humans, administering forms of OPG markedly inhibited osteoclast activity and improved bone strength (Bekker et al. 2001, J. Bone Miner. Res. 16: 348-360; Campagnuolo et al. 2002, Arthritis Rheum. 46: 1926-1936; Bezerra et al. 2005, Brazilian J. Med. Biol. Res. 38: 161-170; McClung 2006, Current Osteoporosis Reports 4: 28-33). In early studies in humans, a fully human antibody against RANK-L (denosumab) reduced bone turnover and improved bone density (Body et al. 2003, Cancer 97: 887-892; Bekker et al. 2004, J. Bone Miner. Res. 19: 1059-1066; McClung 2006, Current Osteoporosis Reports 4: 28-33; Lewiecki 2006, Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 6: 1041-1050; McClung et al. 2006, N. Engl. J. Med. 354: 821-831). Such complete antibodies, however, face the drawbacks of full size antibodies such as high production costs, low stability, and their large size, which e.g. impedes their access to certain hidden epitopes.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Nanobodies are more potent and more stable than conventional four-chain antibodies which leads to (1) lower dosage forms, less frequent dosage leading to less side effects; and (2) improved stability leading to a broader choice of administration routes, comprising oral or subcutaneous routes and slow-release formulations in addition to the intravenous route.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Because of their small size, Nanobodies have the ability to cross membranes and penetrate into physicological compartments, tissues and organs not accessible to other, larger polypeptides and proteins. Nanbodies might, for example, easily penetrate into the bone matrix making them suited for the treatment of bone diseases and disorders.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The small size of the Nanobody also makes them ideally suited for their engineering into multivalent or multispecific polypeptides. In contrast to full antibodies which can bind to only one subunit of the RANK-L trimer, bivalent or trivalent polypeptides (based on respectively two or three Nanobodies against RANK-L), will be able to bind on respectively 2 or 3 subunits of the trimeric RANK-L molecule and might be advantageous because of their higher potency.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0049">The amino acid sequences provided by the invention are preferably in essentially isolated form (as defined herein), or form part of a protein or polypeptide of the invention (as defined herein), which may comprise or essentially consist of one or more amino acid sequences of the invention and which may optionally further comprise one or more further amino acid sequences (all optionally linked via one or more suitable linkers). For example, and without limitation, the one or more amino acid sequences of the invention may be used as a binding unit in such a protein or polypeptide, which may optionally contain one or more further amino acid sequences that can serve as a binding unit (i.e. against one or more other targets than RANK-L), so as to provide a monovalent, multivalent or multispecific polypeptide of the invention, respectively, all as described herein. Such a protein or polypeptide may also be in essentially isolated form (as defined herein).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0050">The amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention as such preferably essentially consist of a single amino acid chain that is not linked via disulphide bridges to any other amino acid sequence or chain (but that may or may not contain one or more intramolecular disulphide bridges. For example, it is known that Nanobodies&#x2014;as described herein&#x2014;may sometimes contain a disulphide bridge between CDR3 and CDR1 or FR2). However, it should be noted that one or more amino acid sequences of the invention may be linked to each other and/or to other amino acid sequences (e.g. via disulphide bridges) to provide peptide constructs that may also be useful in the invention (for example Fab&#x2032; fragments, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments, ScFv constructs, &#x201c;diabodies&#x201d; and other multispecific constructs. Reference is for example made to the review by Holliger and Hudson, Nat Biotechnol. 2005 September; 23(9):1126-36).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0051">Generally, when an amino acid sequence of the invention (or a compound, construct or polypeptide comprising the same) is intended for administration to a subject (for example for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes as described herein), it is preferably either an amino acid sequence that does not occur naturally in said subject; or, when it does occur naturally in said subject, in essentially isolated form (as defined herein).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0052">It will also be clear to the skilled person that for pharmaceutical use, the amino acid sequences of the invention (as well as compounds, constructs and polypeptides comprising the same) are preferably directed against human RANK-L; whereas for veterinary purposes, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are preferably directed against RANK-L from the species to be treated, or at least cross-reactive with RANK-L from the species to be treated.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0053">Furthermore, an amino acid sequence of the invention may optionally, and in addition to the at least one binding site for binding against RANK-L, contain one or more further binding sites for binding against other antigens, proteins or targets.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0054">The efficacy of the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention, and of compositions comprising the same, can be tested using any suitable in vitro assay, cell-based assay, in vivo assay and/or animal model known per se, or any combination thereof, depending on the specific disease or disorder involved. Suitable in vitro assays will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include ELISA; FACS binding assay; Biacore; competition binding assay (AlphaScreen&#xae;, Perkin Elmer, Mass., USA; FMAT); TRAP assay (osteoclast differentiation assay; Rissanen et al. 2005, J. Bone Miner. Res. 20, Suppl. 1: S256); NF-kappaB reporter gene assay (Mizukami et al. 2002, Mol. Cell. Biol. 22: 992-1000). EC50 values for binding of the Nanobodies of the invention (and of polypeptides comprising the same) to RANK-L in, for example ELISA or FACS are preferably 1 &#x3bc;M to 1 pM, more preferably 1 nM to 1 pM and more preferably 100 pM to 1 pM. IC50 values for binding of the Nanobodies of the invention (and of polypeptides comprising the same) to RANK-L in, for example, AlphaScreen&#xae;, NF-kappaB assay or TRAP assay are preferably 1 &#x3bc;M to 1 pM, more preferably 1 nM to 1 pM and more preferably 100 pM to 1 pM.</p>

USA 20: 13960-13965) or ovariectomized rats and cynomolgus monkeys (Simonet et al. 1997, Cell 89: 309-319; Hoegh-Andersen et al. 2004, Arthritis Res.

<p id="p-0054" num="0056">Also, according to the invention, amino acid sequences and polypeptides that are directed against RANK-L from a first species of warm-blooded animal may or may not show cross-reactivity with RANK-L from one or more other species of warm-blooded animal. For example, amino acid sequences and polypeptides directed against human RANK-L may or may not show cross reactivity with RANK-L from one or more other species of primates (such as, without limitation, monkeys from the genus <i>Macaca </i>(such as, and in particular, cynomolgus monkeys (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) and/or rhesus monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>)) and baboon (<i>Papio ursinus</i>)) and/or with RANK-L from one or more species of animals that are often used in animal models for diseases (for example mouse, rat, rabbit, pig or dog), and in particular in animal models for diseases and disorders associated with RANK-L (such as the species and animal models mentioned herein). In this respect, it will be clear to the skilled person that such cross-reactivity, when present, may have advantages from a drug development point of view, since it allows the amino acid sequences and polypeptides against human RANK-L to be tested in such disease models.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0057">More generally, amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention that are cross-reactive with RANK-L from multiple species of mammal will usually be advantageous for use in veterinary applications, since it will allow the same amino acid sequence or polypeptide to be used across multiple species. Thus, it is also encompassed within the scope of the invention that amino acid sequences and polypeptides directed against RANK-L from one species of animal (such as amino acid sequences and polypeptides against human RANK-L) can be used in the treatment of another species of animal, as long as the use of the amino acid sequences and/or polypeptides provide the desired effects in the species to be treated.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0058">In one embodiment, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention directed against human RANK-L are cross-reactive with RANK-L from cynomolgus monkey.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0059">In another embodiment, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention directed against human RANK-L are cross-reactive with RANK-L from mice or rats.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0060">In another embodiment, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention directed against human RANK-L are cross-reactive with RANK-L from cynomolgus monkey and with RANK-L from mice or rats.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0061">In another embodiment, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention directed against human RANK-L are not cross-reactive with RANK-L from mice or rats.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0062">In another embodiment, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention directed against human RANK-L are cross-reactive with RANK-L from cynomolgus monkey while not being cross-reactive with RANK-L from mice or rats.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0063">In another embodiment, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention directed against human RANK-L are not cross-reactive with RANK-L from cynomolgus monkey.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0064">In another embodiment, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention directed against human RANK-L are not cross-reactive with RANK-L from cynomolgus monkey and not with RANK-L from mice or rats.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0065">The present invention is in its broadest sense also not particularly limited to or defined by a specific antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) of RANK-L against which the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are directed. For example, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides may or may not be directed against an &#x201c;interaction site&#x201d; (as defined herein). However, it is generally assumed and preferred that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are preferably directed against an interaction site (as defined herein), and in particular against the binding site on RANK-L for RANK or against the binding site on RANK-L for OPG.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0066">Thus, in one preferred, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are directed against the RANK receptor binding site on RANK-L, and are as further defined herein. Binding of the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention to the RANK receptor binding site on RANK-L may inhibit and/or prevent binding of RANK-L to RANK, and thus inhibit or prevent the signalling that is mediated by this RANK-L/RANK binding. The amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention therefore can act as antagonists of the RANK-L/RANK mediated signalling.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0067">In one, specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are directed against the RANK receptor binding site on RANK-L while not interfering (reducing/inhibiting) with the RANK-L/OPG interaction. In this specific aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will act as antagonists of the RANK-L/RANK mediated signalling (and inhibit osteoclast maturation and activation) in addition to the OPG mediated inhibition of osteoclast maturation and activation.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0068">In another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are directed against the OPG binding site on RANK-L, and are as further defined herein. Binding of the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention to the OPG binding site on RANK-L may inhibit and/or prevent binding of RANK-L to OPG. The amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may therefore act as a competitive or as a non-competitive inhibitor of the binding of RANK-L to OPG (e.g. in ELISA, in AlphaScreen&#xae; assay, in TRAP assay and/or in NFkappaB assay). Binding of the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention to the OPG binding site on RANK-L may, by its turn, inhibit and/or prevent binding of RANK-L to RANK, and thus inhibit and/or prevent the signalling that is mediated by this RANK-L/RANK binding. The amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention therefore can act as antagonists of the RANK-L and RANK-L/RANK mediated signalling (i.e. they inhibit RANK/RANK-L interaction).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0069">In some cases, however, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may be directed against an OPG binding site on RANK-L and interfere with the binding of RANK-L to OPG without essentially reducing the binding of RANK-L to RANK. In this case the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may boost the signalling that is mediated by this RANK-L/RANK interaction and act as agonists of the RANK-L and RANK-L/RANK mediated signalling (i.e. they act as antagonist of the action of OPG).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0070">In another aspect of the present invention, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are preferably directed against an epitope on RANK-L that overlaps with the epitope of denosumab. Binding of the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention to an epitope on RANK-L that overlaps with the eptiope of denosumab may inhibit and/or prevent binding of denosumab to RANK-L. The amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may therefore act as a competitive or as a non-competitive inhibitor of the binding of denosumab to RANK-L (e.g. in ELISA, in AlphaScreen&#xae; assay, in TRAP assay and/or in NFkappaB assay).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0071">As further described herein, a polypeptide of the invention may contain two or more amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against RANK-L. Generally, such polypeptides will bind to RANK-L with increased avidity compared to a single amino acid sequence of the invention. Such a polypeptide may for example comprise two amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against the same antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) of RANK-L (which may or may not be an interaction site); or comprise at least one &#x201c;first&#x201d; amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a first same antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) of RANK-L (which may or may not be an interaction site); and at least one &#x201c;second&#x201d; amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a second antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) different from the first (and which again may or may not be an interaction site). Preferably, in such &#x201c;biparatopic&#x201d; polypeptides of the invention, at least one amino acid sequence of the invention is directed against an interaction site (as defined herein), although the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0072">Thus, in one particular aspect, a polypeptide of the invention may comprise two or more amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against the binding site for RANK on RANK-L; or comprise at least one &#x201c;first&#x201d; amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against the binding site for RANK on RANK-L; and at least one &#x201c;second&#x201d; amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a second antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation different from the first and which is not a binding site for RANK on RANK-L.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0073">Thus, in another particular aspect, a polypeptide of the invention may comprise two or more amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against the binding site for OPG on RANK-L; or comprise at least one &#x201c;first&#x201d; amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against the binding site for OPG on RANK-L; and at least one &#x201c;second&#x201d; amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a second antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation different from the first and which is not a binding site for OPG on RANK-L.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0074">Also, when the target is part of a binding pair (for example, a receptor-ligand binding pair), the amino acid sequences and polypeptides may be such that they compete with the cognate binding partner (e.g. the ligand, receptor or other binding partner, as applicable) for binding to the target, and/or such that they (fully or partially) neutralize binding of the binding partner to the target.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0075">It is also within the scope of the invention that, where applicable, an amino acid sequence of the invention can bind to two or more antigenic determinants, epitopes, parts, domains, subunits or confirmations of RANK-L. In such a case, the antigenic determinants, epitopes, parts, domains or subunits of RANK-L to which the amino acid sequences and/or polypeptides of the invention bind may be essentially the same (for example, if RANK-L contains repeated structural motifs or occurs in a multimeric form) or may be different (and in the latter case, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to such different antigenic determinants, epitopes, parts, domains, subunits of RANK-L with an affinity and/or specificity which may be the same or different). In a preferred, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind two or three subunits of the RANK-L trimer. Also, for example, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to a conformation of RANK-L in which it is bound to a pertinent ligand, may bind to a conformation of RANK-L in which it not bound to a pertinent ligand, or may bind to both such conformations (again with an affinity and/or specificity which may be the same or different). For example, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to a conformation of RANK-L in which it is bound to RANK, may bind to a conformation of RANK-L in which it not bound to RANK, or may bind to both such conformations (again with an affinity and/or specificity which may be the same or different). For example, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to a conformation of RANK-L in which it is bound to OPG, may bind to a conformation of RANK-L in which it not bound to OPG, or may bind to both such conformations (again with an affinity and/or specificity which may be the same or different).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0076">RANK-L exists in a membrane bound and soluble form. The amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to either forms, or preferably the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to both these forms. RANK-L exists in four different isoforms (see supra). The amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to either one of the four isoforms of RANK-L, or may bind to more than one such as two, three or all four isoforms of RANK-L.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0077">It is also expected that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will generally bind to all naturally occurring or synthetic analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments of RANK-L; or at least to those analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments of RANK-L that contain one or more antigenic determinants or epitopes that are essentially the same as the antigenic determinant(s) or epitope(s) to which the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind in RANK-L (e.g. in wild-type RANK-L). Again, in such a case, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to such analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments with an affinity and/or specificity that are the same as, or that are different from (i.e. higher than or lower than), the affinity and specificity with which the amino acid sequences of the invention bind to (wild-type) RANK-L. It is also included within the scope of the invention that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind to some analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments of RANK-L, but not to others.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0078">The amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to other, related TNF family members (e.g. TRAIL, TNF-alpha and/or CD40 ligand). In a preferred aspect, however, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will have no detectable affinity for related TNF family members (i.e. an affinity which is more than 10 times, preferably more than 100 times, more preferably more than 1000 times lower than its affinity for RANK-L). In one aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will have no detectable affinity for TRAIL. In another aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will have no detectable affinity for TNF-alpha. In another aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will have no detectable affinity for CD40 ligand. In yet another aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will have no detectable affinity for TRAIL, TNF-alpha and/or CD40 ligand.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0079">Similar to all known TNF cytokine family members, RANK-L self-assembles into noncovalently associated trimers. When RANK-L exists in a monomeric form and in one or more multimeric forms, it is within the scope of the invention that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention only bind to RANK-L in monomeric form, only bind to RANK-L in multimeric form, or bind to both the monomeric and the multimeric form. Again, in such a case, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to the monomeric form with an affinity and/or specificity that are the same as, or that are different from (i.e. higher than or lower than), the affinity and specificity with which the amino acid sequences of the invention bind to the multimeric form.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0080">In one non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind to RANK-L such that the formation of the RANK-L trimer is prevented and/or inhibited.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0081">It is accepted that RANK-L binds one receptor molecule (RANK) along each of the three clefts (or grooves) formed by neighboring monomers of the homotrimer. In this way, the RANK-L trimer exhibits three spatially distinct, but equivalent, intersubunit receptor-binding grooves into which three receptor molecules bind. Therefore, in order to inhibit the interaction between RANK-L and its receptors, therapeutic molecules should preferably target these intersubunit receptor binding grooves of RANK-L. Nanobodies (as further defined herein) can show so-called cavity-binding properties (inter alia due to their extended CDR3 loop, compared to conventional V<sub>H </sub>domains) and are therefore ideally suited for inhibition of the interaction of RANK-L with its RANK receptor. Accordingly, in a preferred aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind to the intersubunit receptor-binding grooves of RANK-L</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0082">Also, when RANK-L can associate with other proteins or polypeptides to form protein complexes (e.g. with multiple subunits), it is within the scope of the invention that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind to RANK-L in its non-associated state, bind to RANK-L in its associated state, or bind to both. In all these cases, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to such multimers or associated protein complexes with an affinity and/or specificity that may be the same as or different from (i.e. higher than or lower than) the affinity and/or specificity with which the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind to RANK-L in its monomeric and non-associated state.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0083">Generally, amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will at least bind to those forms of RANK-L (including monomeric, multimeric and associated forms) that are the most relevant from a biological and/or therapeutic point of view, as will be clear to the skilled person.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0084">Also, generally, polypeptides of the invention that contain two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies directed against RANK-L may bind with higher avidity than the corresponding monomeric amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0085">For example, and without limitation, a multivalent (as defined herein) protein or polypeptide that contains two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies that are directed against different epitopes of RANK-L may bind to RANK-L with higher avidity than the corresponding monomers.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0086">More importantly, a multivalent (as defined herein) protein or polypeptide that contains two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies that are directed against RANK-L may (and usually will) bind with higher avidity to a multimer of RANK-L than to a monomer of RANK-L, and will usually also bind with higher avidity than the corresponding monomeric amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies. In such a multivalent protein or polypeptide, the two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies may for example be directed against the same epitopes, substantially equivalent epitopes, or different epitopes. In one embodiment of such a multivalent protein or polypeptide, the two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies may be the same (and therefore be directed against the same epitope).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0087">The latter is of particular importance, as it is known that the primary mode of signal transduction by RANK-L involves binding of RANK receptors to a trimer of RANK-L molecules, which contains three receptor binding sites (see for example Lam et al. 2001, J. Clin. Invest. 108: 971-979).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0088">In the present invention, it has been found that amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies are capable of binding to RANK-L in such a way that the activity of RANK-L is reduced, both in in vitro models and in cellular models (see the Experimental Section below). Although the invention is not limited to any specific mechanism, explanation or hypothesis, it is assumed that because of their small size and high affinity for RANK-L, two or three monovalent amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies of the invention are capable of simultaneously occupying two or three different receptor binding sites on the RANK-L trimer, thus preventing the trimer to initiate receptor binding and thereby to initiate signal transduction (however, other mechanisms of action are not excluded: for example, depending on the epitope against which it is directed, an amino acid sequence and/or Nanobody of the invention may also inhibit the association of RANK-L into the trimeric state).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0089">It should also be noted that, in addition or as an alternative to binding to two or more receptor binding sites on a single RANK-L trimer, the proteins or polypeptides of the present invention that comprises or essentially consists of two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies that are directed against epitopes of RANK-L may bind (e.g. intermolecularly) epitopes on two separate RANK-L molecules (e.g. two separate trimers).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0090">However, according to one particularly preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a protein or polypeptide that comprises or essentially consists of two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies that are each directed against epitopes on RANK-L (and in particular on the RANK-L trimer) that lie in and/or form part of the receptor binding site(s) of the RANK-L trimer, such that said polypeptide, upon binding to a RANK-L trimer, is capable of inhibiting or reducing the RANK receptor binding that is mediated by said RANK-L trimer and/or the signal transduction that is mediated by such receptor binding.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0091">In particular, according to this preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a protein or polypeptide that comprises or essentially consist of two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies that are each directed against epitopes on RANK-L (and in particular on the RANK-L trimer) that lie in and/or form part of the receptor binding site(s) of the RANK-L trimer, wherein said amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies are linked to each other in such a way that the protein or polypeptide is capable of simultaneously binding to two or more receptor binding sites on a single RANK-L trimer (in other words, is capable of intramolecular binding to at least two RANK-L receptor binding sites on a RANK-L trimer). In this embodiment, the two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies are preferably as defined above and are most preferably Nanobodies (so that the protein or polypeptide is a multivalent Nanobody construct, as further described herein). Also, in this embodiment, the two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies may be the same or different; and may directed against different epitopes within the RANK receptor binding site(s), but are preferably directed against the same epitope. Some preferred, but non-limiting constructs of this embodiment of the invention are SEQ ID NO's: 622 to 693, 761 to 762 and 766 to 773.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0092">In this embodiment of the invention, the two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies will usually be linked via one or more suitable linkers, which linkers are such that each amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies can bind to a different receptor binding site on the same RANK-L trimer. Suitable linkers will inter alia depend on (the distance between) the epitopes on the RANK-L trimer to which the amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies bind, and will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein, optionally after some limited degree of routine experimentation. For example, when the two or more amino acid sequences are (single) domain antibodies or Nanobodies, suitable linkers may be chosen from the linkers described herein, but with a linker length that is such that the two or more (single) domain antibodies or Nanobodies can each bind to a different receptor binding site on the same RANK-L trimer.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0093">Also, when the two or more amino acid sequences that bind to the receptor binding sites of RANK-L are (single) domain antibodies or Nanobodies, they may also be linked to each other via a third (single) domain antibody or Nanobody (in which the two or more (single) domain antibodies or Nanobodies may be linked directly to the third (single) domain antibody/Nanobody or via suitable linkers). Such a third (single) domain antibody or Nanobody may for example be a (single) domain antibody or Nanobody that provides for an increased half-life, as further described herein. For example, the latter (single) domain antibody or Nanobody may be a (single) domain antibody or Nanobody that is capable of binding to a (human) serum protein such as (human) serum albumin, as further described herein. Some non-limiting examples of such constructs are the constructs of SEQ ID NO's: 694-729 and 759-760. Such a third (single) domain antibody or Nanobody may for example be a (single) domain antibody or Nanobody that is directed against and/or can bind another epitope on RANK-L, providing a biparatopic (single) domain antibody or Nanobodies, as is further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0094">Alternatively, the two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies that bind to the receptor binding site(s) of RANK-L may be linked in series (either directly or via a suitable linker) and the third (single) domain antibody or Nanobody (which may provide for increased half-life or which may bind another epitope on RANK-L, as described above) may be connected directly or via a linker to one of these two or more aforementioned amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0095">More generally, the distance between the two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies should be such that it allows the protein or polypeptide to undergo intramolecular binding to the RANK-L trimer (i.e. instead of intermolecular binding). The distance between the N-terminus and the C-terminus of two anti-RANK-L amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies can be determined by any suitable means, such as by crystallography or molecular modelling (as described, for example, by Lam et al. 2001, J. Clin. Invest. 108: 971-979). These techniques generally also make it possible to determine whether a specific multivalent or multispecific protein or polypeptide is capable of providing intramolecular modelling. Alternatively, size-exclusion chromatography (as described by Santora et al., Anal. Biochem., 299: 119-129) could be used to determine whether a given protein or polypeptide of the invention will (predominantly) provide intramolecular binding to a RANK-L trimer or (predominantly) intermolecular binding between two or more RANK-L trimers. Thus, in one particular embodiment of the invention, a protein or polypeptide of the invention is preferably such that, in this experiment, it predominantly or essentially exclusively leads to intramolecular binding. However, as emphasized above, it should be noted that proteins or polypeptides of the invention that operate via intermolecular binding of separate RANK-L molecules (e.g. trimers) are also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0096">Thus, in another preferred aspect, the invention provides for a multivalent or multispecific protein or polypeptide that comprises at least two amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies against RANK-L (and in particular of the RANK-L trimer), in which said at least two amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies are linked in such a way that the distance between the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the at least two anti-RANK-L amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies is such that the protein or polypeptide is capable of undergoing intramolecular binding (as described herein) with a RANK-L trimer.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0097">In such a preferred protein or polypeptide, the two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies may be linked in any suitable fashion, as long as the preferred distance between the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the at least two anti-RANK-L amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies can be achieved, and/or as long as the protein or polypeptide is capable of undergoing intramolecular binding (as described herein) with a RANK-L trimer.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0098">For example, in its simplest form, the at least two amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies are directly linked via a suitable linker or spacer that provides for the preferred distance between the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the at least two anti-RANK-L amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies and which may allow the protein or polypeptide to undergo intramolecular binding (as described herein) with a RANK-L trimer. Suitable linkers are described herein, and may&#x2014;for example and without limitation&#x2014;comprise an amino acid sequence, which amino acid sequence preferably has a length of from 1 up to 50 or more amino acids, more preferably from 5 to 30 amino acids, such as about 9 to 20 amino acids. Preferably, such an amino acid sequence should also be such that it allows the protein or polypeptide to undergo intramolecular binding (as described herein) with a RANK-L trimer.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0099">Thus, in another preferred aspect, the invention provides for a multivalent or multispecific protein or polypeptide that comprises at least two amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies against RANK-L (and in particular the RANK-L trimer), in which said amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies are preferably directly linked to each other using a suitable linker or spacer such that the distance between the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the at least two anti-RANK-L amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies is such that the protein or polypeptide is capable of undergoing intramolecular binding (as described herein) with a RANK-L trimer.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0100">More preferably, in this preferred aspect, the linker or spacer is an amino acid sequence that preferably has a length of from 1 up to 50 or more amino acids, more preferably from 5 to 30 amino acids, such as about 9 to 20 amino acids. In one preferred, but non-limiting embodiment, the linker essentially consists of glycine and serine residues (as further described below). For example, one suitable linker is the GS9 linker described herein, which comprises 9 amino acid residues, the GS15 linker described herein, which comprises 15 amino acid residues, the GS20 linker described herein, which comprises 20 amino acid residues and the GS30 linker described herein, which comprises 30 amino acid residues.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0101">In another embodiment, the at least two amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies against RANK-L are linked to each other via another moiety (optionally via one or two linkers), such as another protein or polypeptide. In this embodiment, it may be desirable to have the preferred distance (i.e. as mentioned above) between the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the at least two anti-RANK-L amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies, for example such that the protein or polypeptide can still undergo intramolecular binding (as described herein) with a RANK-L trimer. In this embodiment, the at least two amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies may be linked directly to the other moiety, or using a suitable linker or spacer, again as long as the preferred distance and/or desired intramolecular binding can still be achieved. The moiety may be any suitable moiety which does not detract (too much) from the binding of the protein or polypeptide to RANK-L and/or from the further desired biological or pharmacological properties of the protein or polypeptide. As such, the moiety may be essentially inactive or may be biologically active, and as such may or may not improve the desired properties of the protein or polypeptide and/or may confer one or more additional desired properties to the protein or polypeptide. For example, and without limitation, the moiety may improve the half-life of the protein or polypeptide, and/or may reduce its immunogenicity or improve any other desired property. In one preferred embodiment, the moiety may be another amino acid sequences and/or Nanobody (including but not limited to a third amino acid sequences and/or Nanobody against RANK-L, although this is not necessary and usually less preferred), and in particular another amino acid sequences and/or Nanobody that improves the half-life of the protein or polypeptide, such as an amino acid sequences and/or Nanobody that is directed against a serum protein, for example against human serum albumin. Examples of such proteins and polypeptides are described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0102">Thus, in one embodiment, the invention relates to a multivalent multispecific construct comprising two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies that are each directed against epitopes on RANK-L (e.g. on the RANK-L trimer) that lie in and/or form part of the receptor binding site, and that are linked to each other via at least one amino acid sequences and/or Nanobody that provides for increased half-life (and optionally via one or more suitable linkers), such that said polypeptide, upon binding to a RANK-L trimer, is capable inhibiting or reducing the RANK receptor binding and/or the signal transduction that is mediated by said RANK-L trimer. Such a polypeptide may be such that said first mentioned two or more amino acid sequences and/or Nanobodies can each bind to a different receptor binding site on a RANK-L trimer.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0103">In particular, in this embodiment, the polypeptide may comprise a trivalent bispecific Nanobody, that comprises two Nanobodies that are each directed against epitopes on RANK-L (and in particular of the RANK-L trimer) that lie in and/or form part of the receptor binding site, in which said Nanobodies are linked to each other via a third Nanobody that provides for an increased half-life (e.g. a Nanobody that is directed to a serum protein such as human serum albumin), in which each of the first mentioned two Nanobodies may be directly linked to said third Nanobody or via one or more suitable linkers, such that said polypeptide, upon binding to a RANK-L trimer, is capable of inhibiting or reducing the RANK receptor binding and/or the signal transduction that is mediated by said RANK-L trimer. Such a polypeptide may be such that said first mentioned two Nanobodies can each bind to a different receptor binding site on a RANK-L trimer. Again, some particularly preferred Nanobodies for use in this embodiment of the invention are presented in SEQ ID NO's: 560 to 621, as well as humanized and other variants thereof (such as e.g. SEQ ID NO's: 730 to 757 and 765); and the Nanobodies directed against human serum albumin described herein. Some preferred, but non-limiting constructs of this embodiment of the invention are SEQ ID NO's: 694 to 729 and 759 to 760.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0104">It is also within the scope of the invention to use parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives of the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention, and/or to use proteins or polypeptides comprising or essentially consisting of one or more of such parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives, as long as these are suitable for the uses envisaged herein. Such parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives will usually contain (at least part of) a functional antigen-binding site for binding against RANK-L; and more preferably will be capable of specific binding to RANK-L, and even more preferably capable of binding to RANK-L with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K<sub>D</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a K<sub>A</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a k<sub>on</sub>-rate and/or a k<sub>off</sub>-rate, or alternatively as an IC<sub>50 </sub>value, as further described herein) that is as defined herein. Some non-limiting examples of such parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles, derivatives, proteins and/or polypeptides will become clear from the further description herein. Additional fragments or polypeptides of the invention may also be provided by suitably combining (i.e. by linking or genetic fusion) one or more (smaller) parts or fragments as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0105">In one specific, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, which will be further described herein, such analogs, mutants, variants, alleles, derivatives have an increased half-life in serum (as further described herein) compared to the amino acid sequence from which they have been derived. For example, an amino acid sequence of the invention may be linked (chemically or otherwise) to one or more groups or moieties that extend the half-life (such as PEG), so as to provide a derivative of an amino acid sequence of the invention with increased half-life.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0106">In one specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be an amino acid sequence that comprises an immunoglobulin fold or may be an amino acid sequence that, under suitable conditions (such as physiological conditions) is capable of forming an immunoglobulin fold (i.e. by folding). Reference is inter alia made to the review by Halaby et al., J. (1999) Protein Eng. 12, 563-71. Preferably, when properly folded so as to form an immunoglobulin fold, such an amino acid sequence is capable of specific binding (as defined herein) to RANK-L; and more preferably capable of binding to RANK-L with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K<sub>D</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a K<sub>A</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a k<sub>on</sub>-rate and/or a k<sub>off</sub>-rate, or alternatively as an IC<sub>50 </sub>value, as further described herein) that is as defined herein. Also, parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives of such amino acid sequences are preferably such that they comprise an immunoglobulin fold or are capable for forming, under suitable conditions, an immunoglobulin fold.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0107">In particular, but without limitation, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be amino acid sequences that essentially consist of 4 framework regions (FR1 to FR4 respectively) and 3 complementarity determining regions (CDR1 to CDR3 respectively); or any suitable fragment of such an amino acid sequence (which will then usually contain at least some of the amino acid residues that form at least one of the CDR's, as further described herein).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0108">The amino acid sequences of the invention may in particular be an immunoglobulin sequence or a suitable fragment thereof, and more in particular be an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence or a suitable fragment thereof, such as light chain variable domain sequence (e.g. a V<sub>L</sub>-sequence) or a suitable fragment thereof; or a heavy chain variable domain sequence (e.g. a V<sub>H</sub>-sequence) or a suitable fragment thereof. When the amino acid sequence of the invention is a heavy chain variable domain sequence, it may be a heavy chain variable domain sequence that is derived from a conventional four-chain antibody (such as, without limitation, a V<sub>H </sub>sequence that is derived from a human antibody) or be a so-called V<sub>HH</sub>-sequence (as defined herein) that is derived from a so-called &#x201c;heavy chain antibody&#x201d; (as defined herein).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0109">However, it should be noted that the invention is not limited as to the origin of the amino acid sequence of the invention (or of the nucleotide sequence of the invention used to express it), nor as to the way that the amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of the invention is (or has been) generated or obtained. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be naturally occurring amino acid sequences (from any suitable species) or synthetic or semi-synthetic amino acid sequences. In a specific but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence is a naturally occurring immunoglobulin sequence (from any suitable species) or a synthetic or semi-synthetic immunoglobulin sequence, including but not limited to &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; (as defined herein) immunoglobulin sequences (such as partially or fully humanized mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin sequences, and in particular partially or fully humanized V<sub>HH </sub>sequences or Nanobodies), &#x201c;camelized&#x201d; (as defined herein) immunoglobulin sequences, as well as immunoglobulin sequences that have been obtained by techniques such as affinity maturation (for example, starting from synthetic, random or naturally occurring immunoglobulin sequences), CDR grafting, veneering, combining fragments derived from different immunoglobulin sequences, PCR assembly using overlapping primers, and similar techniques for engineering immunoglobulin sequences well known to the skilled person; or any suitable combination of any of the foregoing. Reference is for example made to the standard handbooks, as well as to the further description and prior art mentioned herein.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0110">Similarly, the nucleotide sequences of the invention may be naturally occurring nucleotide sequences or synthetic or semi-synthetic sequences, and may for example be sequences that are isolated by PCR from a suitable naturally occurring template (e.g. DNA or RNA isolated from a cell), nucleotide sequences that have been isolated from a library (and in particular, an expression library), nucleotide sequences that have been prepared by introducing mutations into a naturally occurring nucleotide sequence (using any suitable technique known per se, such as mismatch PCR), nucleotide sequence that have been prepared by PCR using overlapping primers, or nucleotide sequences that have been prepared using techniques for DNA synthesis known per se.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0111">The amino acid sequence of the invention may in particular be a domain antibody (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a domain antibody), a single domain antibody (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a single domain antibody), a &#x201c;dAb&#x201d; (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a dAb) or a Nanobody (as defined herein, and including but not limited to a V<sub>HH </sub>sequence); other single variable domains, or any suitable fragment of any one thereof. For a general description of (single) domain antibodies, reference is also made to the prior art cited above, as well as to EP 0 368 684. For the term &#x201c;dAb's&#x201d;, reference is for example made to Ward et al. (Nature 1989 Oct. 12; 341 (6242): 544-6), to Holt et al., Trends Biotechnol., 2003, 21(11):484-490; as well as to for example WO 06/030220, WO 06/003388 and other published patent applications of Domantis Ltd. It should also be noted that, although less preferred in the context of the present invention because they are not of mammalian origin, single domain antibodies or single variable domains can be derived from certain species of shark (for example, the so-called &#x201c;IgNAR domains&#x201d;, see for example WO 05/18629).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0112">In particular, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be a Nanobody&#xae; (as defined herein) or a suitable fragment thereof.

<p id="p-0111" num="0113">For a general description of Nanobodies, reference is made to the further description below, as well as to the prior art cited herein. In this respect, it should however be noted that this description and the prior art mainly described Nanobodies of the so-called &#x201c;V<sub>H</sub>3 class&#x201d; (i.e. Nanobodies with a high degree of sequence homology to human germline sequences of the V<sub>H</sub>3 class such as DP-47, DP-51 or DP-29), which Nanobodies form a preferred aspect of this invention. It should however be noted that the invention in its broadest sense generally covers any type of Nanobody directed against RANK-L, and for example also covers the Nanobodies belonging to the so-called &#x201c;V<sub>H</sub>4 class&#x201d; (i.e. Nanobodies with a high degree of sequence homology to human germline sequences of the V<sub>H</sub>4 class such as DP-78), as for example described in WO 07/118,670.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0114">Generally, Nanobodies (in particular V<sub>HH </sub>sequences and partially humanized Nanobodies) can in particular be characterized by the presence of one or more &#x201c;Hallmark residues&#x201d; (as described herein) in one or more of the framework sequences (again as further described herein).</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0134">In particular, humanized Nanobodies may be amino acid sequences that are as generally defined for Nanobodies in the previous paragraphs, but in which at least one amino acid residue is present (and in particular, in at least one of the framework residues) that is and/or that corresponds to a humanizing substitution (as defined herein). Some preferred, but non-limiting humanizing substitutions (and suitable combinations thereof) will become clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. In addition, or alternatively, other potentially useful humanizing substitutions can be ascertained by comparing the sequence of the framework regions of a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>sequence with the corresponding framework sequence of one or more closely related human V<sub>H </sub>sequences, after which one or more of the potentially useful humanizing substitutions (or combinations thereof) thus determined can be introduced into said V<sub>HH </sub>sequence (in any manner known per se, as further described herein) and the resulting humanized V<sub>HH </sub>sequences can be tested for affinity for the target, for stability, for ease and level of expression, and/or for other desired properties. In this way, by means of a limited degree of trial and error, other suitable humanizing substitutions (or suitable combinations thereof) can be determined by the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. Also, based on the foregoing, (the framework regions of) a Nanobody may be partially humanized or fully humanized.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0135">Some particularly preferred humanized Nanobodies of the invention are humanized variants of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO's: 560-621, of which the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 730-757 and 765 are some especially preferred examples.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0136">Thus, some other preferred Nanobodies of the invention are Nanobodies which can bind (as further defined herein) to RANK-L and which:
<ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0137">i) are a humanized variant of one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 560-621; and/or</li>

<br/>
and in which:
</li>
    <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0139">i) preferably one or more of the amino acid residues at positions 11, 37, 44, 45, 47, 83, 84, 103, 104 and 108 according to the Kabat numbering are chosen from the Hallmark residues mentioned in Table A-3 below.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0140">According to another specific aspect of the invention, the invention provides a number of stretches of amino acid residues (i.e. small peptides) that are particularly suited for binding to RANK-L. These stretches of amino acid residues may be present in, and/or may be corporated into, an amino acid sequence of the invention, in particular in such a way that they form (part of) the antigen binding site of an amino acid sequence of the invention. As these stretches of amino acid residues were first generated as CDR sequences of heavy chain antibodies or V<sub>HH </sub>sequences that were raised against RANK-L (or may be based on and/or derived from such CDR sequences, as further described herein), they will also generally be referred to herein as &#x201c;CDR sequences&#x201d; (i.e. as CDR1 sequences, CDR2 sequences and CDR3 sequences, respectively). It should however be noted that the invention in its broadest sense is not limited to a specific structural role or function that these stretches of amino acid residues may have in an amino acid sequence of the invention, as long as these stretches of amino acid residues allow the amino acid sequence of the invention to bind to RANK-L. Thus, generally, the invention in its broadest sense comprises any amino acid sequence that is capable of binding to RANK-L and that comprises one or more CDR sequences as described herein, and in particular a suitable combination of two or more such CDR sequences, that are suitably linked to each other via one or more further amino acid sequences, such that the entire amino acid sequence forms a binding domain and/or binding unit that is capable of binding to RANK-L. It should however also be noted that the presence of only one such CDR sequence in an amino acid sequence of the invention may by itself already be sufficient to provide an amino acid sequence of the invention that is capable of binding to RANK-L; reference is for example again made to the so-called &#x201c;Expedite fragments&#x201d; described in WO 03/050531.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0141">Thus, in another specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be an amino acid sequence that comprises at least one amino acid sequence that is chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1 sequences, CDR2 sequences and CDR3 sequences that are described herein (or any suitable combination thereof). In particular, an amino acid sequence of the invention may be an amino acid sequence that comprises at least one antigen binding site, wherein said antigen binding site comprises at least one amino acid sequence that is chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1 sequences, CDR2 sequences and CDR3 sequences that are described herein (or any suitable combination thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0142">Generally, in this aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be any amino acid sequence that comprises at least one stretch of amino acid residues, in which said stretch of amino acid residues has an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the sequence of at least one of the CDR sequences described herein. Such an amino acid sequence may or may not comprise an immunoglobulin fold. For example, and without limitation, such an amino acid sequence may be a suitable fragment of an immunoglobulin sequence that comprises at least one such CDR sequence, but that is not large enough to form a (complete) immunoglobulin fold (reference is for example again made to the &#x201c;Expedite fragments&#x201d; described in WO 03/050531). Alternatively, such an amino acid sequence may be a suitable &#x201c;protein scaffold&#x201d; that comprises least one stretch of amino acid residues that corresponds to such a CDR sequence (i.e. as part of its antigen binding site). Suitable scaffolds for presenting amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person, and for example comprise, without limitation, to binding scaffolds based on or derived from immunoglobulins (i.e. other than the immunoglobulin sequences already described herein), protein scaffolds derived from protein A domains (such as Affibodies&#x2122;), tendamistat, fibronectin, lipocalin, CTLA-4, T-cell receptors, designed ankyrin repeats, avimers and PDZ domains (Binz et al., Nat. Biotech 2005, Vol 23:1257), and binding moieties based on DNA or RNA including but not limited to DNA or RNA aptamers (Ulrich et al., Comb Chem High Throughput Screen 2006 9(8):619-32).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0143">Again, any amino acid sequence of the invention that comprises one or more of these CDR sequences is preferably such that it can specifically bind (as defined herein) to RANK-L, and more in particular such that it can bind to RANK-L with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K<sub>D</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a K<sub>A</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a k<sub>on</sub>-rate and/or a k<sub>off</sub>-rate, or alternatively as an IC<sub>50 </sub>value, as further described herein), that is as defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0144">More in particular, the amino acid sequences according to this aspect of the invention may be any amino acid sequence that comprises at least one antigen binding site, wherein said antigen binding site comprises at least two amino acid sequences that are chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1 sequences described herein, the CDR2 sequences described herein and the CDR3 sequences described herein, such that (i) when the first amino acid sequence is chosen from the CDR1 sequences described herein, the second amino acid sequence is chosen from the CDR2 sequences described herein or the CDR3 sequences described herein; (ii) when the first amino acid sequence is chosen from the CDR2 sequences described herein, the second amino acid sequence is chosen from the CDR1 sequences described herein or the CDR3 sequences described herein; or (iii) when the first amino acid sequence is chosen from the CDR3 sequences described herein, the second amino acid sequence is chosen from the CDR1 sequences described herein or the CDR3 sequences described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0145">Even more in particular, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be amino acid sequences that comprise at least one antigen binding site, wherein said antigen binding site comprises at least three amino acid sequences that are chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1 sequences described herein, the CDR2 sequences described herein and the CDR3 sequences described herein, such that the first amino acid sequence is chosen from the CDR1 sequences described herein, the second amino acid sequence is chosen from the CDR2 sequences described herein, and the third amino acid sequence is chosen from the CDR3 sequences described herein. Preferred combinations of CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences will become clear from the further description herein. As will be clear to the skilled person, such an amino acid sequence is preferably an immunoglobulin sequence (as further described herein), but it may for example also be any other amino acid sequence that comprises a suitable scaffold for presenting said CDR sequences.</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0234">In one preferred, but non-limiting aspect, the invention relates to an amino acid sequence that essentially consists of 4 framework regions (FR1 to FR4, respectively) and 3 complementarity determining regions (CDR1 to CDR3, respectively), in which the CDR sequences of said amino acid sequence have at least 70% amino acid identity, preferably at least 80% amino acid identity, more preferably at least 90% amino acid identity, such as 95% amino acid identity or more or even essentially 100% amino acid identity with the CDR sequences of at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 560-621. This degree of amino acid identity can for example be determined by determining the degree of amino acid identity (in a manner described herein) between said amino acid sequence and one or more of the sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 560-621, in which the amino acid residues that form the framework regions are disregarded. Such amino acid sequences of the invention can be as further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0235">In such an amino acid sequence of the invention, the framework sequences may be any suitable framework sequences, and examples of suitable framework sequences will be clear to the skilled person, for example on the basis the standard handbooks and the further disclosure and prior art mentioned herein.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0236">The framework sequences are preferably (a suitable combination of) immunoglobulin framework sequences or framework sequences that have been derived from immunoglobulin framework sequences (for example, by humanization or camelization). For example, the framework sequences may be framework sequences derived from a light chain variable domain (e.g. a V<sub>L</sub>-sequence) and/or from a heavy chain variable domain (e.g. a V<sub>H</sub>-sequence). In one particularly preferred aspect, the framework sequences are either framework sequences that have been derived from a V<sub>HH</sub>-sequence (in which said framework sequences may optionally have been partially or fully humanized) or are conventional V<sub>H </sub>sequences that have been camelized (as defined herein).</p>

<p id="p-0165" num="0239">Again, as generally described herein for the amino acid sequences of the invention, it is also possible to use suitable fragments (or combinations of fragments) of any of the foregoing, such as fragments that contain one or more CDR sequences, suitably flanked by and/or linked via one or more framework sequences (for example, in the same order as these CDR's and framework sequences may occur in the full-sized immunoglobulin sequence from which the fragment has been derived). Such fragments may also again be such that they comprise or can form an immunoglobulin fold, or alternatively be such that they do not comprise or cannot form an immunoglobulin fold.</p>

For example, a CDR3 sequence may be preceded by (part of) a FR3 sequence and followed by (part of) a FR4 sequence). Such a fragment may also contain a disulphide bridge, and in particular a disulphide bridge that links the two framework regions that precede and follow the CDR sequence, respectively (for the purpose of forming such a disulphide bridge, cysteine residues that naturally occur in said framework regions may be used, or alternatively cysteine residues may be synthetically added to or introduced into said framework regions).

Polypeptides of the invention can also be prepared by a method which generally comprises at least the steps of providing a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide of the invention, expressing said nucleic acid in a suitable manner, and recovering the expressed polypeptide of the invention.

Examples of ways in which an amino acid sequence of the invention can be formatted and examples of such formats will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein; and such formatted amino acid sequences form a further aspect of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0175" num="0249">Generally, the compounds or polypeptides of the invention with increased half-life preferably have a half-life that is at least 1.5 times, preferably at least 2 times, such as at least 5 times, for example at least 10 times or more than 20 times, greater than the half-life of the corresponding amino acid sequence of the invention per se. For example, the compounds or polypeptides of the invention with increased half-life may have a half-life that is increased with more than 1 hours, preferably more than 2 hours, more preferably more than 6 hours, such as more than 12 hours, or even more than 24, 48 or 72 hours, compared to the corresponding amino acid sequence of the invention per se.</p>

<p id="p-0182" num="0256">The invention also relates to methods for modulating RANK-L, either in vitro (e.g. in an in vitro or cellular assay) or in vivo (e.g. in an a single cell or multicellular organism, and in particular in a mammal, and more in particular in a human being, such as in a human being that is at risk of or suffers from a bone disease or disorder), which method comprises at least the step of contacting RANK-L with at least one amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention, or with a composition comprising the same, in a manner and in an amount suitable to modulate RANK-L, with at least one amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0257">The invention also relates to the use of an one amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a composition (such as, without limitation, a pharmaceutical composition or preparation as further described herein) for modulating RANK-L, either in vitro (e.g. in an in vitro or cellular assay) or in vivo (e.g. in an a single cell or multicellular organism, and in particular in a mammal, and more in particular in a human being, such as in a human being that is at risk of or suffers from a bone disease or disorder).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0258">In the context of the present invention, &#x201c;modulating&#x201d; or &#x201c;to modulate&#x201d; generally means either reducing or inhibiting the activity of, or alternatively increasing the activity of, RANK-L, as measured using a suitable in vitro, cellular or in vivo assay (such as those mentioned herein). In particular, &#x201c;modulating&#x201d; or &#x201c;to modulate&#x201d; may mean either reducing or inhibiting the activity of, or alternatively increasing the activity of RANK-L, as measured using a suitable in vitro, cellular or in vivo assay (such as those mentioned herein), by at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, such as at least 10% or at least 25%, for example by at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or 90% or more, compared to activity of RANK-L in the same assay under the same conditions but without the presence of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0259">As will be clear to the skilled person, &#x201c;modulating&#x201d; may also involve effecting a change (which may either be an increase or a decrease) in affinity, avidity, specificity and/or selectivity of RANK-L for one or more of its targets, ligands or substrates; and/or effecting a change (which may either be an increase or a decrease) in the sensitivity of RANK-L for one or more conditions in the medium or surroundings in which RANK-L is present (such as pH, ion strength, the presence of co-factors, etc.), compared to the same conditions but without the presence of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention. As will be clear to the skilled person, this may again be determined in any suitable manner and/or using any suitable assay known per se, such as the assays described herein or in the prior art cited herein.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0260">&#x201c;Modulating&#x201d; may also mean effecting a change (i.e. an activity as an agonist or as an antagonist, respectively) with respect to one or more biological or physiological mechanisms, effects, responses, functions, pathways or activities in which RANK-L (or in which its substrate(s), ligand(s) or pathway(s) are involved, such as its signalling pathway or metabolic pathway and their associated biological or physiological effects) is involved. Again, as will be clear to the skilled person, such an action as an agonist or an antagonist may be determined in any suitable manner and/or using any suitable (in vitro and usually cellular or in assay) assay known per se, such as the assays described herein or in the prior art cited herein. In particular, an action as an agonist or antagonist may be such that an intended biological or physiological activity is increased or decreased, respectively, by at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, such as at least 10% or at least 25%, for example by at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or 90% or more, compared to the biological or physiological activity in the same assay under the same conditions but without the presence of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0261">Modulating may for example involve reducing or inhibiting the binding of RANK-L to one of its substrates or ligands and/or competing with a natural ligand, substrate for binding to RANK-L. Modulating may also involve activating RANK-L or the mechanism or pathway in which it is involved. Modulating may be reversible or irreversible, but for pharmaceutical and pharmacological purposes will usually be in a reversible manner.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0262">The invention further relates to methods for preparing or generating the amino acid sequences, polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells, products and compositions described herein. Some preferred but non-limiting examples of such methods will become clear from the further description herein.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0263">Generally, these methods may comprise the steps of:
<ul id="ul0027" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0027-0001" num="0264">a) providing a set, collection or library of amino acid sequences; and</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0267">In such a method, the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences may be any suitable set, collection or library of amino acid sequences. For example, the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences may be a set, collection or library of immunoglobulin sequences (as described herein), such as a na&#xef;ve set, collection or library of immunoglobulin sequences; a synthetic or semi-synthetic set, collection or library of immunoglobulin sequences; and/or a set, collection or library of immunoglobulin sequences that have been subjected to affinity maturation.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0268">Also, in such a method, the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences may be a set, collection or library of heavy chain variable domains (such as V<sub>H </sub>domains or V<sub>HH </sub>domains) or of light chain variable domains. For example, the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences may be a set, collection or library of domain antibodies or single domain antibodies, or may be a set, collection or library of amino acid sequences that are capable of functioning as a domain antibody or single domain antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0269">In a preferred aspect of this method, the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences may be an immune set, collection or library of immunoglobulin sequences, for example derived from a mammal that has been suitably immunized with RANK-L or with a suitable antigenic determinant based thereon or derived therefrom, such as an antigenic part, fragment, region, domain, loop or other epitope thereof. In one particular aspect, said antigenic determinant may be an extracellular part, region, domain, loop or other extracellular epitope(s).</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0270">In the above methods, the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences may be displayed on a phage, phagemid, ribosome or suitable micro-organism (such as yeast), such as to facilitate screening. Suitable methods, techniques and host organisms for displaying and screening (a set, collection or library of) amino acid sequences will be clear to the person skilled in the art, for example on the basis of the further disclosure herein. Reference is also made to the review by Hoogenboom in Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1105-1116 (2005).</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0271">In another aspect, the method for generating amino acid sequences comprises at least the steps of:

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0275">For example, when the desired amino acid sequence is an immunoglobulin sequence, the collection or sample of cells may for example be a collection or sample of B-cells. Also, in this method, the sample of cells may be derived from a mammal that has been suitably immunized with RANK-L or with a suitable antigenic determinant based thereon or derived therefrom, such as an antigenic part, fragment, region, domain, loop or other epitope thereof. In one particular aspect, said antigenic determinant may be an extracellular part, region, domain, loop or other extracellular epitope(s).</p>

    <li id="ul0032-0003" num="0315">g) Amino acid sequences and nucleic acid sequences are said to be &#x201c;exactly the same&#x201d; if they have 100% sequence identity (as defined herein) over their entire length;</li>
    <li id="ul0032-0004" num="0316">h) When comparing two amino acid sequences, the term &#x201c;amino acid difference&#x201d; refers to an insertion, deletion or substitution of a single amino acid residue on a position of the first sequence, compared to the second sequence; it being understood that two amino acid sequences can contain one, two or more such amino acid differences;</li>
    <li id="ul0032-0005" num="0317">i) When a nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence is said to &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; another nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively, or to &#x201c;essentially consist of&#x201d; another nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, this may mean that the latter nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence has been incorporated into the first mentioned nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively, but more usually this generally means that the first mentioned nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence comprises within its sequence a stretch of nucleotides or amino acid residues, respectively, that has the same nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively, as the latter sequence, irrespective of how the first mentioned sequence has actually been generated or obtained (which may for example be by any suitable method described herein). By means of a non-limiting example, when a Nanobody of the invention is said to comprise a CDR sequence, this may mean that said CDR sequence has been incorporated into the Nanobody of the invention, but more usually this generally means that the Nanobody of the invention contains within its sequence a stretch of amino acid residues with the same amino acid sequence as said CDR sequence, irrespective of how said Nanobody of the invention has been generated or obtained. It should also be noted that when the latter amino acid sequence has a specific biological or structural function, it preferably has essentially the same, a similar or an equivalent biological or structural function in the first mentioned amino acid sequence (in other words, the first mentioned amino acid sequence is preferably such that the latter sequence is capable of performing essentially the same, a similar or an equivalent biological or structural function). For example, when a Nanobody of the invention is said to comprise a CDR sequence or framework sequence, respectively, the CDR sequence and framework are preferably capable, in said Nanobody, of functioning as a CDR sequence or framework sequence, respectively. Also, when a nucleotide sequence is said to comprise another nucleotide sequence, the first mentioned nucleotide sequence is preferably such that, when it is expressed into an expression product (e.g. a polypeptide), the amino acid sequence encoded by the latter nucleotide sequence forms part of said expression product (in other words, that the latter nucleotide sequence is in the same reading frame as the first mentioned, larger nucleotide sequence).</li>
    <li id="ul0032-0006" num="0318">j) A nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence is considered to be &#x201c;(in) essentially isolated (form)&#x201d;&#x2014;for example, compared to its native biological source and/or the reaction medium or cultivation medium from which it has been obtained&#x2014;when it has been separated from at least one other component with which it is usually associated in said source or medium, such as another nucleic acid, another protein/polypeptide, another biological component or macromolecule or at least one contaminant, impurity or minor component. In particular, a nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence is considered &#x201c;essentially isolated&#x201d; when it has been purified at least 2-fold, in particular at least 10-fold, more in particular at least 100-fold, and up to 1000-fold or more. A nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence that is &#x201c;in essentially isolated form&#x201d; is preferably essentially homogeneous, as determined using a suitable technique, such as a suitable chromatographical technique, such as polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis;</li>
    <li id="ul0032-0007" num="0319">k) The term &#x201c;domain&#x201d; as used herein generally refers to a globular region of an amino acid sequence (such as an antibody chain, and in particular to a globular region of a heavy chain antibody), or to a polypeptide that essentially consists of such a globular region. Usually, such a domain will comprise peptide loops (for example 3 or 4 peptide loops) stabilized, for example, as a sheet or by disulfide bonds. The term &#x201c;binding domain&#x201d; refers to such a domain that is directed against an antigenic determinant (as defined herein);</li>
    <li id="ul0032-0008" num="0320">l) The term &#x201c;antigenic determinant&#x201d; refers to the epitope on the antigen recognized by the antigen-binding molecule (such as a Nanobody or a polypeptide of the invention) and more in particular by the antigen-binding site of said molecule. The terms &#x201c;antigenic determinant&#x201d; and &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; may also be used interchangeably herein.</li>
    <li id="ul0032-0009" num="0321">m) An amino acid sequence (such as a Nanobody, an antibody, a polypeptide of the invention, or generally an antigen binding protein or polypeptide or a fragment thereof) that can (specifically) bind to, that has affinity for and/or that has specificity for a specific antigenic determinant, epitope, antigen or protein (or for at least one part, fragment or epitope thereof) is said to be &#x201c;against&#x201d; or &#x201c;directed against&#x201d; said antigenic determinant, epitope, antigen or protein.</li>
    <li id="ul0032-0010" num="0322">n) The term &#x201c;specificity&#x201d; refers to the number of different types of antigens or antigenic determinants to which a particular antigen-binding molecule or antigen-binding protein (such as a Nanobody or a polypeptide of the invention) molecule can bind. The specificity of an antigen-binding protein can be determined based on affinity and/or avidity. The affinity, represented by the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an antigen with an antigen-binding protein (K<sub>D</sub>), is a measure for the binding strength between an antigenic determinant and an antigen-binding site on the antigen-binding protein: the lesser the value of the K<sub>D</sub>, the stronger the binding strength between an antigenic determinant and the antigen-binding molecule (alternatively, the affinity can also be expressed as the affinity constant (K<sub>A</sub>), which is 1/K<sub>D</sub>). As will be clear to the skilled person (for example on the basis of the further disclosure herein), affinity can be determined in a manner known per se, depending on the specific antigen of interest. Avidity is the measure of the strength of binding between an antigen-binding molecule (such as a Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention) and the pertinent antigen. Avidity is related to both the affinity between an antigenic determinant and its antigen binding site on the antigen-binding molecule and the number of pertinent binding sites present on the antigen-binding molecule. Typically, antigen-binding proteins (such as the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention) will bind to their antigen with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>moles/liter or less, and preferably 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>moles/liter or less and more preferably 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>moles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K<sub>A</sub>) of 10<sup>5 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>liter/moles or more, and preferably 10<sup>7 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>liter/moles or more and more preferably 10<sup>8 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>liter/moles). Any K<sub>D </sub>value greater than 10<sup>4 </sup>mol/liter (or any K<sub>A </sub>value lower than 10<sup>4 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) liters/mol is generally considered to indicate non-specific binding. Preferably, a monovalent immunoglobulin sequence of the invention will bind to the desired antigen with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM. Specific binding of an antigen-binding protein to an antigen or antigenic determinant can be determined in any suitable manner known per se, including, for example, Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays, such as radioimmunoassays (RIA), enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and sandwich competition assays, and the different variants thereof known per se in the art; as well as the other techniques mentioned herein.

        <li id="ul0035-0001" num="0323">The dissociation constant may be the actual or apparent dissociation constant, as will be clear to the skilled person. Methods for determining the dissociation constant will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the techniques mentioned herein. In this respect, it will also be clear that it may not be possible to measure dissociation constants of more then 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>moles/liter or 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>moles/liter (e,g, of 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>moles/liter). Optionally, as will also be clear to the skilled person, the (actual or apparent) dissociation constant may be calculated on the basis of the (actual or apparent) association constant (K<sub>A</sub>), by means of the relationship [K<sub>D</sub>=1/K<sub>A</sub>].</li>
        <li id="ul0035-0002" num="0324">The affinity denotes the strength or stability of a molecular interaction. The affinity is commonly given as by the K<sub>D</sub>, or dissociation constant, which has units of mol/liter (or M). The affinity can also be expressed as an association constant, K<sub>A</sub>, which equals 1/K<sub>D </sub>and has units of (mol/liter)<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(or M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). In the present specification, the stability of the interaction between two molecules (such as an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention and its intended target) will mainly be expressed in terms of the K<sub>D </sub>value of their interaction; it being clear to the skilled person that in view of the relation K<sub>A</sub>=1/K<sub>D</sub>, specifying the strength of molecular interaction by its K<sub>D </sub>value can also be used to calculate the corresponding K<sub>A </sub>value. The K<sub>D</sub>-value characterizes the strength of a molecular interaction also in a thermodynamic sense as it is related to the free energy (DG) of binding by the well known relation DG=RT&#xb7;ln(K<sub>D</sub>) (equivalently DG=&#x2212;RT&#xb7;ln(K<sub>A</sub>)), where R equals the gas constant, T equals the absolute temperature and In denotes the natural logarithm.</li>
        <li id="ul0035-0003" num="0325">The K<sub>D </sub>for biological interactions which are considered meaningful (e.g. specific) are typically in the range of 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M (0.1 nM) to 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>M (10000 nM). The stronger an interaction is, the lower is its K<sub>D</sub>.</li>
        <li id="ul0035-0004" num="0326">The K<sub>D </sub>can also be expressed as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant of a complex, denoted as k<sub>off</sub>, to the rate of its association, denoted k<sub>on </sub>(so that K<sub>D</sub>=k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on </sub>and K<sub>A</sub>=k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>off</sub>). The off-rate k<sub>off </sub>has units s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(where s is the SI unit notation of second). The on-rate k<sub>on </sub>has units M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The on-rate may vary between 10<sup>2 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to about 10<sup>7 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, approaching the diffusion-limited association rate constant for bimolecular interactions. The off-rate is related to the half-life of a given molecular interaction by the relation t<sub>1/2</sub>=ln(2)/k<sub>off</sub>. The off-rate may vary between 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(near irreversible complex with a t<sub>1/2 </sub>of multiple days) to 1 s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(t<sub>1/2</sub>=0.69 s).</li>
        <li id="ul0035-0005" num="0327">The affinity of a molecular interaction between two molecules can be measured via different techniques known per se, such as the well known surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technique (see for example Ober et al., Intern. Immunology, 13, 1551-1559, 2001) where one molecule is immobilized on the biosensor chip and the other molecule is passed over the immobilized molecule under flow conditions yielding k<sub>on</sub>, k<sub>off </sub>measurements and hence K<sub>D </sub>(or K<sub>A</sub>) values. This can for example be performed using the well-known BIACORE instruments.</li>
        <li id="ul0035-0006" num="0328">It will also be clear to the skilled person that the measured K<sub>D </sub>may correspond to the apparent K<sub>D </sub>if the measuring process somehow influences the intrinsic binding affinity of the implied molecules for example by artifacts related to the coating on the biosensor of one molecule. Also, an apparent K<sub>D </sub>may be measured if one molecule contains more than one recognition sites for the other molecule. In such situation the measured affinity may be affected by the avidity of the interaction by the two molecules.</li>
        <li id="ul0035-0007" num="0329">Another approach that may be used to assess affinity is the 2-step ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) procedure of Friguet et al. (J. Immunol. Methods, 77, 305-19, 1985). This method establishes a solution phase binding equilibrium measurement and avoids possible artefacts relating to adsorption of one of the molecules on a support such as plastic.</li>
        <li id="ul0035-0008" num="0330">However, the accurate measurement of K<sub>D </sub>may be quite labor-intensive and as consequence, often apparent K<sub>D </sub>values are determined to assess the binding strength of two molecules. It should be noted that as long all measurements are made in a consistent way (e.g. keeping the assay conditions unchanged) apparent K<sub>D </sub>measurements can be used as an approximation of the true K<sub>D </sub>and hence in the present document K<sub>D </sub>and apparent K<sub>D </sub>should be treated with equal importance or relevance. Finally, it should be noted that in many situations the experienced scientist may judge it to be convenient to determine the binding affinity relative to some reference molecule. For example, to assess the binding strength between molecules A and B, one may e.g. use a reference molecule C that is known to bind to B and that is suitably labelled with a fluorophore or chromophore group or other chemical moiety, such as biotin for easy detection in an ELISA or FACS (Fluorescent activated cell sorting) or other format (the fluorophore for fluorescence detection, the chromophore for light absorption detection, the biotin for streptavidin-mediated ELISA detection). Typically, the reference molecule C is kept at a fixed concentration and the concentration of A is varied for a given concentration or amount of B. As a result an IC<sub>50 </sub>value is obtained corresponding to the concentration of A at which the signal measured for C in absence of A is halved. Provided K<sub>D ref</sub>, the K<sub>D </sub>of the reference molecule, is known, as well as the total concentration c<sub>ref </sub>of the reference molecule, the apparent K<sub>D </sub>for the interaction A-B can be obtained from following formula: K<sub>D</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+c<sub>ref</sub>/K<sub>D ref</sub>). Note that if c<sub>ref</sub>&#x3c;&#x3c;K<sub>D ref</sub>, K<sub>D</sub>&#x2248;IC<sub>50</sub>. Provided the measurement of the IC<sub>50 </sub>is performed in a consistent way (e.g. keeping c<sub>ref </sub>fixed) for the binders that are compared, the strength or stability of a molecular interaction can be assessed by the IC<sub>50 </sub>and this measurement is judged as equivalent to K<sub>D </sub>or to apparent K<sub>D </sub>throughout this text.</li>

The in vivo half-life of an amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention can be determined in any manner known per se, such as by pharmacokinetic analysis. Suitable techniques will be clear to the person skilled in the art, and may for example generally involve the steps of suitably administering to a warm-blooded animal (i.e. to a human or to another suitable mammal, such as a mouse, rabbit, rat, pig, dog or a primate, for example monkeys from the genus <i>Macaca </i>(such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) and/or rhesus monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>)) and baboon (<i>Papio ursinus</i>)) a suitable dose of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention; collecting blood samples or other samples from said animal; determining the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention in said blood sample; and calculating, from (a plot of) the data thus obtained, the time until the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention has been reduced by 50% compared to the initial level upon dosing.

In particular, &#x201c;modulating&#x201d; or &#x201c;to modulate&#x201d; may mean either reducing or inhibiting the activity of, or alternatively increasing a (relevant or intended) biological activity of, a target or antigen, as measured using a suitable in vitro, cellular or in vivo assay (which will usually depend on the target or antigen involved), by at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, such as at least 10% or at least 25%, for example by at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or 90% or more, compared to activity of the target or antigen in the same assay under the same conditions but without the presence of the construct of the invention.

Again, as will be clear to the skilled person, such an action as an agonist or an antagonist may be determined in any suitable manner and/or using any suitable (in vitro and usually cellular or in assay) assay known per se, depending on the target or antigen involved.

Modulating may for example also involve effecting a change in respect of the folding or confirmation of the target or antigen, or in respect of the ability of the target or antigen to fold, to change its confirmation (for example, upon binding of a ligand), to associate with other (sub)units, or to disassociate. Modulating may for example also involve effecting a change in the ability of the target or antigen to transport other compounds or to serve as a channel for other compounds (such as ions).</li>

More generally, an &#x201c;interaction site&#x201d; can be any site, epitope, antigenic determinant, part, domain or stretch of amino acid residues on the target or antigen to which an amino acid sequence or polypeptide of the invention can bind such that the target or antigen (and/or any pathway, interaction, signalling, biological mechanism or biological effect in which the target or antigen is involved) is modulated (as defined herein).</li>

The extend to which an amino acid sequence or other binding agent of the invention is able to interfere with the binding of another to RANK-L, and therefore whether it can be said to cross-block according to the invention, can be determined using competition binding assays. One particularly suitable quantitative cross-blocking assay uses a Biacore machine which can measure the extent of interactions using surface plasmon resonance technology. Another suitable quantitative cross-blocking assay uses an ELISA-based approach to measure competition between amino acid sequences or other binding agents in terms of their binding to the target.
    <ul id="ul0038" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0038-0001" num="0341">The following generally describes a suitable Biacore assay for determining whether an amino acid sequence or other binding agent cross-blocks or is capable of cross-blocking according to the invention. It will be appreciated that the assay can be used with any of the amino acid sequence or other binding agents described herein. The Biacore machine (for example the Biacore 3000) is operated in line with the manufacturer's recommendations. Thus in one cross-blocking assay, the target protein is coupled to a CM5 Biacore chip using standard amine coupling chemistry to generate a surface that is coated with the target. Typically 200-800 resonance units of the target would be coupled to the chip (an amount that gives easily measurable levels of binding but that is readily saturable by the concentrations of test reagent being used). Two test amino acid sequences (termed A* and B*) to be assessed for their ability to cross-block each other are mixed at a one to one molar ratio of binding sites in a suitable buffer to create the test mixture. When calculating the concentrations on a binding site basis the molecular weight of an amino acid sequence is assumed to be the total molecular weight of the amino acid sequence divided by the number of target binding sites on that amino acid sequence. The concentration of each amino acid sequence in the test mix should be high enough to readily saturate the binding sites for that amino acid sequence on the target molecules captured on the Biacore chip. The amino acid sequences in the mixture are at the same molar concentration (on a binding basis) and that concentration would typically be between 1.00 and 1.5 micromolar (on a binding site basis). Separate solutions containing A* alone and B* alone are also prepared. A* and B* in these solutions should be in the same buffer and at the same concentration as in the test mix. The test mixture is passed over the target-coated Biacore chip and the total amount of binding recorded. The chip is then treated in such a way as to remove the bound amino acid sequences without damaging the chip-bound target. Typically this is done by treating the chip with 30 mM HCl for 60 seconds. The solution of A* alone is then passed over the target-coated surface and the amount of binding recorded. The chip is again treated to remove all of the bound amino acid sequences without damaging the chip-bound target. The solution of B* alone is then passed over the target-coated surface and the amount of binding recorded. The maximum theoretical binding of the mixture of A* and B* is next calculated, and is the sum of the binding of each amino acid sequence when passed over the target surface alone. If the actual recorded binding of the mixture is less than this theoretical maximum then the two amino acid sequences are cross-blocking each other. Thus, in general, a cross-blocking amino acid sequence or other binding agent according to the invention is one which will bind to the target in the above Biacore cross-blocking assay such that during the assay and in the presence of a second amino acid sequence or other binding agent of the invention the recorded binding is between 80% and 0.1% (e.g. 80% to 4%) of the maximum theoretical binding, specifically between 75% and 0.1% (e.g. 75% to 4%) of the maximum theoretical binding, and more specifically between 70% and 0.1% (e.g. 70% to 4%) of maximum theoretical binding (as just defined above) of the two amino acid sequences or binding agents in combination. The Biacore assay described above is a primary assay used to determine if amino acid sequences or other binding agents cross-block each other according to the invention. On rare occasions particular amino acid sequences or other binding agents may not bind to target coupled via amine chemistry to a CM5 Biacore chip (this usually occurs when the relevant binding site on target is masked or destroyed by the coupling to the chip). In such cases cross-blocking can be determined using a tagged version of the target, for example a N-terminal His-tagged version. In this particular format, an anti-His amino acid sequence would be coupled to the Biacore chip and then the His-tagged target would be passed over the surface of the chip and captured by the anti-His amino acid sequence. The cross blocking analysis would be carried out essentially as described above, except that after each chip regeneration cycle, new His-tagged target would be loaded back onto the anti-His amino acid sequence coated surface. In addition to the example given using N-terminal His-tagged target, C-terminal His-tagged target could alternatively be used. Furthermore, various other tags and tag binding protein combinations that are known in the art could be used for such a cross-blocking analysis (e.g. HA tag with anti-HA antibodies; FLAG tag with anti-FLAG antibodies; biotin tag with streptavidin).</li>
        <li id="ul0038-0002" num="0342">The following generally describes an ELISA assay for determining whether an amino acid sequence or other binding agent directed against a target cross-blocks or is capable of cross-blocking as defined herein. It will be appreciated that the assay can be used with any of the amino acid sequences (or other binding agents such as polypeptides of the invention) described herein. The general principal of the assay is to have an amino acid sequence or binding agent that is directed against the target coated onto the wells of an ELISA plate. An excess amount of a second, potentially cross-blocking, anti-target amino acid sequence is added in solution (i.e. not bound to the ELISA plate). A limited amount of the target is then added to the wells. The coated amino acid sequence and the amino acid sequence in solution compete for binding of the limited number of target molecules. The plate is washed to remove excess target that has not been bound by the coated amino acid sequence and to also remove the second, solution phase amino acid sequence as well as any complexes formed between the second, solution phase amino acid sequence and target. The amount of bound target is then measured using a reagent that is appropriate to detect the target. An amino acid sequence in solution that is able to cross-block the coated amino acid sequence will be able to cause a decrease in the number of target molecules that the coated amino acid sequence can bind relative to the number of target molecules that the coated amino acid sequence can bind in the absence of the second, solution phase, amino acid sequence. In the instance where the first amino acid sequence, e.g. an Ab-X, is chosen to be the immobilized amino acid sequence, it is coated onto the wells of the ELISA plate, after which the plates are blocked with a suitable blocking solution to minimize non-specific binding of reagents that are subsequently added. An excess amount of the second amino acid sequence, i.e. Ab-Y, is then added to the ELISA plate such that the moles of Ab-Y target binding sites per well are at least 10 fold higher than the moles of Ab-X target binding sites that were used, per well, during the coating of the ELISA plate. Target is then added such that the moles of target added per well are at least 25-fold lower than the moles of Ab-X target binding sites that were used for coating each well. Following a suitable incubation period the ELISA plate is washed and a reagent for detecting the target is added to measure the amount of target specifically bound by the coated anti-target amino acid sequence (in this case Ab-X). The background signal for the assay is defined as the signal obtained in wells with the coated amino acid sequence (in this case Ab-X), second solution phase amino acid sequence (in this case Ab-Y), target buffer only (i.e. without target added) and target detection reagents. The positive control signal for the assay is defined as the signal obtained in wells with the coated amino acid sequence (in this case Ab-X), second solution phase amino acid sequence buffer only (i.e. without second solution phase amino acid sequence added), target and target detection reagents. The ELISA assay may be run in such a manner so as to have the positive control signal be at least 6 times the background signal. To avoid any artifacts (e.g. significantly different affinities between Ab-X and Ab-Y for the target) resulting from the choice of which amino acid sequence to use as the coating amino acid sequence and which to use as the second (competitor) amino acid sequence, the cross-blocking assay may to be run in two formats: 1) format 1 is where Ab-X is the amino acid sequence that is coated onto the ELISA plate and Ab-Y is the competitor amino acid sequence that is in solution and 2) format 2 is where Ab-Y is the amino acid sequence that is coated onto the ELISA plate and Ab-X is the competitor amino acid sequence that is in solution. Ab-X and Ab-Y are defined as cross-blocking if, either in format 1 or in format 2, the solution phase anti-target amino acid sequence is able to cause a reduction of between 60% and 100%, specifically between 70% and 100%, and more specifically between 80% and 100%, of the target detection signal (i.e. the amount of target bound by the coated amino acid sequence) as compared to the target detection signal obtained in the absence of the solution phase anti-target amino acid sequence (i.e. the positive control wells).</li>

<p id="p-0215" num="0350">In accordance with the terminology used in the art (see the above references), the variable domains present in naturally occurring heavy chain antibodies will also be referred to as &#x201c;V<sub>HH </sub>domains&#x201d;, in order to distinguish them from the heavy chain variable domains that are present in conventional 4-chain antibodies (which will be referred to hereinbelow as &#x201c;V<sub>H </sub>domains&#x201d;) and from the light chain variable domains that are present in conventional 4-chain antibodies (which will be referred to hereinbelow as &#x201c;V<sub>L </sub>domains&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0351">As mentioned in the prior art referred to above, V<sub>HH </sub>domains have a number of unique structural characteristics and functional properties which make isolated V<sub>HH </sub>domains (as well as Nanobodies based thereon, which share these structural characteristics and functional properties with the naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domains) and proteins containing the same highly advantageous for use as functional antigen-binding domains or proteins. In particular, and without being limited thereto, V<sub>HH </sub>domains (which have been &#x201c;designed&#x201d; by nature to functionally bind to an antigen without the presence of, and without any interaction with, a light chain variable domain) and Nanobodies can function as a single, relatively small, functional antigen-binding structural unit, domain or protein. This distinguishes the V<sub>HH </sub>domains from the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains of conventional 4-chain antibodies, which by themselves are generally not suited for practical application as single antigen-binding proteins or domains, but need to be combined in some form or another to provide a functional antigen-binding unit (as in for example conventional antibody fragments such as Fab fragments; in ScFv's fragments, which consist of a V<sub>H </sub>domain covalently linked to a V<sub>L </sub>domain).</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0352">Because of these unique properties, the use of V<sub>HH </sub>domains and Nanobodies as single antigen-binding proteins or as antigen binding domains (i.e. as part of a larger protein or polypeptide) offers a number of significant advantages over the use of conventional V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains, scFv's or conventional antibody fragments (such as Fab- or F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>-fragments):

        <li id="ul0041-0002" num="0354">V<sub>HH </sub>domains and Nanobodies can be expressed from a single gene and require no post-translational folding or modifications;</li>
        <li id="ul0041-0003" num="0355">V<sub>HH </sub>domains and Nanobodies can easily be engineered into multivalent and multispecific formats (as further discussed herein);</li>
        <li id="ul0041-0004" num="0356">V<sub>HH </sub>domains and Nanobodies are highly soluble and do not have a tendency to aggregate (as with the mouse-derived &#x201c;dAb's&#x201d; described by Ward et al., Nature, Vol. 341, 1989, p. 544);</li>
        <li id="ul0041-0005" num="0357">V<sub>HH </sub>domains and Nanobodies are highly stable to heat, pH, proteases and other denaturing agents or conditions (see for example Ewert et al, supra);</li>
        <li id="ul0041-0006" num="0358">V<sub>HH </sub>domains and Nanobodies are easy and relatively cheap to prepare, even on a scale required for production. For example, V<sub>HH </sub>domains, Nanobodies and proteins/polypeptides containing the same can be produced using microbial fermentation (e.g. as further described below) and do not require the use of mammalian expression systems, as with for example conventional antibody fragments;</li>
        <li id="ul0041-0007" num="0359">V<sub>HH </sub>domains and Nanobodies are relatively small (approximately 15 kDa, or 10 times smaller than a conventional IgG) compared to conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, and therefore show high(er) penetration into tissues (including but not limited to solid tumors and other dense tissues) than such conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof;</li>
        <li id="ul0041-0008" num="0360">V<sub>HH </sub>domains and Nanobodies can show so-called cavity-binding properties (inter alia due to their extended CDR3 loop, compared to conventional V<sub>H </sub>domains) and can therefore also access targets and epitopes not accessible to conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof. For example, it has been shown that V<sub>HH </sub>domains and Nanobodies can inhibit enzymes (see for example WO 97/49805; Transue et al., Proteins 1998 Sep. 1; 32(4): 515-22; Lauwereys et al., EMBO J. 1998 Jul. 1; 17(13): 3512-20).</li>

<p id="p-0294" num="0482">Generally, it should be noted that the term Nanobody as used herein in its broadest sense is not limited to a specific biological source or to a specific method of preparation. For example, as will be discussed in more detail below, the Nanobodies of the invention can generally be obtained: (1) by isolating the V<sub>HH </sub>domain of a naturally occurring heavy chain antibody; (2) by expression of a nucleotide sequence encoding a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain; (3) by &#x201c;humanization&#x201d; (as described herein) of a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding a such humanized V<sub>HH </sub>domain; (4) by &#x201c;camelization&#x201d; (as described herein) of a naturally occurring V<sub>H </sub>domain from any animal species, and in particular a from species of mammal, such as from a human being, or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding such a camelized V<sub>H </sub>domain; (5) by &#x201c;camelisation&#x201d; of a &#x201c;domain antibody&#x201d; or &#x201c;Dab&#x201d; as described by Ward et al (supra), or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding such a camelized V<sub>H </sub>domain; (6) by using synthetic or semi-synthetic techniques for preparing proteins, polypeptides or other amino acid sequences known per se; (7) by preparing a nucleic acid encoding a Nanobody using techniques for nucleic acid synthesis known per se, followed by expression of the nucleic acid thus obtained; and/or (8) by any combination of one or more of the foregoing. Suitable methods and techniques for performing the foregoing will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein and for example include the methods and techniques described in more detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0483">One preferred class of Nanobodies corresponds to the V<sub>HH </sub>domains of naturally occurring heavy chain antibodies directed against RANK-L. As further described herein, such V<sub>HH </sub>sequences can generally be generated or obtained by suitably immunizing a species of Camelid with RANK-L (i.e. so as to raise an immune response and/or heavy chain antibodies directed against RANK-L), by obtaining a suitable biological sample from said Camelid (such as a blood sample, serum sample or sample of B-cells), and by generating V<sub>HH </sub>sequences directed against RANK-L, starting from said sample, using any suitable technique known per se. Such techniques will be clear to the skilled person and/or are further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0484">Alternatively, such naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domains against RANK-L, can be obtained from na&#xef;ve libraries of Camelid V<sub>HH </sub>sequences, for example by screening such a library using RANK-L, or at least one part, fragment, antigenic determinant or epitope thereof using one or more screening techniques known per se. Such libraries and techniques are for example described in WO 99/37681, WO 01/90190, WO 03/025020 and WO 03/035694. Alternatively, improved synthetic or semi-synthetic libraries derived from na&#xef;ve V<sub>HH </sub>libraries may be used, such as V<sub>HH </sub>libraries obtained from na&#xef;ve V<sub>HH </sub>libraries by techniques such as random mutagenesis and/or CDR shuffling, as for example described in WO 00/43507.</p>

Reference is also made to WO 03/054016 and to the review by Hoogenboom in Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1105-1116 (2005).</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0505">As will be clear to the skilled person, the screening step of the methods described herein can also be performed as a selection step. Accordingly the term &#x201c;screening&#x201d; as used in the present description can comprise selection, screening or any suitable combination of selection and/or screening techniques. Also, when a set, collection or library of sequences is used, it may contain any suitable number of sequences, such as 1, 2, 3 or about 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>7</sup>, 10<sup>8 </sup>or more sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0506">Also, one or more or all of the sequences in the above set, collection or library of amino acid sequences may be obtained or defined by rational, or semi-empirical approaches such as computer modelling techniques or biostatics or datamining techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0507">Furthermore, such a set, collection or library can comprise one, two or more sequences that are variants from one another (e.g. with designed point mutations or with randomized positions), compromise multiple sequences derived from a diverse set of naturally diversified sequences (e.g. an immune library)), or any other source of diverse sequences (as described for example in Hoogenboom et al, Nat Biotechnol 23:1105, 2005 and Binz et al, Nat Biotechnol 2005, 23:1247). Such set, collection or library of sequences can be displayed on the surface of a phage particle, a ribosome, a bacterium, a yeast cell, a mammalian cell, and linked to the nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence within these carriers. This makes such set, collection or library amenable to selection procedures to isolate the desired amino acid sequences of the invention. More generally, when a sequence is displayed on a suitable host or host cell, it is also possible (and customary) to first isolate from said host or host cell a nucleotide sequence that encodes the desired sequence, and then to obtain the desired sequence by suitably expressing said nucleotide sequence in a suitable host organism. Again, this can be performed in any suitable manner known per se, as will be clear to the skilled person.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0508">Yet another technique for obtaining V<sub>HH </sub>sequences or Nanobody sequences directed against RANK-L involves suitably immunizing a transgenic mammal that is capable of expressing heavy chain antibodies (i.e. so as to raise an immune response and/or heavy chain antibodies directed against RANK-L), obtaining a suitable biological sample from said transgenic mammal that contains (nucleic acid sequences encoding) said V<sub>HH </sub>sequences or Nanobody sequences (such as a blood sample, serum sample or sample of B-cells), and then generating V<sub>HH </sub>sequences directed against RANK-L, starting from said sample, using any suitable technique known per se (such as any of the methods described herein or a hybridoma technique). For example, for this purpose, the heavy chain antibody-expressing mice and the further methods and techniques described in WO 02/085945, WO 04/049794 and WO 06/008548 and Janssens et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006 Oct. 10; 103(41):15130-5 can be used. For example, such heavy chain antibody expressing mice can express heavy chain antibodies with any suitable (single) variable domain, such as (single) variable domains from natural sources (e.g. human (single) variable domains, Camelid (single) variable domains or shark (single) variable domains), as well as for example synthetic or semi-synthetic (single) variable domains.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0509">The invention also relates to the V<sub>HH </sub>sequences or Nanobody sequences that are obtained by the above methods, or alternatively by a method that comprises the one of the above methods and in addition at least the steps of determining the nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence of said V<sub>HH </sub>sequence or Nanobody sequence; and of expressing or synthesizing said V<sub>HH </sub>sequence or Nanobody sequence in a manner known per se, such as by expression in a suitable host cell or host organism or by chemical synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0510">As mentioned herein, a particularly preferred class of Nanobodies of the invention comprises Nanobodies with an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain, but that has been &#x201c;humanized&#x201d;, i.e. by replacing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of said naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>sequence (and in particular in the framework sequences) by one or more of the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position(s) in a V<sub>H </sub>domain from a conventional 4-chain antibody from a human being (e.g. indicated above). This can be performed in a manner known per se, which will be clear to the skilled person, for example on the basis of the further description herein and the prior art on humanization referred to herein. Again, it should be noted that such humanized Nanobodies of the invention can be obtained in any suitable manner known per se (i.e. as indicated under points (1)-(8) above) and thus are not strictly limited to polypeptides that have been obtained using a polypeptide that comprises a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain as a starting material.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0511">Another particularly preferred class of Nanobodies of the invention comprises Nanobodies with an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V<sub>H </sub>domain, but that has been &#x201c;camelized&#x201d;, i.e. by replacing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V<sub>H </sub>domain from a conventional 4-chain antibody by one or more of the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position(s) in a V<sub>HH </sub>domain of a heavy chain antibody. This can be performed in a manner known per se, which will be clear to the skilled person, for example on the basis of the further description herein. Such &#x201c;camelizing&#x201d; substitutions are preferably inserted at amino acid positions that form and/or are present at the V<sub>H</sub>-V<sub>L </sub>interface, and/or at the so-called Camelidae hallmark residues, as defined herein (see for example WO 94/04678 and Davies and Riechmann (1994 and 1996), supra). Preferably, the V<sub>H </sub>sequence that is used as a starting material or starting point for generating or designing the camelized Nanobody is preferably a V<sub>H </sub>sequence from a mammal, more preferably the V<sub>H </sub>sequence of a human being, such as a V<sub>H</sub>3 sequence. However, it should be noted that such camelized Nanobodies of the invention can be obtained in any suitable manner known per se (i.e. as indicated under points (1)-(8) above) and thus are not strictly limited to polypeptides that have been obtained using a polypeptide that comprises a naturally occurring V<sub>H </sub>domain as a starting material.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0512">For example, again as further described herein, both &#x201c;humanization&#x201d; and &#x201c;camelization&#x201d; can be performed by providing a nucleotide sequence that encodes a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain or V<sub>H </sub>domain, respectively, and then changing, in a manner known per se, one or more codons in said nucleotide sequence in such a way that the new nucleotide sequence encodes a &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; or &#x201c;camelized&#x201d; Nanobody of the invention, respectively. This nucleic acid can then be expressed in a manner known per se, so as to provide the desired Nanobody of the invention. Alternatively, based on the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain or V<sub>H </sub>domain, respectively, the amino acid sequence of the desired humanized or camelized Nanobody of the invention, respectively, can be designed and then synthesized de novo using techniques for peptide synthesis known per se. Also, based on the amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain or V<sub>H </sub>domain, respectively, a nucleotide sequence encoding the desired humanized or camelized Nanobody of the invention, respectively, can be designed and then synthesized de novo using techniques for nucleic acid synthesis known per se, after which the nucleic acid thus obtained can be expressed in a manner known per se, so as to provide the desired Nanobody of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0513">Other suitable methods and techniques for obtaining the Nanobodies of the invention and/or nucleic acids encoding the same, starting from naturally occurring V<sub>H </sub>sequences or preferably V<sub>HH </sub>sequences, will be clear from the skilled person, and may for example comprise combining one or more parts of one or more naturally occurring V<sub>H </sub>sequences (such as one or more FR sequences and/or CDR sequences), one or more parts of one or more naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>sequences (such as one or more FR sequences or CDR sequences), and/or one or more synthetic or semi-synthetic sequences, in a suitable manner, so as to provide a Nanobody of the invention or a nucleotide sequence or nucleic acid encoding the same (which may then be suitably expressed). Nucleotide sequences encoding framework sequences of V<sub>HH </sub>sequences or Nanobodies will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein and/or the further prior art cited herein (and/or may alternatively be obtained by PCR starting from the nucleotide sequences obtained using the methods described herein) and may be suitably combined with nucleotide sequences that encode the desired CDR's (for example, by PCR assembly using overlapping primers), so as to provide a nucleic acid encoding a Nanobody of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0514">As mentioned herein, Nanobodies may in particular be characterized by the presence of one or more &#x201c;Hallmark residues&#x201d; (as described herein) in one or more of the framework sequences.</p>

<p id="p-0330" num="0587">In the Nanobodies of the invention in which the amino acid residues at positions 43-46 according to the Kabat numbering form the sequence KERE or KQRE, the amino acid residue at position 37 is most preferably F. In the Nanobodies of the invention in which the amino acid residues at positions 44-47 according to the Kabat numbering form the sequence GLEW, the amino acid residue at position 37 is chosen from the group consisting of Y, H, I, L, V or F, and is most preferably V.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0588">Thus, without being limited hereto in any way, on the basis of the amino acid residues present on the positions mentioned above, the Nanobodies of the invention can generally be classified on the basis of the following three groups:
<ul id="ul0081" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0081-0001" num="0589">i) The &#x201c;GLEW-group&#x201d;: Nanobodies with the amino acid sequence GLEW at positions 44-47 according to the Kabat numbering and Q at position 108 according to the Kabat numbering. As further described herein, Nanobodies within this group usually have a V at position 37, and can have a W, P, R or S at position 103, and preferably have a W at position 103. The GLEW group also comprises some GLEW-like sequences such as those mentioned in Table A-3 below. More generally, and without limitation, Nanobodies belonging to the GLEW-group can be defined as Nanobodies with a G at position 44 and/or with a W at position 47, in which position 46 is usually E and in which preferably position 45 is not a charged amino acid residue and not cysteine;</li>
    <li id="ul0081-0002" num="0590">ii) The &#x201c;KERE-group&#x201d;: Nanobodies with the amino acid sequence KERE or KQRE (or another KERE-like sequence) at positions 43-46 according to the Kabat numbering and Q or L at position 108 according to the Kabat numbering. As further described herein, Nanobodies within this group usually have a F at position 37, an L or F at position 47; and can have a W, P, R or S at position 103, and preferably have a W at position 103. More generally, and without limitation, Nanobodies belonging to the KERE-group can be defined as Nanobodies with a K, Q or R at position 44 (usually K) in which position 45 is a charged amino acid residue or cysteine, and position 47 is as further defined herein;</li>
    <li id="ul0081-0003" num="0591">iii) The &#x201c;103 P, R, S-group&#x201d;: Nanobodies with a P, R or S at position 103. These Nanobodies can have either the amino acid sequence GLEW at positions 44-47 according to the Kabat numbering or the amino acid sequence KERE or KQRE at positions 43-46 according to the Kabat numbering, the latter most preferably in combination with an F at position 37 and an L or an F at position 47 (as defined for the KERE-group); and can have Q or L at position 108 according to the Kabat numbering, and preferably have Q.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0592">Also, where appropriate, Nanobodies may belong to (i.e. have characteristics of) two or more of these classes. For example, one specifically preferred group of Nanobodies has GLEW or a GLEW-like sequence at positions 44-47; P, R or S (and in particular R) at position 103; and Q at position 108 (which may be humanized to L).</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0593">More generally, it should be noted that the definitions referred to above describe and apply to Nanobodies in the form of a native (i.e. non-humanized) V<sub>HH </sub>sequence, and that humanized variants of these Nanobodies may contain other amino acid residues than those indicated above (i.e. one or more humanizing substitutions as defined herein). For example, and without limitation, in some humanized Nanobodies of the GLEW-group or the 103 P, R, S-group, Q at position 108 may be humanized to 108L. As already mentioned herein, other humanizing substitutions (and suitable combinations thereof) will become clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. In addition, or alternatively, other potentially useful humanizing substitutions can be ascertained by comparing the sequence of the framework regions of a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>sequence with the corresponding framework sequence of one or more closely related human V<sub>H </sub>sequences, after which one or more of the potentially useful humanizing substitutions (or combinations thereof) thus determined can be introduced into said V<sub>HH </sub>sequence (in any manner known per se, as further described herein) and the resulting humanized V<sub>HH </sub>sequences can be tested for affinity for the target, for stability, for ease and level of expression, and/or for other desired properties. In this way, by means of a limited degree of trial and error, other suitable humanizing substitutions (or suitable combinations thereof) can be determined by the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. Also, based on the foregoing, (the framework regions of) a Nanobody may be partially humanized or fully humanized.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0594">Thus, in another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the GLEW-group (as defined herein), and in which CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined herein, and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred aspects herein, and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred aspects herein.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0595">In another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the KERE-group (as defined herein), and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined herein, and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred aspects herein, and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred aspects herein.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0596">Thus, in another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the 103 P, R, S-group (as defined herein), and in which CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined herein, and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred aspects herein, and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred aspects herein.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0597">Also, more generally and in addition to the 108Q, 43E/44R and 103 P,R,S residues mentioned above, the Nanobodies of the invention can contain, at one or more positions that in a conventional V<sub>H </sub>domain would form (part of) the V<sub>H</sub>/V<sub>L </sub>interface, one or more amino acid residues that are more highly charged than the amino acid residues that naturally occur at the same position(s) in the corresponding naturally occurring V<sub>H </sub>sequence, and in particular one or more charged amino acid residues (as mentioned in Table A-2). Such substitutions include, but are not limited to, the GLEW-like sequences mentioned in Table A-3 below; as well as the substitutions that are described in the International Application WO 00/29004 for so-called &#x201c;microbodies&#x201d;, e.g. so as to obtain a Nanobody with Q at position 108 in combination with KLEW at positions 44-47. Other possible substitutions at these positions will be clear to the skilled person based upon the disclosure herein.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0598">In one aspect of the Nanobodies of the invention, the amino acid residue at position 83 is chosen from the group consisting of L, M, S, V and W; and is preferably L.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0599">Also, in one aspect of the Nanobodies of the invention, the amino acid residue at position 83 is chosen from the group consisting of R, K, N, E, G, I, T and Q; and is most preferably either K or E (for Nanobodies corresponding to naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domains) or R (for &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; Nanobodies, as described herein). The amino acid residue at position 84 is chosen from the group consisting of P, A, R, S, D T, and V in one aspect, and is most preferably P (for Nanobodies corresponding to naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domains) or R (for &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; Nanobodies, as described herein).</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0600">Furthermore, in one aspect of the Nanobodies of the invention, the amino acid residue at position 104 is chosen from the group consisting of G and D; and is most preferably G.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0601">Collectively, the amino acid residues at positions 11, 37, 44, 45, 47, 83, 84, 103, 104 and 108, which in the Nanobodies are as mentioned above, will also be referred to herein as the &#x201c;Hallmark Residues&#x201d;. The Hallmark Residues and the amino acid residues at the corresponding positions of the most closely related human V<sub>H </sub>domain, V<sub>H</sub>3, are summarized in Table A-3.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0602">Some especially preferred but non-limiting combinations of these Hallmark Residues as occur in naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domains are mentioned in Table A-4. For comparison, the corresponding amino acid residues of the human V<sub>H</sub>3 called DP-47 have been indicated in italics.</p>

<p id="p-0345" num="0605">In the Nanobodies, each amino acid residue at any other position than the Hallmark Residues can be any amino acid residue that naturally occurs at the corresponding position (according to the Kabat numbering) of a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0606">Such amino acid residues will be clear to the skilled person. Tables A-5 to A-8 mention some non-limiting residues that can be present at each position (according to the Kabat numbering) of the FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4 of naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domains. For each position, the amino acid residue that most frequently occurs at each position of a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain (and which is the most preferred amino acid residue for said position in a Nanobody) is indicated in bold; and other preferred amino acid residues for each position have been underlined (note: the number of amino acid residues that are found at positions 26-30 of naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domains supports the hypothesis underlying the numbering by Chothia (supra) that the residues at these positions already form part of CDR1).</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0607">In Tables A-5-A-8, some of the non-limiting residues that can be present at each position of a human V<sub>H</sub>3 domain have also been mentioned. Again, for each position, the amino acid residue that most frequently occurs at each position of a naturally occurring human V<sub>H</sub>3 domain is indicated in bold; and other preferred amino acid residues have been underlined.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0608">For reference only, Tables A-5-A-8 also contain data on the V<sub>HH </sub>entropy (&#x201c;V<sub>HH</sub>Ent.&#x201d;) and V<sub>HH </sub>variability (&#x201c;V<sub>HH </sub>Var.&#x201d;) at each amino acid position for a representative sample of 1118 V<sub>HH </sub>sequences (data kindly provided by David Lutje Hulsing and Prof. Theo Verrips of Utrecht University). The values for the V<sub>HH </sub>entropy and the V<sub>HH </sub>variability provide a measure for the variability and degree of conservation of amino acid residues between the 1118 V<sub>HH </sub>sequences analyzed: low values (i.e. &#x3c;1, such as &#x3c;0.5) indicate that an amino acid residue is highly conserved between the V<sub>HH </sub>sequences (i.e. little variability). For example, the G at position 8 and the G at position 9 have values for the V<sub>HH </sub>entropy of 0.1 and 0 respectively, indicating that these residues are highly conserved and have little variability (and in case of position 9 is G in all 1118 sequences analysed), whereas for residues that form part of the CDR's generally values of 1.5 or more are found (data not shown). Note that (1) the amino acid residues listed in the second column of Tables A-5-A-8 are based on a bigger sample than the 1118 V<sub>HH </sub>sequences that were analysed for determining the V<sub>HH </sub>entropy and V<sub>HH </sub>variability referred to in the last two columns; and (2) the data represented below support the hypothesis that the amino acid residues at positions 27-30 and may be even also at positions 93 and 94 already form part of the CDR's (although the invention is not limited to any specific hypothesis or explanation, and as mentioned above, herein the numbering according to Kabat is used). For a general explanation of sequence entropy, sequence variability and the methodology for determining the same, see Oliveira et al., PROTEINS: Structure, Function and Genetics, 52: 544-552 (2003).</p>

<p id="p-0365" num="0639">With regard to framework 1, it will be clear to the skilled person that, when an amino acid sequence as outlined above is generated by expression of a nucleotide sequence, the first four amino acid sequences (i.e. amino acid residues 1-4 according to the Kabat numbering) may often be determined by the primer(s) that have been used to generate said nucleic acid. Thus, for determining the degree of amino acid identity, the first four amino acid residues are preferably disregarded.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0640">Also, with regard to framework 1, and although amino acid positions 27 to 30 are according to the Kabat numbering considered to be part of the framework regions (and not the CDR's), it has been found by analysis of a database of more than 1000 V<sub>HH </sub>sequences that the positions 27 to 30 have a variability (expressed in terms of V<sub>HH </sub>entropy and V<sub>HH </sub>variability&#x2014;see Tables A-5 to A-8) that is much greater than the variability on positions 1 to 26. Because of this, for determining the degree of amino acid identity, the amino acid residues at positions 27 to 30 are preferably also disregarded.</p>

<p id="p-0396" num="0702">According to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, a Nanobody may be as defined herein, but with the proviso that it has at least &#x201c;one amino acid difference&#x201d; (as defined herein) in at least one of the framework regions compared to the corresponding framework region of a naturally occurring human V<sub>H </sub>domain, and in particular compared to the corresponding framework region of DP-47. More specifically, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, a Nanobody may be as defined herein, but with the proviso that it has at least &#x201c;one amino acid difference&#x201d; (as defined herein) at least one of the Hallmark residues (including those at positions 108, 103 and/or 45) compared to the corresponding framework region of a naturally occurring human V<sub>H </sub>domain, and in particular compared to the corresponding framework region of DP-47. Usually, a Nanobody will have at least one such amino acid difference with a naturally occurring V<sub>H </sub>domain in at least one of FR2 and/or FR4, and in particular at least one of the Hallmark residues in FR2 and/or FR4 (again, including those at positions 108, 103 and/or 45).</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0703">Also, a humanized Nanobody of the invention may be as defined herein, but with the proviso that it has at least &#x201c;one amino acid difference&#x201d; (as defined herein) in at least one of the framework regions compared to the corresponding framework region of a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain. More specifically, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, a humanized Nanobody may be as defined herein, but with the proviso that it has at least &#x201c;one amino acid difference&#x201d; (as defined herein) at least one of the Hallmark residues (including those at positions 108, 103 and/or 45) compared to the corresponding framework region of a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain.

<p id="p-0398" num="0704">As will be clear from the disclosure herein, it is also within the scope of the invention to use natural or synthetic analogs, mutants, variants, alleles, homologs and orthologs (herein collectively referred to as &#x201c;analogs&#x201d;) of the Nanobodies of the invention as defined herein, and in particular analogs of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO's: 560-621. Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, the term &#x201c;Nanobody of the invention&#x201d; in its broadest sense also covers such analogs.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0705">Generally, in such analogs, one or more amino acid residues may have been replaced, deleted and/or added, compared to the Nanobodies of the invention as defined herein. Such substitutions, insertions or deletions may be made in one or more of the framework regions and/or in one or more of the CDR's. When such substitutions, insertions or deletions are made in one or more of the framework regions, they may be made at one or more of the Hallmark residues and/or at one or more of the other positions in the framework residues, although substitutions, insertions or deletions at the Hallmark residues are generally less preferred (unless these are suitable humanizing substitutions as described herein).</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0706">By means of non-limiting examples, a substitution may for example be a conservative substitution (as described herein) and/or an amino acid residue may be replaced by another amino acid residue that naturally occurs at the same position in another V<sub>HH </sub>domain (see Tables A-5 to A-8 for some non-limiting examples of such substitutions), although the invention is generally not limited thereto. Thus, any one or more substitutions, deletions or insertions, or any combination thereof, that either improve the properties of the Nanobody of the invention or that at least do not detract too much from the desired properties or from the balance or combination of desired properties of the Nanobody of the invention (i.e. to the extent that the Nanobody is no longer suited for its intended use) are included within the scope of the invention. A skilled person will generally be able to determine and select suitable substitutions, deletions or insertions, or suitable combinations of thereof, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, which may for example involve introducing a limited number of possible substitutions and determining their influence on the properties of the Nanobodies thus obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0707">For example, and depending on the host organism used to express the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention, such deletions and/or substitutions may be designed in such a way that one or more sites for post-translational modification (such as one or more glycosylation sites) are removed, as will be within the ability of the person skilled in the art. Alternatively, substitutions or insertions may be designed so as to introduce one or more sites for attachment of functional groups (as described herein), for example to allow site-specific pegylation (again as described herein).</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0708">As can be seen from the data on the V<sub>HH </sub>entropy and V<sub>HH </sub>variability given in Tables A-5 to A-8 above, some amino acid residues in the framework regions are more conserved than others. Generally, although the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thereto, any substitutions, deletions or insertions are preferably made at positions that are less conserved. Also, generally, amino acid substitutions are preferred over amino acid deletions or insertions.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0709">The analogs are preferably such that they can bind to RANK-L with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K<sub>D</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a K<sub>A</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a k<sub>on</sub>-rate and/or a k<sub>off</sub>-rate, or alternatively as an IC<sub>50 </sub>value, as further described herein) that is as defined herein for the Nanobodies of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0710">The analogs are preferably also such that they retain the favourable properties the Nanobodies, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0711">Also, according to one preferred aspect, the analogs have a degree of sequence identity of at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, such as at least 95% or 99% or more; and/or preferably have at most 20, preferably at most 10, even more preferably at most 5, such as 4, 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference (as defined herein), with one of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NOs: 560-621.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0712">Also, the framework sequences and CDR's of the analogs are preferably such that they are in accordance with the preferred aspects defined herein. More generally, as described herein, the analogs will have (a) a Q at position 108; and/or (b) a charged amino acid or a cysteine residue at position 45 and preferably an E at position 44, and more preferably E at position 44 and R at position 45; and/or (c) P, R or S at position 103.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0713">One preferred class of analogs of the Nanobodies of the invention comprise Nanobodies that have been humanized (i.e. compared to the sequence of a naturally occurring Nanobody of the invention). As mentioned in the background art cited herein, such humanization generally involves replacing one or more amino acid residues in the sequence of a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>with the amino acid residues that occur at the same position in a human V<sub>H </sub>domain, such as a human V<sub>H</sub>3 domain. Examples of possible humanizing substitutions or combinations of humanizing substitutions will be clear to the skilled person, for example from the Tables herein, from the possible humanizing substitutions mentioned in the background art cited herein, and/or from a comparison between the sequence of a Nanobody and the sequence of a naturally occurring human V<sub>H </sub>domain.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0714">The humanizing substitutions should be chosen such that the resulting humanized Nanobodies still retain the favourable properties of Nanobodies as defined herein, and more preferably such that they are as described for analogs in the preceding paragraphs. A skilled person will generally be able to determine and select suitable humanizing substitutions or suitable combinations of humanizing substitutions, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, which may for example involve introducing a limited number of possible humanizing substitutions and determining their influence on the properties of the Nanobodies thus obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0715">Generally, as a result of humanization, the Nanobodies of the invention may become more &#x201c;human-like&#x201d;, while still retaining the favorable properties of the Nanobodies of the invention as described herein. As a result, such humanized Nanobodies may have several advantages, such as a reduced immunogenicity, compared to the corresponding naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domains. Again, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, the skilled person will be able to select humanizing substitutions or suitable combinations of humanizing substitutions which optimize or achieve a desired or suitable balance between the favourable properties provided by the humanizing substitutions on the one hand and the favourable properties of naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domains on the other hand.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0716">The Nanobodies of the invention may be suitably humanized at any framework residue(s), such as at one or more Hallmark residues (as defined herein) or at one or more other framework residues (i.e. non-Hallmark residues) or any suitable combination thereof. One preferred humanizing substitution for Nanobodies of the &#x201c;P,R,S-103 group&#x201d; or the &#x201c;KERE group&#x201d; is Q108 into L108. Nanobodies of the &#x201c;GLEW class&#x201d; may also be humanized by a Q108 into L108 substitution, provided at least one of the other Hallmark residues contains a camelid (camelizing) substitution (as defined herein). For example, as mentioned above, one particularly preferred class of humanized Nanobodies has GLEW or a GLEW-like sequence at positions 44-47; P, R or S (and in particular R) at position 103, and an L at position 108.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0717">The humanized and other analogs, and nucleic acid sequences encoding the same, can be provided in any manner known per se. For example, the analogs can be obtained by providing a nucleic acid that encodes a naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domain, changing the codons for the one or more amino acid residues that are to be substituted into the codons for the corresponding desired amino acid residues (e.g. by site-directed mutagenesis or by PCR using suitable mismatch primers), expressing the nucleic acid/nucleotide sequence thus obtained in a suitable host or expression system; and optionally isolating and/or purifying the analog thus obtained to provide said analog in essentially isolated form (e.g. as further described herein). This can generally be performed using methods and techniques known per se, which will be clear to the skilled person, for example from the handbooks and references cited herein, the background art cited herein and/or from the further description herein. Alternatively, a nucleic acid encoding the desired analog can be synthesized in a manner known per se (for example using an automated apparatus for synthesizing nucleic acid sequences with a predefined amino acid sequence) and can then be expressed as described herein. Yet another technique may involve combining one or more naturally occurring and/or synthetic nucleic acid sequences each encoding a part of the desired analog, and then expressing the combined nucleic acid sequence as described herein. Also, the analogs can be provided using chemical synthesis of the pertinent amino acid sequence using techniques for peptide synthesis known per se, such as those mentioned herein.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0718">In this respect, it will be also be clear to the skilled person that the Nanobodies of the invention (including their analogs) can be designed and/or prepared starting from human V<sub>H </sub>sequences (i.e. amino acid sequences or the corresponding nucleotide sequences), such as for example from human V<sub>H</sub>3 sequences such as DP-47, DP-51 or DP-29, i.e. by introducing one or more camelizing substitutions (i.e. changing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of said human V<sub>H </sub>domain into the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position in a V<sub>HH </sub>domain), so as to provide the sequence of a Nanobody of the invention and/or so as to confer the favourable properties of a Nanobody to the sequence thus obtained. Again, this can generally be performed using the various methods and techniques referred to in the previous paragraph, using an amino acid sequence and/or nucleotide sequence for a human V<sub>H </sub>domain as a starting point.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0719">Some preferred, but non-limiting camelizing substitutions can be derived from Tables A-5-A-8. It will also be clear that camelizing substitutions at one or more of the Hallmark residues will generally have a greater influence on the desired properties than substitutions at one or more of the other amino acid positions, although both and any suitable combination thereof are included within the scope of the invention. For example, it is possible to introduce one or more camelizing substitutions that already confer at least some the desired properties, and then to introduce further camelizing substitutions that either further improve said properties and/or confer additional favourable properties. Again, the skilled person will generally be able to determine and select suitable camelizing substitutions or suitable combinations of camelizing substitutions, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, which may for example involve introducing a limited number of possible camelizing substitutions and determining whether the favourable properties of Nanobodies are obtained or improved (i.e. compared to the original V<sub>H </sub>domain). Generally, however, such camelizing substitutions are preferably such that the resulting an amino acid sequence at least contains (a) a Q at position 108; and/or (b) a charged amino acid or a cysteine residue at position 45 and preferably also an E at position 44, and more preferably E at position 44 and R at position 45; and/or (c) P, R or S at position 103; and optionally one or more further camelizing substitutions. More preferably, the camelizing substitutions are such that they result in a Nanobody of the invention and/or in an analog thereof (as defined herein), such as in a humanized analog and/or preferably in an analog that is as defined in the preceding paragraphs.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0720">Other analogs and nucleic acid sequences encoding the same, can be provided, for example to improve stability of the Nanobody. During storage, Nanobodies and other types of immunoglobulins may generate certain variants as a result of:
<ul id="ul0111" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0111-0001" num="0721">i) oxidation event(s), occurring in typically only the &#x201c;accessible&#x201d; methionines wherein oxidation increases during storage in parallel with incubation temperature and time;</li>
    <li id="ul0111-0002" num="0722">ii) cyclization of the first glutamic acid residue, if present, resulting in formation of pyroglutamate, and</li>
    <li id="ul0111-0003" num="0723">iii) isomerization of only the &#x201c;accessible&#x201d; aspartic acids or asparagines in a DG, DS, NG or NS motif wherein isomerization increases during storage in parallel with incubation temperature and time.
<br/>
Analogues of variants of the Nanobodies of the invention may be generated that have improved stability profile. This can be done, for example, but without being limiting, by avoiding isomerization of Asp (D) and Asn (N), e.g. by replacing the Asp-Gly (DG), Asp-Ser (DS), Asn-Gly (NG) and Asn-Ser (NS) in the CDRs with another amino acid such as e.g. Glu (E) or Gln (Q); by avoiding oxidation of Met e.g. by replacing Met which are susceptible to forced oxidation with another amino acid such as e.g. an Ala or Thr, and/or by replacing N-terminal Glu by an alternative N-terminus, e.g. Asp. Again, the skilled person will generally be able to determine and select suitable stabilizing substitutions or suitable combinations of stabilizing substitutions, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, which may for example involve introducing a limited number of possible stabilizing substitutions and determining whether the Nanobodies still bind RANK-L and whether the favourable properties of Nanobodies are obtained or improved (i.e. compared to the original V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>HH </sub>domain). A preferred stabilized Nanobody is depicted in SEQ ID NO: 756) wherein the DS motif in CDR2 is replaced with ES resulting in the following CDR2: SITGSGGSTYYAESVKG (SEQ ID NO: 758).

<p id="p-0415" num="0724">As will also be clear from the disclosure herein, it is also within the scope of the invention to use parts or fragments, or combinations of two or more parts or fragments, of the Nanobodies of the invention as defined herein, and in particular parts or fragments of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO's: 560-621. Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, the term &#x201c;Nanobody of the invention&#x201d; in its broadest sense also covers such parts or fragments.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0725">Generally, such parts or fragments of the Nanobodies of the invention (including analogs thereof) have amino acid sequences in which, compared to the amino acid sequence of the corresponding full length Nanobody of the invention (or analog thereof), one or more of the amino acid residues at the N-terminal end, one or more amino acid residues at the C-terminal end, one or more contiguous internal amino acid residues, or any combination thereof, have been deleted and/or removed.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0726">The parts or fragments are preferably such that they can bind to RANK-L with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K<sub>D</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a K<sub>A</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a k<sub>on</sub>-rate and/or a k<sub>off</sub>-rate, or alternatively as an IC<sub>50 </sub>value, as further described herein) that is as defined herein for the Nanobodies of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0727">Any part or fragment is preferably such that it comprises at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues, preferably at least 20 contiguous amino acid residues, more preferably at least 30 contiguous amino acid residues, such as at least 40 contiguous amino acid residues, of the amino acid sequence of the corresponding full length Nanobody of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0728">Also, any part or fragment is such preferably that it comprises at least one of CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 or at least part thereof (and in particular at least CDR3 or at least part thereof). More preferably, any part or fragment is such that it comprises at least one of the CDR's (and preferably at least CDR3 or part thereof) and at least one other CDR (i.e. CDR1 or CDR2) or at least part thereof, preferably connected by suitable framework sequence(s) or at least part thereof. More preferably, any part or fragment is such that it comprises at least one of the CDR's (and preferably at least CDR3 or part thereof) and at least part of the two remaining CDR's, again preferably connected by suitable framework sequence(s) or at least part thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0729">According to another particularly preferred, but non-limiting aspect, such a part or fragment comprises at least CDR3, such as FR3, CDR3 and FR4 of the corresponding full length Nanobody of the invention, i.e. as for example described in the International application WO 03/050531 (Lasters et al.).</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0730">As already mentioned above, it is also possible to combine two or more of such parts or fragments (i.e. from the same or different Nanobodies of the invention), i.e. to provide an analog (as defined herein) and/or to provide further parts or fragments (as defined herein) of a Nanobody of the invention. It is for example also possible to combine one or more parts or fragments of a Nanobody of the invention with one or more parts or fragments of a human V<sub>H </sub>domain.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0731">According to one preferred aspect, the parts or fragments have a degree of sequence identity of at least 50%, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 80%, such as at least 90%, 95% or 99% or more with one of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NOs: 560-621.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0732">The parts and fragments, and nucleic acid sequences encoding the same, can be provided and optionally combined in any manner known per se. For example, such parts or fragments can be obtained by inserting a stop codon in a nucleic acid that encodes a full-sized Nanobody of the invention, and then expressing the nucleic acid thus obtained in a manner known per se (e.g. as described herein). Alternatively, nucleic acids encoding such parts or fragments can be obtained by suitably restricting a nucleic acid that encodes a full-sized Nanobody of the invention or by synthesizing such a nucleic acid in a manner known per se. Parts or fragments may also be provided using techniques for peptide synthesis known per se.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0733">The invention in its broadest sense also comprises derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention. Such derivatives can generally be obtained by modification, and in particular by chemical and/or biological (e.g enzymatical) modification, of the Nanobodies of the invention and/or of one or more of the amino acid residues that form the Nanobodies of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0734">Examples of such modifications, as well as examples of amino acid residues within the Nanobody sequence that can be modified in such a manner (i.e. either on the protein backbone but preferably on a side chain), methods and techniques that can be used to introduce such modifications and the potential uses and advantages of such modifications will be clear to the skilled person.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0735">For example, such a modification may involve the introduction (e.g. by covalent linking or in an other suitable manner) of one or more functional groups, residues or moieties into or onto the Nanobody of the invention, and in particular of one or more functional groups, residues or moieties that confer one or more desired properties or functionalities to the Nanobody of the invention. Example of such functional groups will be clear to the skilled person.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0736">For example, such modification may comprise the introduction (e.g. by covalent binding or in any other suitable manner) of one or more functional groups that increase the half-life, the solubility and/or the absorption of the Nanobody of the invention, that reduce the immunogenicity and/or the toxicity of the Nanobody of the invention, that eliminate or attenuate any undesirable side effects of the Nanobody of the invention, and/or that confer other advantageous properties to and/or reduce the undesired properties of the Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention; or any combination of two or more of the foregoing. Examples of such functional groups and of techniques for introducing them will be clear to the skilled person, and can generally comprise all functional groups and techniques mentioned in the general background art cited hereinabove as well as the functional groups and techniques known per se for the modification of pharmaceutical proteins, and in particular for the modification of antibodies or antibody fragments (including ScFv's and single domain antibodies), for which reference is for example made to Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1980). Such functional groups may for example be linked directly (for example covalently) to a Nanobody of the invention, or optionally via a suitable linker or spacer, as will again be clear to the skilled person.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0737">One of the most widely used techniques for increasing the half-life and/or reducing the immunogenicity of pharmaceutical proteins comprises attachment of a suitable pharmacologically acceptable polymer, such as poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) or derivatives thereof (such as methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or mPEG). Generally, any suitable form of pegylation can be used, such as the pegylation used in the art for antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to (single) domain antibodies and ScFv's); reference is made to for example Chapman, Nat. Biotechnol., 54, 531-545 (2002); by Veronese and Harris, Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 54, 453-456 (2003), by Harris and Chess, Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov., 2, (2003) and in WO 04/060965. Various reagents for pegylation of proteins are also commercially available, for example from Nektar Therapeutics, USA.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0738">Preferably, site-directed pegylation is used, in particular via a cysteine-residue (see for example Yang et al., Protein Engineering, 16, 10, 761-770 (2003). For example, for this purpose, PEG may be attached to a cysteine residue that naturally occurs in a Nanobody of the invention, a Nanobody of the invention may be modified so as to suitably introduce one or more cysteine residues for attachment of PEG, or an amino acid sequence comprising one or more cysteine residues for attachment of PEG may be fused to the N- and/or C-terminus of a Nanobody of the invention, all using techniques of protein engineering known per se to the skilled person.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0739">Preferably, for the Nanobodies and proteins of the invention, a PEG is used with a molecular weight of more than 5000, such as more than 10,000 and less than 200,000, such as less than 100,000; for example in the range of 20,000-80,000.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0740">Another, usually less preferred modification comprises N-linked or O-linked glycosylation, usually as part of co-translational and/or post-translational modification, depending on the host cell used for expressing the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0741">Yet another modification may comprise the introduction of one or more detectable labels or other signal-generating groups or moieties, depending on the intended use of the labelled Nanobody. Suitable labels and techniques for attaching, using and detecting them will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include, but are not limited to, fluorescent labels (such as fluorescein, isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde, and fluorescamine and fluorescent metals such as <sup>152</sup>Eu or others metals from the lanthanide series), phosphorescent labels, chemiluminescent labels or bioluminescent labels (such as luminal, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, imidazole, acridinium salts, oxalate ester, dioxetane or GFP and its analogs), radio-isotopes (such as <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>51</sup>Cr, <sup>57</sup>Co, <sup>58</sup>Co, <sup>59</sup>Fe, and <sup>75</sup>Se), metals, metal chelates or metallic cations (for example metallic cations such as <sup>99m</sup>Tc, <sup>123</sup>I, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>97</sup>Ru, <sup>67</sup>Cu, <sup>67</sup>Ga, and <sup>68</sup>Ga or other metals or metallic cations that are particularly suited for use in in vivo, in vitro or in situ diagnosis and imaging, such as (<sup>157</sup>Gd, <sup>55</sup>Mn, <sup>162</sup>Dy, <sup>52</sup>Cr, and <sup>56</sup>Fe), as well as chromophores and enzymes (such as malate dehydrogenase, staphylococcal nuclease, delta-V-steroid isomerase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, biotinavidin peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, asparaginase, glucose oxidase, beta-galactosidase, ribonuclease, urease, catalase, glucose-VI-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucoamylase and acetylcholine esterase). Other suitable labels will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include moieties that can be detected using NMR or ESR spectroscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0742">Such labelled Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may for example be used for in vitro, in vivo or in situ assays (including immunoassays known per se such as ELISA, RIA, EIA and other &#x201c;sandwich assays&#x201d;, etc.) as well as in vivo diagnostic and imaging purposes, depending on the choice of the specific label.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0743">As will be clear to the skilled person, another modification may involve the introduction of a chelating group, for example to chelate one of the metals or metallic cations referred to above. Suitable chelating groups for example include, without limitation, diethyl-enetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0744">Yet another modification may comprise the introduction of a functional group that is one part of a specific binding pair, such as the biotin-(strept)avidin binding pair. Such a functional group may be used to link the Nanobody of the invention to another protein, polypeptide or chemical compound that is bound to the other half of the binding pair, i.e. through formation of the binding pair. For example, a Nanobody of the invention may be conjugated to biotin, and linked to another protein, polypeptide, compound or carrier conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. For example, such a conjugated Nanobody may be used as a reporter, for example in a diagnostic system where a detectable signal-producing agent is conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. Such binding pairs may for example also be used to bind the Nanobody of the invention to a carrier, including carriers suitable for pharmaceutical purposes. One non-limiting example are the liposomal formulations described by Cao and Suresh, Journal of Drug Targeting, 8, 4, 257 (2000). Such binding pairs may also be used to link a therapeutically active agent to the Nanobody of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0745">For some applications, in particular for those applications in which it is intended to kill a cell that expresses the target against which the Nanobodies of the invention are directed (e.g. in the treatment of cancer), or to reduce or slow the growth and/or proliferation such a cell, the Nanobodies of the invention may also be linked to a toxin or to a toxic residue or moiety. Examples of toxic moieties, compounds or residues which can be linked to a Nanobody of the invention to provide&#x2014;for example&#x2014;a cytotoxic compound will be clear to the skilled person and can for example be found in the prior art cited above and/or in the further description herein. One example is the so-called ADEPT&#x2122; technology described in WO 03/055527.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0746">Other potential chemical and enzymatical modifications will be clear to the skilled person. Such modifications may also be introduced for research purposes (e.g. to study function-activity relationships). Reference is for example made to Lundblad and Bradshaw, Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem., 26, 143-151 (1997).</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0747">Preferably, the derivatives are such that they bind to RANK-L with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K<sub>D</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a K<sub>A</sub>-value (actual or apparent), a k<sub>on</sub>-rate and/or a k<sub>off</sub>-rate, or alternatively as an IC<sub>50 </sub>value, as further described herein) that is as defined herein for the Nanobodies of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0748">As mentioned above, the invention also relates to proteins or polypeptides that essentially consist of or comprise at least one Nanobody of the invention. By &#x201c;essentially consist of&#x201d; is meant that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide of the invention either is exactly the same as the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody of the invention or corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody of the invention which has a limited number of amino acid residues, such as 1-20 amino acid residues, for example 1-10 amino acid residues and preferably 1-6 amino acid residues, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 amino acid residues, added at the amino terminal end, at the carboxy terminal end, or at both the amino terminal end and the carboxy terminal end of the amino acid sequence of the Nanobody.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0749">Said amino acid residues may or may not change, alter or otherwise influence the (biological) properties of the Nanobody and may or may not add further functionality to the Nanobody. For example, such amino acid residues:

    <li id="ul0112-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0113" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0113-0001" num="0750">can comprise an N-terminal Met residue, for example as result of expression in a heterologous host cell or host organism.</li>
        <li id="ul0113-0002" num="0751">may form a signal sequence or leader sequence that directs secretion of the Nanobody from a host cell upon synthesis. Suitable secretory leader peptides will be clear to the skilled person, and may be as further described herein. Usually, such a leader sequence will be linked to the N-terminus of the Nanobody, although the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thereto;</li>
        <li id="ul0113-0003" num="0752">may form a sequence or signal that allows the Nanobody to be directed towards and/or to penetrate or enter into specific organs, tissues, cells, or parts or compartments of cells, and/or that allows the Nanobody to penetrate or cross a biological barrier such as a cell membrane, a cell layer such as a layer of epithelial cells, a tumor including solid tumors, or the blood-brain-barrier. Examples of such amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person. Some non-limiting examples are the small peptide vectors (&#x201c;Pep-trans vectors&#x201d;) described in WO 03/026700 and in Temsamani et al., Expert Opin. Biol. Ther., 1, 773 (2001); Temsamani and Vidal, Drug Discov. Today, 9, 1012 (004) and Rousselle, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 296, 124-131 (2001), and the membrane translocator sequence described by Zhao et al., Apoptosis, 8, 631-637 (2003). C-terminal and N-terminal amino acid sequences for intracellular targeting of antibody fragments are for example described by Cardinale et al., Methods, 34, 171 (2004). Other suitable techniques for intracellular targeting involve the expression and/or use of so-called &#x201c;intrabodies&#x201d; comprising a Nanobody of the invention, as mentioned below;</li>
        <li id="ul0113-0004" num="0753">may form a &#x201c;tag&#x201d;, for example an amino acid sequence or residue that allows or facilitates the purification of the Nanobody, for example using affinity techniques directed against said sequence or residue. Thereafter, said sequence or residue may be removed (e.g. by chemical or enzymatical cleavage) to provide the Nanobody sequence (for this purpose, the tag may optionally be linked to the Nanobody sequence via a cleavable linker sequence or contain a cleavable motif). Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such residues are multiple histidine residues, glutatione residues and a myc-tag (see for example SEQ ID NO:31 of WO 06/12282).</li>
        <li id="ul0113-0005" num="0754">may be one or more amino acid residues that have been functionalized and/or that can serve as a site for attachment of functional groups.

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0755">According to another aspect, a polypeptide of the invention comprises a Nanobody of the invention, which is fused at its amino terminal end, at its carboxy terminal end, or both at its amino terminal end and at its carboxy terminal end to at least one further amino acid sequence, i.e. so as to provide a fusion protein comprising said Nanobody of the invention and the one or more further amino acid sequences. Such a fusion will also be referred to herein as a &#x201c;Nanobody fusion&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0756">The one or more further amino acid sequence may be any suitable and/or desired amino acid sequences. The further amino acid sequences may or may not change, alter or otherwise influence the (biological) properties of the Nanobody, and may or may not add further functionality to the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention. Preferably, the further amino acid sequence is such that it confers one or more desired properties or functionalities to the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0757">For example, the further amino acid sequence may also provide a second binding site, which binding site may be directed against any desired protein, polypeptide, antigen, antigenic determinant or epitope (including but not limited to the same protein, polypeptide, antigen, antigenic determinant or epitope against which the Nanobody of the invention is directed, or a different protein, polypeptide, antigen, antigenic determinant or epitope).</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0758">Example of such amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person, and may generally comprise all amino acid sequences that are used in peptide fusions based on conventional antibodies and fragments thereof (including but not limited to ScFv's and single domain antibodies). Reference is for example made to the review by Holliger and Hudson, Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1126-1136 (2005).</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0759">For example, such an amino acid sequence may be an amino acid sequence that increases the half-life, the solubility, or the absorption, reduces the immunogenicity or the toxicity, eliminates or attenuates undesirable side effects, and/or confers other advantageous properties to and/or reduces the undesired properties of the polypeptides of the invention, compared to the Nanobody of the invention per se. Some non-limiting examples of such amino acid sequences are serum proteins, such as human serum albumin (see for example WO 00/27435) or haptenic molecules (for example haptens that are recognized by circulating antibodies, see for example WO 98/22141).</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0760">In particular, it has been described in the art that linking fragments of immunoglobulins (such as V<sub>H </sub>domains) to serum albumin or to fragments thereof can be used to increase the half-life. Reference is for made to WO 00/27435 and WO 01/077137). According to the invention, the Nanobody of the invention is preferably either directly linked to serum albumin (or to a suitable fragment thereof) or via a suitable linker, and in particular via a suitable peptide linked so that the polypeptide of the invention can be expressed as a genetic fusion (protein). According to one specific aspect, the Nanobody of the invention may be linked to a fragment of serum albumin that at least comprises the domain III of serum albumin or part thereof. Reference is for example made to WO 07/112,940 of Ablynx N.V.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0761">Alternatively, the further amino acid sequence may provide a second binding site or binding unit that is directed against a serum protein (such as, for example, human serum albumin or another serum protein such as IgG), so as to provide increased half-life in serum. Such amino acid sequences for example include the Nanobodies described below, as well as the small peptides and binding proteins described in WO 91/01743, WO 01/45746 and WO 02/076489 and the dAb's described in WO 03/002609 and WO 04/003019. Reference is also made to Harmsen et al., Vaccine, 23 (41); 4926-42, 2005, as well as to EP 0 368 684, as well as to the following the U.S. provisional applications 60/843,349 (see also PCT/EP2007/059475), 60/850,774 (see also PCT/EP2007/060849), 60/850,775 (see also PCT/EP2007/060850) by Ablynx N.V. mentioned herein and US provisional application of Ablynx N.V. entitled &#x201c;Peptides capable of binding to serum proteins&#x201d; filed on Dec. 5, 2006 (see also PCT/EP2007/063348).</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0762">Such amino acid sequences may in particular be directed against serum albumin (and more in particular human serum albumin) and/or against IgG (and more in particular human IgG). For example, such amino acid sequences may be amino acid sequences that are directed against (human) serum albumin and amino acid sequences that can bind to amino acid residues on (human) serum albumin that are not involved in binding of serum albumin to FcRn (see for example WO 06/0122787) and/or amino acid sequences that are capable of binding to amino acid residues on serum albumin that do not form part of domain III of serum albumin (see again for example WO 06/0122787); amino acid sequences that have or can provide an increased half-life (see for example WO 08/028,977 by Ablynx N.V.); amino acid sequences against human serum albumin that are cross-reactive with serum albumin from at least one species of mammal, and in particular with at least one species of primate (such as, without limitation, monkeys from the genus <i>Macaca </i>(such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) and/or rhesus monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>)) and baboon (<i>Papio ursinus</i>), reference is again made to the U.S. provisional application 60/843,349 and PCT/EP2007/059475); amino acid sequences that can bind to serum albumin in a pH independent manner (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,774 by Ablynx N.V. entitled &#x201c;Amino acid sequences that bind to serum proteins in a manner that is essentially independent of the pH, compounds comprising the same, and uses thereof&#x201d;, filed on Oct. 11, 2006; see also and PCT/EP2007/059475) and/or amino acid sequences that are conditional binders (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,775 by Ablynx N.V. entitled &#x201c;Amino acid sequences that bind to a desired molecule in a conditional manner&#x201d;, filed on Oct. 11, 2006; see also PCT/EP2007/060850).</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0763">According to another aspect, the one or more further amino acid sequences may comprise one or more parts, fragments or domains of conventional 4-chain antibodies (and in particular human antibodies) and/or of heavy chain antibodies. For example, although usually less preferred, a Nanobody of the invention may be linked to a conventional (preferably human) V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>domain or to a natural or synthetic analog of a V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>domain, again optionally via a linker sequence (including but not limited to other (single) domain antibodies, such as the dAb's described by Ward et al.).</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0764">The at least one Nanobody may also be linked to one or more (preferably human) C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2 and/or C<sub>H</sub>3 domains, optionally via a linker sequence. For instance, a Nanobody linked to a suitable C<sub>H</sub>1 domain could for example be used&#x2014;together with suitable light chains&#x2014;to generate antibody fragments/structures analogous to conventional Fab fragments or F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments, but in which one or (in case of an F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment) one or both of the conventional V<sub>H </sub>domains have been replaced by a Nanobody of the invention. Also, two Nanobodies could be linked to a C<sub>H</sub>3 domain (optionally via a linker) to provide a construct with increased half-life in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0765">According to one specific aspect of a polypeptide of the invention, one or more Nanobodies of the invention may be linked (optionally via a suitable linker or hinge region) to one or more constant domains (for example, 2 or 3 constant domains that can be used as part of/to form an Fc portion), to an Fc portion and/or to one or more antibody parts, fragments or domains that confer one or more effector functions to the polypeptide of the invention and/or may confer the ability to bind to one or more Fc receptors. For example, for this purpose, and without being limited thereto, the one or more further amino acid sequences may comprise one or more C<sub>H</sub>2 and/or C<sub>H</sub>3 domains of an antibody, such as from a heavy chain antibody (as described herein) and more preferably from a conventional human 4-chain antibody; and/or may form (part of) and Fc region, for example from IgG (e.g. from IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4), from IgE or from another human Ig such as IgA, IgD or IgM. For example, WO 94/04678 describes heavy chain antibodies comprising a Camelid V<sub>HH </sub>domain or a humanized derivative thereof (i.e. a Nanobody), in which the Camelidae C<sub>H</sub>2 and/or C<sub>H</sub>3 domain have been replaced by human C<sub>H</sub>2 and C<sub>H</sub>3 domains, so as to provide an immunoglobulin that consists of 2 heavy chains each comprising a Nanobody and human C<sub>H</sub>2 and C<sub>H</sub>3 domains (but no C<sub>H</sub>1 domain), which immunoglobulin has the effector function provided by the C<sub>H</sub>2 and C<sub>H</sub>3 domains and which immunoglobulin can function without the presence of any light chains. Other amino acid sequences that can be suitably linked to the Nanobodies of the invention so as to provide an effector function will be clear to the skilled person, and may be chosen on the basis of the desired effector function(s). Reference is for example made to WO 04/058820, WO 99/42077, WO 02/056910 and WO 05/017148, as well as the review by Holliger and Hudson, supra and to the non-prepublished US provisional application by Ablynx N.V. entitled &#x201c;Constructs comprising single variable domains and an Fc portion derived from IgE&#x201d; which has a filing date of Dec. 4, 2007. Coupling of a Nanobody of the invention to an Fc portion may also lead to an increased half-life, compared to the corresponding Nanobody of the invention. For some applications, the use of an Fc portion and/or of constant domains (i.e. C<sub>H</sub>2 and/or C<sub>H</sub>3 domains) that confer increased half-life without any biologically significant effector function may also be suitable or even preferred. Other suitable constructs comprising one or more Nanobodies and one or more constant domains with increased half-life in vivo will be clear to the skilled person, and may for example comprise two Nanobodies linked to a C<sub>H</sub>3 domain, optionally via a linker sequence. Generally, any fusion protein or derivatives with increased half-life will preferably have a molecular weight of more than 50 kD, the cut-off value for renal absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0766">In another one specific, but non-limiting, aspect, in order to form a polypeptide of the invention, one or more amino acid sequences of the invention may be linked (optionally via a suitable linker or hinge region) to naturally occurring, synthetic or semisynthetic constant domains (or analogs, variants, mutants, parts or fragments thereof) that have a reduced (or essentially no) tendency to self-associate into dimers (i.e. compared to constant domains that naturally occur in conventional 4-chain antibodies). Such monomeric (i.e. not self-associating) Fc chain variants, or fragments thereof, will be clear to the skilled person. For example, Helm et al., J Biol Chem 1996 271 7494, describe monomeric Fc&#x3b5; chain variants that can be used in the polypeptide chains of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0767">Also, such monomeric Fc chain variants are preferably such that they are still capable of binding to the complement or the relevant Fc receptor(s) (depending on the Fc portion from which they are derived), and/or such that they still have some or all of the effector functions of the Fc portion from which they are derived (or at a reduced level still suitable for the intended use). Alternatively, in such a polypeptide chain of the invention, the monomeric Fc chain may be used to confer increased half-life upon the polypeptide chain, in which case the monomeric Fc chain may also have no or essentially no effector functions.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0768">Bivalent/multivalent, bispecific/multispecific or biparatopic/multiparatopic polypeptides of the invention may also be linked to Fc portions, in order to provide polypeptide constructs of the type that is described in the non-prepublished U.S. provisional application U.S. 61/005,331 entitled &#x201c;immunoglobulin constructs&#x201d; filed on Dec. 4, 2007.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0769">The further amino acid sequences may also form a signal sequence or leader sequence that directs secretion of the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention from a host cell upon synthesis (for example to provide a pre-, pro- or prepro-form of the polypeptide of the invention, depending on the host cell used to express the polypeptide of the invention).</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0770">The further amino acid sequence may also form a sequence or signal that allows the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to be directed towards and/or to penetrate or enter into specific organs, tissues, cells, or parts or compartments of cells, and/or that allows the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to penetrate or cross a biological barrier such as a cell membrane, a cell layer such as a layer of epithelial cells, a tumor including solid tumors, or the blood-brain-barrier. Suitable examples of such amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include, but are not limited to, the &#x201c;Peptrans&#x201d; vectors mentioned above, the sequences described by Cardinale et al. and the amino acid sequences and antibody fragments known per se that can be used to express or produce the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention as so-called &#x201c;intrabodies&#x201d;, for example as described in WO 94/02610, WO 95/22618, U.S. Pat.

Polypeptides of the invention that comprise two or more Nanobodies, of which at least one is a Nanobody of the invention, will also be referred to herein as &#x201c;multivalent&#x201d; polypeptides of the invention, and the Nanobodies present in such polypeptides will also be referred to herein as being in a &#x201c;multivalent format&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0459" num="0773">In a multivalent polypeptide of the invention, the two or more Nanobodies may be the same or different, and may be directed against the same antigen or antigenic determinant (for example against the same part(s) or epitope(s) or against different parts or epitopes) or may alternatively be directed against different antigens or antigenic determinants; or any suitable combination thereof. For example, a bivalent polypeptide of the invention may comprise (a) two identical Nanobodies; (b) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigenic determinant of a protein or antigen and a second Nanobody directed against the same antigenic determinant of said protein or antigen which is different from the first Nanobody; (c) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigenic determinant of a protein or antigen and a second Nanobody directed against another antigenic determinant of said protein or antigen; or (d) a first Nanobody directed against a first protein or antigen and a second Nanobody directed against a second protein or antigen (i.e. different from said first antigen). Similarly, a trivalent polypeptide of the invention may, for example and without being limited thereto. comprise (a) three identical Nanobodies; (b) two identical Nanobody against a first antigenic determinant of an antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a different antigenic determinant of the same antigen; (c) two identical Nanobody against a first antigenic determinant of an antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a second antigen different from said first antigen; (d) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigenic determinant of a first antigen, a second Nanobody directed against a second antigenic determinant of said first antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a second antigen different from said first antigen; or (e) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigen, a second Nanobody directed against a second antigen different from said first antigen, and a third Nanobody directed against a third antigen different from said first and second antigen.</p>

<p id="p-0461" num="0775">Accordingly, in its simplest form, a bispecific polypeptide of the invention is a bivalent polypeptide of the invention (as defined herein), comprising a first Nanobody directed against RANK-L, and a second Nanobody directed against a second antigen, in which said first and second Nanobody may optionally be linked via a linker sequence (as defined herein); whereas a trispecific polypeptide of the invention in its simplest form is a trivalent polypeptide of the invention (as defined herein), comprising a first Nanobody directed against RANK-L, a second Nanobody directed against a second antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a third antigen, in which said first, second and third Nanobody may optionally be linked via one or more, and in particular one and more, in particular two, linker sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0776">However, as will be clear from the description hereinabove, the invention is not limited thereto, in the sense that a multispecific polypeptide of the invention may comprise at least one Nanobody against RANK-L, and any number of Nanobodies directed against one or more antigens different from RANK-L.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0777">Furthermore, although it is encompassed within the scope of the invention that the specific order or arrangement of the various Nanobodies in the polypeptides of the invention may have some influence on the properties of the final polypeptide of the invention (including but not limited to the affinity, specificity or avidity for RANK-L, or against the one or more other antigens), said order or arrangement is usually not critical and may be suitably chosen by the skilled person, optionally after some limited routine experiments based on the disclosure herein. Thus, when reference is made to a specific multivalent or multispecific polypeptide of the invention, it should be noted that this encompasses any order or arrangements of the relevant Nanobodies, unless explicitly indicated otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0778">Finally, it is also within the scope of the invention that the polypeptides of the invention contain two or more Nanobodies and one or more further amino acid sequences (as mentioned herein).</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0779">For multivalent and multispecific polypeptides containing one or more V<sub>HH </sub>domains and their preparation, reference is also made to Conrath et al., J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 276, 10. 7346-7350, 2001; Muyldermans, Reviews in Molecular Biotechnology 74 (2001), 277-302; as well as to for example WO 96/34103 and WO 99/23221. Some other examples of some specific multispecific and/or multivalent polypeptide of the invention can be found in the applications by Ablynx N.V. referred to herein.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0780">One preferred, but non-limiting example of a multispecific polypeptide of the invention comprises at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one Nanobody that provides for an increased half-life. Such Nanobodies may for example be Nanobodies that are directed against a serum protein, and in particular a human serum protein, such as human serum albumin, thyroxine-binding protein, (human) transferrin, fibrinogen, an immunoglobulin such as IgG, IgE or IgM, or against one of the serum proteins listed in WO 04/003019. Of these, Nanobodies that can bind to serum albumin (and in particular human serum albumin) or to IgG (and in particular human IgG, see for example Nanobody VH-1 described in the review by Muyldermans, supra) are particularly preferred (although for example, for experiments in mice or primates, Nanobodies against or cross-reactive with mouse serum albumin (MSA) or serum albumin from said primate, respectively, can be used. However, for pharmaceutical use, Nanobodies against human serum albumin or human IgG will usually be preferred). Nanobodies that provide for increased half-life and that can be used in the polypeptides of the invention include the Nanobodies directed against serum albumin that are described in WO 04/041865, in WO 06/122787 and in the further patent applications by Ablynx N.V., such as those mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0781">For example, the some preferred Nanobodies that provide for increased half-life for use in the present invention include Nanobodies that can bind to amino acid residues on (human) serum albumin that are not involved in binding of serum albumin to FcRn (see for example WO 06/0122787); Nanobodies that are capable of binding to amino acid residues on serum albumin that do not form part of domain III of serum albumin (see for example WO 06/0122787); Nanobodies that have or can provide an increased half-life (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/843,349 by Ablynx N.V mentioned herein; see also PCT/EP2007/059475); Nanobodies against human serum albumin that are cross-reactive with serum albumin from at least one species of mammal, and in particular with at least one species of primate (such as, without limitation, monkeys from the genus <i>Macaca </i>(such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) and/or rhesus monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>)) and baboon (<i>Papio ursinus</i>)) (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/843,349 by Ablynx N.V; see also PCT/EP2007/059475); Nanobodies that can bind to serum albumin in a pH independent manner (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,774 by Ablynx N.V.; see also PCT/EP2007/060849) and/or Nanobodies that are conditional binders (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,775 by Ablynx N.V.; see also PCT/EP2007/060850).</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0782">Some particularly preferred Nanobodies that provide for increased half-life and that can be used in the polypeptides of the invention include the Nanobodies ALB-1 to ALB-10 disclosed in WO 06/122787 (see Tables II and III) of which ALB-8 (SEQ ID NO: 62 in WO 06/122787) is particularly preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0783">Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of polypeptides of the invention that comprise at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one Nanobody that provides for increased half-life are given in SEQ ID NO's 694-729 and 759-760.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0784">According to a specific, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the polypeptides of the invention contain, besides the one or more Nanobodies of the invention, at least one Nanobody against human serum albumin.</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0785">Generally, any polypeptides of the invention with increased half-life that contain one or more Nanobodies of the invention, and any derivatives of Nanobodies of the invention or of such polypeptides that have an increased half-life, preferably have a half-life that is at least 1.5 times, preferably at least 2 times, such as at least 5 times, for example at least 10 times or more than 20 times, greater than the half-life of the corresponding Nanobody of the invention per se. For example, such a derivative or polypeptides with increased half-life may have a half-life that is increased with more than 1 hours, preferably more than 2 hours, more preferably more than 6 hours, such as more than 12 hours, or even more than 24, 48 or 72 hours, compared to the corresponding Nanobody of the invention per se.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0786">In a preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, such derivatives or polypeptides may exhibit a serum half-life in human of at least about 12 hours, preferably at least 24 hours, more preferably at least 48 hours, even more preferably at least 72 hours or more. For example, such derivatives or polypeptides may have a half-life of at least 5 days (such as about 5 to 10 days), preferably at least 9 days (such as about 9 to 14 days), more preferably at least about 10 days (such as about 10 to 15 days), or at least about 11 days (such as about 11 to 16 days), more preferably at least about 12 days (such as about 12 to 18 days or more), or more than 14 days (such as about 14 to 19 days).</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0787">According to one aspect of the invention the polypeptides are capable of binding to one or more molecules which can increase the half-life of the polypeptide in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0788">The polypeptides of the invention are stabilised in vivo and their half-life increased by binding to molecules which resist degradation and/or clearance or sequestration. Typically, such molecules are naturally occurring proteins which themselves have a long half-life in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0789">Another preferred, but non-limiting example of a multispecific polypeptide of the invention comprises at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one Nanobody that directs the polypeptide of the invention towards, and/or that allows the polypeptide of the invention to penetrate or to enter into specific organs, tissues, cells, or parts or compartments of cells, and/or that allows the Nanobody to penetrate or cross a biological barrier such as a cell membrane, a cell layer such as a layer of epithelial cells, a tumor including solid tumors, or the blood-brain-barrier. Examples of such Nanobodies include Nanobodies that are directed towards specific cell-surface proteins, markers or epitopes of the desired organ, tissue or cell (for example cell-surface markers associated with tumor cells), and the single-domain brain targeting antibody fragments described in WO 02/057445 and WO 06/040153, of which FC44 (SEQ ID NO: 189 of WO 06/040153) and FC5 (SEQ ID NO: 190 of WO 06/040154) are preferred examples.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0790">In the polypeptides of the invention, the one or more Nanobodies and the one or more polypeptides may be directly linked to each other (as for example described in WO 99/23221) and/or may be linked to each other via one or more suitable spacers or linkers, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0791">Suitable spacers or linkers for use in multivalent and multispecific polypeptides will be clear to the skilled person, and may generally be any linker or spacer used in the art to link amino acid sequences. Preferably, said linker or spacer is suitable for use in constructing proteins or polypeptides that are intended for pharmaceutical use.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0792">Some particularly preferred spacers include the spacers and linkers that are used in the art to link antibody fragments or antibody domains. These include the linkers mentioned in the general background art cited above, as well as for example linkers that are used in the art to construct diabodies or ScFv fragments (in this respect, however, its should be noted that, whereas in diabodies and in ScFv fragments, the linker sequence used should have a length, a degree of flexibility and other properties that allow the pertinent V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains to come together to form the complete antigen-binding site, there is no particular limitation on the length or the flexibility of the linker used in the polypeptide of the invention, since each Nanobody by itself forms a complete antigen-binding site).</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0793">For example, a linker may be a suitable amino acid sequence, and in particular amino acid sequences of between 1 and 50, preferably between 1 and 30, such as between 1 and 10 amino acid residues. Some preferred examples of such amino acid sequences include gly-ser linkers, for example of the type (gly<sub>x</sub>ser<sub>y</sub>)<sub>z</sub>, such as (for example (gly<sub>4</sub>ser)<sub>3 </sub>or (gly<sub>3</sub>ser<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, as described in WO 99/42077 and the GS30, GS15, GS9 and GS7 linkers described in the applications by Ablynx mentioned herein (see for example WO 06/040153 and WO 06/122825), as well as hinge-like regions, such as the hinge regions of naturally occurring heavy chain antibodies or similar sequences (such as described in WO 94/04678).</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0794">Some other particularly preferred linkers are poly-alanine (such as AAA), as well as the linkers GS30 (SEQ ID NO: 85 in WO 06/122825) and GS9 (SEQ ID NO: 84 in WO 06/122825).</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0795">Other suitable linkers generally comprise organic compounds or polymers, in particular those suitable for use in proteins for pharmaceutical use. For instance, poly(ethyleneglycol) moieties have been used to link antibody domains, see for example WO 04/081026.</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0796">It is encompassed within the scope of the invention that the length, the degree of flexibility and/or other properties of the linker(s) used (although not critical, as it usually is for linkers used in ScFv fragments) may have some influence on the properties of the final polypeptide of the invention, including but not limited to the affinity, specificity or avidity for RANK-L, or for one or more of the other antigens. Based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linker(s) for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0797">For example, in multivalent polypeptides of the invention that comprise Nanobodies directed against a multimeric antigen (such as a multimeric receptor or other protein), the length and flexibility of the linker are preferably such that it allows each Nanobody of the invention present in the polypeptide to bind to the antigenic determinant on each of the subunits of the multimer. Similarly, in a multispecific polypeptide of the invention that comprises Nanobodies directed against two or more different antigenic determinants on the same antigen (for example against different epitopes of an antigen and/or against different subunits of a multimeric receptor, channel or protein), the length and flexibility of the linker are preferably such that it allows each Nanobody to bind to its intended antigenic determinant. Again, based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linker(s) for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0798">It is also within the scope of the invention that the linker(s) used confer one or more other favourable properties or functionality to the polypeptides of the invention, and/or provide one or more sites for the formation of derivatives and/or for the attachment of functional groups (e.g. as described herein for the derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention). For example, linkers containing one or more charged amino acid residues (see Table A-2 above) can provide improved hydrophilic properties, whereas linkers that form or contain small epitopes or tags can be used for the purposes of detection, identification and/or purification. Again, based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linkers for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0799">Finally, when two or more linkers are used in the polypeptides of the invention, these linkers may be the same or different. Again, based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linkers for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0486" num="0800">Usually, for easy of expression and production, a polypeptide of the invention will be a linear polypeptide. However, the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thereto. For example, when a polypeptide of the invention comprises three of more Nanobodies, it is possible to link them by use of a linker with three or more &#x201c;arms&#x201d;, which each &#x201c;arm&#x201d; being linked to a Nanobody, so as to provide a &#x201c;star-shaped&#x201d; construct. It is also possible, although usually less preferred, to use circular constructs.</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0801">The invention also comprises derivatives of the polypeptides of the invention, which may be essentially analogous to the derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention, i.e. as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0488" num="0802">The invention also comprises proteins or polypeptides that &#x201c;essentially consist&#x201d; of a polypeptide of the invention (in which the wording &#x201c;essentially consist of&#x201d; has essentially the same meaning as indicated hereinabove).</p>
<p id="p-0489" num="0803">According to one aspect of the invention, the polypeptide of the invention is in essentially isolated from, as defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0804">The amino acid sequences, Nanobodies, polypeptides and nucleic acids of the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se, as will be clear to the skilled person from the further description herein. For example, the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be prepared in any manner known per se for the preparation of antibodies and in particular for the preparation of antibody fragments (including but not limited to (single) domain antibodies and ScFv fragments). Some preferred, but non-limiting methods for preparing the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies, polypeptides and nucleic acids include the methods and techniques described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0805">As will be clear to the skilled person, one particularly useful method for preparing an amino acid sequence, Nanobody and/or a polypeptide of the invention generally comprises the steps of:
<ul id="ul0114" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0114-0001" num="0806">i) the expression, in a suitable host cell or host organism (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;host of the invention&#x201d;) or in another suitable expression system of a nucleic acid that encodes said amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;nucleic acid of the invention&#x201d;), optionally followed by:</li>
    <li id="ul0114-0002" num="0807">ii) isolating and/or purifying the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention thus obtained.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0808">In particular, such a method may comprise the steps of:

    <li id="ul0115-0002" num="0810">ii) isolating and/or purifying the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention thus obtained.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0811">A nucleic acid of the invention can be in the form of single or double stranded DNA or RNA, and is preferably in the form of double stranded DNA. For example, the nucleotide sequences of the invention may be genomic DNA, cDNA or synthetic DNA (such as DNA with a codon usage that has been specifically adapted for expression in the intended host cell or host organism).</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0812">According to one aspect of the invention, the nucleic acid of the invention is in essentially isolated from, as defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0813">The nucleic acid of the invention may also be in the form of, be present in and/or be part of a vector, such as for example a plasmid, cosmid or YAC, which again may be in essentially isolated form.</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0814">The nucleic acids of the invention can be prepared or obtained in a manner known per se, based on the information on the amino acid sequences for the polypeptides of the invention given herein, and/or can be isolated from a suitable natural source. To provide analogs, nucleotide sequences encoding naturally occurring V<sub>HH </sub>domains can for example be subjected to site-directed mutagenesis, so at to provide a nucleic acid of the invention encoding said analog. Also, as will be clear to the skilled person, to prepare a nucleic acid of the invention, also several nucleotide sequences, such as at least one nucleotide sequence encoding a Nanobody and for example nucleic acids encoding one or more linkers can be linked together in a suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0815">Techniques for generating the nucleic acids of the invention will be clear to the skilled person and may for instance include, but are not limited to, automated DNA synthesis; site-directed mutagenesis; combining two or more naturally occurring and/or synthetic sequences (or two or more parts thereof), introduction of mutations that lead to the expression of a truncated expression product; introduction of one or more restriction sites (e.g. to create cassettes and/or regions that may easily be digested and/or ligated using suitable restriction enzymes), and/or the introduction of mutations by means of a PCR reaction using one or more &#x201c;mismatched&#x201d; primers. These and other techniques will be clear to the skilled person, and reference is again made to the standard handbooks, such as Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al., mentioned above, as well as the Examples below.</p>
<p id="p-0498" num="0816">The nucleic acid of the invention may also be in the form of, be present in and/or be part of a genetic construct, as will be clear to the person skilled in the art. Such genetic constructs generally comprise at least one nucleic acid of the invention that is optionally linked to one or more elements of genetic constructs known per se, such as for example one or more suitable regulatory elements (such as a suitable promoter(s), enhancer(s), terminator(s), etc.) and the further elements of genetic constructs referred to herein. Such genetic constructs comprising at least one nucleic acid of the invention will also be referred to herein as &#x201c;genetic constructs of the invention&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0499" num="0817">The genetic constructs of the invention may be DNA or RNA, and are preferably double-stranded DNA. The genetic constructs of the invention may also be in a form suitable for transformation of the intended host cell or host organism, in a form suitable for integration into the genomic DNA of the intended host cell or in a form suitable for independent replication, maintenance and/or inheritance in the intended host organism. For instance, the genetic constructs of the invention may be in the form of a vector, such as for example a plasmid, cosmid, YAC, a viral vector or transposon. In particular, the vector may be an expression vector, i.e. a vector that can provide for expression in vitro and/or in vivo (e.g. in a suitable host cell, host organism and/or expression system).</p>
<p id="p-0500" num="0818">In a preferred but non-limiting aspect, a genetic construct of the invention comprises
<ul id="ul0116" list-style="none">

These and other suitable elements for such genetic constructs will be clear to the skilled person, and may for instance depend upon the type of construct used, the intended host cell or host organism; the manner in which the nucleotide sequences of the invention of interest are to be expressed (e.g. via constitutive, transient or inducible expression); and/or the transformation technique to be used. For example, regulatory requences, promoters and terminators known per se for the expression and production of antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to (single) domain antibodies and ScFv fragments) may be used in an essentially analogous manner.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0501" num="0822">Preferably, in the genetic constructs of the invention, said at least one nucleic acid of the invention and said regulatory elements, and optionally said one or more further elements, are &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; to each other, by which is generally meant that they are in a functional relationship with each other. For instance, a promoter is considered &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; to a coding sequence if said promoter is able to initiate or otherwise control/regulate the transcription and/or the expression of a coding sequence (in which said coding sequence should be understood as being &#x201c;under the control of&#x201d; said promoter). Generally, when two nucleotide sequences are operably linked, they will be in the same orientation and usually also in the same reading frame. They will usually also be essentially contiguous, although this may also not be required.</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0823">Preferably, the regulatory and further elements of the genetic constructs of the invention are such that they are capable of providing their intended biological function in the intended host cell or host organism.</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0824">For instance, a promoter, enhancer or terminator should be &#x201c;operable&#x201d; in the intended host cell or host organism, by which is meant that (for example) said promoter should be capable of initiating or otherwise controlling/regulating the transcription and/or the expression of a nucleotide sequence&#x2014;e.g. a coding sequence&#x2014;to which it is operably linked (as defined herein).</p>
<p id="p-0504" num="0825">Some particularly preferred promoters include, but are not limited to, promoters known per se for the expression in the host cells mentioned herein; and in particular promoters for the expression in the bacterial cells, such as those mentioned herein and/or those used in the Examples.</p>
<p id="p-0505" num="0826">A selection marker should be such that it allows&#x2014;i.e. under appropriate selection conditions&#x2014;host cells and/or host organisms that have been (successfully) transformed with the nucleotide sequence of the invention to be distinguished from host cells/organisms that have not been (successfully) transformed. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such markers are genes that provide resistance against antibiotics (such as kanamycin or ampicillin), genes that provide for temperature resistance, or genes that allow the host cell or host organism to be maintained in the absence of certain factors, compounds and/or (food) components in the medium that are essential for survival of the non-transformed cells or organisms.</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="0827">A leader sequence should be such that&#x2014;in the intended host cell or host organism&#x2014;it allows for the desired post-translational modifications and/or such that it directs the transcribed mRNA to a desired part or organelle of a cell. A leader sequence may also allow for secretion of the expression product from said cell. As such, the leader sequence may be any pro-, pre-, or prepro-sequence operable in the host cell or host organism. Leader sequences may not be required for expression in a bacterial cell. For example, leader sequences known per se for the expression and production of antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to single domain antibodies and ScFv fragments) may be used in an essentially analogous manner.</p>
<p id="p-0507" num="0828">An expression marker or reporter gene should be such that&#x2014;in the host cell or host organism&#x2014;it allows for detection of the expression of (a gene or nucleotide sequence present on) the genetic construct. An expression marker may optionally also allow for the localisation of the expressed product, e.g. in a specific part or organelle of a cell and/or in (a) specific cell(s), tissue(s), organ(s) or part(s) of a multicellular organism. Such reporter genes may also be expressed as a protein fusion with the amino acid sequence of the invention. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples include fluorescent proteins such as GFP.</p>

<p id="p-0512" num="0840">The amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can also be introduced and expressed in one or more cells, tissues or organs of a multicellular organism, for example for prophylactic and/or therapeutic purposes (e.g. as a gene therapy). For this purpose, the nucleotide sequences of the invention may be introduced into the cells or tissues in any suitable way, for example as such (e.g. using liposomes) or after they have been inserted into a suitable gene therapy vector (for example derived from retroviruses such as adenovirus, or parvoviruses such as adeno-associated virus). As will also be clear to the skilled person, such gene therapy may be performed in vivo and/or in situ in the body of a patient by administering a nucleic acid of the invention or a suitable gene therapy vector encoding the same to the patient or to specific cells or a specific tissue or organ of the patient; or suitable cells (often taken from the body of the patient to be treated, such as explanted lymphocytes, bone marrow aspirates or tissue biopsies) may be treated in vitro with a nucleotide sequence of the invention and then be suitably (re-)introduced into the body of the patient. All this can be performed using gene therapy vectors, techniques and delivery systems which are well known to the skilled person, and for example described in Culver, K. W., &#x201c;Gene Therapy&#x201d;, 1994, p. xii, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., Publishers, New York, N.Y.); Giordano, Nature F Medicine 2 (1996), 534-539; Schaper, Circ.

<p id="p-0513" num="0841">For expression of the Nanobodies in a cell, they may also be expressed as so-called &#x201c;intrabodies&#x201d;, as for example described in WO 94/02610, WO 95/22618 and U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0514" num="0842">The amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can for example also be produced in the milk of transgenic mammals, for example in the milk of rabbits, cows, goats or sheep (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,741,957, U.S. Pat. No. 6,304,489 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,849,992 for general techniques for introducing transgenes into mammals), in plants or parts of plants including but not limited to their leaves, flowers, fruits, seed, roots or turbers (for example in tobacco, maize, soybean or alfalfa) or in for example pupae of the silkworm <i>Bombix mori. </i></p>
<p id="p-0515" num="0843">Furthermore, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can also be expressed and/or produced in cell-free expression systems, and suitable examples of such systems will be clear to the skilled person. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples include expression in the wheat germ system; in rabbit reticulocyte lysates; or in the <i>E. coli </i>Zubay system.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0844">As mentioned above, one of the advantages of the use of Nanobodies is that the polypeptides based thereon can be prepared through expression in a suitable bacterial system, and suitable bacterial expression systems, vectors, host cells, regulatory elements, etc., will be clear to the skilled person, for example from the references cited above. It should however be noted that the invention in its broadest sense is not limited to expression in bacterial systems.</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="0845">Preferably, in the invention, an (in vivo or in vitro) expression system, such as a bacterial expression system, is used that provides the polypeptides of the invention in a form that is suitable for pharmaceutical use, and such expression systems will again be clear to the skilled person. As also will be clear to the skilled person, polypeptides of the invention suitable for pharmaceutical use can be prepared using techniques for peptide synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="0846">For production on industrial scale, preferred heterologous hosts for the (industrial) production of Nanobodies or Nanobody-containing protein therapeutics include strains of <i>E. coli, Pichia pastoris, S. cerevisiae </i>that are suitable for large scale expression/production/fermentation, and in particular for large scale pharmaceutical (i.e. GMP grade) expression/production/fermentation. Suitable examples of such strains will be clear to the skilled person. Such strains and production/expression systems are also made available by companies such as Biovitrum (Uppsala, Sweden).</p>
<p id="p-0519" num="0847">Alternatively, mammalian cell lines, in particular Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, can be used for large scale expression/production/fermentation, and in particular for large scale pharmaceutical expression/production/fermentation. Again, such expression/production systems are also made available by some of the companies mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0520" num="0848">The choice of the specific expression system would depend in part on the requirement for certain post-translational modifications, more specifically glycosylation. The production of a Nanobody-containing recombinant protein for which glycosylation is desired or required would necessitate the use of mammalian expression hosts that have the ability to glycosylate the expressed protein. In this respect, it will be clear to the skilled person that the glycosylation pattern obtained (i.e. the kind, number and position of residues attached) will depend on the cell or cell line that is used for the expression. Preferably, either a human cell or cell line is used (i.e. leading to a protein that essentially has a human glycosylation pattern) or another mammalian cell line is used that can provide a glycosylation pattern that is essentially and/or functionally the same as human glycosylation or at least mimics human glycosylation. Generally, prokaryotic hosts such as <i>E. coli </i>do not have the ability to glycosylate proteins, and the use of lower eukaryotes such as yeast usually leads to a glycosylation pattern that differs from human glycosylation. Nevertheless, it should be understood that all the foregoing host cells and expression systems can be used in the invention, depending on the desired amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0521" num="0849">Thus, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is glycosylated. According to another non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is non-glycosylated.</p>
<p id="p-0522" num="0850">According to one preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a bacterial cell, in particular a bacterial cell suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production, such as cells of the strains mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0523" num="0851">According to another preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a yeast cell, in particular a yeast cell suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production, such as cells of the species mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0852">According to yet another preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a mammalian cell, in particular in a human cell or in a cell of a human cell line, and more in particular in a human cell or in a cell of a human cell line that is suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production, such as the cell lines mentioned hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0853">When expression in a host cell is used to produce the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and the polypeptides of the invention, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be produced either intracellullarly (e.g. in the cytosol, in the periplasma or in inclusion bodies) and then isolated from the host cells and optionally further purified; or can be produced extracellularly (e.g. in the medium in which the host cells are cultured) and then isolated from the culture medium and optionally further purified. When eukaryotic host cells are used, extracellular production is usually preferred since this considerably facilitates the further isolation and downstream processing of the Nanobodies and proteins obtained. Bacterial cells such as the strains of <i>E. coli </i>mentioned above normally do not secrete proteins extracellularly, except for a few classes of proteins such as toxins and hemolysin, and secretory production in <i>E. coli </i>refers to the translocation of proteins across the inner membrane to the periplasmic space. Periplasmic production provides several advantages over cytosolic production. For example, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the secreted product can be identical to the natural gene product after cleavage of the secretion signal sequence by a specific signal peptidase. Also, there appears to be much less protease activity in the periplasm than in the cytoplasm. In addition, protein purification is simpler due to fewer contaminating proteins in the periplasm. Another advantage is that correct disulfide bonds may form because the periplasm provides a more oxidative environment than the cytoplasm. Proteins overexpressed in <i>E. coli </i>are often found in insoluble aggregates, so-called inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies may be located in the cytosol or in the periplasm; the recovery of biologically active proteins from these inclusion bodies requires a denaturation/refolding process. Many recombinant proteins, including therapeutic proteins, are recovered from inclusion bodies. Alternatively, as will be clear to the skilled person, recombinant strains of bacteria that have been genetically modified so as to secrete a desired protein, and in particular an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or a polypeptide of the invention, can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0526" num="0854">Thus, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide that has been produced intracellularly and that has been isolated from the host cell, and in particular from a bacterial cell or from an inclusion body in a bacterial cell. According to another non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide that has been produced extracellularly, and that has been isolated from the medium in which the host cell is cultivated.</p>

<p id="p-0531" num="0871">After transformation, a step for detecting and selecting those host cells or host organisms that have been successfully transformed with the nucleotide sequence/genetic construct of the invention may be performed.

Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention. Their percentage in the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0545" num="0885">The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.</p>
<p id="p-0546" num="0886">Preparations and formulations for oral administration may also be provided with an enteric coating that will allow the constructs of the invention to resist the gastric environment and pass into the intestines. More generally, preparations and formulations for oral administration may be suitably formulated for delivery into any desired part of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, suitable suppositories may be used for delivery into the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p id="p-0547" num="0887">The amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention or their salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.</p>
<p id="p-0548" num="0888">The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p>
<p id="p-0549" num="0889">Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0550" num="0890">For topical administration, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be applied in pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0551" num="0891">Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, hydroxyalkyls or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.</p>
<p id="p-0552" num="0892">Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0553" num="0893">Examples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention to the skin are known to the art; for example, see Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508).</p>
<p id="p-0554" num="0894">Useful dosages of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949.</p>
<p id="p-0555" num="0895">Generally, the concentration of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, will be from about 0.1-25 wt-%, preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1-5 wt-%, preferably about 0.5-2.5 wt-%.</p>
<p id="p-0556" num="0896">The amount of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. Also the dosage of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention varies depending on the target cell, tumor, tissue, graft, or organ.</p>
<p id="p-0557" num="0897">The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.</p>
<p id="p-0558" num="0898">An administration regimen could include long-term, daily treatment. By &#x201c;long-term&#x201d; is meant at least two weeks and preferably, several weeks, months, or years of duration. Necessary modifications in this dosage range may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein. See Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Martin, E. W., ed. 4), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.</p>

In particular, the invention relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that can be treated by modulating RANK-L, its biological or pharmacological activity, and/or the biological pathways or signalling in which RANK-L is involved, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same. In particular, said pharmaceutically effective amount may be an amount that is sufficient to modulate RANK-L, its biological or pharmacological activity, and/or the biological pathways or signalling in which RANK-L is involved; and/or an amount that provides a level of the amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention in the circulation that is sufficient to modulate RANK-L, its biological or pharmacological activity, and/or the biological pathways or signalling in which RANK-L is involved.</p>
<p id="p-0563" num="0903">The invention furthermore relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that can be prevented and/or treated by administering an amino acid sequence of the invention, a Nanobody of the invention or a polypeptide of the invention to a patient, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.</p>
<p id="p-0564" num="0904">More in particular, the invention relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder chosen from the group consisting of the diseases and disorders listed herein, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.</p>
<p id="p-0565" num="0905">In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for immunotherapy, and in particular for passive immunotherapy, which method comprises administering, to a subject suffering from or at risk of the diseases and disorders mentioned herein, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.</p>
<p id="p-0566" num="0906">In the above methods, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention and/or the compositions comprising the same can be administered in any suitable manner, depending on the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used. Thus, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention and/or the compositions comprising the same can for example be administered orally, intraperitoneally (e.g. intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or via any other route of administration that circumvents the gastrointestinal tract), intranasally, transdermally, topically, by means of a suppository, by inhalation, again depending on the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used. The clinician will be able to select a suitable route of administration and a suitable pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used in such administration, depending on the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated and other factors well known to the clinician.</p>
<p id="p-0567" num="0907">The amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention and/or the compositions comprising the same are administered according to a regime of treatment that is suitable for preventing and/or treating the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated. The clinician will generally be able to determine a suitable treatment regimen, depending on factors such as the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated, the severity of the disease to be treated and/or the severity of the symptoms thereof, the specific amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to be used, the specific route of administration and pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used, the age, gender, weight, diet, general condition of the patient, and similar factors well known to the clinician.</p>
<p id="p-0568" num="0908">Generally, the treatment regimen will comprise the administration of one or more amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention, or of one or more compositions comprising the same, in one or more pharmaceutically effective amounts or doses. The specific amount(s) or doses to administer can be determined by the clinician, again based on the factors cited above.</p>
<p id="p-0569" num="0909">Generally, for the prevention and/or treatment of the diseases and disorders mentioned herein and depending on the specific disease or disorder to be treated, the potency of the specific amino acid sequence, Nanobody and polypeptide of the invention to be used, the specific route of administration and the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition used, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention will generally be administered in an amount between 1 gram and 0.01 microgram per kg body weight per day, preferably between 0.1 gram and 0.1 microgram per kg body weight per day, such as about 1, 10, 100 or 1000 microgram per kg body weight per day, either continuously (e.g. by infusion), as a single daily dose or as multiple divided doses during the day. The clinician will generally be able to determine a suitable daily dose, depending on the factors mentioned herein. It will also be clear that in specific cases, the clinician may choose to deviate from these amounts, for example on the basis of the factors cited above and his expert judgment. Generally, some guidance on the amounts to be administered can be obtained from the amounts usually administered for comparable conventional antibodies or antibody fragments against the same target administered via essentially the same route, taking into account however differences in affinity/avidity, efficacy, biodistribution, half-life and similar factors well known to the skilled person.</p>
<p id="p-0570" num="0910">Usually, in the above method, a single amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention will be used. It is however within the scope of the invention to use two or more amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0571" num="0911">The Nanobodies, amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may also be used in combination with one or more further pharmaceutically active compounds or principles, i.e. as a combined treatment regimen, which may or may not lead to a synergistic effect. Again, the clinician will be able to select such further compounds or principles, as well as a suitable combined treatment regimen, based on the factors cited above and his expert judgement.</p>
<p id="p-0572" num="0912">In particular, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be used in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds or principles that are or can be used for the prevention and/or treatment of the diseases and disorders cited herein, as a result of which a synergistic effect may or may not be obtained. Examples of such compounds and principles, as well as routes, methods and pharmaceutical formulations or compositions for administering them will be clear to the clinician.</p>
<p id="p-0573" num="0913">In particular, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise one or more amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention and at least one additional therapeutic agent selected from a bone morphogenic factor, transforming growth factor-&#x3b2; (TGF-&#x3b2;), an interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitor, IL-1ra, Kineret&#x2122;, a TNF&#x3b1; inhibitor, a soluble TNF&#x3b1; receptor, Enbrel&#x2122;, an anti-TNF&#x3b1; antibody, Remicade&#x2122;, a D2E7 antibody, a parathyroid hormone, an analog of a parathyroid hormone, a parathyroid hormone related protein, an analog of a parathyroid hormone related protein, a prostaglandin, a bisphosphonate, an alendronate, fluoride, calcium, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), a COX-2 inhibitor, Celebrex&#x2122;, Vioxx&#x2122;, an immunosuppressant, methotrexate, leflunomide, a serine protease inhibitor, a secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), an IL-6 inhibitor, an antibody or Nanobody against IL-6, an IL-8 inhibitor, an antibody or Nanobody against IL-8, an IL-18 inhibitor, an IL-18 binding protein, an antibody or Nanobody against IL-18, an Interleukin-1 converting enzyme (ICE) modulator, a fibroblast growth factor (FGF), an FGF modulator, a PAF antagonist, a keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), a KGF-related molecule, a KGF modulator, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) modulator, a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) modulator, a modulator of glucocorticoid receptor, a modulator of glutamate receptor, a modulator of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, a noradrenaline, a noradrenaline mimetic, and a noradrenaline modulator as described, for example, in US 2004/00335353</p>
<p id="p-0574" num="0914">When two or more substances or principles are to be used as part of a combined treatment regimen, they can be administered via the same route of administration or via different routes of administration, at essentially the same time or at different times (e.g. essentially simultaneously, consecutively, or according to an alternating regime). When the substances or principles are to be administered simultaneously via the same route of administration, they may be administered as different pharmaceutical formulations or compositions or part of a combined pharmaceutical formulation or composition, as will be clear to the skilled person.</p>
<p id="p-0575" num="0915">Also, when two or more active substances or principles are to be used as part of a combined treatment regimen, each of the substances or principles may be administered in the same amount and according to the same regimen as used when the compound or principle is used on its own, and such combined use may or may not lead to a synergistic effect. However, when the combined use of the two or more active substances or principles leads to a synergistic effect, it may also be possible to reduce the amount of one, more or all of the substances or principles to be administered, while still achieving the desired therapeutic action. This may for example be useful for avoiding, limiting or reducing any unwanted side-effects that are associated with the use of one or more of the substances or principles when they are used in their usual amounts, while still obtaining the desired pharmaceutical or therapeutic effect.</p>
<p id="p-0576" num="0916">The effectiveness of the treatment regimen used according to the invention may be determined and/or followed in any manner known per se for the disease or disorder involved, as will be clear to the clinician. The clinician will also be able, where appropriate and on a case-by-case basis, to change or modify a particular treatment regimen, so as to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, to avoid, limit or reduce unwanted side-effects, and/or to achieve an appropriate balance between achieving the desired therapeutic effect on the one hand and avoiding, limiting or reducing undesired side effects on the other hand.</p>
<p id="p-0577" num="0917">Generally, the treatment regimen will be followed until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved and/or for as long as the desired therapeutic effect is to be maintained. Again, this can be determined by the clinician.</p>
<p id="p-0578" num="0918">In another aspect, the invention relates to the use of an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for prevention and/or treatment of at least one bone disease or disorder; and/or for use in one or more of the methods of treatment mentioned herein.</p>
<p id="p-0579" num="0919">The subject to be treated may be any warm-blooded animal, but is in particular a mammal, and more in particular a human being. As will be clear to the skilled person, the subject to be treated will in particular be a person suffering from, or at risk of, the diseases and disorders mentioned herein.</p>
<p id="p-0580" num="0920">The invention also relates to the use of an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that can be prevented and/or treated by administering an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0581" num="0921">More in particular, the invention relates to the use of an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and/or treatment of bone diseases and disorders, and in particular for the prevention and treatment of one or more of the diseases and disorders listed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0582" num="0922">Again, in such a pharmaceutical composition, the one or more amino acid sequences, Nanobodies or polypeptides of the invention may also be suitably combined with one or more other active principles, such as those mentioned herein.</p>
<p id="p-0583" num="0923">Finally, although the use of the Nanobodies of the invention (as defined herein) and of the polypeptides of the invention is much preferred, it will be clear that on the basis of the description herein, the skilled person will also be able to design and/or generate, in an analogous manner, other amino acid sequences and in particular (single) domain antibodies against RANK-L, as well as polypeptides comprising such (single) domain antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0584" num="0924">For example, it will also be clear to the skilled person that it may be possible to &#x201c;graft&#x201d; one or more of the CDR's mentioned above for the Nanobodies of the invention onto such (single) domain antibodies or other protein scaffolds, including but not limited to human scaffolds or non-immunoglobulin scaffolds. Suitable scaffolds and techniques for such CDR grafting will be clear to the skilled person and are well known in the art, see for example U.S. Pat. No. 7,180,370, WO 01/27160, EP 0 605 522, EP 0 460 167, U.S. Pat. No. 7,054,297, Nicaise et al., Protein Science (2004), 13:1882-1891; Ewert et al., Methods, 2004 October; 34(2):184-199; Kettleborough et al., Protein Eng. 1991 October; 4(7): 773-783; O'Brien and Jones, Methods Mol. Biol. 2003:207:81-100; Skerra, J. Mol. Recognit. 2000:13:167-187, and Saerens et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2005 Sep. 23; 352(3):597-607, and the further references cited therein. For example, techniques known per se for grafting mouse or rat CDR's onto human frameworks and scaffolds can be used in an analogous manner to provide chimeric proteins comprising one or more of the CDR's of the Nanobodies of the invention and one or more human framework regions or sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0585" num="0925">It should also be noted that, when the Nanobodies of the inventions contain one or more other CDR sequences than the preferred CDR sequences mentioned above, these CDR sequences can be obtained in any manner known per se, for example from Nanobodies (preferred), V<sub>H </sub>domains from conventional antibodies (and in particular from human antibodies), heavy chain antibodies, conventional 4-chain antibodies (such as conventional human 4-chain antibodies) or other immunoglobulin sequences directed against RANK-L. Such immunoglobulin sequences directed against RANK-L can be generated in any manner known per se, as will be clear to the skilled person, i.e. by immunization with RANK-L or by screening a suitable library of immunoglobulin sequences with RANK-L, or any suitable combination thereof. Optionally, this may be followed by techniques such as random or site-directed mutagenesis and/or other techniques for affinity maturation known per se. Suitable techniques for generating such immunoglobulin sequences will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the screening techniques reviewed by Hoogenboom, Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1105-1116 (2005). Other techniques for generating immunoglobulins against a specified target include for example the Nanoclone technology (as for example described in the published US patent application 2006-0211088), so-called SLAM technology (as for example described in the European patent application 0 542 810), the use of transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulins or the well-known hybridoma techniques (see for example Larrick et al, Biotechnology, Vol. 7, 1989, p. 934). All these techniques can be used to generate immunoglobulins against RANK-L, and the CDR's of such immunoglobulins can be used in the Nanobodies of the invention, i.e. as outlined above. For example, the sequence of such a CDR can be determined, synthesized and/or isolated, and inserted into the sequence of a Nanobody of the invention (e.g. so as to replace the corresponding native CDR), all using techniques known per se such as those described herein, or Nanobodies of the invention containing such CDR's (or nucleic acids encoding the same) can be synthesized de novo, again using the techniques mentioned herein.</p>
<p id="p-0586" num="0926">Further uses of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies, polypeptides, nucleic acids, genetic constructs and hosts and host cells of the invention will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. For example, and without limitation, the amino acid sequences of the invention can be linked to a suitable carrier or solid support so as to provide a medium than can be used in a manner known per se to purify RANK-L from compositions and preparations comprising the same. Derivatives of the amino acid sequences of the invention that comprise a suitable detectable label can also be used as markers to determine (qualitatively or quantitatively) the presence of RANK-L in a composition or preparation or as a marker to selectively detect the presence of RANK-L on the surface of a cell or tissue (for example, in combination with suitable cell sorting techniques).</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Identification of RANK-L Blocking Nanobodies</heading>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">1.1 Immunizations</p>
<p id="p-0618" num="1328">Two llamas (No. 115 and No. 116) were immunized, according to standard protocols, with 9 intramuscular injections (100 or 50 &#x3bc;g/dose at weekly intervals) of alternating human RANK-L (R&#x26;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., US) and mouse RANK-L (R&#x26;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., US) in llama No. 116 and in llama No. 115 for the 5 first injections. The last four injections in llama 115 were only of human RANK-L. Both antigens were formulated in Stimune (Cedi-Diagnostics B.V., Lelystad, The Netherlands). At week 3, sera were collected to define antibody titers against human and mouse RANK-L by ELISA. In short, 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) were coated with human or mouse RANK-L. After blocking and adding diluted sera samples, the presence of anti-RANK-L Nanobodies was demonstrated by using HRP (horseradish peroxidase) conjugated goat anti-llama immunoglobulin (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, Tex. USA) and a subsequent enzymatic reaction in the presence of the substrate TMB (3,3&#x2032;,5,5&#x2032;-tetramentylbenzidine) (Pierce, Rockford, Ill., USA). OD<sub>450nm </sub>exceeded 1 for human and mouse RANK-L in both animals.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">1.2 Library Construction</p>
<p id="p-0619" num="1329">Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from the serum samples using Ficoll-Hypaque according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, total RNA was extracted from these cells and used as starting material for RT-PCR to amplify Nanobody encoding gene fragments. These fragments were cloned into a house made phagemid vector. Phage was prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein) and stored after filter sterilization at 4&#xb0; C. for further use.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">1.3 Selections</p>
<p id="p-0620" num="1330">Phage libraries obtained from llamas No. 115 and No. 116 were used for different selection strategies.</p>
<p id="p-0621" num="1331">In a first selection, biotinylated hRANK-L (expressed in mouse myeloma NS0 cell line) (R&#x26;D Systems, Minneapolis, US) at 1, 0.1, 0.01 &#x3bc;g/ml was captured on a neutravidin coated solid phase. Following incubation with the phage libraries and extensive washing, bound phage was aspecifically eluted with trypsin (1 mg/ml).</p>
<p id="p-0622" num="1332">In a second selection, soluble biotinylated hRANK-L (R&#x26;D Systems, Minneapolis, US) (1 nM, 100 pM, 10 pM) was incubated with the phage libraries. After extensive washing, the biotinylated hRANK-L was captured on a neutravidin coated solid phase. Bound phage was specifically eluted with trypsin (1 mg/ml)</p>
<p id="p-0623" num="1333">In a third selection hRANK-L (expressed in <i>E. Coli</i>) (Peprotech, London, UK) was coated onto Maxisorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) at 1, 0.1, 0.01 &#x3bc;g/ml. Following incubation with the phage libraries and extensive washing, bound phage was aspecifically eluted with trypsin (1 mg/ml).</p>
<p id="p-0624" num="1334">In all selections, enrichment was observed. The output from the selections was recloned as a pool into a house made expression vector. Colonies were picked and grown in 96 deep well plates (1 ml volume) and induced by adding IPTG for Nanobody expression. Periplasmic extracts (volume: &#x2dc;80 &#x3bc;l) were prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein).</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">1.4 Screening for RANK-L Blocking Nanobodies in Alphascreen Assay</p>
<p id="p-0625" num="1335">The periplasmic extracts were screened in a RANK Alphascreen assay to evaluate the blocking capacity of the expressed Nanobodies. This assay relies on the use of Donor and Acceptor beads which can be conjugated to biological molecules. When a biological interaction between molecules brings the beads into proximity, excited singlet oxygen molecules that are produced upon laser excitation at 680 nm by a photosensitizer in the Donor bead, diffuse across to react with a chemiluminiscer in the acceptor bead that further activates fluorophores which subsequently emit light at 520-620 nm. If the Nanobody inhibits binding of RANK-L to RANK, fluorescent output will decrease, and the amount of Nanobody present will be inversely related to the amount of fluorescence.</p>
<p id="p-0626" num="1336">Human RANK-L was biotinylated using biotin (Sigma, St Louis, Mo., US) and biotinamidohexanoic acid 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester sodium salt (Sigma, St Louis, Mo., US). RANK-huFc chimera (Alexis, Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland) was coupled to acceptor beads according to manufacturer instructions (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass., US). To evaluate the neutralizing capacity of anti-hRANK-L Nanobodies, dilution series of the periplasmic extracts were pre-incubated with biotinylated human RANK-L. To this mixture, the acceptor beads and the streptavidin donor beads were added and further incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured by reading plates on the EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer) using an excitation wavelength of 680 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Decrease in fluorescence signal indicates that the binding of biotinylated RANK-L to the RANK receptor is blocked by the Nanobody expressed in the periplasmic extract.</p>
<p id="p-0627" num="1337">From this screening inhibiting Nanobodies were selected and sequenced. Sequencing analysis revealed 12 unique Nanobodies and 10 Nanobody families. The corresponding sequences are depicted in Table C-1 and Table B-1. The sequence of non-inhibitory Nanobodies is shown in Table B-2.</p>

<p id="h-0014" num="0000">2.1 Nanobody Expression and Purification</p>
<p id="p-0628" num="1338">20 inhibitory Nanobodies selected from the screening described in example 1 were further purified and characterised. Selected Nanobodies were expressed in <i>E. coli </i>as c-myc, His 6-tagged proteins in a culture volume of 50 mL. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and allowed to continue for 4 h at 37&#xb0; C. After spinning the cell cultures, periplasmic extracts were prepared by freeze-thawing the pellets. These extracts were used as starting material for immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Nanobodies were eluted from the column with 150 mM imidazole and subsequently dialyzed against PBS.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">2.2 Nanobodies Bind to Soluble hRANK-L Coated on Maxisorp 96-Well Plates</p>
<p id="p-0629" num="1339">First, biotinylated hRANK-L (200 ng/ml) was captured on neutravidin coated 96-well plates. Therefore 2 &#x3bc;g/ml neutravidin was coated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. The plates were washed 5 times with 300 &#x3bc;l PBS and then blocked with 300 &#x3bc;l 1% casein/PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. After blocking biotinylated RANK-L (200 ng/ml) was added to the wells and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. After extensive washing with PBS, varying concentrations of Nanobodies starting from 500 nM to 160 pM diluted in 1% casein/PBS were added to the wells and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Bound Nanobodies were detected by subsequent incubations of a primary mouse anti-myc antibody and a secondary anti mouse-HRP conjugate (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and using TMB-H2O2 (Pierce, Rockford, Ill., USA) substrate cocktail. The reaction was stopped with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and the OD was read at 450 nm. All Nanobodies bound to hRANK-L coated on plates in a dose-dependent way. Calculated ED50 values are shown in Table C-2.</p>
<p id="p-0630" num="1340">The same panel of Nanobodies was also analysed for binding to murine RANK-L in a similar set-up as described for human RANK-L (see above). Only Nanobody RANKL3 could bind to murine RANK-L in a dose-dependent way with an ED50 of approximately 600 pM.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">2.3 Nanobodies Block the Binding of RANK-L to its Cognate Receptor RANK in Alpha Screen</p>
<p id="p-0631" num="1341">Human RANK-L was biotinylated using biotin (Sigma, St Louis, Mo., US) and biotinamidohexanoic acid 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester sodium salt (Sigma, St Louis, Mo., US). RANK-huFc chimera (1 nM) (Alexis, Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland) were coupled to acceptor beads according to manufacturer instructions (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass., US).</p>
<p id="p-0632" num="1342">A dilution series of anti-RANK-L Nanobodies starting from 50 nM up to 1 pM was pre-incubated with 100 pM biotinylated RANK-L during 30 minutes at RT. To this mixture, the RANK acceptor beads and the streptavidin donor beads were added and further incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured by reading plates on the EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer) using an excitation wavelength of 680 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0633" num="1343">Preincubation of all Nanobodies with biotinylated RANK-L reduced fluorescence intensity at 520 nm, demonstrating that the Nanobodies can effectively inhibit RANK-L binding to RANK in a dose-dependent manner. The calculated IC50 values are shown in Table C-3, and vary from 137 pM for RANKL9 up to 3530 pM for RANKL23.</p>

Chem. 282: 81-90) as the full length, membrane-bound protein. Binding of the Nanobodies to the cell surface expressed RANK-L was assessed by FACS analysis of cells as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0635" num="1345">Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 nM L-glutamine, 0.4 mM sodium pyruvate. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid expressing full length human or full length cynomolgus RANK-L using Fugene6&#xae; and Optimem (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Ind., US) according to manufacturer's instructions. After 48 hours, transfected cells were subjected to FACS analysis. Transfectants were seeded in 96-well plates at a final concentration of 5E+06/ml in FACS buffer (PBS+10% FBS) and incubated with varying concentrations of Nanobody (2 nM, 400 pM, 80 pM, 16 pM, 3.2 pM for hRANK-L transfectants; 2 nM, 400 pM for cynomolgus RANK-L transfectants) for 1 hour at 4&#xb0; C. Then cells were washed three times with FACS buffer. Bound Nanobodies were detected by subsequent incubations of a primary mouse anti Myc antibody (30 min at 4&#xb0; C. (2 &#x3bc;g/ml)) and a second incubation with goat anti mouse-Phycoerythrin (PE) (Jackson Laboratories) for another 30 min at 4&#xb0; C. Finally, after washing, the cells were resuspended in PBS+10% FBS+TO-PRO&#xae;-3 (5 nM) (Molecular Probes&#xae;, Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) and cell surface fluorescence expressed as mean PE fluorescence, was measured using flow cytometry. All Nanobodies showed dose-dependent binding to both human RANK-L and cynomolgus RANK-L expressed on HEK293T cells at all concentrations tested (Table C-4). Binding was specific since addition of 40 nM soluble human RANK-L to the incubation mixture of 400 pM Nanobody with the HEK293T transfectants abrogated binding of the respective Nanobody to the cells (data not shown).</p>

After 24 hours aliquots of 60 &#x3bc;l (7.5&#xd7;10<sup>3 </sup>cells) were plated into FMAT system 384-well plates (PE Biosystems, CA, US) and allowed to adhere for 24 h. After overnight adherence, culture supernatant was removed by gently tapping the plate. To initiate the competitive screen, 20 &#x3bc;l ALEXA<sup>647</sup>-labeled human RANK-L (200 pM final concentration) diluted in PBS+10% BSA (FMAT buffer) and 20 &#x3bc;l of a dilution series (200 nM down to 0.075 pM) of the different monovalent and trivalent Nanobodies were added to the cell-containing FMAT system 384-well plates (PE Biosystems, CA).

<p id="p-0643" num="1353">RANK-L stimulated osteoclastogenesis is associated with NF-&#x3ba;B activation. Most likely, RANK-L activates the most common dimer, p50/p65 (Wei et al. 2001, Endocrinology 142(3): 1290-1295). The important role of NF-&#x3ba;B p50 and p52 molecules in osteoclastogenese has been shown by Xing et al. (2002, J Bone Miner. Res. 17(7): 1200-1210) reporting that NF-&#x3ba;B p50 and p52 are essential for RANK-expressing osteoclast precursors to differentiate into TRAP+ osteoclasts in response to RANK-L. Moreover p50 and p52 double knock out mice reportedly develop severe osteopetrosis due to the inability to generate mature osteoclasts (Franzoso et al. 1998, Genes &#x26; Development 11: 3482-3496). All together, RANK-L induced NF-&#x3ba;B activation is important for formation of mature osteoclasts.</p>
<p id="p-0644" num="1354">To evaluate the effect of Nanobodies on RANK-L induced NF-&#x3ba;B activation, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected as described in example 3 with a NF-&#x3ba;B reporter gene plasmid and a plasmid encoding &#x3b2;-galactosidase, the latter being used to correct for transfection efficiency. After 24 h, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Another 24 h later, cells were left untreated or were incubated in the presence of a constant amount of human RANK-L (300 ng/ml) and varying amounts of the indicated anti-RANK-L Nanobodies (200 nM down to approximately 10 pM). After 6 hours cells were lysed; luciferase (Luc) and &#x3b2;-galactosidase activity were assayed using the Dual-light kit (Tropix/Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., US) according to manufacturer's instructions. Luc values were normalized for &#x3b2;-galactosidase values to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. As shown in Table C-7, all anti-RANK-L Nanobodies inhibit RANK-L induced NF-&#x3ba;B activation in a dose-dependent way. Calculated IC50 values indicate that trivalent Nanobodies are more potent then the corresponding monovalent molecules.</p>

<p id="p-0645" num="1355">The effects of the three Nanobodies RANKL60, RANKL130 and RANKL180 on differentiation of human osteoclasts in vitro were investigated.</p>
<p id="p-0646" num="1356">The method of osteoclast culture on bone slices was originally described by Boyde and co-workers (1984; Br. Dent J. 156: 216-220) and by Chambers and Horton (1984; J. Pathol. 144: 295-6). Originally, the number of osteoclasts was determined by calculating the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-positive multinuclear cells under a microscope. Later, it was demonstrated that secreted TRACP 5b activity reflects the number of osteoclasts in mouse osteoclast cultures (Alatalo et al., 2000; Clin. Chem. 46: 1751-4). While secreted TRACP 5b activity correlated strongly with the number of osteoclasts, TRACP 5b was not secreted by TRACP-positive mononuclear osteoclast precursor cells before they had differentiated into mature multinuclear osteoclasts. Therefore, secreted TRACP 5b is a reliable marker of the number of mature multinuclear osteoclasts.</p>
<p id="p-0647" num="1357">A human osteoclast differentiation assay was set up in which CD34+ osteoclast precursor cells derived from human bone marrow were cultured for 7 days in the presence of appropriate growth factors, including M-CSF and RANK-ligand, allowing them to differentiate into mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts (Rissanen et al., 2005; Circulation 112: 3937-46).</p>
<p id="p-0648" num="1358">Human bone marrow-derived CD34+ stem cells were suspended to culture medium and allowed to attach to bovine bone slices in 96-well tissue culture plates. The culture medium contained appropriate amounts of important growth factors favoring osteoclast differentiation, including M-CSF and RANK-ligand. The cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator in humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide at 37&#xb0; C. At day 7 when osteoclast differentiation was completed, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b activity (TRACP 5b) was measured from the culture medium as an index of the number of osteoclasts formed, using the BoneTRAP&#xae; assay (IDS Ltd, Boldon, UK) and VICTOR2&#x2122; Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass., USA).</p>
<p id="p-0649" num="1359">Seven different concentrations of each Nanobody were tested in this study, ranging from 0.05 nM to 250 nM. A baseline group without Nanobodies and a control group with a reference molecule were included in each cell culture. Osteoprotegerin, an inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis, was used as a reference molecule to demonstrate that the test system can detect inhibition of osteoclast differentiation.</p>
<p id="p-0650" num="1360">Baseline TRACP 5b values were high and the reference inhibitor OPG inhibited significantly osteoclast differentiation, which indicates that the assay was performed successfully and the results obtained reliable (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). All three Nanobodies inhibited dose-dependently human osteoclast differentiation. All compounds showed a statistically significant inhibition with 3.0 nM and higher concentrations. The inhibition profiles were similar for all three Nanobodies.</p>

Nanobody binding was assessed at one concentration (100 nM). Each Nanobody was injected for 4 minutes at a flow rate of 45 &#x3bc;l/min to allow binding to chip-bound antigen. Next, binding buffer without Nanobody was sent over the chip at the same flow rate to allow spontaneous dissociation of bound Nanobody. From the sensorgrams obtained for the different Nanobodies k<sub>off</sub>-values (k<sub>d</sub>) were calculated and are indicated in Table C-13. Association rate constants (k<sub>on</sub>, or k<sub>a</sub>), and hence also K<sub>D </sub>values, were only indicative as only 1 concentration of Nanobody was used to fit the bindingmodel. As shown in Table C-13, all humanized Nanobodies showed comparable dissociation rate constants/off rates compared to the wild type Nanobody RANKL13.</p>
<p id="p-0675" num="1391">All together, AlphaScreen data and Biacore analysis did not indicate significant effects on binding or potency of the introduced mutations in the respective humanized versions. In a final humanized version, RANKL13hum5, all humanizing mutations were combined. As shown in Table C-13, RANKL13hum5 shows similar potency and binding affinity as the wild type RANKL13.</p>
<p id="h-0045" num="0000">RANKL18</p>
<p id="p-0676" num="1392">In the humanization process of RANKL18, six RANKL18 versions (RANKL18basic, RANKL18hum1, RANKL18hum2, RANL18hum3, RANKL18hum4 and RANKL18hum5) were constructed. RANKL18basic contains 4 substitutions: A14P, E44G, V78L and Q108L. In addition to these changes additional substitutions were introduced in the hum1-5 versions: RANKL18hum1: R27F; RANKL18hum2: G49S; RANKL18hum3: G60A; RANKL18hum4: P77T and V78L; RANKL18hum5: G94A. All versions were tested in AlphaScreen and Biacore (Table C-13).</p>
<p id="p-0677" num="1393">Calculated IC50 values in AlphaScreen indicated that the introduced mutations in RANKL18basic, RANKL18hum3 and RANKL18hum5 did not affect the potencies of these versions compared to the wild type RANKL18 (Table C-13). Humanizing mutations in RANKL18hum1 and RANKL18hum2 influenced moderately the potency while the double mutation in RANKL18hum4 completely abrogated the potency of the Nanobody. Based on these results, two additional mutants, RANKL18hum6 and RANKL18hum7 were constructed and analysed. RANKL18hum6 combines humanizing mutations in RANKL18basic, RANKL18hum3 and RANKL18hum5. RANKL18hum7 includes all mutations of RANKL18hum6 together with V78L substitution. Table C-13 shows that RANKL18hum6 displays similar potency and binding affinity as the wild type RANKL18. RANKL18hum7 is slightly less potent and shows a slightly reduced binding affinity to RANK-L.</p>

<p id="p-0678" num="1394">Analysis of the primary sequence of RANKL13hum5 identified D62 as a potential site for isomerisation and hence as a potential source for chemical instability of the molecule. To test this possibility, a stability assay was performed with the RANKL13hum5 molecule and a mutant in which the potential isomerisation site is replaced by a glutamic acid residue (E), RANKL13hum5D62E (SEQ ID NO: 756).</p>
<p id="p-0679" num="1395">The D62E mutation in RANKL13hum5 was introduced by overlap PCR using primers including the mutation: RevRANKL13hum5D62 (CCTCCCTTTGACGGATTCCGCGTAATACGT; SEQ ID NO: 797) and FwRANKL13hum5D62E (ACGTATTACGCGGATTCCGTCAAAGGGAGG; SEQ ID NO: 798). Both cDNAs encoding RANKL13hum5 or RANKL13hum5_D62E were cloned as SfiI/BstEII fragments in an expression vector derived from pUC119 which contained the LacZ promoter, a resistance gene for ampicillin or carbenicillin, a multicloning site and the gen3 leader sequence. In frame with the Nanobody coding sequence, the vector coded for two stop codons at the 3&#x2032; end of the Nanobody.</p>
<p id="p-0680" num="1396">For production, RANKL13hum5 and RANKL13hum5_D62E constructs were inoculated in 50 ml TB/0.1% glucose/Kanamycin and the suspension incubated overnight at 37&#xb0; C. 5&#xd7;400 ml medium was inoculated with 1/100 of the obtained overnight preculture. Cultures were further incubated at 37&#xb0; C., 250 rpm until OD600&#x3e;5. The cultures were induced with 1 mM IPTG and further kept incubating for 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C. 250 rpm. The cultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 4500 rpm and afterward the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were stored at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0681" num="1397">For purification, pellets were thawed and re-suspended in 20 mL d-PBS and incubated for 1 hour at 4&#xb0; C.

Nanobodies were purified via cation exchange (Source 30S column, washbuffer: 10 mM citric acid pH 4.0; Elution buffer 10 mM citric acid/1M NaCl pH 4.0) followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 Hiload 16/60 column; in d-PBS). The OD 280 nm was measured and the concentration calculated. Samples were stored at &#x2212;20 C.</p>
<p id="p-0682" num="1398">RANKL13hum5 and RANKL13hum5_D62E were analysed for their binding capacity and neutralizing activity in Alphascreen as described in Example 2. Humanization of RANK13 and D62E mutation in RANKL13hum5 did not interfere with potency of the Nanobody.

In this experiment a 100 nM solution was passed over a chip with immobilized RANK-L. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the sensorgrams in the absence of albumin are comparable for both molecules (wild type and humanized) suggesting that both molecules interact in a similar way with immobilized RANKL. Subsequently a mixture was prepared (100 nM of the Nanobody with 500 nM HSA) and passed over the chip. As the signal was significantly higher for the complex, we conclude that both the wild type and humanized variants with anti-Human Serum Albumin Nanobody building block are able to bind to RANK-L and albumin simultaneously.</p>

After 120 seconds, dissociation was allowed or a mixture containing the same concentration of the first Nanobody together with 500 nM of the Nanobody to be tested was injected for 120 seconds.

<p id="p-0725" num="1441"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> represent the serum NTx concentration-time plots for the different Nanobodies dosed at different amounts either intravenously or subcutaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0726" num="1442">All plasma concentration-time profiles of each Nanobody were fitted simultaneously to the pharmacokinetic function that was minimally necessary to provide a reasonable characterization of the concentration-time data. Only the plasma concentration-time profiles of the monkeys devoid of significant immunogenicity were included in the analysis. A two-compartmental pharmacokinetic model with both linear and non-linear clearance from the central compartment was found to characterize the dose and time dependent pharmacokinetics. In turn, these Nanobody-specific pharmacokinetic functions were used as an input function for the pharmacodynamic model to estimate the in vivo potency (IC<sub>50</sub>) and intrinsic activity (I<sub>max</sub>) on serum NTx turnover.</p>
<p id="p-0727" num="1443">The intrinsic activity (I<sub>max</sub>) and potency (IC<sub>50</sub>) of each Nanobody on the serum NTx turnover was described using an indirect response model. The indirect response model was parameterized with the half-life of serum NTx (t<sub>1/2</sub>=0.693/k<sub>out</sub>) and a Nanobody-mediated inhibition (Hill function) on the zero order production rate of NTx (K<sub>in</sub>). The Nanobodies were assumed to inhibit K<sub>in </sub>by means of a Hill equation parameterized with I<sub>max</sub>, IC<sub>50 </sub>and a shape factor n. For each Nanobody a single set of PD parameters was estimated, except for RANKL003p where the turnover parameters (K<sub>in</sub>, K<sub>out</sub>) were allowed to vary for each dose level.</p>
<p id="p-0728" num="1444">The obtained pharmacodynamic parameters of all Nanobodies are presented in Table C-24. Although all three Nanobodies had similar intrinsic activity and mediated an almost complete inhibition of serum NTx 90), their potency was significantly different. RANKL008a was found to be the most potent inhibitor of serum NTx synthesis, followed by RANKL001p and RANKL003p. RANKL003p had a tenfold lower potency than RANKL008a. The average serum NTx half-life was approximately 1.6 hr.</p>
