<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter disclosed herein relates to integrated circuits. More particularly, the subject matter relates to integrated circuit fabrication and layout design.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As integrated circuit (IC) devices (also referred to as semiconductor devices) advance technologically, these devices generally evolve to become physically smaller. In order to meet design constraints associated with these smaller devices, advanced patterning techniques have been developed. For example, multiple patterning techniques, such as double patterning and/or triple patterning may be used to meet design constraints in smaller devices (e.g., at the 14 nanometer (nm) node, and potentially beyond this node).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, in the case of multiple patterning, decomposing a layout into, e.g., two exposures may not guarantee the desired patterning in the completed IC. That is, it is also critical to ensure that the density of shapes on both masks (in the double-patterning example) remains balanced, in order to ensure uniform etch behavior. However, it can be difficult to enforce these shape density parameters during the design process because IC designers are not responsible for particularly large areas of the IC. Conventional approaches of designing layouts for multiple patterning processes are deficient in producing the desired result.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is noted that the drawings of the invention are not necessarily to scale. The drawings are intended to depict only typical aspects of the invention, and therefore should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention. In the drawings, like numbering represents like elements between the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As noted, the subject matter disclosed herein relates to integrated circuits. More particularly, the subject matter relates to integrated circuit fabrication and layout design.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As described herein, in the case of multiple patterning, decomposing a layout into, e.g., two exposures may not guarantee the desired patterning in the completed IC. That is, it is also helpful to ensure that the density of shapes on both masks (in the double-patterning example) remains balanced, in order to ensure uniform etch behavior. However, it can be difficult to enforce these shape density parameters during the design process because IC designers are not responsible for large areas of the IC, but instead are typically focused on designing small components of the design, which are assembled by software tools on a large scale.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In contrast to the conventional approaches, various embodiments include improving uniform density during the lithography/exposure process, prior to polishing (e.g., chemical mechanical polishing, or CMP) to better control the uniform density of an integrated circuit. As described herein, various embodiments of the invention include approaches for balancing the types of exposure masks used in layout windows of an integrated circuit layout.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Various embodiments of the invention include a method of designing an integrated circuit (IC) layout for a multiple patterning process. In some cases, the method includes: providing a pre-characterized mask tile library including a plurality of distinct mask tiles each having a distinct mask density on a plurality of distinct exposures each associated with a patterning process; determining a density of a mask group in a first layout window in the IC layout, the first layout window including an open space unfilled by the mask group; and selecting a set of mask tiles from the plurality of distinct mask tiles to fill a portion of the open space, the selecting based upon the determined density of the mask group in the first layout window.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Various additional embodiments of the invention include a system having at least one computing device configured to design an integrated circuit (IC) layout for a multiple patterning process by performing actions including: providing a pre-characterized mask tile library including a plurality of distinct mask tiles each having a distinct mask density (spread across the multiple exposures); determining a density of a mask group in a first layout window in the IC layout, the first layout window including an open space unfilled by the mask group; and selecting a set of mask tiles from the plurality of distinct mask tiles to fill a portion of the open space, the selecting based upon the determined density of the mask group in the first layout window and the distinct mask density of the selected set of mask tiles on the plurality of distinct (multiple) exposures.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Various other embodiments of the invention includes a computer program product including program code stored on a computer-readable storage medium, which when executed by at least one computing device, causes the at least one computing device to perform actions including: providing a pre-characterized mask tile library including a plurality of distinct mask tiles each having a distinct mask density on a plurality of distinct exposures each associated with a patterning process; determining a density of a mask group in a first layout window in the IC layout, the first layout window including an open space unfilled by the mask group; and selecting a set of mask tiles from the plurality of distinct mask tiles to fill a portion of the open space, the selecting based upon the determined density of the mask group in the first layout window and the distinct mask density of the selected set of mask tiles on the plurality of distinct (multiple) exposures.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The various solutions disclosed utilize layout fill techniques in IC layout data preparation (or, dataprep) to balance the density of shapes on multiple exposures in addition to achieving density uniformity. These solutions are based on using a pre-characterized library of fill shapes having different densities at each exposure. The approach further includes using an optimization formulation to minimize the density imbalance in each layout window subject to meeting fill density constraints.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The various approaches of the invention include approaches for minimizing the density imbalance using various algorithms, e.g., a greedy algorithm. The approaches described according to various embodiments have several advantages: a) approaches according to embodiments reduce the burden of balancing densities on the IC designer; b) these approaches are agnostic to the method of layout decomposition used by the IC data processing components; c) these approaches require no more than small changes to the existing fill infrastructure; and d) these approaches run in linear time.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an illustrative data flow diagram <b>2</b> is shown illustrating a process according to various embodiments of the invention. As shown, a first process (process PA) in this data flow can include correcting a decomposed layout <b>4</b> (data object 4) to account for density imbalances after the layout has been decomposed. This first process can be performed according to methods known in the art. For example, the layout of particular mask shapes used to form underlying components of the layout <b>4</b> can be modified in order to balance a density of a first type of shape against a second, third, fourth, etc., type of shape in the layout <b>4</b>. A next process (process PB) can include layout windowing, where the IC layout is partitioned into a series of windows (or sub-layouts) for analysis on a smaller, more manageable scale. Layout windowing can be performed according to various embodiments of the invention. Next, in process PC, each layout window can be filled as well as balanced between various exposures according to the various embodiments of the invention. That is, process PC can include color-aware fill insertion, where the term &#x201c;color&#x201d; refers to a type of exposure mask. As used herein, different colors/patterns can refer to different types of exposure mask, e.g., red (hashed pattern in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) correlating with mask shapes on the first exposure mask, green (white in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) correlating with mask shapes on the second exposure mask, blue (black in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) correlating with mask shapes on the third exposure mask, etc. Process PC (color-aware fill insertion) can include balancing the exposure density of each window in the IC layout, using density calculations <b>6</b> from the layout windowing (process PB), pre-determined density requirements <b>8</b> for each window, and a pre-characterized fill library <b>10</b> including a plurality of exposure mask types. As described herein, process PC can include an iterative process of filling each layout window in order to balance exposure densities. Following process PC, a decomposed and filled layout (with balanced densities) <b>12</b> is formed, which can then be utilized in process dataprep (process PD). Dataprep (process PD) can include conventional data preparation techniques known in the art for preparing layout data for fabrication (e.g., verifying spacing constraints, line constraints, via fill constraints, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of a schematic data flow according to various embodiments of the invention. As shown, a first layout window (e.g., from an integrated circuit) <b>20</b> is to be filled according to various embodiments of the invention. This schematic data flow includes a depiction of a tile library <b>22</b>, which can be pre-formed according to various embodiments of the invention. The tile library <b>22</b> can include a plurality of mask layout configurations, which are shown with distinct combinations of &#x201c;colors&#x201d; or patterns (exposure masks), which leads to varying density of shapes for each color/pattern in each tile. As shown, the tile library <b>22</b> includes six (6) distinct mask layout configurations, with the following combinations:</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">1) Red-blue-red; 2) Blue-red-blue; 3) Red-green-red; 4) Green-red-green; 5) Blue-green-blue; and 6) Green-blue-green. It is understood that these tiles are only examples of the various combinations of mask configurations available to fill portions of the window <b>20</b> (e.g., a first layout window in a larger IC), consisting of different densities on each exposure. It is understood that the tile library <b>22</b> can include any number of tiles, and this example is only meant for illustrative purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown, the window <b>20</b> can include an initial mask group <b>24</b> in the first layout window <b>22</b> in the IC layout. The first layout window <b>20</b> can include an open space <b>27</b> unfilled by the initial mask group <b>24</b>. As shown in the data flow, a first process can include selecting a set of mask tiles (e.g., tile group 4) from the plurality of distinct mask tiles in the tile library <b>22</b> for a portion <b>28</b> of the open space <b>27</b>. The selecting can be based upon the determined density of the mask group <b>24</b> in the first layout window <b>20</b> and the distinct mask density of the selected set of mask tiles on the plurality of distinct exposures.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The selecting process can include: a) determining a total area of the mask group <b>24</b> in the first layout window <b>20</b>. In this case, the mask group <b>24</b> can be measured, or its area can be determined based upon the known size of each shape in the group <b>24</b> as well as a known or measured spacing between each shape in the group <b>24</b>; b) calculating a shape density of the mask group <b>24</b> in the layout window <b>20</b>. In this case, the shape density can be calculated by determining (e.g., measuring) the area (e.g., two-dimensional area) occupied by each shape (or each group of similar shapes corresponding to the same &#x201c;color&#x201d;) as a percentage of the total area in the window <b>20</b>, the total area of the open space <b>27</b> or the portion <b>28</b> of he open space; c) comparing that calculated shape density to a predetermined density threshold for the first layout window <b>20</b>. The predetermined density threshold can be based upon a known maximum shape density for each type of shape. This known maximum shape density can be based upon spacing constraints in each level of the layout window, which can depend upon fabrication processes to be performed at each level of the layout window, along with tolerances associated with each fabrication process; d) comparing a shape density of a candidate set of mask tiles (e.g., at least one of tile 1, tile 2, tile 3, etc.) from the plurality of distinct mask tiles (in tile library <b>22</b>) with a difference between the predetermined density threshold for the first layout window <b>20</b> and the shape density of the mask group <b>24</b>; and selecting the candidate set of mask tile (e.g., at least one of tile 1, tile 2, tile 3, etc.) for insertion in the first layout window <b>22</b> in response to determining the shape density of the candidate set (e.g., at least one of tile 1, tile 2, tile 3, etc.) does not exceed the difference between the predetermined density threshold and the shape density of the mask group. This process is simplified in the depiction where tile 4, then tile 6, then tile 1, then tile 6 are selected (in series in this example) to fill the open space <b>26</b> in the layout window <b>20</b>. It is understood that the above-noted processes for selecting at least one tile is iterated to select each subsequent tile (e.g., for selection of Tile 4, then Tile 6, then Tile 1, etc.). That is, the process of selecting can further include:</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A) Determining a density of a combination of the mask group <b>24</b> and the set of mask tiles (e.g., Tile 4 in the first step) in the first layout window <b>20</b>, the first layout window including a subsequent open space <b>32</b> unfilled by the mask group <b>24</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">B) Selecting a subsequent set of mask tiles (e.g., Tile 6) from the plurality of distinct mask tiles (e.g., at least one of tile 1, tile 2, tile 3, etc.) for a portion <b>34</b> of the subsequent open space <b>32</b> based upon the density of the combination of the mask group <b>24</b> and the set of mask tiles (Tile 4) and the subsequent open space <b>32</b>. This process is iterated for each subsequent open space (e.g., subsequent open space <b>32</b>, subsequent open space <b>42</b> (with portion <b>44</b>), subsequent open space <b>52</b>, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After filling the layout window <b>20</b>, the filled layout <b>44</b> including the selected group of tiles (e.g., tiles 4, 6, 1, 6, etc.) can be provided, e.g., for data preparation (Dataprep) as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As noted herein, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates but one example illustration of a method according to the various embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a flow diagram illustrating methods according to various embodiments of the invention. As shown, the methods can include optional (or additional) processes (shown in phantom), which can be performed according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a series of sub-processes associated with process P<b>3</b> (selecting of a set of mask tiles), which further illustrate details associated with this process.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Turning to optional process P<b>0</b>, the method can include compiling a plurality of distinct mask tiles to form a pre-characterized mask tile library (e.g., as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), e.g., for a layout fill process described herein. This can include compiling a plurality of known or custom designed mask tiles into a library and saving the library in an accessible data store.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Process P<b>1</b> can include providing the pre-characterized mask tile library for use in an integrated circuit (IC) design process, as described herein. As described herein, each of the plurality of distinct mask tiles has a distinct mask density on a plurality of distinct exposures each associated with a patterning process.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Process P<b>2</b> can include determining a density of a mask group in a first layout window, where the first layout window includes an open space unfilled by the mask group. As described herein, the density of a mask group can be determined by measuring, calculating, or otherwise determining which portion of the area in the first layout window is occupied by the mask group. In some cases, the density can be a fraction, percentage, etc. of the total area in the first layout window. In other cases, the density of the mask group can be determined as a comparison with other mask group(s) in the first layout window.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Process P<b>3</b> can include selecting a set of mask tiles from the plurality of distinct mask tiles to fill a portion of the open space. The selecting can be based upon the determined density of the mask group in the first layout window, especially accounting for the different relative densities of the exposure masks, and the distinct mask density of the selected set of mask tiles on the plurality of distinct exposures.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, sub-processes in process P<b>3</b> are illustrated, including:</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Process P<b>3</b>A: Determining a total area of the mask group in the first layout window, e.g., by measuring or otherwise calculating the area occupied by the mask group within the first layout window;</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Process P<b>3</b>B: Calculating a shape density of the mask group in the first layout window, e.g., by determining a percentage of the mask group's area attributable to each shape (also referred to as a color), e.g., red is &#x2153; of the area of the mask group and accounts for &#x2153; of the total area of the mask group;</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Process P<b>3</b>C: Comparing the shape density of the mask group (e.g., &#x2153; red, &#x2154; green) to a predetermined density threshold (e.g., A/B red, D/E green, F/G blue) for the first layout window, where the predetermined density threshold is calculated based upon a desired shape density at different levels of the layout (into and out of the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and distinct colors can represent different masks at different levels of that layout);</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Process P<b>3</b>D: Comparing the total shape density (the composite shape density) of the mask group to a predetermined density threshold (for composite shape density) for the first layout window;</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Process P<b>3</b>E: Comparing a shape density of a candidate set of mask tiles from the plurality of distinct mask tiles with a difference between the total predetermined density threshold for the first layout window and the shape density of the mask group; and</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Process P<b>3</b>F: selecting the candidate set of mask tiles for insertion in the first layout window in response to determining the shape density of the candidate set does not exceed the difference between the predetermined density threshold and the shape density of the mask group, accounting for the imbalance of densities between the various exposures in the layout. That is, in this process, the selecting of the candidate set of mask tiles reduces an imbalance of densities between the plurality of distinct exposures.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, additional (optional) process P<b>4</b> can include determining a density of a combination of the mask group (after being inserted into the layout) and the set of mask tiles previously present in the first layout window, e.g., by combining the measured or otherwise calculated areas of these groups as a percentage of the total area in the layout window. In this case, the first layout window can include a subsequent open space unfilled by the mask group.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Additional (optional) process P<b>5</b> can include selecting a subsequent set of mask tiles from the plurality of distinct mask tiles for a portion of the subsequent open space based upon: the density of the combination of the mask group and the set of mask tiles, and the subsequent open space.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one particular example, a method according to various embodiments of the invention can include using a heuristic based algorithm for determining which fill shape(s) (e.g., tiles) to select for filing open space in an IC layout.
