<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-048646 filed on Mar. 7, 2011 in Japan, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate to a semiconductor device and a method for fabricating the semiconductor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a semiconductor element, low-resistance contact between an n-type semiconductor region and metal is needed. Similarly, low-resistance contact between a p-type semiconductor region and metal is needed. In a semiconductor element based on, for example, silicon (Si), the sum of barrier between an n-type region or p-type region and a metal for the same metal is about 1 eV of the magnitude of a bandgap. In this case, a sufficiently low contact resistance can be obtained by sufficiently increasing the amount of dopant in both regions. That is, the barrier can be set sufficiently low and a sufficient amount of dopant can be introduced for activation and thus, forming simultaneous contact to both the n-type semiconductor region and the p-type semiconductor region does not pose a big problem.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductor device, however, the sum of barrier between an n-type semiconductor region or p-type semiconductor region and a metal for the same metal amounts to about 3 eV of the magnitude of a bandgap. Thus, for use of the semiconductor device as a product, steps are needed such as using different metals for electrodes between the n-type region and the p-type region to reduce the resistance. It is also necessary to introduce the dopant in higher concentrations to reduce the resistance and further, a long-term high-temperature process is needed for activation. An interface between, for example, an SiC semiconductor and a dielectric film is caused to deteriorate by the high-temperature process. Thus, it is desirable to reduce the resistance at a lower temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Regarding contact between, for example, a large n-type SiC region and metal, a satisfactory value to some extent is obtained for a reduction of resistance by using an interface reaction layer in a high-temperature process. Regarding contact between a p-type SiC region and metal, however, an obtained value cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory even for a large region. This stems from material characteristics of the material SiC. That is, the material itself has a large bandgap. This is an intrinsic problem of a wide bandgap semiconductor because any electrode capable of making low-resistance contact with an n-type SiC region has a barrier to a p-type SiC region as large as the bandgap.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described above, for low-resistance contact between an n-type SiC region and metal, there is a problem that a high-temperature process is needed. For low-resistance contact between a p-type SiC region and metal, there is a problem that even realization thereof is insufficient with the same metal as that of the n-type SiC region. Thus, there is a problem that the type of metal to be used is sharply restricted.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the first embodiment, SiC is co-doped with a &#x201c;dopant&#x201d; (nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) is introduced for the n-type and boron (B) or aluminum (Al) for the p-type) with a smaller ion radius and a &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; with a larger ion radius. S, Se, or Te is introduced in an n-type interface and Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba is introduced in a p-type interface. When SiC is used, high-temperature (for example, 1700&#xb0; C.)/long-term (for example, 30 min) annealing is needed to introduce a sufficient amount of dopant for activation, one cause therefor is that the dopant to be used is small. If an element having a larger ion diameter is co-doped, distortion during introduction is eased, which makes direct introduction into lattice points easier. On the other hand, if only the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; is introduced, the ion radius is too large, which makes introduction into SiC difficult. Thus, by combining the &#x201c;dopant&#x201d; and &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d;, more of these materials can be introduced into SiC. SiC has a smaller lattice and thus, an introduced material is diffused extremely slowly compared with Si, which is a big difference from Si. In Si, the introduced material is uniformly diffused throughout the Si film. In SiC, by contrast, a distribution close to the initial state of introduction can be obtained even after high-temperature annealing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, the &#x201c;dopant&#x201d; with a smaller ion radius and the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; with a larger ion radius can advantageously be introduced more easily by both being introduced simultaneously. It is difficult for the dopant to be introduced into SiC and particularly it is difficult to produce a high concentration of the dopant. However, a high concentration of the dopant can easily be produced by co-doping. That is, while high-temperature long-term annealing at 1700&#xb0; C. for 30 min or so has been needed, it turns out that annealing at 1050&#xb0; C. for 1 min or so is effective with co-doping. The &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; of n-type has two more electrons and thus, even a deep state hardly affects the n-type conduction. The p-type similarly lacks two electrons and even a deep state hardly affects the p-type conduction. Therefore, it turns out that the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; is also effective as an &#x201c;assist material of introduction and activation&#x201d; of the &#x201c;dopant&#x201d;. It turns out that the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; is an important additive element not only as the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d;, but also as a material that makes the dopant easier to use (migration to annealing at a lower temperature for a shorter time).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It has been revealed that many materials diffuse fast in Si and the distribution thereof spreads and thus, if S, Se, or Te is introduced into Si for later diffusion, it is difficult to concentrate the element in an interface. In SiC, by contrast, the diffusion of the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; is slow due to a smaller lattice constant and as shown below, it is more advantageous to pile up in an n-type SiC/metal interface than being inside. Similarly, it has been revealed that if Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba is introduced into Si for later diffusion, it is difficult to concentrate the element in an interface. In SiC, by contrast, the diffusion of the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; is slow and it is more advantageous to pile up in a p-type SiC/metal interface than being inside.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the additive elements S, Se, and Te (denoted as an additive element D) create a state at the bottom of a conduction band of SiC. If these additive elements are in an interface between n-SiC and metal, electrons are emitted to the metal to form a dipole in the interface. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the effective work function of the metal moves in a smaller (shallower) direction. In this case, the system as a whole is energetically advantageous by the amount of transfer of electrons. In this manner, these additive elements D pile up in the interface. For the mechanism of gain to work, it is clear that the metal to be used with a larger work function (larger than 4.2 eV) piles up more in the interface. If a metal material having a work function smaller than 4.2 eV is used, while this mechanism does not work, the junction becomes a sufficiently ohmic junction in the first place. Many actual metals are considered to have a work function larger than 4.3 eV and thus, an ohmic connection is automatically created by the additive element D such as S, Se, and Te being piled up in the n-SiC/metal interface.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the additive elements Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba (denoted as an additive element A) create a state immediately above a valence band of SiC. If these additive elements are in an interface between p-SiC and metal, electrons are obtained from the metal to form a dipole in the interface. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the effective work function of the metal moves in a larger (deeper) direction. In this case, the system as a whole is energetically advantageous by the amount of transfer of electrons. In this manner, these additive elements A pile up in the interface. The work function of the metal to be used is at most 5.7 eV or so (for example, gold). The top of the valence band of SiC is very deep with 7.4 eV and thus, a large gain can be expected from the transfer of electrons from the metal. If a metal material having a work function larger than 7.4 eV is used, this mechanism is not needed and the junction is considered to become a sufficiently ohmic junction. Many actual metals are considered to have a work function smaller than 5.7 eV and thus, an ohmic connection is automatically created by the additive element A such as Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba being piled up in the p-SiC/metal interface.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The work function of the metal used commonly is distributed in the range of 4.3 eV to 5.7 eV. Thus, an n-SiC/metal junction having a Schottky barrier of about 0.1 eV can be produced without much difficulty on the n-SiC side and may practically be considered as an ohmic junction. However, a high Schottky barrier is anticipated for a p-SiC/metal junction. This is because SiC has a large bandgap. According to the first embodiment, however, an increasing energy gain due to the transfer of electrons is considered for an interface with an increasing Schottky barrier expected, which makes the first embodiment more advantageous. A wide gap semiconductor can demonstrate effects particularly thanks to the energy gain.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The pinning effect in the first embodiment will be described by comparing with a conventional example using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a case when the above pinning material like in the first embodiment is not used. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a lower barrier is attempted to realize by implanting the dopant in high concentrations and using high-temperature annealing for activation. The selection of electrode material is also important. In the first embodiment, by contrast, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a pinning material is introduced to an interface between SiC and metal. Accordingly, an interface state can be created at a band end. An almost zero barrier can be realized by the effect of such a pinning material. Further, the flexibility of metal selection can dramatically be increased. Further, the need for annealing at a high temperature can be eliminated so that device deterioration can be avoided or controlled. Moreover, the pinning material can be applied to n-type and p-type SiC simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, by causing an interface portion with an electrode to contain a pinning material for each of n-type SiC and p-type SiC in such a way that the surface density thereof peaks, the resistance of each of n-type and p-type can be reduced. Further, an electrode of one type of metal can be formed simultaneously on the n-type (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b> and the p-type (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>220</b>. In the first embodiment, the reduction of resistance in the junction between the n-type (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b> and the electrode <b>240</b> to be a source electrode, the reduction of resistance in the junction between the p-type (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>220</b> and the electrode <b>240</b> to be a source electrode, and the reduction of resistance in the junction between the back side of the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor substrate <b>200</b> and the electrode <b>262</b> to be a drain electrode can all be realized. However, the first embodiment is not limited to this and a configuration to realize only one or any two of the reduction of resistance in the junction between the n-type (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b> and the electrode <b>240</b> to be a source electrode, the reduction of resistance in the junction between the p-type (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>220</b> and the electrode <b>240</b> to be a source electrode, and the reduction of resistance in the junction between the back side of the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor substrate <b>200</b> and the electrode <b>262</b> to be a drain electrode may be adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With further micropatterning in the future, it will be necessary to make contact with both of an n-type SiC region and a p-type SiC region within the same SiC single element by the same metal. If both the n-type SiC region and the p-type SiC region should be contacted by the same metal, simultaneous and low-resistance contact formation is desirable from the perspective of limitations of adjustment precision and simplification of processes. In other words, a technology to make low-resistance contact with both the n-type SiC region and the p-type SiC region by one electrode is desirable. If such a reduction of resistance cannot be realized, the ON resistance will be large in the n-type SiC region. On the other hand, a resistor and a capacitor are effectively formed in the p-type SiC region and thus, a problem of switching speed is caused. If contact resistance to the p-type SiC region is large, the RC time constant when an element is driven increases, which slows down the operation speed. According to the first embodiment, these problems are tackled by making contact with both the n-type SiC region and the p-type SiC region by the same metal. Further, low-resistance contact can be formed simultaneously. Therefore, the ON resistance can be reduced in the n-type SiC region. On the other hand, the switching speed can be increased in the p-type SiC region.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Then, as the ion implantation process of n-type pinning material (S) (S<b>108</b>), immediately after introduction of N ions, S ions serving as an n-type pinning material are implanted in the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b> by using the same mask <b>222</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The amount of &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; will briefly be considered. The lower limit thereof is determined by the necessary voltage shift amount in the interface. The amount of n-type is about 0.1 eV (to change the work function of metal of 4.3 eV or more to an effective work function smaller than 4.2 eV) and the amount of p-type is about 1.7 eV (to change the work function of metal of only 5.7 eV or less to an effective work function larger than 7.4 eV).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The shift X (V) by a fixed polarization amount constituted of the metal/SiC substrate interface can be calculated as X=(charge)&#xd7;(surface density)&#xd7;(polarization length)/dielectric constant.

For S, Se, Te or Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba in the SiC substrate, the charge is 2, the number surface density is about 10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>, and the dielectric constant is 10. Because the lower limit is considered, the maximum value is adopted and about 10 &#x212b; is assumed for the polarization length. Thus, X=1.81&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;14</sup>&#xd7;2&#xd7;10<sup>13</sup>&#xd7;10/10=0.36 (V). The voltage shift amount for n-type should be about 0.1 V and thus, the surface density of 0.28&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>or more is needed. The voltage shift amount for p-type should be about 1.7 V and thus, the surface density of 4.7&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>or more is needed. If the surface density is less than these values, the necessary shift amount is not obtained and the resistance increases.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The upper limit is a state in which Si is replaced by the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d;.

However, the amount of additives in the interface should be as less as possible. If there is an extra amount of additives, the number of defects may increase on the substrate side, leading to higher resistance. Particularly on the electrode side, the resistance increases with an increasing amount of impurities, which does not pay.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The upper limit is determined from the above formula. Because the upper limit is determined, the minimum value is adopted and about 1 &#x212b; is assumed for the polarization length. 1.5 eV or less (to change the work function of 5.7 eV to an effective work function of less than 4.2 eV) is enough as the shift amount in the interface for n-type and thus, the surface density may be 4.2&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>or less. 3.1 eV or less (to change the work function of 4.3 eV to an effective work function of more than 7.4 eV) is enough as the shift amount in the interface for p-type and thus, the surface density may be 8.7&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>or less. The upper limit shown here is determined by assuming that the polarization length is about 1 &#x212b;, but may be increased up to 10 &#x212b;.

In this manner, a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> is obtained. At this point, while, activation of the dopant introduced into SiC can be realized, the dopant is hardly diffused. Also, introduced S and Mg are hardly diffused. This point has been checked to apply when, in addition to S and Mg, other pinning materials such as Se, Te, Ca, Sr, and Ba are introduced. Thus, the SiC material is fundamentally different from Si in that &#x201c;the dopant and other elements are hardly diffused in SiC&#x201d;. If many dopants and S or Mg should be implanted into Si, dopants and S or Mg are diffused.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, as the dielectric film formation process (S<b>116</b>), the oxide film <b>250</b> is formed so as to cover the whole of the (n<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) SiC semiconductor layer <b>202</b>, the (p<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) SiC semiconductor regions <b>210</b>, the (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>220</b>, and the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b>. For example, dry oxidation (thermal oxidation) may be used as the formation method of the oxide film <b>250</b>. For example, a compact oxide film can be produced by dry oxidation under conditions of 1200&#xb0; C. and the heating time of 30 min.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, a resist film having a pattern is first formed on the oxide film <b>250</b> by using photolithography. The resist film is used as a mask to remove a portion of the oxide film <b>250</b> positioned on the surface of the (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>220</b> and a portion of the surface of the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b> by etching. Accordingly, the oxide film <b>250</b> extending over the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor regions <b>230</b> on both sides is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Subsequently, as the electrode (source electrode) formation process (S<b>118</b>), a conductive film of metal or the like is formed on the surface of the (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>220</b> and a portion of the surface of the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b> exposed by an opening formed after the resist film and the oxide film <b>250</b> are removed. The conductive film becomes the electrode <b>240</b> (first electrode). Then, the resist film is removed to remove (lift-off) the conductive film positioned on the resist film. If the width of the oxide film <b>250</b> is made narrower by etchback or the like, a gap can be formed between the oxide film <b>250</b> and the electrode <b>240</b> to avoid contact therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, nickel (Ni), tungsten (W), and titanium nitride (TiN) are suitable as an electric conductor to be the electrode <b>240</b>. W and TiN are advantageously easy to work on. The type and production process have severely been limited for this electrode. However, it turns out that no limitation is imposed if the conductor is stable because the effective work function is pinned to about 4.2 eV in the n+ region by the next heat treatment and about 7.2 eV in the p+ region. Thus, for example, other metals or materials other than metals superior in workability such as n-type (such as phosphorus doped) polysilicon, p-type (such as boron doped) polysilicon (poly-Si), n-type (such as nitrogen or phosphorus doped) polysilicon carbide, and p-type (such as boron or Al doped) polysilicon carbide (poly-SiC) may be used. Si and SiC are materials constituting an SiC substrate and thus very compatible with the substrate. If the method of the present patent is used, limitations of the work function of an electrode and the like are completely eliminated and thus, a free selection can be made thanks to stability, workability, resistance, easy production, and compatibility with the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As the low-temperature annealing process (S<b>122</b>), heat treatment at 400&#xb0; C. is provided after the source electrode is produced. For example, the heat treatment is to heat for 5 min in an argon (Ar) gas. With the heat treatment, S can be aggregated (piled up) in the interface between the electrode <b>240</b> and the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b> and Mg in the interface between the electrode <b>240</b> and the (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>220</b>. This is because the states of S and Mg are stabilized by piling up in the interface through exchange of electrons with the electrode. If annealing is performed at high temperature (for example, 1700&#xb0; C.) as in the past after the oxide film <b>250</b> to be a gate oxide film being formed, the interface between the oxide film <b>250</b> and the channel region is caused to deteriorate. In the present embodiment, however, the heating temperature can significantly be lowered to 400&#xb0; C. so that such deterioration can be controlled. In the lower temperature of 300&#xb0; C. or below, the heating treatment time will be longer. With an increasing temperature, on the other hand, a treatment time will be needed to raise/lower the temperature before/after the heat treatment. Considering these factors collectively, 300&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C. can be deemed to be appropriate. Considering the total treatment time, the temperature around 400&#xb0; C. can be deemed to be best. At this temperature, a reaction between SiC and metal does not occur. Also in this sense, the temperature around 400&#xb0; C. can be said to be an appropriate temperature. If silicide obtained by a reaction between SiC and metal should be used as an electrode, after the silicide is produced at high temperature, an interface pileup process may be introduced by low-temperature annealing of the present patent.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Another example of the method of doping a pinning material in the first embodiment will be described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, an example of the surface density of a pinning material when the dopant and the pinning material are co-doped. In other words, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows a case when the pinning material is implanted to the SiC side and then, an electrode of a metallic material is formed. In an (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor, for example, a case when S to be an n-type pinning material is implanted is shown. This also applies when Se or Te is implanted. The trend of the graph is the same when Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba to be a p-type pinning material is implanted into a (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor. As indicated by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, though the surface side of SiC is highly concentrated before annealing even if a metallic film is formed, there is no peak that stands out. In contrast, if annealing is performed, it is evident that a peak of S (or another &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d;) appears in the interface portion of SiC with the metal, here within 10 &#x212b; from the surface of SiC due to pileup in the interface. The mechanism by which a peak is formed is stabilization by electron transfer. Electrons can be transferred within 10 &#x212b; and thus, a peak is formed within this range. This process is characterized by high-efficiency activation due to an effect of co-doping. Moreover, the amount of impurities on the metal side is small and thus, the resistance on the metal side can be maintained low. That is, not only the reduction of contact resistance, but also the reduction of resistance on the substrate side and the metal side is achieved. The effect of co-doping can further be enhanced by further introducing a large amount of the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d;. Accordingly, achieving almost 100% of the activation ratio at the operating temperature, that is, the reduction of resistance in the substrate portion is also possible. In the present embodiment, the amount of the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; is intentionally reduced to demonstrate only the pinning effect. Thus, though improvement in activation ratio of about 10% is observed, it is easy to make further improvement. This process uses two properties: the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; (such as S and Mg) is not diffused by activation annealing and pileup in the interface by low-temperature annealing after electrode formation. The first property is caused by a small lattice constant. The second property is caused by a large gap.</p>

As indicated by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, S is present in the metallic film in almost the same concentrations before annealing is performed after formation of the metallic film. In contrast, if annealing is performed, it is evident that S moves from the metal side to the SiC side to pile up in the interface and a peak of S appears in the interface portion of SiC with the metal, here within 10 &#x212b;. The trend of the graph is the same when Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba to be a p-type pinning material is implanted into a (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor. In this case, the pinning material is hardly diffused into the substrate. Therefore, an effect of co-doping cannot be demonstrated. Moreover, a large amount of impurities is implanted to the metal side and thus, a higher resistance of the metal is unavoidable. That is, the process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> is superior in terms of properties. However, the process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is very simple and superior in cost.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>, for example, a 4H&#x2014;SiC substrate having another plane such as the (000-1) plane as the main surface. That is, the ohmic connection due to pileup of S (or Se or Te) in the interface between the source electrode and n+ region and the ohmic connection due to pileup of Mg (or Ca, Sr, or Ba) in the interface between the source electrode and p+ region are valid regardless of the orientation of the substrate. That is, that an electron state of sulfur (or selenium or tellurium) creates a localized state near the bottom of the conduction band is a nature as a bulk. Also, that an electron state of Mg (or calcium, strontium, or barium) creates a localized state near the top of the valence band is a nature as a bulk.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the first embodiment, the ohmic connection is obtained by pileup of S at low temperature in the source electrode/n+ region interface or pileup of Mg at low temperature in the source electrode/p+ region interface. If, instead of S, Se or Te is introduced, a similar result is obtained. If, instead of Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba is introduced, a similar result is obtained. As a result, (1) it turns out that the ON resistance in the source electrode/n+ region interface can be reduced immeasurably compared with the past. While 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>&#x3a9;cm<sup>2 </sup>or less is aimed for as the contact resistance, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>&#x3a9;cm<sup>2 </sup>is realizable. (2) It turns out that the contact resistance in the source electrode/p+ region interface can be reduced immeasurably compared with the past.

(3) In the conventional configuration, the source electrode and the n+ region or p+ region are contacted by forming an interface reaction later at a high temperature. It is known that if a high-temperature heating process is undergone after a gate dielectric film is formed, a large amount of dangling bond of the SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiC substrate interface arises so that mobility deteriorates significantly. In the present embodiment, however, only low-temperature annealing for the purpose of piling up additive materials at low temperature is performed. As a result, it turns out that the channel mobility has a value (the peak value of 320 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs after passing through processes in the present embodiment), which is larger than a conventional value (the peak value of 20 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs after passing through the high-temperature heating process) by an order of magnitude. The improvement in mobility directly affects the ON resistance and thus very effective for device characteristic improvement. (4) The electrode is changed like the TiN electrode, polysilicon electrode, and W electrode, but no significant difference is found. However, if S or Mg is not introduced, electrode dependence appears intensely.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to the first embodiment, as described above, ohmic connection can be established for both the source electrode and the drain electrode.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, as the ion implantation process (S<b>106</b>), the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b> is formed by selectively implanting n-type conductive impurities into a portion of the surface of the (p<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>210</b>.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, as the ion implantation process for (p<sup>+</sup>) (S<b>110</b>), the (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>220</b> is formed by selectively implanting p-type conductive impurities in another portion of the surface of the (p<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) SiC semiconductor regions <b>210</b> so as to be adjacent to the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b>. In the second embodiment, Mg ions are not subsequently implanted.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The annealing process (S<b>114</b>) and the dielectric film formation process (S<b>116</b>) are executed in the same manner as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>, as the electrode (source electrode) formation process (S<b>120</b>), like in the first embodiment, a conductive film of metal or the like is formed on the surface of the (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>220</b> and a portion of the surface of the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b> exposed by an opening formed after the resist film and the oxide film <b>250</b> are removed. The conductive film is formed by the sputter process using a target of a conductive material containing both S and Mg. Such a conductive film becomes the electrode <b>240</b>. The electrode <b>240</b> is different from the electrode <b>240</b> in the first embodiment in that the &#x201c;pinning material&#x201d; is contained. A detailed description thereof will be provided with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>. Then, the resist film is removed to remove (lift-off) the conductive film positioned on the resist film. If the width of the oxide film <b>250</b> is made narrower by etchback or the like, a gap can be formed between the oxide film <b>250</b> and the electrode <b>240</b> to avoid contact therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The subsequent processes are the same as those in the first embodiment. S is moved from the electrode <b>240</b> on the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b> and Mg is moved from the electrode <b>240</b> on the (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>220</b> by the low-temperature annealing process (S<b>122</b>) to the SiC side before being piled up in the interface portion. Then, like in the first embodiment, the (n<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>230</b> and the electrode <b>240</b> are ohmically connected. Similarly, the (p<sup>+</sup>) SiC semiconductor region <b>220</b> and the electrode <b>240</b> are ohmically connected. In the present embodiment, the amount of the &#x201c;pinning material (S)&#x201d; in the interface between an n-type SiC region and metal is about 2&#xd7;10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. The amount of the &#x201c;pinning material (Mg)&#x201d; in the interface between a p-type SiC region and metal is about 8&#xd7;10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Alternatively, individual targets such as S and Mg may be sputtered simultaneously (co-sputtered) only near the interface. Mg in the n region receives electrons from the dopant (such as N) and thus does not work and Mg is not piled up in the interface of the n region. Similarly, S in the p region provides electrons to the dopant (such as Al) and thus does not work and S is not piled up in the interface of the p region. Thus, it turns out that a pinning material in the opposite direction causes no problem even if such a pinning material is present. That is, if both pinning materials are introduced, the pinning materials pin the effective work function of an electrode to the bottom of the conduction band in an n region and immediately above the valence band in a p region.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Alternatively, after an electrode being formed, ions of S or Mg may be implanted. To implant ions in an n region and a p region separately, a mask process is separately needed and also an alignment error causes a problem. However, implanting ions of both S and Mg in metal by using a mask pattern used for forming a metal film hardly causes a process load. In this case, both pinning materials are introduced into each of an n region and a p region and, as described above, the pinning materials pin the effective work function of an electrode to the bottom of the conduction band in the n region and immediately above the valence band in the p region. Se or Te may be used instead of S and Ca, Sr, or Ba may be used instead of Mg.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">It is also possible to create only one of ohmic connection between an n region and metal and ohmic connection between a p region and metal. If, for example, an electrode in which Mg is introduced into Ni is created, the n region and Ni is ohmically connected. Mg is piled up in the interface of only the p region and the p region is also ohmically connected.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Also in the second embodiment, as described above, ohmic connection can be established for both the source electrode and the drain electrode. Thus, low-resistance contact between a p-type SiC region and metal can be made realizable. In the source electrode/p+ region interface, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>&#x3a9;cm<sup>2 </sup>is realizable as the contact resistance. Also, low-resistance contact between an n-type SiC region and metal at low temperature can be made realizable. In the source electrode/n+ region interface, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>&#x3a9;cm<sup>2 </sup>is realizable as the contact resistance. Further, one electrode can be connected to the p-type SiC region and the n-type SiC region simultaneously. The electrode is changed like the TiN electrode, polysilicon electrode, and W electrode, but no significant difference is found. However, if S or Mg is not introduced, electrode dependence appears intensely. It turns out that the channel mobility has a value (the peak value of 320 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs after passing through processes in the present embodiment), which is larger than a conventional value (the peak value of 20 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs after passing through the high-temperature heating process) by an order of magnitude.</p>

More specifically, an ion implantation mask is first formed. For example, a polysilicon film is grown and after a predetermined resist mask process is undergone, patterning of a polysilicon film is performed. In this case, strongly anisotropic conditions for etching polysilicon, for example, reactive ion etching is used to form the polysilicon film. Because the etching is anisotropic, the mask is patterned in a rectangular shape. The ion implantation mask is used to implant nitrogen ions for conversion from the p+ epitaxial layer into the n-type (the impurity concentration is suitably set to, for example, 1&#xd7;10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>) to link to the (n<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) SiC semiconductor layer <b>202</b> as the groundwork.
