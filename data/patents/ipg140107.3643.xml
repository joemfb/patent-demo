<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is based on Taiwan, R.O.C. patent application No. 97137151 filed on Sep. 26, 2008.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to radio frequency identification (RFID), and more particularly, to an item positioning system using an RFID tag and a method thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">RFID technology is a non-contact automatic identification technology implementing a tag and a reader. A small RFID tag chip is set on or embedded in a product, and product data stored in the RFID tag chip is sent to the reader for tracking. Using RFID technology as a goods tracking system or an access control system can greatly reduce manual operations. Therefore, more and more RFID technologies are being applied to factory automation, goods sales, toll systems and vehicle identification.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a shopping mall or a supermarket, the types of goods for sale are diversified and complex. A conventional method of manually managing and searching goods needs tremendous manpower and time, and is sometimes ineffective in practice. Hence, the conventional method is not a good mechanism for managing goods.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Presently, a common goods search system used in a shop or store records the position or area of every good in the shop. When a customer or a shop assistant wishes to search for a position or area of a certain good, he inputs the name or keyword of the good into the goods search system and obtains the exact position from the goods search system. However, if the position of the good is changed, e.g., the good is moved to another area by a customer, the customer or the shop assistant can not successfully find the good from the goods search system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need for improving goods search systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An item positioning system is provided according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The item positioning system determines a position of a target item to which a target tag is attached. In practice, the target tag is a high frequency (HF) RFID tag.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The item positioning system comprises a plurality of tag readers and a control device. The tag readers correspond to a plurality of predetermined positions within a space. The tag readers generate access signals respectively and optionally receive a response signal generated by the target tag. The control device, coupled to the tag readers, optionally adjusts transmitting power of the access signals generated by the tag readers. The control device determines the position of the target item according to whether the tag readers receive the response signal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An item positioning method is provided according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The item positioning method is used to determine a position of a target item. In this embodiment, a target tag is attached to the target item. In practice, the target tag is a HF RFID tag.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the method, a plurality of tag readers are controlled to generate access signals respectively, and are corresponding to a plurality of predetermined positions within a space. Transmitting power of the access signals generated by the tag readers is optionally adjusted according to whether the tag readers receive a response signal generated by the target item. The position of the target item is determined according to whether the number of the tag readers receiving the response signal is smaller than a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In conclusion, an item positioning system according to the present invention determines whether a plurality of tag readers provided at different positions within a same space can access a target tag. Accordingly, the item positioning system according to the present invention optionally controls transmitting power of the tag readers to narrow down a range and a position of the target tag. Compared to the prior art, the item positioning system according to the invention can correctly position the position of the target tag and determine a current position of the target item. Therefore, the item positioning system of the invention may be particularly useful for purposes of searching for positions of goods in a shop, or for books in a library, among other uses.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An objective of the present invention is to control transmitting power of a tag reader to narrow down the search range according to the response of the target tag and, ultimately, find the target tag.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An item positioning system is provided according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The item positioning system deployed in a convenience store is used for determining a position of a target good with an identification tag, such as a certain drink. An identification tag, such as a high frequency RFID tag, is attached to the target good. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic diagram of the item position system comprising a control device <b>10</b>, a transforming device <b>12</b> and sixteen tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, the control device <b>10</b> is coupled to the transforming device <b>12</b> via Ethernet, and the transforming device <b>12</b> is coupled to the tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b> via a power line network or Ethernet.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this embodiment, the tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b> are respectively provided at different positions in the convenience store. For example, the tag reader <b>141</b>, inserted in an electric socket, is coupled to the transforming device <b>12</b> via the power line network, and the transforming device <b>12</b> is coupled to the control device <b>10</b> via Ethernet. A function of the transforming device is to convert different signal formats between the power line network and Ethernet.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When a shop assistant of the convenience store wishes to find a current position of a target good attached with the target tag <b>5</b> by the item positioning system <b>1</b>, the shop assistant operates the control device <b>10</b> to generate a control signal to each of the tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b>. In the process, the transforming device <b>12</b> is used to convert the control signal and transmit the converted control signal to the readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b>. When receiving the control signal respectively, each of the tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b> generates an access signal and transmits the access signal within a first range as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (<i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In practice, each of the tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b> adjusts transmitting power of the access signal to change the transmitting range of the access signal. For example, when transmitting power of the access signal of the tag reader <b>141</b> is increased, the transmitting range of the access signal is expanded. In this embodiment, suppose that the first ranges of the tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b> are the same; that is, each of the tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b> transmits the access signal with the same transmitting power.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Whether the target good is in the first ranges of the access signals transmitted by the tag readers is to be further discussed below. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (<i>a</i>), when the target good with the target tag <b>5</b> is in the first range of the access signal transmitted by the tag reader device <b>144</b>, the target tag <b>5</b> shall receive the access signal. According to the access signal, the target tag <b>5</b> then generates a response signal, which is subsequently received by the tag reader <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Having received the response signal, the tag reader <b>144</b> generates a successful access signal according to the response signal and transmits the same to the control device <b>10</b>. If the control device <b>10</b> receives the successful access signal sent by the tag reader <b>144</b>, it means that the tag reader <b>144</b> can access the target tag <b>5</b> attached to the target good. That is, the target tag <b>5</b> is located in the first range of the access signal of the tag reader <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (<i>a</i>), the target tag <b>5</b> attached to the target good is obviously outside the first range of the access signal of the tag reader <b>141</b>. Indeed, the target tag <b>5</b> is not able to receive an access signal transmitted by the tag reader <b>141</b>, and hence the target tag <b>5</b> does not generate a response signal according to the access signal of the tag reader <b>141</b>. The tag reader <b>141</b> does not receive the response signal from the target tag <b>5</b>. Therefore, the tag reader <b>141</b> will not transmit a successful access signal to the control device <b>10</b>. If the control device <b>10</b> does not receive the successful access signal sent by the tag reader <b>141</b>, it means that the tag reader <b>141</b> is not able to access the target tag <b>5</b> attached to the target good. That is, the target tag <b>5</b> is not located in the first range of the access signal of the tag reader <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is apparent from the above description that, the control device <b>10</b> determines whether each of the tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b> can access the target tag <b>5</b>, according to whether the control device <b>10</b> receives successful access signals respectively sent by each of the tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (<i>a</i>), only the tag readers <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>147</b> and <b>148</b> can access the target tag <b>5</b>. That is, the item positioning system <b>1</b> can determine an approximate position of the target tag <b>5</b>, which is positioned near an intersection area of the first ranges of the tag readers <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>147</b> and <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">However, the foregoing positioning result obtained by the item positioning system <b>1</b> is not accurate enough. Accordingly, the control device <b>10</b> of the item positioning system <b>1</b> adjusts transmitting power of the access signals of the tag readers according to the foregoing positioning result.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this embodiment, only the tag readers <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>147</b> and <b>148</b> are able to access the target tag <b>5</b>; that is, the target tag <b>5</b> is positioned near the tag readers <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>147</b> and <b>148</b>. Therefore, in order to further narrow down the positioning range and get a more accurate positioning result, the control device <b>10</b> decreases transmitting power of the access signals of the tag readers <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>147</b> and <b>148</b> and sets transmitting power of access signals of other tag readers as zero. As a result, only the tag readers <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>147</b> and <b>148</b> transmit access signals again within second ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (<i>b</i>), transmitting power of the access signals of the tag readers <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>147</b> and <b>148</b> are decreased. Therefore, the second ranges are smaller than the original first ranges, i.e., access ranges of the tag readers <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>147</b> and <b>148</b> are further decreased to achieve an objective of more accurately positioning the target tag <b>5</b>. It is assumed that the second ranges of the tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b> are the same, i.e., the access signals of the tag readers <b>141</b> to <b>156</b>, according to the second ranges, are supposed to have the same transmitting power.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (<i>b</i>), the target good is located in the second range of the access signal of the tag reader <b>144</b>. At this point, the target tag <b>5</b> attached to the target good receives the access signal transmitted by the tag reader <b>144</b> and generates a response signal according to the access signal. The tag reader <b>144</b> then generates a successful access signal according to the response signal and transmits the same to the control device <b>10</b>. If the control device <b>10</b> receives the successful access signal sent by the tag reader <b>144</b>, it means that the tag reader <b>144</b> can access the target tag <b>5</b> attached to the target good. That is, the target tag <b>5</b> is in the second range of the access signal transmitted by the tag reader device <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If the control device <b>10</b> does not receive the successful access signals sent back to the tag readers <b>143</b>, <b>147</b> and <b>148</b>, it means that the target good is outside the second ranges of the access signals transmitted by the tag readers <b>143</b>, <b>147</b> and <b>148</b>. Therefore, the target tag <b>5</b> attached to the target good does not receive the access signals transmitted by the tag readers <b>143</b>, <b>147</b> and <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As mentioned above, the control device <b>10</b> only receives the successful access signal from the tag reader <b>144</b>. Hence, the position of the target tag <b>5</b> is narrowed down to the second range of the tag reader <b>144</b> by the item position system <b>1</b>. Accordingly, the item positioning system <b>1</b> can accurately position a correct position of the target good currently located in the convenience store.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this embodiment, the tag reader can be provided in a general electric socket and coupled to a transforming device via the power line network. The tag reader <b>141</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is taken as an example to be discussed below. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>a</i>), the tag reader device <b>141</b> comprises a tag reader module <b>1412</b> and a power line network transmitting/receiving module <b>1414</b>. The tag reader module <b>1412</b> comprises an antenna <b>1413</b>. The power line network transmitting/receiving module <b>1414</b> is coupled to the transforming device <b>12</b> via the power line network. The transforming device <b>12</b> is coupled to the control device <b>10</b> via Ethernet, and hence a control signal generated by the control device is first transmitted to the transforming device <b>12</b> via Ethernet. After the signal format of the control signal is converted by the transforming device, the control signal is then transmitted to the transmitting/receiving module <b>1414</b> via the power line network. The tag reader module <b>1412</b> receives the control signal from the power line network transmitting/receiving module <b>1414</b> and sends an access signal via the antenna <b>1413</b> according to the control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, when receiving the response signal of the target tag <b>5</b> via the antenna <b>1413</b>, the tag reader module <b>1412</b> shall generate a successful access signal and transmit the successful access signal from the power line network transmitting/receiving module <b>1414</b> to the transforming device <b>12</b> via the power line network. After the signal format of the successful access signal is converted by the transforming device <b>12</b>, the successful access signal is transmitted to the control device <b>10</b> via Ethernet. Upon receiving the successful access signal, the control device <b>10</b> adjusts transmitting power of the access signal sent from the antenna <b>1413</b> of the tag reader module <b>1412</b> according to the successful access signal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In practice, the power line network transmitting/receiving module <b>1414</b> is coupled to the tag reader module <b>1412</b> via a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), a universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART), an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) or a Universal Serial Bus (USB).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The tag reader can be coupled to the transforming device via Ethernet. The tag reader <b>142</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is taken as an example to be discussed below. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>b</i>), the tag reader <b>142</b> comprises a tag reader module <b>1422</b> and an Ethernet transmitting/receiving module <b>1424</b>. The tag reader <b>1422</b> comprises an antenna <b>1423</b>. The Ethernet transmitting/receiving module <b>1424</b> is coupled to a transforming device <b>13</b> via Ethernet, and the transforming device <b>13</b> is coupled to the control device <b>10</b> via Ethernet as well. Therefore, the control signal generated by the control device <b>10</b> is transmitted from the transmit device <b>13</b> to the Ethernet transmitting/receiving module <b>1424</b> via the Ethernet. The tag reader module <b>1422</b> then receives the control signal from the Ethernet transmitting/receiving module <b>1424</b> and sends an access signal via the antenna <b>1423</b> according to the control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, when the response signal of the target tag <b>5</b> via the antenna <b>1423</b> is received, the tag reader module <b>1422</b> generates a successful access signal and sends the same from the Ethernet transmitting/receiving module <b>1424</b> to the control device <b>10</b> through the transforming device <b>13</b> via the Ethernet. When the control device <b>10</b> receives the successful access signal, the control device <b>8</b> adjusts transmitting power of the access signal sent from the antenna <b>1423</b> of the tag reader module <b>1422</b> according to the successful access signal.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In practice, the Ethernet transmitting/receiving module <b>1424</b> is coupled to the tag reader module <b>1422</b> via an SPI, a UART, an I2C or a USB.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An item positioning method is provided according to a second embodiment of the present invention, so as to determine a position of a target item having a target tag and a plurality of tag readers corresponding to a plurality of positions within a space. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a flow chart of the item positioning method.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this embodiment, the item positioning method begins with Step S<b>10</b> of controlling each tag reader to generate and transmit an access signal within a first range. In Step S<b>12</b>, whether tag readers receive a response signal from the target tag is determined. Two outcomes are possible: tag readers receive the response signal or tag readers do not receive a response signal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When a certain tag reader does not receive the response signal, Step S<b>16</b> is executed. Specifically, in Step S<b>16</b>, it is determined that the tag reader can not access the target tag. Accordingly, no further processing is performed with respect to that tag reader. When the tag reader receives the response signal, Step S<b>14</b> is executed. In Step S<b>14</b>, whether the number of tag readers receiving the response signal is smaller than a predetermined value is further determined.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the determination result of Step S<b>14</b> is yes, i.e., when the number of tag readers receiving the response signal is smaller than the predetermined value, it means that the positioning range is accurate enough, and Step S<b>18</b> is executed. In Step S<b>18</b>, the position of the target item is determined according to the positions of the tag readers having received the response signal. Note that this could be based on a single tag reader.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the determination result of Step S<b>14</b> is no, i.e., when the number of tag readers receiving the response signals is not smaller than the predetermined value, it means that the positioning range is not accurate enough, and Step S<b>20</b> is executed. In Step S<b>20</b>, transmitting power of the access signals of the tag readers having received the response signals is decreased. Step S<b>10</b> is then executed again. In Step S<b>10</b>, the transmitting power of the tag readers that received the response signals is adjusted to transmit access signals within second ranges. That is, the transmitting power of the access signals is decreased. Hence, the second ranges of the access signals of the tag readers are smaller than the first ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In conclusion, an item positioning system according to the present invention determines whether a plurality of tag readers provided at different positions within a same space can access a target tag. Accordingly, the item positioning system according to the present invention optionally controls transmitting power of the tag readers to narrow down a possible range and a position of the target tag. Compared to the prior art, the item positioning system can correctly position the position of the target tag and determine a current position of the target item. Therefore, the item position system may be particularly useful for, e.g., purposes of searching for positions of goods in a shop or books in a library.</p>
