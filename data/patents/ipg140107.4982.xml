<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE(S) TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention claims priority of Korean Patent Application Nos. 10-2007-0128750 and 10-2008-0026807, filed on Dec. 12, 2007 and Mar. 24, 2008, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a link adaptation method and apparatus in wireless communication system; and, more particularly, to a method for measuring received signal strength and a method for controlling a transmission parameter according to the measured received signal strength.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This work was supported by the IT R&#x26;D program for MIC/IITA [2006-S-014-02, &#x201c;Development of IEEE 802.11n Modem &#x26; RF Chip-sets with Data Rate 200 Mbps&#x201d;].</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a wireless communication system, a channel state is changed by causes such as interference, noise, propagation route, and attenuation to thereby deteriorate the performance of the wireless communication system and make normal communication impossible. Accordingly, a link adaptation method for controlling a transmission parameter according to a wireless channel state and providing communication optimized to the channel state has been studied.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are three conventional link adaptation methods. First, there is an auto rate fallback (ARF) method which is most generally used. The ARF method is a method for sensing packet reception failure through cyclic redundancy checking (CRC) and lowering a transmission speed by one step when a packet reception failure value is higher than a predetermined value. The ARF method can be easily realized but does not follow the change of the channel and is not helpful in entire system throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Second, there is a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) method. The SNR method is applied when finely divided Media Access Control Protocol Data Unit (MAC MPDU) is transmitted by measuring the SNR upon receiving the packet. The SNR method has a fast response speed for channel change but it is complicated to realize hardware to exactly measure the SNR.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Third, there is a method using received signal strength (RSS). Since the received signal strength has linear relationship with the SNR on average, the channel state is estimated by measuring strength of the received signal. Accordingly, a transmitting end can determine and transmit a transmission parameter. Subsequently, a receiving end receives the transmission parameter, measures received signal strength and transmits the received signal strength after link adaptation. These procedures are repeated in this method.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The method using the received signal strength has the fastest response speed through adaptation to the channel change on the basis of a packet unit. However, since the receiving end should measure strength before a signal received through an antenna is amplified, there is a problem that hardware complexity increases by connecting an individual analog-to-digital (ADC) converter prior to an amplifying unit. Also, when a signal exceeding a conversion threshold range or too small signal is inputted, it is difficult to exactly measure the received signal strength.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The advantages, features and aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, which is set forth hereinafter. Therefore, those skilled in the field of this art of the present invention can embody the technological concept and scope of the invention easily. In addition, if it is considered that detailed description on a related art may obscure the points of the present invention, the detailed description will not be provided herein. The preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a receiving end of a wireless communication system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The receiving end includes a received signal strength measuring block <b>108</b> and a transmission parameter control block <b>110</b>. The transmission parameter control block <b>110</b> controls a transmission parameter of a next reverse channel packet to be transmitted based on received signal strength of a forward channel measured in the received signal strength measuring block <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The received signal strength measuring block <b>108</b> includes an amplifying unit <b>100</b>, a digital converting unit <b>102</b>, a measuring unit <b>104</b>, and a gain control unit <b>106</b>. The amplifying unit <b>100</b> includes an amplifier for amplifying a received weak radio signal. The digital converting unit <b>102</b> represents an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for converting an analog signal into a digital signal. The measuring unit <b>104</b> measures strength of the digital signal converted in the digital converting unit <b>102</b>. The gain control unit <b>106</b> controls an amplification gain in the amplifying unit <b>100</b> according to the digital signal strength measured in the measuring unit <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The received signal strength measuring block <b>108</b> calculates the received signal strength of the receiving end based on the digital signal strength measured in the measuring unit <b>104</b> and the amplification gain of the amplifying unit <b>100</b>. That is, since the digital signal strength is measured by performing digital-conversion after summating the amplification gain with the received signal strength, it is possible to reversely figure out the received signal strength based on the acquired digital signal strength and the amplification gain. Accordingly, the signal strength received in the receiving end can be simply measured without adding an individual ADC prior to the amplifying unit <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Since the measured received signal strength shows a channel state changing on time and space by causes such as interference, noise, a propagation route, and attenuation, it is possible to optimize and transmit a transmission parameter such as a transmission speed, a modulation method, and a code rate according to the channel state. The transmission parameter control block <b>110</b> controls the transmission parameter to thereby perform link adaptation on the wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since the amplification gain control procedure of the gain control unit <b>106</b> and the received signal strength measuring procedure of the received signal strength measuring block <b>108</b> can be performed in the middle of receiving a preamble part of the packet, the rest part of the packet is received based on the determined amplification gain and the transmission parameter determined by the measured received signal strength is applied to a case where the receiving end transmits a next packet.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a wireless communication station using a multiple antenna in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

There are an ADC <b>102</b>, the measuring unit <b>104</b> and the gain control unit <b>106</b> between the RF block <b>200</b> and the modem <b>210</b> but its configuration may be changed for the ADC <b>102</b>, the measuring unit <b>104</b> and the gain control unit <b>106</b> to be included in the RF block <b>200</b> or the modem <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the amplifying unit <b>100</b> includes a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) <b>206</b> and a Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA) <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The LNA <b>206</b> is located directly in a side of the RF receiving unit <b>202</b> and amplifies the radio received signal while minimizing noise. It is general that the LNA <b>206</b> controls the amplification gain differently according to the mode of each level such as High, Medium and Low in the gain control unit <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The VGA <b>208</b> amplifies baseband after the signal amplified in the LNA <b>206</b> is converted into a baseband signal. The gain control unit <b>106</b> can control the amplification gain of the VGA <b>208</b>. Also, the gain control unit <b>106</b> can control the amplification gain of the entire receiving end.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The received signal strength measuring procedure of the received packet is performed in the same manner described above.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in Tables 1 or 2, the transmission parameter is controlled by defining the MCS level according to the received signal strength and selecting a proper MCS level according to the measured received signal strength.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the received signal strength calculating step S<b>308</b> based on the digital signal strength and the amplification gain in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Since the digital signal strength is measured by amplifying the received signal at the step S<b>302</b> and performing conversion into digital signal at step S<b>304</b>, reversely, the received signal strength can be calculated based on the digital signal strength and the amplification gain at step S<b>308</b>. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the received signal strength can be calculated by subtracting the amplification gain from the digital signal strength.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The subtracting operation is derived from the operation of adding the amplification gain at the step S<b>302</b> having the signal strength on the basis of dB unit. When the unit of the signal strength is changed, the amplifying step S<b>302</b> may be a multiplying operation. In this case, a dividing operation by the amplification gain is required.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> are flowcharts describing a method for controlling the amplification gain for the digital signal to be within the threshold range in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a signal and a threshold range in accordance with the present invention and shows a digital conversion range, a threshold range, the maximum threshold, and the minimum threshold to be easily recognizable.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a flowchart describing the method for controlling the digital signal to be within the maximum threshold range of conversion in the procedure of calculating the digital signal strength at step S<b>306</b> and controlling the amplification gain.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It is determined at step S<b>502</b> whether the digital signal is higher than the maximum threshold based on the calculated digital signal strength. When the digital signal is higher than the maximum threshold, the amplification gain decreases at step S<b>504</b>. Otherwise, a logic flow goes to a step S<b>506</b> of determining whether the digital signal is higher than the minimum threshold. When the digital signal is lower than the minimum threshold, the amplification gain increases a little at step S<b>508</b>. Otherwise, the amplification gain is determined at step S<b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">That is, the amplification gain is determined in the manner that the digital signal is lower than the maximum threshold and higher than the minimum threshold within the threshold range. Accordingly, the digital signal strength can be exactly measured at step S<b>306</b> by preventing cases that the digital signal is distorted when the digital signal is higher than the maximum threshold of digital conversion and the digital conversion range is not sufficiently applied when the digital signal is lower than the minimum threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A signal is amplified into the determined amplification gain at step S<b>302</b>. These successive procedures are performed in the preamble part of the reception packet as described above and the rest part of the reception packet is amplified into the determined amplification gain.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is checked at step S<b>512</b> whether the gain is controlled at the signal amplifying step S<b>302</b>. When the gain is controlled, the signal is amplified into the controlled gain at step S<b>516</b>. Otherwise, the signal is amplified into the pre-determined initial gain at step S<b>514</b>. When the initial gain is determined, the amplification gain is automatically controlled through the amplification gain controlling step S<b>312</b>. The amplified signal is converted into a digital signal at step S<b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart describing a method for controlling a transmission parameter using an error measurement value in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Error vector magnitude (EVM) showing an error value between an actually transmitted symbol and an ideal reference symbol as a vector size may be used as an error measurement value. EVM will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">An EVM value is measured at the transmission parameter controlling step S<b>310</b> in detail, and can be applied to control the transmission parameter. The transmission parameter is controlled according to the received signal strength at step S<b>600</b> and the EVM is measured in a long training field (LTF) or signal field of the received packet at step S<b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">An EVM feature according to the acquired received signal strength is compared with the measured EVM at step S<b>604</b>. That is, this method exactly corrects the received signal strength measured at the received signal strength calculating step S<b>308</b> through EVM by previously figuring out the level of EVM with respect to the received signal strength according to the feature of the RF block. The measurement result of the EVM feature according to the received signal strength will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">At step S<b>606</b>, the transmission parameter is controlled through the received signal strength corrected by measuring the error such as EVM. Accordingly, the received signal strength can be exactly measured and efficient link adaptation is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart describing a method for controlling a transmission parameter according to an LNA gain mode in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The commercialized RF block divides the LNA gain into one to three modes, e.g., High, Medium and Low, according to the size and the performance of the RF block is changed according to the mode. That is, the EVM feature on the received signal strength is differed according to the LNA gain mode and a related embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, efficient link adaptation is performed by referring to the amplification gain and the current LNA gain mode at step S<b>700</b>, determining an LNA gain mode at step S<b>701</b>, and controlling the transmission parameter according to the determined LNA gain mode at step S<b>702</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The digital signal is divided and inputted into I and Q of a real number part and an imaginary number part, and each size is acquired by taking an absolute value. The digital signal strength is calculated at step S<b>306</b> by taking a log format through a block <b>810</b>. Subsequently, the received signal strength is calculated by subtracting the amplification gain as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the measured received signal strength is stored as 4 different Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values in a readable register. The signal strength is measured for each 0.8 us and becomes 16 samples as a 20 MHz rate reference. When the modem is a reception mode, the received signal is continuously measured. However, when the RSSI value is latched as a readable register in a section of estimating Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) based on Short Training Field (STF), the gain controlling step S<b>312</b> goes to the end. The latched value should be maintained until a next new value is acquired. Signal strength-based carrier sensing is performed in this section. The presence of the signal in the channel is determined based on the received signal strength calculated for the carrier sensing period after comparing with predetermined threshold.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A saturation state determining index value shows whether the digital signal strength is higher than the maximum threshold of digital conversion. The large gain is controlled according to the saturation state determining index value and the small gain is controlled by comparing the measured signal strength with a target amplification gain value. The gain to be amplified by the VGA is determined by subtracting the gain shown in the LNA gain mode from the determined amplification gain.</p>

In other words, the larger the EVM becomes, the larger a gap with the ideal signal gets. Accordingly, the MCS level is defined by decreasing the transmission speed or the code rate.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">For example, when the received signal strength Indicator of the RSSI <b>1920</b> acquired in the received signal strength calculating step S<b>308</b> is 8 and the LNA gain mode determined in the amplification gain controlling step S<b>312</b> is high, the MCS levels are determined to range 9 to 11 properly to the RSSI <b>8</b> and the LNA gain mode high <b>1906</b>. Subsequently, when the value designated by the EVM Indicator is 6 by measuring EVM at the step S<b>602</b>, the corresponding MCS level is searched by comparing an EVM feature <b>1900</b> in the proper LNA gain mode with the EVM Indicator. In this embodiment, MCS level becomes 11 as expressed in a dotted line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.
