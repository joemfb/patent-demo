<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a screw compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The pressure of an intake channel and the pressure of a discharge channel in a screw compressor are determined by both an air charging unit (an atmospheric pressure in a case of sucking atmospheric air) and demand equipment. On the other hand, the pressure of gas obtained immediately before the gas is discharged from a rotor chamber to the discharge channel in the screw compressor is determined by the pressure of the intake channel and a mechanical compression ratio (a volume ratio) of the screw compressor. When the pressure of gas obtained immediately before the gas is discharged from the rotor chamber is higher than the pressure of the discharge chamber, the gas will be expanded at the moment when the gas is delivered into the discharge chamber, resulting in a drop of the pressure. Therefore, all power used for compressing the gas by an amount corresponding to a difference between the pressures will be wasted.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some of the screw compressors comprise a slide valve for changing the degree of opening of a discharge port and have a capability of adjusting the mechanical compression ratio as described in Japanese Patent H09-317676-A, for example. However, the slide valve is complex in structure and significantly increases costs. Moreover, the slide valve has a drawback of requiring complex control.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the problems set forth above, the present invention advantageously provides a screw compressor which is simple in structure and yet capable of changing a mechanical compression ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To overcome at least one or more of the aforementioned problems, the screw compressor according to the present invention, in which a pair of intermeshing male and female screw rotors are housed in a rotor chamber formed in a casing, and a gas sucked from an intake channel is compressed by the screw rotors and discharged from a discharge channel, comprises: a columnar space provided with a functional end face having an opening into an intermediate pressure section, which is an empty space in the rotor chamber and isolatable from both the intake channel and the discharge channel by the screw rotors, and also having an opening into a bypass channel which is communicated with the discharge channel; a piston fittingly inserted in the columnar space and brought into contact with the functional end face, to thereby separate the intermediate pressure section from the bypass channel when the piston is brought into contact with the functional end face; and a pressure detection channel for allowing an area located on an opposite side of the functional end face across the piston in the columnar space to communicate with the discharge channel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the above-described structure, when the pressure of the intermediate pressure section is higher than a discharge pressure, the piston is moved away from the functional end face, thereby allowing the intermediate pressure section to communicate with the bypass channel. As a result, the gas is discharged from the intermediate pressure section into the discharge channel, which means that the mechanical compression ratio of the screw compressor is actually reduced. In this way, the power can be prevented from being wasted on excessive compression. Further, in the structure of this invention, the piston is shifted by means of a difference in pressure between the intermediate pressure section and the discharge channel, to thereby cause the bypass channel to be opened (through connection of the intermediate pressure section to the discharge channel)/closed (through disconnection of the intermediate pressure section from the discharge channel) for changing the mechanical compression ratio. Therefore, the mechanical compression ratio can be changed without the need to provide power and control for driving, and achieved with simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the screw compressor of the present invention may further comprise: a low pressure channel for allowing the area located on the opposite side of the functional end face in the columnar space to communicate with the intake channel; a pressure detection channel valve capable of blocking the pressure detection channel; and a low pressure channel valve capable of blocking the low pressure channel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the above-described structure, the piston can be moved away from the functional end face by blocking the pressure detection channel valve while opening the low pressure channel vale, to maintain the mechanical compression ratio of the screw compressor at a low level regardless of the pressure of the discharge channel. When the pressure of the intermediate pressure section is close in value to the pressure of the discharge channel, the bypass channel might be repeatedly opened and closed at frequent intervals. However, the bypass channel can be continued open by means of the pressure detection channel valve and the low pressure channel valve, which can, in turn, prevent the pressure of the discharge channel from being fluctuated in response to the change in compression ratio of the screw compressor caused by movement of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still further, in the screw compressor of the present invention, the intermediate pressure section may be a region which can be communicated with the discharge channel depending on a rotational position of the screw rotors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to this configuration, because the gas is not recompressed in a working space after the disconnection from the bypass channel in a state where the bypass channel is open, unnecessary compression work is not performed.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show the structure of a screw compressor <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment of this invention. In the screw compressor <b>1</b>, a rotor chamber <b>3</b> formed in a casing <b>2</b> houses a male screw rotor <b>4</b> and a female screw rotor <b>5</b> which are intermeshing with each other, while a motor chamber <b>6</b> also formed in the casing <b>2</b> houses a rotor <b>7</b> and a stator <b>8</b> of a motor for driving the male rotor <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The screw compressor <b>1</b> sucks external air from an intake port <b>9</b> formed in an end region of the motor chamber <b>6</b> and supplies a gas to the rotor chamber <b>3</b> via an intake channel <b>10</b> which connects the rotor chamber <b>3</b> to the motor chamber <b>6</b>. A supply air filter <b>11</b> is installed inside the intake port <b>9</b>. The gas supplied to the rotor chamber <b>3</b> is compressed in a working space defined by the male screw rotor <b>4</b> and the female screw rotor <b>5</b> in the rotor chamber <b>3</b>, discharged through a discharge channel <b>12</b> into a discharge space <b>13</b>, and supplied from a discharge port <b>14</b> to a desired system. Shafts of the screw rotors <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are supported by bearings <b>15</b> to <b>18</b>, and the bearings <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> located on a discharge side are retained in a bearing block <b>19</b> which seals the rotor chamber <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a columnar space <b>20</b>, which opens into a female screw rotor <b>5</b>-side-outer edge region at a discharge-side end region of the rotor chamber <b>3</b>, is formed in the bearing block <b>19</b>. A piston <b>21</b> is fittingly inserted in the columnar space <b>20</b>. On an end face of the casing <b>2</b> closely contacted with the bearing block <b>19</b>, a slot extended from a location faced with the columnar space <b>20</b> in a region outside the rotor chamber <b>3</b> to the outside of the bearing block <b>19</b> is formed to define a bypass channel <b>22</b> through which the columnar space <b>20</b> is communicated with the discharge space <b>13</b>. In addition, the columnar space <b>20</b> is also open, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to an intermediate pressure section which is an empty space in the rotor chamber <b>3</b> where the working space formed by the screw rotors <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> can be isolated from the discharge channel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the piston <b>21</b> can cause an intermediate pressure section of the rotor chamber to be isolated from the bypass channel <b>22</b> by making contact with an end face (a functional end face <b>23</b>) of the columnar space <b>20</b> located on a rotor chamber <b>3</b> side and defined by an end face of the casing <b>2</b>. Moreover, a pressure detection channel <b>24</b> communicating with the discharge space <b>13</b> and functioning to make the pressure of an internal area on the opposite side of the functional end face <b>23</b> in the columnar space <b>20</b> equal to the pressure of the discharge space <b>13</b> and thus the pressure of the discharge channel <b>12</b> is formed on the opposite side of the functional end face <b>23</b> in the columnar space <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The pressure of the intake channel <b>10</b> is equal to that of outside air, while the pressure of the discharge space <b>13</b> and the discharge channel <b>12</b> is equal to a setting pressure of demand equipment. The pressure of the intermediate pressure section is determined both from a volume ratio (of, for example, Vi=2.0) between a volume of the working space obtained at the moment when the working space is isolated from the intake channel <b>10</b> and a volume of the working space obtained at the moment when the working space is opened to the columnar space <b>20</b> and from the pressure of the intake channel <b>10</b>. It should be noted that a pressure in the rotor chamber <b>3</b> is known to be computable assuming that the pressure is polytropic change.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the pressure of the intermediate pressure section in the rotor chamber <b>3</b> is lower than that of the discharge space <b>13</b>, the gas flows into the rotor chamber <b>3</b> from the discharge space <b>13</b> through the bypass channel <b>22</b> and the columnar space <b>20</b>. At this time, the pressure of an area on a functional end face <b>23</b> side of the columnar space <b>20</b> becomes slightly lower than that of an area on the other side of the columnar space <b>20</b> across the piston <b>21</b> due to a pressure loss in both the bypass channel <b>22</b> and the columnar space <b>20</b>. As a result, the piston <b>21</b> is shifted toward the rotor chamber <b>3</b> and brought into contact with the functional end face <b>23</b>, to thereby isolate the bypass channel <b>22</b> from the rotor chamber <b>3</b>. The isolation places the screw compressor <b>1</b> under a condition the same as that of a conventional screw compressor including neither the columnar space <b>20</b> nor the bypass channel <b>22</b>, and allows the screw compressor <b>1</b> to compress the gas at the ratio (of Vi=3.0, for example) between the volume of the working space obtained at the moment when the working space is isolated from the intake channel <b>10</b> and the volume of the working space obtained at the moment when the working space is opened to the discharge channel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the pressure of the intermediate pressure section in the rotor chamber <b>3</b> is higher than that of the discharge space <b>13</b>, a difference between the pressures causes the piston <b>21</b> to move away from the functional end face <b>23</b>. As a result, the gas flows into the discharge space <b>13</b> from the intermediate pressure section through the columnar space <b>20</b> and the bypass channel <b>22</b>. In the screw compressor <b>1</b>, the working space moves according as the screw rotors <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> rotate. While the working space is opened to the columnar space <b>20</b>, however, the gas is discharged into the discharge space <b>13</b> by an amount corresponding to a decrease in volume of the working space so that compression work is not performed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the intermediate pressure section which is in communication with the columnar space <b>20</b> can be also communicated with the discharge channel <b>12</b> depending on a rotational position of the female rotor <b>5</b>. This means that once the working space is opened to the columnar space <b>20</b>, the compression work is not performed even after the working space is isolated from the columnar space <b>20</b>, which prevents energy from being wastefully consumed. In other words, isolation of the piston <b>21</b> from the functional end face <b>23</b> has an effect the same as that obtained when the discharge channel <b>12</b> is actually enlarged, and reduces the mechanical compression ratio of the screw compressor <b>1</b> to Vi=2.0.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a screw compressor <b>1</b><i>a </i>according to a second embodiment of the present invention. It should be noted that, in the second embodiment, components identical to those of the first embodiment are designated by the same reference numerals as those of the first embodiment, and descriptions related to these components will not be repeated. The screw compressor <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the second embodiment is provided, between a first columnar space <b>20</b> and the discharge channel <b>12</b> which are arranged in a way identical to that of the first embodiment, with a second columnar space <b>20</b><i>a </i>into which a second piston <b>21</b><i>a </i>is fittingly inserted. In the casing <b>2</b>, a slot extended from a location faced with the second columnar space <b>20</b><i>a </i>and opened to the discharge channel <b>12</b> is formed to define a second bypass channel <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The second columnar space <b>20</b><i>a</i>, the piston <b>21</b><i>a</i>, and the bypass channel <b>22</b><i>a </i>have the same effect as that obtained by the first columnar space <b>20</b>, the piston <b>21</b>, and the bypass channel <b>22</b>, but provide a different volume ratio (of Vi=2.5, for example) when the rotor chamber <b>3</b> is connected to the bypass channel <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the second embodiment, because an optimum volume ratio is automatically selected from three volume ratios (of Vi=3.0, 2.5, and 2.0), a power loss resulting from a situation where the screw compressor <b>1</b><i>a </i>excessively compresses the gas to a pressure higher than a necessary pressure for demand equipment can be effectively reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a screw compressor <b>31</b> according to a third embodiment of the present invention. In the screw compressor <b>31</b> of the third embodiment, a male screw rotor <b>34</b> and a female screw rotor <b>35</b> which are intermeshing with each other are housed in a rotor chamber <b>33</b> formed in a casing <b>32</b>, and a gas taken in from an intake channel <b>36</b> is discharged into a discharge channel <b>37</b>. The discharge channel <b>37</b> is directly connected to an external discharge pipe arrangement <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, in the casing <b>32</b>, a columnar space <b>39</b> opening into an end face of the rotor chamber <b>33</b> on the discharge side is formed in such a manner that the columnar space <b>39</b> is allowed to communicate with the intermediate pressure section which can be isolated from the discharge channel <b>37</b> by the screw rotors <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>. Still further, in the columnar space <b>39</b>, a functional end face <b>40</b> having an opening into the intermediate pressure section also has an opening into a bypass channel <b>41</b> formed at a position radially outside the rotor chamber <b>33</b> in the casing <b>32</b>, to thereby allow indirect connection between the intermediate pressure section and the bypass channel <b>41</b>. Because a piston <b>42</b> is fittingly inserted in the columnar space <b>39</b>, the intermediate pressure section can be isolated from the bypass channel <b>41</b> when the piston <b>42</b> is brought into close contact with the functional end face <b>40</b>. The bypass channel <b>41</b> is in communication with the discharge pipe arrangement <b>38</b> and thus the discharge channel <b>37</b> via a bypass pipe arrangement <b>43</b> externally provided to the casing <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Moreover, the screw compressor <b>31</b> of this embodiment includes a pressure detection channel <b>44</b> that includes an external pipe arrangement for allowing an area located on the opposite side of the functional end face <b>40</b> in the columnar space <b>39</b> to be communicated with the discharge channel <b>37</b> through the discharge pipe arrangement <b>38</b> and the bypass pipe arrangement <b>43</b>, and also includes a low pressure channel <b>45</b> that includes an external pipe arrangement for allowing the area located on the opposite side of the functional end face <b>40</b> in the columnar space <b>39</b> to be communicated with the intake channel <b>36</b>. The pressure detection channel <b>44</b> is equipped with a pressure detection channel valve <b>46</b> capable of blocking the pressure detection channel <b>44</b>, while the low pressure channel <b>45</b> is equipped with a low pressure channel valve <b>47</b> capable of blocking the low pressure channel <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this embodiment, by closing the pressure detection channel valve <b>46</b> while opening the low pressure channel valve <b>47</b>, the pressure of an area located on a functional end face <b>40</b> side in the columnar space <b>39</b> is always kept higher than the pressure of an internal area on the other side across the piston <b>42</b> in the columnar space <b>39</b> regardless of the pressure of the discharge channel <b>37</b>, and the bypass channel <b>41</b> can be thus maintained in communication with the intermediate pressure section of the rotor chamber <b>33</b>. In this way, when the pressure of the discharge channel <b>37</b> fluctuates above and below the pressure of the intermediate pressure section in the rotor chamber <b>33</b>, the piston <b>42</b> can be prevented from being frequently shifted, thereby repeatedly connecting and disconnecting the intermediate pressure section to the bypass channel <b>41</b>. Thus, the discharge pressure can be accordingly prevented from fluctuating. This operation is preferably performed in such a manner that both an intake pressure and a discharge pressure of the screw compressor <b>31</b> are detected, and a ratio between the detected pressures is maintained within a predetermined range through program control.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be noted that the screw compressor according to the present invention may be applied to a refrigeration unit in which a compressor, a condenser, an expansion means, an evaporator, and other components are installed in a circulating channel through which a refrigerant flows.</p>
