<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An integrated circuit in which a logic circuit and a memory circuit are mounted over the same semiconductor substrate, what is called a composite circuit, has a feature in that the logic circuit and the memory circuit exist over the same substrate. Accordingly, not only the integration efficiency is improved simply because the layout within the short distance is possible, but also the operation speed is increased because a wiring between circuits is short.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when a logic circuit and a memory circuit having a capacitive element are mounted over the same semiconductor substrate, it is usually necessary to use a structure, which is not used when the logic circuit is formed, in order to form a capacitive element which is provided in the memory circuit and is used to store the data. For example, in the case of a trench type capacitive element, a technique of forming a deep groove with a depth of several microns or more in a semiconductor substrate and forming a capacitive element in the groove has been reported. However, not only the trench opening size decreases with miniaturization of elements, but also the depth steadily increases in order to ensure the capacitance. As a result, the degree of difficulty in the manufacturing process is increasing extremely.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, also in the case of a stacked capacitive element, a fin type or a cylinder type is adopted for the stacked structure in order to realize the desired capacitance. In a so-called COB structure (capacitor over bit line structure) in which a capacitive element is formed over a bit line, it is necessary to increase the height of the capacitor in order to ensure the capacitance of the capacitive element.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Currently, there are various kinds of proposals regarding a semiconductor device in which a wiring layer provided between a lower capacitor wiring and an upper capacitor wiring of a capacitive element is a single layer (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NOS. 2000-003960 and 2005-101647).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Ensuring the height of a capacitive element by using a stacked structure increases the distance between a wiring of a lower capacitor portion and a wiring of an upper capacitor portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, since the contact height from a first wiring layer to a diffusion layer increases in a logic circuit portion, the level of difficulty is increased in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, since the electric resistance of a layer in which the capacitive element is formed increases, that is, since the parasitic resistance also increases, the operation speed is decreased in terms of performance.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, when designing a logic circuit in the case where a memory circuit and a logic circuit are formed over the same semiconductor substrate as described above, it is necessary to perform the design in which the parasitic resistance and the like are considered, in consideration of the forming of a capacitive element. This means that in the cases where the same logic circuit is designed, a design parameter needs to be changed according to whether or not a capacitive element exists over the same semiconductor substrate, especially according to the difference of wiring resistance or its parasitic capacitance. Accordingly, in spite of the circuits being completely the same, the design work should be performed again only because a logic circuit is formed simultaneously with a capacitive element. In some cases, the operation speed of a circuit may drop or the operation margin may be reduced due to being provided together with a capacitive element and as a result, the circuit may not operate in the end.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As an example of the proposal for reducing the contact height of a logic circuit portion, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2007-201101 may be mentioned first. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2007-201101 discloses that neither a dedicated process nor a dedicated facility for forming a wiring, which is called a plate line for connection between upper electrodes, is needed by connecting upper electrodes of capacitive elements to each other with an upper capacitor wiring formed at the same height as a wiring existing in a logic circuit portion and that the thicknesses of upper and lower layers of the capacitive element can be ensured and the aspect of a contact (logic contact) of the logic circuit portion can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Regarding the proposal disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2007-201101, the contact height may be reduced, but a reduction in the contact height of the logic circuit portion is equivalent to one layer of the wiring height, which is restrictive. In order to increase the capacitance of a capacitive element in this structure, it is necessary to increase the height of the capacitive element. In this case, however, the logic contact height also increases with an increase in capacitance height. As a result, not only the level of difficulty in contact manufacture increases, but also the resistance of the logic contact increases. Moreover, although a copper wiring material containing copper as a main component is preferable as a multi-layered wiring material of the logic circuit portion, a wiring other than the copper wiring material, that is, a tungsten (W) wiring with high resistance is used. In addition, the structure of a wiring layer in which a capacitive element exists is different from the wiring structure of a normal logic circuit due to the existence of the capacitive element. That is, in the layer in which a capacitive element exists, the logic contact height is large and the resistance is also high. As a result, there are needed dedicated design parameters which are not compatible with parameters for design of a normal logic circuit in which all wiring layers are formed of a low-resistance copper material.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the proposal disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787, a first layer wiring is formed in an intermediate portion of a capacitive element in order to reduce the contact height. In this case, the contact height of a logic circuit portion may be reduced similar to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2007-201101. However, even if the method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787 is used, the structure of the logic circuit portion becomes a different structure from the structure in which a capacitive element is not provided because the structure of the logic circuit portion depends on the structure of a capacitive element.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, even if the structure disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787 is used, it is necessary to use dedicated values as the design parameters of a logic circuit when the logic circuit is provided together with a memory circuit. Moreover, also in the method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787, it is necessary to form a high capacitor by increasing the thickness of an interlayer insulating layer in order to ensure the capacitance of the capacitive element, similar to the method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2007-201101. In addition, since not all wirings at the memory circuit side are copper wirings, all multi-layered wirings at the logic circuit side cannot be copper wirings. Also in this case, the level of difficulty when forming a contact increases or the contact resistance increases, similar to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2007-201101. Moreover, in a multi-layered wiring of the latest logic circuit, a low dielectric constant interlayer insulating layer, such as an SiOCH layer, is introduced for at least narrow-pitch local wirings located in a lower layer. Since the low dielectric constant interlayer insulating layer (Low-k layer) has a limitation in thermal resistance, it is not possible to apply a W wiring using CVD-W with high growing temperature, for example. For this reason, Low-k/Cu wirings cannot be formed in all layers of the multi-layered wiring at the logic circuit side. As a result, there are needed dedicated design parameters which are not compatible with parameters for design of a normal logic circuit in which all wiring layers are formed in the Low-k/Cu structure.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Moreover, in the first or third embodiment disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787, a structure is shown in which an insulating layer of a silicon oxide layer is formed right above a copper layer of an upper layer wiring or upper electrode. The silicon oxide layer does not have diffusion resistance to the copper layer. Accordingly, in the structure disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787, copper (Cu) is diffused into the insulating layer and this deteriorates the reliability of the insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover, the silicon oxide layer is mainly formed by oxidation of source gas. Accordingly, when the silicon oxide layer is formed under the conditions in which Cu of the wiring surface is exposed, there are concerns about an increase in wiring resistance caused by oxidation of Cu, a reduction in adhesiveness with the formed silicon oxide layer, a drop in reliability occurring due to those described above, and the like. As described above, in the method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787, there is an advantage in that it is not necessary to provide an etching stopper layer, but it is thought that there is a disadvantage, on the contrary, in that the reliability deteriorates in the structure disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Those described up to now may be shown like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 33B</figref>. As represented by Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787, in the related art, a memory circuit portion <b>101</b> has a structure (add-on structure) in which a multi-layered wiring portion <b>103</b> is provided over a capacitive element <b>90</b>. Accordingly, in a logic circuit portion <b>102</b>, a wiring portion (lift-up wiring portion <b>104</b>) for lifting up the multi-layered wiring portion <b>103</b> according to the height of the capacitive element <b>90</b> is needed in order to ensure the capacitance. As a result, there has been a problem that the multi-layered wiring structure becomes thick.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, there is provided a semiconductor device including: a semiconductor substrate; a multi-layered wiring structure which is formed over the semiconductor substrate and in which a plurality of wiring layers, each of which is formed by a wiring and an insulating layer, are laminated; and a capacitive element having a lower electrode, a capacitor insulating layer, and an upper electrode which is embedded in the multi-layered wiring structure, wherein at least two or more of the wiring layers are provided between a lower capacitor wiring connected to the lower electrode and an upper capacitor wiring connected to the upper electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Due to the structure in which a capacitive element is embedded in a multi-layered wiring structure and at least two more wiring layers are provided between lower and upper capacitor wirings of the capacitive element, it is possible to suppress an increase in the thickness of the multi-layered wiring structure while ensuring the capacitance of the capacitive element.</p>

<?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The invention will be now described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many alternative embodiments can be accomplished using the teachings of the present invention and that the invention is not limited to the embodiments illustrated for explanatory purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Before describing an embodiment of the present invention in detail, definitions of terms in the embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">An insulating layer is a layer (interlayer insulating layer) for separating wiring materials from each other by insulation, for example. A low dielectric constant insulating layer refers to a material whose relative permittivity is lower than that of a silicon oxide layer (relative permittivity of 4.5) in order to reduce the capacitance between multi-layered wirings for connections between semiconductor elements. Particularly, examples of a porous insulating layer include a porous silica material which has a low relative permittivity by making a silicon oxide layer porous, a hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) layer, and a material which has a low relative permittivity by making SiOCH or SiOC (for example, Black Diamond&#x2122; or Aurora&#x2122;) porous. As this insulating layer, it is also possible to use a layer obtained by making the above layers have lower dielectric constants.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the embodiments, a metal wiring material and a contact plug material mainly have Cu as a main component. In order to improve the reliability of a metal wiring material, a metal element other than Cu may be included in a member formed of Cu, or a metal element other than Cu may be formed at an upper surface, side surface, or the like of Cu. Moreover, in some of the embodiments, a contact plug material which connects a first layer wiring with a MOSFET formed over a silicon substrate mainly has tungsten (W) as a main component. In this case, a pre-metal insulating layer (PMD) which separates the first layer wiring from the MOSFET formed over the silicon substrate by insulation is a silicon oxide layer excellent in thermal resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A barrier metal layer is a conductive layer which serves as a barrier against diffusion of copper and which covers side and bottom surfaces of wirings in order to prevent a metal element, which forms a wiring or a contact plug, from being diffused to an interlayer insulating layer or a lower layer. For example, when a wiring is formed of a metal element having Cu as a main component, high-melting-point metals, such as tantalum (Ta), tantalum nitride (TaN), titanium (Ti), titanium nitride (TiN), tungsten carbon nitride (WCN), and ruthenium (Ru), their nitrides, or a laminated layer thereof is used. In addition, the metal layer is also used as a barrier metal of a contact plug which uses tungsten as a main component.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A damascene wiring is an embedded wiring formed by embedding a metal wiring material in a groove of an interlayer insulating layer formed beforehand and then removing surplus metal, which is not located in the groove, by CMP, for example. When the damascene wiring is formed of Cu, a wiring structure is generally used in which the side surface and outer periphery of a Cu wiring are covered by a barrier metal and the upper surface of the Cu wiring is covered by an insulating barrier layer (also referred to as a cap layer) with resistance to copper diffusion (Cu barrier property).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) method is a technique of flattening the unevenness of the wafer surface, which occurs in the process of forming multi-layered wirings, by polishing the wafer surface by bringing the wafer surface into contact with a rotating polishing pad while pouring the polishing solution to the wafer surface. Particularly, the damascene method is used to obtain the flat wiring surface by embedding metal in a wiring groove or a via hole and then removing a surplus metal portion.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A semiconductor substrate is a substrate formed with a semiconductor device. Examples of the semiconductor substrate include not only a single crystal silicon substrate but also a silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate and a substrate for manufacturing a thin film transistor (TFT) and liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A hard mask is an insulating layer which is laminated over an interlayer insulating layer to protect it when it is difficult to directly perform plasma etching or CMP due to a drop in mechanical strength or a drop in process resistance caused by a reduction in the dielectric constant of the interlayer insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The plasma CVD method is, for example, a technique of supplying a gaseous material into a decompressed reaction chamber continuously, exciting molecules by plasma energy, and forming a continuous layer over a substrate by gas reaction or substrate surface reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Examples of the PVD method include not only the normal sputtering method but also high-directivity sputtering methods for improvement in embedding characteristic, improvement in the quality of layers, or improvement in uniformity of the layer thickness within the wafer surface, such as a long slow sputtering method, a collimated sputtering method, and an ionized sputtering method. When sputtering an alloy, a metal other than a main component is contained beforehand below the solid solubility limit within the metal target, so that the formed metal layer can serve as an alloy layer. In the present invention, the PVD method may be used mainly when forming a Cu seed layer in forming a damascene Cu wiring or when forming a barrier metal layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The multi-layered wiring structure is a structure in which a wiring layer formed by the third layer wiring <b>35</b> and the interlayer insulating layer <b>31</b> of the third layer, a wiring layer formed by the fourth layer wiring <b>45</b> and the interlayer insulating layer <b>41</b> of the fourth layer, a wiring layer formed by the fifth layer wiring <b>55</b> and the interlayer insulating layer <b>51</b> of the fifth layer, and a wiring layer formed by the sixth layer wiring <b>65</b> and the interlayer insulating layer <b>61</b> of the sixth layer are laminated, for example. In the multi-layered wiring structure, different wiring layers may be further laminated. In the first embodiment, the multi-layered wiring structure is a multi-layered wiring structure of a typical logic circuit region. In the multi-layered wiring structure of the logic circuit region, it is common that the thickness of each wiring or wiring layer which forms a multi-layered wiring layer located at the upper layer is larger than that of a multi-layered wiring layer located at the lower layer. In the first embodiment, however, the thickness of each wiring or wiring layer which forms the multi-layered wiring layer is not particularly limited. Like the related art, the thicknesses of some or all wiring layers or wirings may be equal, or the thicknesses of wiring layers or wirings may increase from the lower layer toward the upper layer.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Moreover, at least in a region where a capacitive element is provided, the heights (thicknesses) of wiring layers and the heights (thicknesses) of wirings may be equal. That is, in a region where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is embedded, for example, the thicknesses of the third layer wiring <b>35</b>, fourth layer wiring <b>45</b>, and fifth layer wiring <b>55</b> are equal, and the thicknesses of the third, fourth, and fifth wiring layers in which the wirings are provided may be equal. In addition, the thickness of a wiring layer or wiring in a region where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is not embedded may be equal to or different from that of a wiring layer or wiring in the region where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is embedded. In the first embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, the thicknesses of the second layer wiring <b>25</b>, third layer wiring <b>35</b>, . . . , sixth layer wiring <b>65</b> are equal, and the thicknesses of wiring layers in which the wirings are provided are also equal. In the first embodiment, the thicknesses of wirings and wiring layers are assumed to be the thicknesses in the normal direction of the silicon substrate <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In this multi-layered wiring structure, wiring layers of the memory circuit region and wiring layers of the logic circuit region are provided at the same layers. That is, the third layer wiring layer, . . . , fifth layer wiring layer of the memory circuit region and the third layer wiring layer, . . . , fifth layer wiring layer of the logic circuit region are the same layers, respectively. In the first embodiment, the capacitive element <b>90</b> is embedded in the multi-layered wiring structure of the memory circuit region. In addition, the capacitive element <b>90</b> is provided over at least two or more wiring layers. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain the desired capacitance by changing the number of wiring layers, through which the capacitive element <b>90</b> passes, without changing the number of wiring layers of the multi-layered wiring structure. In addition, as described above, the multi-layered wirings of the memory circuit region where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is embedded and the multi-layered wirings of the logic circuit region where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is embedded are formed in the same layers. Accordingly, it is not necessary to additionally provide multi-layered wirings of the logic circuit region. As a result, the compact multi-layered wiring structure can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Since the capacitive element <b>90</b> is embedded in the multi-layered wiring structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, the lower electrode layer <b>91</b> is provided to pass through the interlayer insulating layer <b>51</b> of the fifth layer, the interlayer insulating layer <b>41</b> of the fourth layer, and the interlayer insulating layer <b>31</b> of the third layer from above, and a recessed portion is formed in the multi-layered wiring structure. The capacitor insulating layer <b>92</b> is formed to be in contact with the bottom and side surfaces of the recessed portion. In addition, the upper electrode layer <b>93</b> is formed to be in contact with the capacitor insulating layer <b>92</b>. By providing the lower electrode layer <b>91</b>, the capacitor insulating layer <b>92</b>, and the upper electrode layer <b>93</b> as described above, the capacitive element <b>90</b> is embedded in the multi-layered wiring structure. In addition, the capacitive element <b>90</b> is embedded in the multi-layered wiring structure. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, in the interlayer insulating layer <b>51</b> of the fifth layer provided with the upper electrode layer <b>93</b> of the capacitive element <b>90</b>, the fifth layer wiring <b>55</b> as an upper capacitor wiring connected to the upper electrode layer <b>93</b> is provided over the upper electrode layer <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The position where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is embedded in the multi-layered wiring structure is not particularly limited as long as at least two or more wiring layers are provided between the lower capacitor wiring (second layer wiring <b>25</b>) and the upper capacitor wiring (fifth layer wiring <b>55</b> as a plate line wiring). The capacitive element <b>90</b> may be formed in the multi-layered wiring layer located at the lower layer which is being most miniaturized.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, the capacitive element <b>90</b> of the memory circuit region where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is provided is embedded in the multi-layered wiring structure. Accordingly, in the first embodiment, in the multi-layered wiring structure, a column decode wiring <b>18</b> is formed in an upper layer of the lower capacitor wiring. Since one or both of a row decode wiring <b>17</b> and the column decode wiring <b>18</b> are provided in the same layer as the capacitive element <b>90</b> or in the same layer as the lower capacitor wiring, it becomes unnecessary to use the upper wiring. Accordingly, the number of wiring layers of the memory circuit region can be reduced. In this case, the upper layer of the memory circuit region may be used for wirings of the logic circuit region or for connection between the circuit regions. As a result, the chip area can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Moreover, in the multi-layered wiring structure, the thicknesses of different wiring layers, for example, the thicknesses of the third and fourth wiring layers may be set to be equal. In addition, the thickness of a wiring layer of the memory circuit region where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is provided may be set to be equal to that of a wiring layer of the logic circuit region where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is not provided. In addition, the capacitive element <b>90</b> may be embedded in the multi-layered wiring structure without changing the thickness of the wiring layer of the multi-layered wiring structure. In this case, the desired capacitance of the capacitive element <b>90</b> can be obtained by the wiring layer, through which the capacitive element <b>90</b> passes, without increasing the thickness of the wiring layer of the multi-layered wiring structure.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Next, a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device according to the first embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> show a substrate with a structure after formation of a MOS transistor <b>9</b> and the second layer wiring <b>25</b>, which has been generated by using a typical method of forming an integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The semiconductor device according to the first embodiment further includes a first diffusion layer (diffusion layer <b>7</b>) formed near the surface of the silicon substrate <b>5</b>, a second diffusion layer (diffusion layer <b>7</b>) formed near the surface of the silicon substrate <b>5</b>, a gate dielectric layer provided in the silicon substrate <b>5</b> between the first diffusion layer (diffusion layer <b>7</b>) and the second diffusion layer (diffusion layer <b>7</b>), and a gate electrode <b>8</b> provided over the gate dielectric layer. Moreover, in the semiconductor device according to the first embodiment, a field effect transistor (MOS transistor <b>9</b>) is formed by the silicon substrates <b>5</b>, the first diffusion layer (diffusion layer <b>7</b>), the second diffusion layer (diffusion layer <b>7</b>), the gate dielectric layer, and the gate electrode <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">It is preferable that the gate dielectric layer of the MOS transistor <b>9</b> formed over the silicon substrate <b>5</b> is a high dielectric constant gate dielectric layer. For example, a high dielectric constant gate dielectric layer containing a silicon oxynitride, such as SiON, or Hf, such as an Hf oxynitride, may be used as the high dielectric constant gate dielectric layer. Specifically, a high dielectric constant insulating layer in which an Hf oxide or an Hf silicate is contained or in which nitrogen is introduced into the Hf oxide or Hf silicate may be used. The gate dielectric layer may be a single layer or may be a multi-layer including the single layers.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Moreover, in a gate electrode material, polysilicon or its upper surface layer is covered by metal silicide, such as Ni, Co, Ti, and Pt. In addition, a metal gate electrode containing Ti, Ta, Al, or conductive nitrides thereof in a part of the gate electrode may be used. Particularly in the case of a metal gate electrode, not only an effect of improving the driving current of a transistor in a logic portion is obtained, but also an effect of reducing the resistance of a word line of a DRAM portion is obtained because the metal gate electrode forms the word line of the DRAM portion. Accordingly, by combination with the eDRAM structure in which a capacitive element portion is embedded in a multi-layered wiring layer, the operation can be performed at higher speed.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The MOS transistor <b>9</b> may be of an N or P type. In addition, an N type transistor and a P type transistor may be formed over the same silicon substrate <b>5</b>. The diffusion layer <b>7</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> indicates a first diffusion layer and a second diffusion layer, one of the first and second diffusion layers is a source diffusion layer, and the other one is a drain diffusion layer. Moreover, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, reference numeral <b>1</b> denotes an insulating layer between contact layers, reference numeral <b>2</b> denotes an etch stop layer, reference numeral <b>3</b> denotes a contact barrier metal layer, reference numeral <b>4</b> denotes a contact plug, reference numeral <b>5</b> denotes a silicon (Si) substrate, reference numeral <b>6</b> denotes an element separation shallow trench isolation (STI), reference numeral <b>7</b> denotes a diffusion layer, and reference numeral <b>8</b> denotes a gate electrode. In addition, reference numeral <b>11</b> denotes an interlayer insulating layer of a first layer, reference numeral <b>13</b> denotes a first layer wiring barrier metal layer, reference numeral <b>15</b> denotes a first layer wiring, reference numeral <b>20</b> denotes a cap layer of a first layer wiring, reference numeral <b>23</b> denotes a second layer wiring barrier metal layer, reference numeral <b>25</b> denotes a second layer wiring, and reference numeral <b>30</b> denotes a cap layer of a second layer wiring. In addition, a bit line <b>19</b> is formed simultaneously with the first layer wiring <b>15</b> and serves as a bit line in a memory circuit portion.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition, since the bit line <b>19</b> is formed in the same layer as the first layer wiring <b>15</b>, a wiring layer with only bit lines which is found in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787 or the like does not exist. By the structure shown in the first embodiment, the number of layers can be effectively utilized in the multi-layered wiring structure.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the insulating layer <b>1</b> between contact layers is a silicon oxide layer, the contact plug <b>4</b> is formed of tungsten, and the contact barrier metal layer <b>3</b> is a laminated layer of titanium nitride/titanium. In addition, the interlayer insulating layer <b>11</b> of the first layer and the interlayer insulating layer <b>21</b> of the second layer are low dielectric constant insulating layers and are SiOCH layers, more specifically, molecular pore stack (MPS) layers. Details of the MPS layer are disclosed in M. Ueki et al., IEEE IEDM, pp 973-976 (2007). The first layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>13</b> is a laminated layer of tantalum/tantalum nitride, and the first layer wiring is formed of copper. In addition, the cap layer <b>20</b> of the first layer wiring and the cap layer <b>30</b> of the second layer wiring are silica amorphous carbon composite (SCC) layers. Details of the SCC layer are also disclosed in M. Ueki et al., IEEE IEDM, pp 973-976 (2007), like the MPS layer.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The MPS layer and the SCC layer will be briefly described below. The MPS layer is formed by using six-membered cyclic siloxane as main skeleton, and using organic siloxane having an organic group as a functional group, as base material. The organic functional group bonding to silicon atom is an unsaturated hydrocarbon group and an alkyl group. The SCC layer is formed by using the organic silane material where an unsaturated hydrocarbon group, an alkoxy group, and an alkyl group directly bond to silicon atom. The layer is the structure which contains an amorphous carbon structure and an unsaturated hydrocarbon bonding in the layer. The unsaturated hydrocarbon group in base material of any of the MPS layer and the SCC layer includes a vinyl group, a propenyl, an isopropenyl group, a 1-methyl-propenyl group, a 2-methyl-propenyl group, a 1,2-dimethyl-propenyl group, or the like. In particular, the preferable unsaturated hydrocarbon group is a vinyl group. The alkoxy group in base material of any of the MPS layer and the SCC layer is the structure where an alkyl group bonds to oxygen atom. The alkyl group directly bonding to silicon atom, and the alkyl group consisting of an alkoxy group include a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, an isopropyl group, a butyl group, an isobutyl group, a sec-butyl group, a tert-butyl group, or the like. The alkyl group bonding to silicon of the MPS layer material is preferably a functional group which is large volume and functions as a steric hindrance group, such as an isopropyl group, an isobutyl group, a tert-butyl group, or the like. In particular, one of the more preferable functional group is an isopropyl group. In other words, triisopropyl trivinyl tricyclosiloxane is more preferred. As the alkoxy group and the alkyl group bonding to silicon of the SCC layer material, a methoxy group and an isopropyl group are more preferred. In other words, isopropyl dimethoxy vinyl siloxane is more preferred. Micropore (mainly 0.5 nm or less) structure is introduced in the MPS layer by using these materials. The SCC layer is a kind of SiOCH layer with resistance to copper diffusion. Relative permittivity is approximately 3.1, while mechanical strength is as high as 20 GPa. Since the layer is formed by strong surface reaction, step coverage is excellent. In these layers, the composition of carbon is high, as compared with the SiOCH layer which is generally known. The ration of silicon/oxygen/carbon is about 2 times carbon in the SCC layer, and about 4 times carbon in the MPS layer with relation to the SiOCH layer, based on Si. The relative ratio of oxygen is at least about &#xbe; in the SCC layer and about &#xbd; in the MPS layer as compared with general SiOCH layer. These layers is formed by not the plasma CVD method which dissociates and activates material in plasma, but the plasma polymerization method, so as to activate an unsaturated hydrocarbon with holding silica skeleton, and to be easy to control a chemical structure of an insulating layer. The composition difference of the MPS layer and the SCC layer is important in forming capacitive element opening.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">A method of forming the second layer wiring <b>25</b> will be briefly described. The first layer wiring <b>15</b> is formed, the cap layer <b>20</b> of the first layer wiring which is formed by an SCC layer is formed, and then the MPS layer is formed as the interlayer insulating layer <b>21</b> of the second layer. Subsequently, as a mask at the time of subsequent processing, a silicon oxide (not shown in the drawings) layer is formed. Then, an opening of the second layer wiring is formed by the so-called dual damascene process using lithography and dry etching. In this case, a part of the opening includes a via hole for electrical connection with the first layer wiring <b>15</b>. The second layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>23</b> is deposited in the opening by the sputtering method, and then a copper to become a copper plated seed layer is deposited. Then, a copper is embedded by the plating method. The copper used herein may include a metal additive, such as aluminum or silver. The excessive barrier metal layer and copper are removed such that the barrier metal layer <b>23</b> and the copper remain in the opening of the second layer wiring by using a technique, such as CMP, thereby forming the second layer wiring <b>25</b>. Since the silicon oxide layer is removed in this process, it does not remain over the interlayer insulating layer <b>21</b> of the second layer. Then, the cap layer <b>30</b> of the second layer wiring, which is formed by an SCC layer similar to the first layer, is formed. Here, the silicon oxide layer may also be partially provided in a lower portion of the capacitor insulating layer other than the opening of the capacitive element. In the subsequent process, an opening of the third layer wiring, . . . , an opening of the sixth layer wiring can be formed similar to the opening of the second layer wiring. A third layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>33</b>, a fourth layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>43</b>, a fifth layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>53</b>, and a sixth layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>63</b> which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> can be formed similar to the first layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>13</b> or the second layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>23</b>. A cap layer <b>60</b> of the fifth layer wiring and a cap layer <b>70</b> of the sixth layer wiring which are shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> can be formed similar to the cap layer <b>30</b> of the second layer wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the first embodiment, an insulating layer with a single layer is used as the interlayer insulating layer and the cap layer. However, a laminated structure of a plurality of kinds of insulating layers may also be used as the interlayer insulating layer and the cap layer. For example, a laminated structure of an MPS layer and a SiOCH layer may be used as the interlayer insulating layer, and a laminated structure of a SiC layer and a SiCN layer may be used as the cap layer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> is a plane layout view before the cap layer <b>30</b> is formed, in which the column decode wiring <b>18</b>, the interlayer insulating layer <b>21</b> of the second layer, and the second layer wiring <b>25</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Moreover, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the third layer wiring <b>35</b> and the fourth layer wiring <b>45</b> are formed. The method of forming the third layer wiring <b>35</b> and the fourth layer wiring <b>45</b> is the same as the method of forming the second layer wiring <b>25</b>. Here, a wiring layer is formed only in the logic circuit region since a capacitive element is formed in the memory circuit region later. In the first embodiment, the case where the height of the capacitive element is lower than that of three layers of the logic circuit portion is shown. However, when the height of the capacitive element is set to be higher than that of three layers of the logic circuit portion, one more layer is formed for the logic circuit portion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> is a plane layout view before a cap layer <b>50</b> is formed, in which the interlayer insulating layer <b>41</b> of the fourth layer and the fourth layer wiring <b>45</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Then, the cap layer <b>50</b> of the fourth layer wiring is deposited as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, and then a hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> is formed. Then, a cylinder processing resist layer <b>95</b> is formed by lithography.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Here, a silicon oxide layer is used as the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b>. However, a laminated structure including another insulating layer may also be used as the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b>. In addition, it is also possible to adopt a multi-layered structure in which an antireflection layer is provided between the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> and a resist layer. In any case, it is preferable that the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> is an insulating layer with an effect of protecting the cap layer <b>50</b> of the fourth layer wiring in the process of forming a capacitive element. Specifically, a silicon nitride layer, a silicon oxynitride layer, and the like may be mentioned in addition to the silicon oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, a capacitive element opening <b>98</b> is formed by dry etching. In this case, the cap layer <b>30</b> of the second layer wiring is not etched in order to prevent oxidation of the second layer wiring. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> is a plan layout view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in which the whole surface is covered with the cylinder processing resist layer <b>95</b>. The cap layer <b>30</b> of the second layer wiring is formed in the capacitive element opening <b>98</b> to be the capacitive element. By forming the capacitive element <b>90</b> in a rectangular shape like the first embodiment, an exposure including an optical proximity correction and a forming process such as dry etching process become easy. Particularly in a next generation of the 32 nm and 28 nm technology the optical proximity correction becomes complex. Forming each element pattern in a simple rectangular shape or a linear shape is highly advantageous, in order to increase the bit density per unit area or to obtain the shape as designed.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Although the interlayer insulating layer and the cap layer are alternately etched by dry etching when forming the capacitive element opening <b>98</b>, an MPS layer is used as the interlayer insulating layer and an SCC is used as the cap layer in the first embodiment. Accordingly, this is the structure in which the SiOCH layer is laminated. Since the composition of carbon of the two layers is greatly different as described above, it becomes easy to control the ratio of etching rates, so-called etching selectivity of the MPS layer/SCC layer by studying the processing conditions based on dry etching. Accordingly, the capacitive element opening <b>98</b> can be opened deep by setting the etching selectivity of the SCC layer, which is a cap layer, to be small while etching the MPS layer which is an interlayer insulating layer. On the contrary, etching may be stopped at the bottom of the cylinder opening by setting the etching selectivity of the MPS layer/SCC layer to be large. Although the interlayer insulating layer is etched, it is possible to set the etching rate of the cap layer to be relatively noticeably small. That is, due to the existence of carbon, it is possible to select the condition in which the etching rate changes and the condition in which the etching rate does not change. By using such a structure in which the degree of freedom of processing is high, the satisfactory shape of the capacitive element opening <b>98</b> can be acquired. Here, assuming that the carbon/silicon ratio of the cap insulating layer is cap insulating layer (C/Si) and the carbon/silicon ratio of the low dielectric constant SiOCH layer is low dielectric constant SiOCH layer (C/Si), for example, the relationship of cap insulating layer (C/Si)/low dielectric constant SiOCH layer (C/Si)&#x3c;2 may be satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Then, the cylinder processing resist layer is removed by ashing, and the cap layer <b>30</b> of the second layer wiring is etched back by dry etching in order to connect a lower electrode of the capacitive element to the second layer wiring <b>25</b> serving as a wiring of a lower layer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> is a plain layout view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, in which the whole surface is covered with the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b>. The interlayer insulating layer <b>21</b> of the second layer and the second layer wiring <b>25</b> are formed in the capacitive element opening <b>98</b> to be the capacitive element.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Then, the lower electrode layer <b>91</b> serving as a lower electrode of the capacitive element is formed, and then a lower electrode processing resist layer (not shown in the drawings) is formed by lithography. The lower electrode layer <b>91</b> is etched back using the lower electrode processing resist layer as a mask, and then the lower electrode processing resist layer is removed by ashing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>). In addition, the lower capacitor wiring may be provided such that the upper surface of the lower capacitor wiring and the upper surface of the wiring of a wiring layer provided with the lower capacitor wiring are coplanar.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Then, the capacitor insulating layer <b>92</b> and the upper electrode layer <b>93</b> are formed, and an upper electrode processing resist layer <b>97</b> serving as a mask at the time of processing is formed by lithography. The capacitor insulating layer <b>92</b> and the upper electrode layer <b>93</b> are etched by dry etching using the upper electrode processing resist layer <b>97</b> as a mask. In this case, over-etching is performed for uniformity, but a part of the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> is etched due to the over-etching (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>). In addition, the upper capacitor wiring may be provided such that the upper surface of the upper capacitor wiring and the upper surface of the wiring of a wiring layer provided with the upper capacitor wiring are coplanar.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As materials used for the capacitive element <b>90</b>, Ti, TiN, Ta, TaN, Ru, or the laminated structure thereof may be mentioned for the upper electrode layer <b>93</b> and the lower electrode layer <b>91</b>. In addition, as the capacitor insulating layer <b>92</b>, a layer formed by adding lanthanoid, such as Tb, Er, or Yb, in zirconium dioxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), zirconium alminate (ZrAlO<sub>x</sub>), or zirconium dioxide may be mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> serves to protect especially a cap layer, which exists at a lower layer of a hard mask layer in a logic circuit portion, and a copper wiring located below the cap layer in the above-described ashing and etching processes. Particularly when the interlayer insulating layer or the cap layer has no resistance to oxygen plasma or etching process of the capacitor layer, the copper wiring of the logic circuit portion is oxidized if a hard mask layer does not exist. As a result, the resistance is increased or the reliability is reduced, and the performance of the logic circuit portion deteriorates or malfunction occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Then, the upper electrode processing resist layer <b>97</b> is removed by ashing, in the same manner as in the lower electrode processing. Then, the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> is etched back using the upper electrode as a mask, such that the cap layer <b>50</b> of the fourth layer wiring is exposed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>). As a result, the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> remains only in a region where the capacitor layer and the upper electrode exist. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> is a plain layout view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, in which the almost whole surface of the memory circuit region is covered with the upper electrode layer <b>93</b>. The capacitive element opening <b>98</b> to be the capacitive element is formed and, the cap layer <b>50</b> of the fourth layer wiring is formed in the region on which the capacitive element does not exist.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The structure in which a part of the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> remains in the region where a capacitor layer and an upper electrode exist is a most preferable structure when the capacitive element <b>90</b> is embedded in a multi-layer wiring and an interlayer insulating layer of the multi-layered wiring is formed as a low dielectric constant layer like the first embodiment. When the capacitive element <b>90</b> is formed in the multi-layered wiring by the process of the first embodiment, the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> necessarily remains in the region.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Then, the interlayer insulating layer <b>51</b> of the fifth layer is formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>). In this case, in the memory circuit portion, a level difference occurs between the memory circuit portion and the logic circuit portion due to the existence of the capacitive element <b>90</b>. Accordingly, this is flattened by the technique, such as CMP. In addition, when it is difficult to embed an insulating layer in a cylinder opening, it is also possible to embed the capacitive element opening <b>98</b> using an interlayer insulating layer, which is excellent in being embedded, to perform etchback, to form the interlayer insulating layer only in the opening, and to form the interlayer insulating layer <b>51</b> of the fifth layer. Then, a hard mask insulating layer <b>54</b> that is used as a mask for forming the opening of the fifth layer wiring is formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Then, the fifth layer wiring <b>55</b> is formed through the same process as in the method when the second layer wiring <b>25</b> is formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>). In addition, the cap layer <b>60</b> of the fifth layer wiring is formed after forming the fifth layer wiring (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>). In this case, in the memory circuit portion, the upper electrode functions as a stopper at the time of processing of a wiring groove and the depth of the groove is restricted. At the same time, an upper capacitor wiring (fifth layer wiring <b>55</b> formed in the memory circuit region) which is directly connected to the upper electrode is formed. As a result, a structure, in which the upper capacitor wiring as a plate line wiring is directly connected to the upper electrode, is acquired. In this structure, not only connection between capacitive elements as plate line wirings is made, but also the electric resistance between the elements can be reduced. In addition, the plate line wiring (fifth layer wiring <b>55</b> formed in the memory circuit region) is only shown to extend in the depth direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref>. In practice, however, the plate line wiring may be formed in the mesh shape in the plane within the memory circuit region (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>). Thus, in the first embodiment, the structure in which the plate line wiring is directly formed over the upper electrode is acquired. In addition, the sixth layer wiring <b>65</b> is similarly formed and then an upper wiring is formed, thereby completing the semiconductor integrated circuit (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The effect of the first embodiment will be described. As described above, by embedding the capacitive element of the memory circuit portion in the multi-layered wiring structure and ensuring the height, which is equal to or more than a plurality of layers of the multi-layered wiring, in the structure of the capacitive element, it becomes easy to ensure the capacitance of the capacitive element without changing the structure of the multi-layered wiring even if it is miniaturized. Specifically, in the first embodiment, the case where the height of the capacitive element is larger than that of two layers of the logic circuit portion is shown. However, when the capacitance is insufficient due to the miniaturization, a structure higher than three layers may be formed by increasing one layer. In this case, it is not necessary to change the multi-layered wiring structure of the logic circuit portion.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Moreover, since the performance of the logic circuit portion is emphasized in the first embodiment, it is preferable that all wirings of a wiring layer at least in a region where a capacitive element is formed are formed of a wiring material containing copper as a main component in order to reduce the wiring resistance. More preferably, all wirings of the wiring layer are formed of a wiring material containing copper as a main component. As described above, the copper may include a metal additive, such as aluminum or silver.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In order to reduce the wiring resistance, at least wiring materials used for the multi-layered wirings (second layer wiring <b>25</b>, third layer wiring <b>35</b>, and fourth layer wiring <b>45</b>) in which a capacitive element is embedded are preferably copper. More preferably, copper wirings are used for all wiring layers (first to sixth wiring layers) (however, a so-called pad Al layer is excluded). In the first embodiment, copper wirings are used for all wiring layers from the first layer wiring <b>15</b> to the sixth layer wiring <b>65</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>. In the design of a logic circuit portion of a so-called memory composite LSI, in which a memory circuit portion and a logic circuit portion are integrated over the same semiconductor substrate, like the first embodiment, it is possible to use the same parameters as in the design of the normal logic LSI in which a memory circuit portion is not provided together with a logic circuit portion. Accordingly, the design just for the logic circuit portion of the LSI in which the memory circuit portion is provided together becomes unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Thus, according to the first embodiment, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device which includes a memory circuit portion provided with a capacitive element and a logic circuit portion over the same semiconductor substrate, all wirings required for connection of the capacitive element can be formed using multi-layered wirings of the logic circuit portion by embedding the capacitive element in a region ranging at least over a plurality of wiring layers of an interlayer insulating layer which separates multi-layered wirings formed in the logic circuit portion by insulation. Accordingly, also in the case where a memory circuit and a logic circuit are formed over the same semiconductor substrate, the design parameters of the logic circuit at the time of design can be used as compatible values regardless of the existence of a capacitive element. As a result, also in an integrated circuit in which a capacitive element is formed over the same substrate, the design becomes easy.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In addition, since the height of a capacitive element is ensured by disposing the capacitive element over a plurality of layers of a multi-layered wiring, the required capacitance can be ensured even if the scaling progresses. In addition, since the distance from a diffusion layer of a transistor in a logic circuit portion to the first wiring layer is significantly reduced compared with that in the related art, the formation becomes easy. Moreover, since the parasitic capacitance of the transistor is reduced by decreasing the resistance, a high-speed operation becomes possible.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In addition, a Low-k/Cu wiring which has low resistance and low parasitic capacitance can be applied to both the memory circuit portion and the logic circuit portion. Accordingly, the performance of the logic circuit portion does not deteriorate at all even if the memory circuit portion with a capacitive element is provided together.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In addition, neither a dedicated process nor a dedicated facility for forming a wiring, which is called a plate line for connection between upper electrodes, is needed by connecting upper electrodes of capacitive elements to each other with an upper capacitor wiring formed at the same height as a wiring existing in a logic circuit portion, the thicknesses of upper and lower layers of the capacitive element can be ensured and the aspect of a contact (logic contact) of the logic circuit portion can be reduced. In addition, the same effect is acquired even if the lower capacitor wiring is provided such that the upper surface of the lower capacitor wiring and the upper surface of the wiring of a wiring layer provided with the lower capacitor wiring are coplanar. In addition, by providing a silicon oxide layer partially in a lower portion of a capacitor insulating layer other than an opening of a capacitive element, it is possible to protect a cap layer, which exists at a lower layer of the silicon oxide layer in a logic circuit portion, during the forming of the capacitive element and also to protect a copper wiring and an interlayer insulating layer located below the cap layer. Through the existence of the silicon oxide layer, an increase in resistance or a drop in reliability caused by oxidation of the copper wiring of the logic circuit portion, oxidizing can be prevented. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress performance degradation or malfunction in the logic circuit portion.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As described in the first embodiment, it is effective to form the capacitive element in the multi-layered wiring layer located at the lower layer which is being most miniaturized. In general, the thicknesses of wirings and wiring layers which form the multi-layered wiring layer located at the lower layer are equal. This is because the characteristics of wirings become equal in the respective layers and accordingly, the circuit design at the side of a logic circuit provided together becomes easy. However, the main point of the first embodiment is that a capacitive element is embedded in a multi-layered wiring layer including at least two or more layers. Accordingly, the thicknesses of the wiring layers or wirings do not need to be necessarily equal. As a modification of the first embodiment, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A and 32B</figref> which will be described later, a part of upper portion of a capacitive element may be formed in an upper multi-layered wiring layer (global wiring) located over a multi-layered wiring located in a lower layer. In general, the thickness of each wiring layer or wiring which forms the upper multi-layered wiring layer is larger than that of a multi-layered wiring layer located at the lower layer.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Those disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787 are shown like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 33B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 33B</figref>, reference numeral <b>111</b> denotes a lift-up insulating layer A, reference numeral <b>112</b> denotes a lift-up wiring plug A, reference numeral <b>113</b> denotes a capacitor processing stop layer, reference numeral <b>114</b> denotes a lift-up insulating layer B, reference numeral <b>115</b> denotes a lift-up wiring plug B, reference numeral <b>116</b> denotes a wiring processing stop layer, and reference numeral <b>117</b> denotes a plate line. In Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787, the memory circuit portion <b>101</b> has a structure (add-on structure) in which the multi-layered wiring portion <b>103</b> is provided over the capacitive element <b>90</b>. Accordingly, in the logic circuit portion <b>102</b>, a wiring portion (lift-up wiring portion <b>104</b>) for lifting up the multi-layered wiring portion <b>103</b> according to the height of the capacitive element <b>90</b> was needed. The lift-up wiring portion <b>104</b> is difficult to be formed because the aspect ratio is high, and the resistance is high. Due to the existence of the lift-up wiring portion <b>104</b>, the design parameters of the add-on logic circuit portion <b>102</b> become largely different from those in the case where the lift-up wiring portion <b>104</b> does not exist, and the performance of the add-on logic circuit portion <b>102</b> deteriorates. These conditions become worse as the miniaturization progresses.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">On the other hand, in the first embodiment, a memory circuit portion <b>105</b> and a logic circuit portion <b>106</b> with built-in structures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33C and 33D</figref>, in which the capacitive element <b>90</b> is embedded in the multi-layered wiring structure, are provided for the structures of the memory circuit portion and logic circuit portion. Accordingly, by changing the number of layers passing through the multi-layered wiring regarding the height of the capacitive element, it is possible to ensure the capacitance. Moreover, in the case of the built-in logic circuit portion <b>106</b>, there is no change of design parameters caused by the existence of the capacitive element <b>90</b>. That is, since there is no change in the structure and material of the multi-layered wiring of the logic circuit portion even if the built-in memory circuit portion <b>105</b> exists over the same semiconductor substrate, it is possible to use design parameters which are completely compatible with those in the case where only a logic circuit portion exists. In other words, in a composite circuit chip which includes a memory circuit portion with a capacitive element and a logic circuit portion, a high-speed memory function can be realized while maintaining the logic operation capability which is completely the same as that of a logic circuit chip including only a normal logic circuit portion.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Moreover, as described above, in the first embodiment, the MPS layer is used as the interlayer insulating layer and the SCC layer is used as the cap layer. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13C</figref>, a SiOCH layer, such as Black Diamond&#x2122;, may be adopted as the interlayer insulating layer and a SiCN layer may be adopted as the cap layer. In this case, since the composition of the layers is different due to the existence of nitrogen, the processing is conditions need to be set in consideration of the point when forming the opening of the capacitive element <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14C</figref>, a plate line wiring (fifth layer wiring <b>55</b> formed in the memory circuit region) may be formed in the shape over a pad, which is not the wiring shape, in the memory circuit region. That is, the plate line wiring may be an ultra-wide wiring. In addition, the plate line wiring may be formed in the wide wiring shape with slits interposed in places.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Based on the structure of the first embodiment, copper is adopted for a contact plug <b>4</b>, and a first layer wiring <b>15</b> and the dual damascene shape (dual damascene contact shape) are formed. Accordingly, it is possible to realize the structure in which the resistance from a diffusion layer to the first layer wiring <b>15</b> is further reduced. In this case, although a silicon oxide layer may be used as the insulating layer <b>1</b> between contact layers like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the insulating layer <b>1</b> between contact layers is the same interlayer insulating layer as the first layer wiring <b>15</b> herein. Alternatively, a low dielectric constant SiOCH layer which is different from the first layer may be used as the insulating layer <b>1</b> between contact layers. Moreover, a laminated structure of different low dielectric constant SiOCH layers may be adopted. For the insulating layer <b>1</b> between contact layers, it is preferable to use a layer with Cu diffusion barrier resistance, for example, the SCC layer. When a laminated structure is used, it is preferable to use it in a lowermost layer, that is, right above an etch stop layer.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In particular, the SCC layer is formed by the plasma polymerization method. Accordingly, the SCC layer is excellent for step coverage rather than the interlayer insulating layer formed by the normal plasma CVD method. For this reason, when the SCC layer is formed over the uneven surface, which is formed due to the existence of a gate, like the semiconductor substrate after the forming of the etch stop layer, the SCC layer can be satisfactorily embedded.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In addition, in the second embodiment, copper is also adopted as a material for the contact plug <b>4</b>, and copper is used for all plugs including the contact plug <b>4</b> and all wiring metals including via (except for a so-called pad Al layer). This is one of the most preferable forms since low resistance is realized.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Moreover, in the structure of the second embodiment, a contact barrier metal layer <b>3</b> of the contact plug <b>4</b> also serves as a barrier metal layer <b>13</b> of the first layer wiring <b>15</b> and is formed in the dual damascene process as described above. Accordingly, the contact barrier metal layer <b>3</b> is preferably a barrier layer which is high in resistance to copper diffusion and has a low resistance. Among metal layers used for the barrier metal, tantalum nitride or a laminated structure of tantalum/tantalum nitride is preferable, and a laminated structure of ruthenium/titanium is more preferable.</p>

<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Then, the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> is etched back using the upper electrode as a mask, such that the cap layer <b>40</b> of the third layer wiring is exposed (not shown in the drawings). As a result, the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> remains only in a region where the capacitor layer and the upper electrode exist.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Then, an interlayer insulating layer <b>41</b> of a fourth layer is formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref>). In the subsequent process, the interlayer insulating layer <b>41</b> of the fourth layer is made to be flat and a fourth layer wiring <b>45</b> is formed through the same process as in the first embodiment. Then, an upper layer wiring is further formed by forming a fifth layer wiring <b>55</b> serving as the upper layer wiring (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A to 16C</figref>), thereby completing the semiconductor integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In the third embodiment, since the bit line <b>19</b> is formed in the same layer as the first layer wiring <b>15</b> like the first or second embodiment, a wiring layer with only bit lines which is found in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication NO. 2004-342787 or the like does not exist. Moreover, in the third embodiment, a wiring which is electrically connected to a lower electrode of a capacitive element, what is called a wiring which performs lower electrode contact, is formed in the first layer wiring <b>15</b> of the same layer as the bit line <b>19</b>. Through the structure shown in the third embodiment, the number of layers can be effectively utilized in the multi-layered wiring structure. In addition, the capacitive element is formed to pass through a layer of the second layer wiring <b>25</b> and a layer of the third layer wiring <b>35</b>. Moreover, regarding the connection to a lower electrode, the shape in which cylinders with different diameters are connected up and down is adopted in order to directly connect the capacitive element to the first layer wiring <b>15</b>. This shape is a suitable structure for directly connecting the capacitive element to the first layer wiring <b>15</b> for the connection of the capacitive element to the lower electrode. Accordingly, the structure of the capacitive element in the third embodiment becomes a shape in which the cylinders with different diameters are connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">As described above, in the third embodiment, the MPS layer is used as the interlayer insulating layer and the SCC layer is used as the cap layer. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A to 26C</figref>, a SiOCH layer, such as Black Diamond&#x2122;, may be adopted as the interlayer insulating layer and a SiCN layer may be adopted as the cap layer. In this case, since the composition of the layers is different due to the existence of nitrogen, the processing conditions need to be set in consideration of the point when forming the opening of a capacitive element.</p>

<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Based on the structure of the third embodiment, copper is adopted for a contact plug <b>4</b>, and a first layer wiring and the dual damascene shape (dual damascene contact shape) are formed. Accordingly, it is possible to realize the structure in which the resistance from a diffusion layer to the first layer wiring <b>15</b> is further reduced. In this case, although a silicon oxide layer may be used as the insulating layer <b>1</b> between contact layers like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the insulating layer <b>1</b> between contact layers is the same interlayer insulating layer as the first layer wiring <b>15</b> herein. Alternatively, a low dielectric constant SiOCH layer which is different from the first layer may be used as the insulating layer <b>1</b> between contact layers. Moreover, a laminated structure of different low dielectric constant SiOCH layers may be adopted. For the insulating layer between contact layers, it is preferable to use a layer with Cu diffusion barrier resistance, for example, the SCC layer. When a laminated structure is used, it is preferable to use it in a lowermost layer, that is, right above an etch stop layer.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Moreover, in the semiconductor device according to the fourth embodiment, a lower capacitor wiring (first layer wiring <b>15</b>) connected to a lower electrode (lower electrode layer <b>91</b>) is connected to the contact plug <b>4</b>, which is connected to a diffusion layer <b>7</b> formed near the surface of the semiconductor substrate (silicon substrate <b>5</b>), and a signal wiring (bit line <b>19</b>) which connects between semiconductor elements (MOS transistors <b>9</b>) is formed in the same layer as the lower capacitor wiring (first layer wiring <b>15</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In particular, the SCC layer is formed by the plasma polymerization method. Accordingly, the SCC layer is excellent for step coverage rather than the interlayer insulating layer formed by the normal plasma CVD method. For this reason, when the SCC layer is formed over the uneven surface, which is formed due to the existence of a gate, like the semiconductor substrate after the forming of the etch stop layer, the SCC layer can be satisfactorily embedded.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Moreover, in the structure of the fourth embodiment, a contact barrier metal layer <b>3</b> of the contact plug <b>4</b> also serves as a barrier metal layer <b>13</b> of the first layer wiring <b>15</b> and is formed in the dual damascene process as described above. Accordingly, the contact barrier metal layer <b>3</b> is preferably a barrier layer which is high in resistance to copper diffusion and has a low resistance. Among metal layers used for the barrier metal, tantalum nitride or a laminated structure of tantalum/tantalum nitride is preferable, and a laminated structure of ruthenium/titanium is more preferable.</p>

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>, when forming a capacitive element opening A <b>88</b> after forming a cylinder processing resist layer A <b>81</b>, the capacitive element opening A <b>88</b> may be formed in the tapered shape by increasing isotropic components by controlling the anisotropy in the dry etching conditions. By executing the same processes as those from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref> after forming the capacitive element opening A <b>88</b> in the tapered shape, a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A to 28C</figref> is formed. By the method used in the fifth embodiment, the lithography process and reticule for forming the capacitive element opening B <b>89</b> become unnecessary.

<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Also in the fifth embodiment, the capacitive element is formed to pass through a layer of the second layer wiring <b>25</b> and a layer of the third layer wiring <b>35</b>.

In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29C</figref> at the right side shows a typical sectional view of a logic circuit region.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, the cap layer <b>40</b> of the third layer wiring is deposited and then the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In this case, the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> is a thin layer with a thickness equal to or more than about 20 nm and equal to or less than about 30 nm. In addition, the process of forming the cylinder processing resist layer A <b>81</b> by lithography and subsequent processes are performed like the third embodiment. When etching back the cap layer <b>20</b> of the first layer wiring located at the bottom of the cylinder opening A, the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> is also etched simultaneously. As a result, the thickness of the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> decreases to about 10 nm or more and about 20 nm or less. Then, a lower electrode layer is formed like the third embodiment, and the lower electrode is etched back after lithography. In this case, the thickness of the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> is further decreased by over-etching. As a result, the thickness of the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> becomes about 10 nm or less than 10 nm. Then, when processing the capacitor insulating layer <b>92</b> and the upper electrode layer <b>93</b> after forming the layers, the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> in a region where there is no work electrode is almost removed. Accordingly, the etchback process described in the third embodiment becomes unnecessary. The subsequent process of forming the upper wiring is performed in the same manner as in the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In the structure of the sixth embodiment, however, the distance from the bottom surface (surface of the fourth layer wiring <b>45</b>) of the cap layer <b>50</b> of the fourth layer wiring to the surface of the upper electrode layer <b>93</b> is shorter than the via height of the fourth layer wiring <b>45</b>. Therefore, it is necessary to expose a via pattern since a via below the fourth layer wiring <b>45</b> also needs to be formed in the memory circuit region. However, since the exposure in this case is performed simultaneously with exposure of the via pattern of the fourth layer wiring <b>45</b>, there is neither an increase in the number of reticules nor an increase in the number of processes.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Through the above-described method, the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A to 29C</figref> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In the sixth embodiment, a connection via is further provided between the upper electrode and the upper capacitor wiring in the structures of the first to fifth embodiments. In the structures of the first to fifth embodiments, the depth of a wiring groove directly formed over an upper electrode of a capacitive element should be smaller than that of a wiring groove of a logic circuit portion in the same layer with the same surface. On the other hand, such restriction is eliminated by adopting the structure of connecting the upper capacitor wiring to the upper electrode of the capacitive element through a via like the sixth embodiment. As a result, the degree of freedom in design of the wiring structure is improved. In other words, if the wiring structure is limited to the structure in which the wiring groove is directly formed over the upper electrode of the capacitive element, the depth of the wiring groove in the logic circuit portion is restricted depending on the structure of the capacitive element.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In the sixth embodiment, the capacitive element is formed to pass through the second and third layers. For example, if the capacitive element is formed to pass through both a local wiring layer and a semi-global wiring layer, the via height of the semi-global wiring layer is increased. Accordingly, the thickness of the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> can be more reduced in the sixth embodiment than in the structure in which the plate line wiring is directly formed over the upper electrode like the first embodiment. Particularly when the low dielectric constant SiOCH layer is also used as an interlayer insulating layer of the semi-global layer, it is possible to reduce the effective dielectric constant of the interlayer insulating layer.</p>

<p id="p-0171" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A to 30C</figref> in the seventh embodiment show the structure in which a capacitive element is embedded in a region ranging over three wiring layers of an interlayer insulating layer which separates multi-layered wirings formed in a logic circuit portion by insulation. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref> show the structure in which a capacitive element is embedded in a region ranging over four wiring layers. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref>, a seventh layer wiring <b>75</b> and an interlayer insulating layer <b>71</b> of the seventh layer are further provided as a seventh wiring layer, in addition to the sixth wiring layer. An opening of the seventh layer wiring can be formed similar to the opening of the second layer wiring. A seventh layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>73</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref> can be formed similar to the first layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>13</b> or the second layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>23</b>. A cap layer <b>70</b> of the seventh layer wiring shown in FIGS. <b>31</b>A and <b>31</b>B can be formed similar to the cap layer <b>30</b> of the second layer wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In addition to the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, a multi-layered wiring of one or two layers is formed in a logic circuit portion. Then, in the same manner as in the fifth embodiment, a cylinder processing resist layer (not shown in the drawings) is formed, and isotropic components are increased by controlling the anisotropy in the dry etching conditions when forming the capacitive element opening A. Thus, the capacitive element opening A is formed in the tapered shape (not shown in the drawings). By executing the same processes as those from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref> after forming the capacitive element opening in the tapered shape, a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A to 30C</figref> or a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref> is formed. By the method used in the seventh embodiment, the lithography process and reticule for forming the capacitive element opening B become unnecessary. As a result, the manufacturing cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A to 30C</figref>, the capacitive element <b>90</b> is formed to pass through a layer of the second layer wiring <b>25</b> to a layer of the fourth layer wiring <b>45</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref>, the capacitive element <b>90</b> is formed to pass through a layer of the second layer wiring <b>25</b> to a layer of the fifth layer wiring <b>55</b>. In addition, regarding the connection to a lower electrode, the shape in which tapered cylinders with different diameters are connected up and down is adopted in order to directly connect the capacitive element to the first layer wiring <b>15</b>. This shape is a suitable structure for directly connecting the capacitive element to the first layer wiring for the connection of the capacitive element to the lower electrode, like the third or fourth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Moreover, as a modification of the first embodiment, a part of the upper portion of the capacitive element <b>90</b> may be formed in an upper multi-layered wiring layer (global wiring), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A and 32B</figref>. In addition, the thickness of each wiring layer or wiring which forms a multi-layered wiring layer located at the upper layer may be larger than that of a multi-layered wiring layer located at the lower layer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A and 32B</figref>, in the region where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is provided, the second to fourth wiring layers have the same thickness such that the thicknesses of the second layer wiring <b>25</b> to fourth layer wiring are equal, while the thicknesses of the second to fourth wiring layers are different from that of the fifth wiring layer such that the thicknesses of the second to fourth wirings are different from that of the fifth wiring. Thus, the seventh embodiment may have the structure in which the thickness of each wiring layer is different from the thickness of each wiring in the multi-layered wiring structure of the region where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Although the interlayer insulating layer and the cap layer are alternately etched by dry etching when forming the opening of the capacitive element <b>90</b>, an MPS layer is used as the interlayer insulating layer and an SCC layer is used as the cap layer in the seventh embodiment. Accordingly, this is the structure in which the SiOCH layer is laminated. Since the carbon composition of the two layers greatly differs as described above, it becomes easy to control the ratio of etching rates, the so-called etching selectivity of the MPS layer/SCC layer by studying the processing conditions based on dry etching. Accordingly, the opening of the capacitive element <b>90</b> can be opened deep by setting the etching selectivity of the SCC layer, which is a cap layer, to be small while etching the MPS layer which is an interlayer insulating layer. On the contrary, etching may be stopped at the bottom of the cylinder opening by setting the etching selectivity of the MPS layer/SCC layer to be large. Particularly in the seventh embodiment, it is necessary to form a deep cylinder opening. In the structure of the seventh embodiment, it is easy to form a deep opening in the laminated structure. This is a technique which is difficult to realize in the combination of the SiOCH interlayer insulating layer and the SiCN cap layer that are commonly used. By using such a structure in which the degree of freedom of processing is high, the satisfactory shape of the opening of the capacitive element <b>90</b> can be acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In addition, in the seventh embodiment, since the capacitive element is formed to pass through three or more wiring layers, the cell capacitance of the memory circuit portion can be increased. In this case, the structure of the logic circuit portion is the same multi-layered wiring structure as in the case where there is no memory circuit portion. Accordingly, the design parameters are not changed but are compatible.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Moreover, since the capacitive element <b>90</b> is formed to pass through the three or more wiring layers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A to 30C</figref>, the row decode wiring <b>17</b> and the column decode wiring <b>18</b> are provided in the multi-layered wiring structure in which the capacitive element <b>90</b> of the memory circuit region is embedded. Therefore, it becomes unnecessary to use the upper wiring. Accordingly, the number of wiring layers of the memory circuit region can be reduced. In this case, the upper layer of the memory circuit region may be used for wirings of the logic circuit region or for connection between the circuit regions. As a result, the chip area can be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In addition, in the memory circuit portion, the column decode wiring <b>18</b> is formed simultaneously with the second layer wiring <b>25</b>. Although the column decode wiring <b>18</b> is formed simultaneously with the second layer wiring <b>25</b> in the eighth embodiment, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the row decode wiring <b>17</b> may be formed instead of the column decode wiring <b>18</b>. In this case, the column decode wiring <b>18</b> which was not formed simultaneously with the second layer wiring <b>25</b> may be formed in the sixth layer, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A to 34C</figref>, the insulating layer <b>1</b> between contact layers is a silicon oxide layer, the contact plug <b>4</b> is formed of tungsten, and the contact barrier metal layer <b>3</b> is a laminated layer of titanium nitride/titanium. In addition, the interlayer insulating layer <b>11</b> of the first layer and the interlayer insulating layer <b>21</b> of the second layer are low dielectric constant insulating layers and are SiOCH layers, more specifically, MPS layers. The first layer wiring barrier metal layer <b>13</b> is a laminated layer of tantalum/tantalum nitride, and the first layer wiring <b>15</b> is formed of copper. In addition, the cap layer <b>20</b> of the first layer wiring and the cap layer <b>30</b> of the second layer wiring are SCC layers. Moreover, for the SCC layer, those disclosed in M. Ueki et al., IEEE IEDM, pp 973-976 (2007) may also be used like the MPS layer. The SCC layer is a kind of SiOCH layer and has resistance to copper diffusion. The method of forming the second layer wiring <b>25</b> and the third layer wiring <b>35</b> is the same as that in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Also in the eighth embodiment, an insulating layer with a single layer is used as the interlayer insulating layer and the cap layer. However, a laminated structure of a plurality of kinds of insulating layers may also be used as the interlayer insulating layer and the cap layer, like the first embodiment. For example, a laminated structure of an MPS layer and a SiOCH layer may be used as the interlayer insulating layer, and a laminated structure of a SiC layer and a SiCN layer may be used as the cap layer.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Also in the eighth embodiment, the structure of the capacitive element <b>90</b> is formed in the shape in which cylinders with different diameters are connected to each other, like the third embodiment. The eighth embodiment is different from the third embodiment in that the connection with a lower electrode is not performed through the first layer wiring <b>15</b> but is performed through the contact plug <b>4</b> located at the lower layer. Accordingly, in the eighth embodiment, when forming the first layer wiring <b>15</b> in the third embodiment, the first layer wiring is not formed in a region where the lower electrode is to be connected (not shown in the drawings).</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The procedures of forming the capacitive element <b>90</b> are based on those in the third embodiment. The eighth embodiment is different from the third embodiment in that when forming the capacitive element opening A <b>88</b> by dry etching, the cap layer <b>20</b> of the first layer wiring layer and the interlayer insulating layer <b>11</b> of the first layer are etched such that the contact plug <b>4</b> formed of tungsten is exposed. When forming the capacitive element opening A <b>88</b>, the interlayer insulating layer and the cap layer are alternately etched by dry etching. In this case, in the eighth embodiment, the structure in which the SiOCH layer is laminated is used since an MPS layer is used as the interlayer insulating layer and an SCC layer is used as the cap layer like the third embodiment. Accordingly, the satisfactory shape of the capacitive element opening can be acquired by study on the processing.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">The subsequent process is the same as that in the third embodiment. In this case, since the cap layer <b>20</b> of the first layer wiring layer and the interlayer insulating layer <b>11</b> of the first layer were already etched, it is not necessary to etch back the cap layer <b>20</b> of the first layer wiring when forming the capacitive element opening B <b>89</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Then, the capacitive element <b>90</b> and an upper wiring subsequent to the fourth layer wiring <b>45</b> are formed like the first embodiment. Thus, the semiconductor integrated circuit is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In the eighth embodiment, a wiring (lower capacitor wiring) which is electrically connected to the lower electrode (lower electrode layer <b>91</b>) of the capacitive element <b>90</b>, what is called a wiring which performs lower electrode contact, also serves as the contact plug <b>4</b> connected to the diffusion layer <b>7</b> of a transistor. Accordingly, the lower electrode is located in the same layer as the first layer wiring <b>15</b> of the above-described integrated circuit. For this reason, it becomes easier to ensure the capacitance of the capacitive element <b>90</b> than the case where the lower electrode is formed over the first layer wiring <b>15</b>. In addition, since the lower capacitor wiring also serves as a contact plug connected to a diffusion layer of a transistor, it is not necessary to change the parameter in both the case where the range up to the contact plug <b>4</b> is designed as a transistor parameter and the case where the capacitive element <b>90</b> is provided together. Simultaneously, since the capacitor contact is formed over tungsten similar to the related art, it is not necessary to consider an influence on the performance by exposure of a different kind of material in the process of forming the capacitive element <b>90</b>. Specifically, since Cu is not exposed when the lower electrode is formed, it becomes unnecessary to consider the Cu barrier property as the lower electrode. Accordingly, the barrier metal layer having the Cu barrier property, such as TaN, does not need to be used for the lower electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In a modification of the eighth embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A and 35B</figref>, in the memory circuit region, a plate line wiring (fourth layer wiring <b>45</b> formed in the memory circuit region) does not have a wiring shape but completely covers an upper portion of a cylinder capacitor portion so as to become an ultra-wide wiring. In addition, the plate line wiring is embedded as a wiring material to the inside of the cylinder. For example, the wiring shape of the plate line wiring may be the wide wiring shape with slits interposed at predetermined distances.</p>

<p id="p-0193" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A and 36B</figref> are sectional views showing a semiconductor device according to a ninth embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</figref> on the left side shows a sectional view of a memory circuit region, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref> at the right side shows a typical sectional view of a logic circuit region. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A and 36B</figref>, the MOS transistor <b>9</b> generated by using the typical method of forming an integrated circuit is provided in the same manner as in the first embodiment. Moreover, in the ninth embodiment, a lift-up insulating layer A <b>111</b> is formed over a contact correlation insulating layer <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 33B</figref> as the known technique. In the lift-up insulating layer A <b>111</b>, a bit line <b>19</b> and a lift-up wiring plug A <b>112</b> are formed. The method of forming the bit line <b>19</b> and the lift-up wiring plug A <b>112</b> may be formed by the technique that is generally known. Since the bit line <b>19</b> is formed in the lower layer of the first layer wiring <b>15</b>, the bit line <b>19</b> is called a 0-th layer wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">For example, a laminated layer of a titanium nitride layer and a tungsten layer serving as a bit line is processed into a bit line pattern by the lithography technique and the etching technique. Then, the lift-up insulating layer A <b>111</b> is formed, and a level difference caused by the bit line <b>19</b> is made to be flat by the CMP technique. A connection hole for forming the lift-up wiring plug A <b>112</b> is formed using the lithography technique and the etching technique again. Then, a laminated layer of a titanium nitride layer and a tungsten layer is formed to be embedded in the connection hole, and the surplus portion is removed by the CMP technique.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The above is one of the formation examples. In this case, a silicon oxide layer is usually used for the lift-up insulating layer A <b>111</b>. As the lift-up insulating layer A <b>111</b>, an insulating layer which can stand the process temperature when forming the lift-up wiring plug A <b>112</b> is preferable. Moreover, as the method of forming the bit line <b>19</b>, it is also possible to form the bit line <b>19</b> in the forming method described above after forming the lift-up insulating layer A <b>111</b> thin first and then opening a connection hole for connection with the contact plug <b>4</b> to be connected to the bit line <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">After forming the bit line <b>19</b> and the lift-up wiring plug A <b>112</b>, the first layer wiring <b>15</b> and the second layer wiring <b>25</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A and 36B</figref> are formed by the technique used when forming the third layer wiring and the fourth layer wiring in the first embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A and 36B</figref>, however, a process of forming a via layer is not necessary because the first layer wiring <b>15</b> does not have a via layer.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">After forming the second layer wiring <b>25</b>, the capacitive element <b>90</b> is formed by the technique which was also described in the first embodiment. In the ninth embodiment, the interlayer insulating layer <b>31</b> of the third layer is formed to have a thickness equal to or less than that corresponding to the via layer after forming the cap layer <b>30</b> of the second layer wiring <b>25</b>, unlike the first embodiment. Then, the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> is formed. Then, in order to form the capacitive element <b>90</b> in the same manner as in the first embodiment, the lower electrode layer <b>91</b> is formed and the capacitor insulating layer <b>92</b> and the upper electrode layer <b>93</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In the ninth embodiment, a metal material that becomes the plate line <b>117</b> is formed after forming the upper electrode layer <b>93</b>, unlike the first embodiment. For example, it is a tungsten layer. The thickness of the metal material layer is set such that the surface height is lower than the height of the surface of a wiring layer of the third layer.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Here, the plate line <b>117</b> as a plate line, the upper electrode layer <b>93</b>, the capacitor insulating layer <b>92</b>, and the hard mask insulating layer <b>94</b> are processed by the same technique used when forming the bit line <b>19</b>. Then, the interlayer insulating layer B <b>131</b> of the third layer is formed. Similar to the first embodiment, in the memory circuit portion, a level difference occurs between the memory circuit portion and the logic circuit portion due to the existence of the capacitive element <b>90</b>. Accordingly, this is flattened by the technique, such as CMP. The thickness of the interlayer insulating layer B <b>131</b> of the third layer after the flattening is set to be the height of the upper surface of the third layer wiring <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Then, in the same manner in the first embodiment, a hard mask insulating layer (not shown in the drawings) is formed and the third layer wiring <b>35</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In the ninth embodiment, an example where a tungsten layer is used as a plate line is assumed. However, the shape of the plate line wiring shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14C</figref> in the first embodiment or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A and 35B</figref> in the modification of the eighth embodiment may also be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In the example of the ninth embodiment, the wiring structure of the logic circuit portion is so special as to be close to the known structure, compared with the first to eighth embodiments. Accordingly, it is difficult to completely match the design parameter of the logic circuit portion with that of a normal logic LSI in which a memory circuit portion is not provided together with a logic circuit portion. However, it is possible to make the design parameter close to that in the known technique. Similarly, the number of layers of the multi-layered wiring structure can be effectively utilized compared with the known technique. The ninth embodiment is advantageous in that the structure can be easily formed since the structure is relatively close to the known technique. Undoubtedly, the effect obtained by disposing the capacitive element over a plurality of layers of the multi-layered wiring is acquired like the other embodiments.</p>
