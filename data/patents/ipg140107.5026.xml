<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/419,626, filed May 22, 2006, entitled &#x201c;AUTHENTICATING A TAMPER-RESISTANT MODULE IN A BASE STATION ROUTER&#x201d;, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to the field of networked communications, and more particularly to methods and systems for securing base stations using SIM cards.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Mobile communications provides access by mobile phones, PDAs, portable computers and a variety of other user equipment to communicate via radio access networks (RANs) to core networks for connection to other mobile devices, the Internet, and conventional land-line phones. The RANs are distributed over a geographical area typically divided into cells that are served by a corresponding base station. Base stations communicate over an air interface with the user equipment, with several base stations being connected to a radio network controller (RNC) or base station controller (BSC) that is connected to one or more core networks. In the typical situation, secure communications for users of the system may be provided through encryption and decryption at the base station. Communications between the core network and the base station is encrypted and communications between the base station and the wireless user equipment is also encrypted. In some large wireless networks security for the encryption and cipher keys is provided by virtue of the base stations themselves being physically protected (e.g., under lock and key) to prevent unauthorized monitoring of communications traffic to and from the base station (the RNC performs encryption in UMTS, although the eNB performs encryption for 3GPP long term evolution (3GPP LTE), where a secure cell-site vault portion can be provided for securing the encryption). Integrated base stations (e.g., base station routers or BSRs) are being designed to operate in residential or small business environments to form micro cells, pico cells, or femto cells. The integrated base station is designed to be connected to the service provider's network via broadband (such as DSL or cable), and effectively allows service providers to extend coverage in small locations, such as high density cities, or inside buildings where access would otherwise be limited or unavailable using convention base stations. A femto cell generally provides the functionality of a base station but extends it to allow a simpler, self contained deployment, for example, a UMTS femtocell containing a Node B, RNC and GSN with Ethernet for backhaul. As these integrated base stations are installed and maintained by a subscriber, however, they are not physically controlled by the network operator. Accordingly, there is a need for improved methods and systems for securing base station routers or other secured devices. Note that a 3GPP LTE eNB is considered to be an integrated base station.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following is a summary of one or more aspects of the invention to facilitate a basic understanding thereof, wherein this summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure and is intended neither to identify certain elements of the invention, nor to delineate the scope of the disclosure. Rather, the primary purpose of the summary is to present some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form prior to the more detailed description that is presented hereinafter. The various aspects of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for securing base stations in which a SIM card is operatively coupled with a secured portion of a base station and a secure association is established therebetween to facilitate authentication between the secured portion of the base station and a core network.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One or more aspects of the disclosure relate to a base station for providing wireless communications between wireless mobile terminals and a core network. In one exemplary implementation, the integrated base station is a base station router for a femto cell, pico cell, micro cell or other type of cell. In another exemplary implementation, the integrated base station is a 3GPP LTE eNB base station. The integrated base station comprises a subscriber identity module (SIM) card operatively coupled with the device and including a first local tunnel management component and a first security management component operatively coupled with the core network to facilitate one or more security functions in the base station. In the remainder of this disclosure, base station, integrated base station and base station router as synonymous. The base station further includes a secure portion (e.g., a cell-site vault) that operates in concert with the first tunnel management component to establish a secured association between the SIM card and the cell-site vault. The base station further comprises an unsecure portion which includes a radio interface operative to communicate with wireless mobile terminals, and a line interface operative to communicate with the core network.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain further aspects of the disclosure, the security function components perform encryption or decryption security operations with respect to communications packets handled by the base station, such as a first encryption component to perform encryption and decryption security operations with respect to communications packets transferred between the base station and a radio interface of a wireless mobile terminal, and a second encryption component to perform encryption and decryption security operations with respect to communications packets transferred between the base station and a line interface of the core network. In one embodiment, the security management components facilitate generation of session keys for the one or more security function components.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with other aspects of the disclosure, a SIM card is provided for facilitating security operations in a base station coupled with a core network. The SIM card comprises a security management component operative to establish a secured association between the SIM card and a secure portion of the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still other aspects of the disclosure provide a method for securing a base station using a subscriber identity module (SIM) card. The method includes operatively coupling a SIM card to the base station, establishing a secure tunnel between a secure portion of the base station and an authentication component of a core communications network, establishing a secure association between the SIM card and the secure portion of the base station, and confirming to the authentication component establishment of the secure association between the SIM card and the secure portion of the base station. In certain embodiments, the secure tunnel is established between the secure portion of the base station and the authentication component of the core communications network via an IKE protocol, a TLS protocol, or an AKA procedure. In certain embodiments, moreover, establishing the secure association is established between the SIM card and the secure portion of the base station includes executing an AKA (e.g. UMTS-AKA) procedure.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, several embodiments or implementations of the various aspects of the present disclosure are hereinafter illustrated and described in conjunction with the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements. An exemplary system <b>2</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for facilitating security of a device <b>20</b>, such as a base station or the system <b>2</b> may be implemented in other secured device applications. The system <b>2</b> includes a subscriber identity module (SIM) card <b>10</b> operatively coupled with the device <b>20</b>, where the SIM card <b>10</b> includes a first security management component <b>14</b> operatively coupled with a core network or other external system to facilitate one or more security functions in the device <b>20</b>. Note that in one embodiment component <b>14</b> executes the USIM program application <b>12</b>. The device <b>20</b> also includes one or more security function components <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> that perform security operations with respect to data processed or used by the device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a wireless communications system <b>100</b> including one possible implementation of the system <b>2</b> in association with a base station <b>110</b> for providing wireless communications between wireless mobile terminals <b>120</b> and a core network <b>130</b>. The base station <b>110</b> in one possible embodiment is an integrated base station for a femto cell, pico cell, micro cell, or other type of cell although not a strict requirement of the present disclosure. The core network <b>130</b> is operated by a wireless operator and includes e.g. an AAA or other authentication component <b>131</b>, an authentication center <b>132</b>, a key management component <b>133</b>, a secure gateway (SEGW) <b>137</b>, a line interface <b>138</b>, and other functional components so as to provide for packet exchange with the base station <b>110</b> via a line interface <b>138</b> and exchange of signaling and user data via component <b>134</b>, where the core network <b>130</b> performs encryption/decryption via an encryption component <b>136</b> for packets exchanged with the base station <b>110</b>. The mobile terminal <b>120</b> provides a signaling and user data component <b>124</b> along with an encryption component <b>126</b> for encryption/decryption of packets exchanged with the base station <b>110</b>, and a radio interface <b>122</b>. In another embodiment, parts of the core network component <b>134</b> can execute inside the cell-site vault <b>20</b> in the integrated base station <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The authentication center <b>132</b> authenticates elements of the wireless communication system <b>100</b>, and preferably stores secret keys associated with the mobile terminals <b>120</b> for use in authenticating communications between the core network <b>130</b> and the terminals <b>120</b>. The authentication center <b>132</b>, moreover, stores a secret key used to authenticate the secured vault portion <b>20</b> of the base station <b>110</b>, for example, with one copy of the key being provisioned to the authentication center <b>132</b> and another copy being pre-provisioned to the base station vault <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the authentication center can hold on to the public key while the secured vault portion <b>20</b> stores the private part of the public/private key pair. These keys are then used to authenticate communications between the wireless communication system <b>100</b> and the base station <b>110</b> using well-known secure tunnel establishment procedures such as TLS, SSL or the various AKA algorithms.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The base station <b>110</b> comprises a secured portion <b>20</b> and an unsecured portion <b>110</b><i>a</i>, where the unsecured portion <b>110</b><i>a </i>is operatively connected via a radio interface <b>112</b> to corresponding radio interfaces <b>122</b> of mobile terminals <b>120</b> proximate the base station <b>110</b>, and is also connected to a core network <b>130</b> via a line interface <b>114</b> in the unsecured portion <b>110</b><i>a </i>that interoperates with a line interface <b>138</b> of the core network <b>130</b>. The base station <b>110</b> may be any suitable hardware, software, firmware, programmable logic, etc., or combinations thereof, whether unitary or distributed among two or more entities, wherein all such implementations are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present disclosure and the appended claims. Various aspects of the disclosure are illustrated and described in terms of software, or algorithms, and/or symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory, by which ordinary skilled artisans convey the substance of their work. As such, algorithms, scripts, computations, and other operations of the described components may be implemented as computer implemented steps via programmed software core or other programming or configuration to provide a desired result, where such steps involve manipulation or transformation of physical quantities such as stored memory states in a computer memory. In particular, certain embodiments may include software components operating according to programmed computer-executable instructions stored in an electronic memory, which operate on messages or packets sent to or received from the core network <b>130</b> and or the mobile terminal(s) <b>120</b>, which data may be likewise stored in an electronic memory at least for a time, wherein the packets and data described herein may be of any suitable form including without limitation optical, electrical, or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated, and wherein these may be referred to in various terms such as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Unless specifically stated otherwise, or as is apparent from the discussion, terms such as &#x201c;processing&#x201d; or &#x201c;computing&#x201d; or &#x201c;calculating&#x201d; or &#x201c;determining&#x201d; or &#x201c;displaying&#x201d; or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device or devices, that manipulate and transform data represented as physical, electronic quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices. In addition, the various software implemented aspects of the present disclosure are typically encoded on some form of program storage medium or implemented over some type of transmission medium. The program storage medium may be magnetic (e.g., a floppy disk or a hard drive) or optical (e.g., a compact disk read only memory, or &#x201c;CD ROM&#x201d;), and may be read only or random access. Similarly, the transmission medium may be twisted wire pairs, coaxial cable, optical fiber, wireless, or some other suitable transmission medium known to the art or combinations thereof, wherein the present disclosure is not limited by these aspects of any given implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The exemplary integrated base station <b>110</b> provides wireless connectivity to the user equipment <b>120</b> according to Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) standards and/or protocols, although other embodiments of the present disclosure are possible in which alternative standards and/or protocols (e.g., Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), 3GPP LTE, 3GPP code division multiple access (CDMA), or WiMAX standards and/or protocols) may be implemented in portions of the wireless communication system <b>100</b>. In addition to the secure cell-site vault <b>20</b> and the unsecured portion <b>110</b><i>a</i>, the base station <b>110</b> comprises a subscriber identity module (SIM) card <b>10</b> in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure. The SIM card <b>10</b> is operatively coupled with the vault <b>20</b> and includes a first security management component <b>14</b> for key management. The key management component <b>14</b> is operatively coupled with the core network <b>130</b> to facilitate the association of a SIM card with a secure cell-site vault. In the illustrated implementation, the secure cell-site vault <b>20</b> is generally as described in Applicants' prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/419,626, filed May 22, 2006, entitled &#x201c;Authenticating a Tamper-Resistant Module in a Base Station Router&#x201d;, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The vault <b>20</b> includes one or more security (e.g., encryption/decryption) functions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, and a second security management component (e.g., key distribution) <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In operation, a secure association <b>30</b> is established between the SIM card <b>10</b> and the cell-site vault <b>20</b> during initialization of the base station <b>110</b>, with the security key management component <b>14</b> and the key management component <b>24</b> facilitating the execution of the UMTS-AKA procedure between the SIM card and the AAA infrastructure. The procedure establishes a unique binding between SIM card, the secure cell-site vault, the AAA infrastructure and the SEGW. The security function component <b>28</b> performs security functions with respect to communications packets handled by the base station <b>110</b> including encryption/decryption operations performed on communications packets sent to the mobile core <b>130</b> via the line interface <b>114</b>, as well as encryption/decryption operations performed on communications packets received at the line interface <b>114</b>. In the illustrated implementation, the first encryption component <b>26</b> performs encryption and decryption operations with respect to communications packets transferred between the base station <b>110</b> and the radio interface <b>122</b> of the mobile terminal <b>120</b> and the second encryption component <b>28</b> performs encryption and decryption security operations with respect to communications packets transferred between the base station <b>110</b> and a line interface <b>138</b> of the core network <b>130</b>. Other implementations are possible, in which the functions of the two security components <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are implemented by a single component, or these functions may be distributed across more than two components.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The SIM card <b>10</b> facilitates the security operations in the base station <b>110</b> by providing for operator configurable control of the provisioning of the base station <b>110</b>, which is particularly advantageous for base stations <b>110</b> that are sold and thereafter operated and maintained by the user. In practice, the operator may provision the SIM card <b>10</b> for operative connection to a given base station <b>110</b> at a point of sale or thereafter by the user, where the SIM card <b>10</b> performs the key management and other portions of the management features to effectively provision the base station <b>110</b> with operational information or data to facilitate (security) processing in the base station device <b>110</b>, and the SIM card <b>10</b> may perform other functions, including informing the base station <b>110</b> of which mobile core endpoint to use.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present disclosure allows the SIM card advantages with respect to controlled provisioning while providing the actual security processing within the secured cell-site vault <b>20</b> of the base station <b>110</b>. This solution provides an authentication mechanism to the deploying operator that is intimately tied with the base station <b>110</b> itself (e.g. the base station processing cell-site vault <b>20</b>) and does not travel with the SIM card <b>10</b>, thereby allowing the operator to decommission a base station <b>110</b> if needed by decommissioning the base station's SIM card. In this manner, the present disclosure provides a unique identity in the form of a secret key that is part of the initialization sequence of the base station <b>110</b> together with secure association establishment to grant or deny access to the operator's network <b>130</b>. If the core network <b>130</b> access is not granted, the base station <b>110</b> cannot be used for any other operator since SIM card authentication is part of the base station's initialization sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present disclosure extends the secured cell-site vault concept presented in Applicant's previous application Ser. No. 11/419,626 with the advantages of the SIM card <b>10</b> through authentication of the SIM card to the vault and vice versa. Using this distributed security environment it is now possible to safely perform provisioning of a base station <b>110</b> with credentials via the SIM card <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, an exemplary signal flow diagram <b>300</b> is provided, which illustrates an exemplary technique for provisioning the base station and security association establishment using the SIM card in accordance with further aspects of the disclosure, as well as optional establishment of a secondary security tunnel. The illustrated example operates to establish secure tunnels between the cell-site vault <b>20</b> and the gateway (SEGW) <b>137</b>, between the vault <b>20</b> and the AAA <b>131</b>, and a security association between the vault <b>20</b> and the SIM card <b>10</b>, by which existing SIM cards <b>10</b> may be used having authentication and key agreement (AKA) functions implemented through the USIM program. In this implementation, the SIM card <b>10</b> may incorporate software changes to be able to encrypt and decrypt messages, but no new functions or significant changes are required for establishing a secure association <b>30</b> between it and the cell-site vault <b>20</b>. This embodiment provides for ease of commercial sale by other than the service provider and deployment by the end user without provisioning long-term secrets in the vault <b>20</b> or the AAA component <b>131</b>. By this design, the base station <b>110</b> can be marketed and delivered to the end user outside the control of the service provider/network operator, while the base station vault <b>20</b> need not be pre-configured with any secure information specific to the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In operation of this embodiment, the vault <b>20</b> and the AAA component <b>131</b> may perform public key operations and the SIM card <b>10</b> does not. In the case of an integrated base station <b>110</b>, the base station manufacturer loads appropriate certificates into the cell-site vault <b>20</b>, and the network operator is provided with only the public keys of the base station manufacturers that will be deployed with the operator's network <b>130</b>. In one illustrative example, a user purchases a base station <b>110</b> from any store (e.g., retailer not owned or operated by a network operator/wireless service provider) and the user separately enters into a subscription with an operator. The network operator ships a base station's SIM card <b>10</b> to the user, who then inserts the SIM card <b>10</b> in to the base station <b>110</b> and begins use. As shown in the signal flow diagram <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, upon power up in the integrated base station <b>110</b>, the installed SIM card <b>10</b> sends a first message <b>301</b> to the vault <b>20</b> including a SIM_ID. The vault <b>20</b> then sends a message <b>302</b>, <b>303</b> to the AAA component <b>131</b> via the unsecured portion <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the base station <b>110</b> to initiate the tunnel establishment, with the message <b>303</b> from the unsecure portion <b>110</b><i>a </i>to the AAA component <b>131</b> including the base station ID. The AAA component <b>131</b> then initiates an SSL/TLS [RFC5246, incorporated herein by reference] connection by sending an SSL &#x201c;Hello&#x201d; message <b>304</b> back to the vault <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The vault <b>20</b> sends a base station certificate back to the AAA component <b>131</b> in a TLS/SSL server hello message <b>305</b>, wherein the manufacturer of the base station <b>110</b> may use a variety of techniques to create a base station certificate including a base station ID, manufacture ID, model ID and/or batch ID, and a public key, and load it into the vault <b>20</b>. The manufacturer can create the public/private key pair for the integrated base station <b>110</b> and load these into the base station <b>110</b>. In this case, the manufacturer signs the public key, base station ID, manufacture ID, model ID, and/or batch ID with the manufacturer's signing key and loads the signature to the integrated base station <b>110</b> before the base station is shipped. Note that alternate mechanisms for provisioning exist.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The AAA component <b>131</b> verifies the certificate at <b>310</b> including checking the base station ID from the message <b>305</b> against a list of acceptable base stations. At <b>310</b>, the AAA component <b>131</b> may look at the base station ID, manufacture ID, model ID, and/or the batch ID to determine whether a given base station <b>110</b> is acceptable to the operator's security policies, and may also check for specific blacklisted integrated base stations <b>110</b>. The AAA component <b>131</b> in this implementation is previously provisioned with the base station manufacturer's public key for signature verification and uses the public key to verify if the base station's certificate (and thus the base station's public key) is legitimate. The vault <b>20</b> and the AAA component <b>131</b> then initiate key exchange and other steps at <b>312</b> to complete an SSL/TLS tunnel by which the AAA component <b>313</b> has authenticated the cell-site vault <b>20</b> and is assured that the base station <b>110</b> has a secure vault <b>20</b> and that it is acceptable to the network operator's security policies. At this point, the integrated base station <b>110</b> has not authenticated the AAA component <b>131</b> or matched the SIM card <b>10</b> with the operator's AAA component <b>131</b>, and the component <b>131</b> has not authenticated the SIM card <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Accordingly, the process <b>300</b> continues with the vault <b>20</b> sending the SIM_ID to the AAA component <b>131</b> in a message <b>316</b> inside the SSL/TLS tunnel established at <b>312</b> the AAA component <b>131</b> then sends a message <b>317</b> to the operator's authentication center (AC) <b>132</b> requesting that the AC <b>132</b> associated with the SIM card <b>10</b> to respond with an AKA vector in a reply message <b>318</b>. With this, the AAA component <b>131</b> sends the authentication vector AV with RAND, AUTN, XRES, CK, IK in a message <b>319</b> to the vault <b>20</b> inside the SSL tunnel. The UMTS-AKA procedure is described in detail in 3GPP 33.102.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the vault <b>20</b> then sends the RAND, AUTN to the SIM card <b>10</b> via a message <b>320</b>, and the SIM card <b>10</b> verifies the AUTN and returns the RES value in a message <b>321</b> to the vault <b>20</b>. At this point the cell-site vault <b>20</b> can verify RES to XRES and when there is agreement knows that the SIM card <b>10</b> has authenticated the AAA component <b>131</b> and thus the base station <b>110</b> can now trust the AAA component <b>131</b>. The result of the comparison is signaled to AAA with message <b>322</b>. In an alternative embodiment, AAA component only transmits RAND and AUTN to vault <b>20</b> in message <b>319</b> and the RES is forwarded by the vault <b>20</b> in a message <b>322</b> to the AAA component <b>131</b> inside the TLS/SSL tunnel, and the AAA component <b>131</b> checks that the RES equals the XRES. In an exemplary normal AKA processing implementation, the CK and IK keys are also returned by the SIM card <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At this point the AAA component <b>131</b> is assured that this integrated base station <b>110</b> has a legitimate SIM card <b>10</b> with a SIM_ID attached to the vault <b>20</b>, and the secured association <b>30</b> is established. At <b>330</b>, the SIM card <b>10</b> establishes keys CK and IK and sends these to the vault <b>20</b> via message <b>330</b><i>a</i>. The AAA component <b>131</b> uses the earlier indication of successful completion of the secure association <b>30</b> as the establishment of the SIM card <b>10</b> on the particular base station <b>110</b>. Next, standard SSL/TLS mechanisms may be used to establish a secure tunnel between the SEGW and the vault at <b>340</b>. In one optional implementation, the AAA component <b>131</b> randomly picks keys CK&#x2032; and IK&#x2032; at <b>332</b> for the secure gateway <b>137</b> for establishing this second tunnel, and sends these to the keys to the SEGW <b>137</b> via a message <b>334</b>. The AAA component <b>131</b> in this implementation also sends the CK&#x2032; and IK&#x2032; keys to the vault <b>20</b> via a message <b>335</b> to establish a vault-SEGW tunnel at <b>340</b>. In another embodiment, the AAA creates a new session key that it signals to both the SEGW and vault.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the above described situation, the base station <b>110</b> will be operative in association with any operator's AAA component <b>131</b> and any legitimate SIM card <b>10</b>. Other implementations are possible in which the integrated base station operation can be restricted to a specific operator. For example, the base station manufacturer could sign a usage_certificate using its private key stating that only a specific network operator A can use base station ID. The vault <b>20</b> in this case will also have the manufacturer's public key for signing verification. After the vault <b>20</b> sends the message <b>305</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the AAA component <b>131</b> in this implementation sends this &#x2018;usage_certificate&#x2019; to the vault <b>20</b> inside the TLS/SSL tunnel and the vault <b>20</b> uses the manufacturer's public key to verify it and grant access.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As noted in the above described embodiments, once the SSL/TLS tunnel is established at <b>312</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), the AAA component <b>131</b> knows that it is talking to a secure vault <b>20</b> and that there are no &#x201c;man in the middle&#x201d; attackers since the vault <b>20</b> acts like a server in SSL/TLS with a server certificate. After the AKA is then performed at <b>317</b>, <b>318</b> and the proper RES is received at <b>322</b>, the AAA component <b>131</b> knows that the legitimate SIM card <b>10</b> is attached to the vault <b>20</b> and security is complete. The SIM card <b>10</b> knows that if it receives a legitimate AUTN in the message <b>320</b> which includes a proper AKA sequence number and a MAC, the SIM card <b>10</b> can trust the vault <b>20</b> and it has established TLS/SSL with the vault <b>20</b>, since the current valid AUTN is only sent over the TLS/SSL tunnel. If the MAC is incorrect then the connection is rejected, and if the MAC is correct and the sequence number is out of range, then a resync process is initiated. The authentication center <b>132</b> and the AAA component <b>131</b> are thus operative to protect the AKA vectors and to not reveal them, and also to ensure that the AKA vectors are not repeated. From the base station's perspective, if either the SIM card <b>10</b> or the AAA component <b>131</b> is an imposter, the AKA protocol would not be satisfied, and if both are imposters.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The disclosed embodiments further provide protection against so-called &#x201c;bad neighbor&#x201d; attacks. These attacks involve a &#x201c;bad neighbor&#x201d; base station's cell may attempt to overpower a friendly neighbor's handset so that the friendly neighbor's calls go through the attacker's base station, and the attacker may eavesdrop on such calls. In the implementations of the disclosure, if the attacker's base station <b>110</b> has a vault <b>20</b> then eavesdropping cannot happen, and an operator can ensure that all the base stations <b>110</b> in its network have a secure vault <b>20</b>. While it is difficult to provide protection for handsets that roam to a different operator's base station, an operator can try to protect its handset users by requiring that the handsets can place calls only through the operator's base stations and only via base stations deployed by its trusted partners, for instance, using policies that all of the base stations run by the operator have a secure vault <b>20</b> and any roaming partner whose base station can carry an operator's handsets call should also have a secure vault <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present disclosure also contemplates associating a single SIM card <b>10</b> with multiple base stations <b>110</b>. For example, each base station vault <b>20</b> could send RAND/AUTN queries (e.g., message <b>320</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) to such a SIM card <b>10</b> and receive a corresponding response (e.g., <b>321</b>). In accordance with the disclosure, however, such undesirable usage can be mitigated or avoided by the AAA component <b>131</b> ensuring that the SIM card <b>10</b> can only be associated with one base station ID at any given time. In this manner, a SIM card <b>10</b> may be used in one base station <b>110</b> for a time and may thereafter be switched to another station <b>110</b>. It may be important to periodically re-verify the availability of the SIM card/secure cell-site vault association.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Other alternative implementations are possible, wherein the various aspects of the disclosure are amenable to variations of the tunnel establishment. The disclosure facilitates leveraging a base station manufacturer's certificate installed in the vault <b>20</b> so that the network operator does not need to deal with a separate secret key in each vault <b>20</b> and does not require that the key also be known and provisioned in the operator's AAA/AuC. For example, while TLS/SSL tunnel may be employed as described above in the verification of the vault <b>20</b> by the AAA component <b>131</b> and in the tunnel establishment, other public key protocols may also be employed, wherein all such alternative implementations are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present disclosure. Moreover, while the above embodiments are illustrated and described as using a CK and IK in the SIM card <b>10</b> to create a security association between the SIM card <b>10</b> and the vault <b>20</b>, and no tunnel is required between the SIM card <b>10</b> and the AAA component <b>131</b>, if such a tunnel is desired, the AKA pseudorandom function f<b>3</b> can be used to create CK<b>1</b>=f<b>3</b>(CK, &#x201c;1&#x201d;), CK<b>2</b>=f<b>3</b>(CK, &#x201c;2&#x201d;) and IK<b>1</b>=f<b>3</b>(IK, &#x201c;1&#x201d;), <b>1</b>K<b>2</b>=f<b>3</b>(IK, &#x201c;2&#x201d;). With this, CK<b>1</b> and IK<b>1</b> can be used to establish a secured tunnel between the SIM card <b>10</b> and the AAA component <b>131</b>, whereas CK<b>2</b> and IK<b>2</b> can be used for the security association <b>30</b> between the SIM card <b>10</b> and the vault <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present disclosure further contemplates a method for securing a base station using a SIM card. The method includes operatively coupling the SIM card (e.g., card <b>10</b> above) to the base station (e.g., base station <b>110</b>), and establishing a secure tunnel between a secure portion of the base station (e.g., vault <b>20</b>) and an authentication component (e.g., AAA component <b>131</b>) of a core communications network (e.g., core network <b>130</b> above). A secure association (e.g., association <b>30</b> above) is established between the SIM card and the secure portion of the base station, and this secure association establishment is confirmed to the authentication component. In certain embodiments, the establishment of the secure tunnel between the secure portion of the base station and the authentication component is accomplished by an IKE protocol, a TLS protocol, or an Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedure. In addition, the secure association may be established between the SIM card and the secure portion of the base station by executing a UMTS AKA procedure. In the above described system, for example, the process can be employed with respect to the SIM card <b>10</b> in a base station <b>110</b> with a secure (vault) portion <b>20</b> and the AAA component <b>131</b> of the core network <b>130</b>, where the AAA component may be with or without a secure gateway <b>137</b>. In the above implementation, the AAA component <b>131</b> can be pre-provisioned with a vault key (Kv) and a SIM key (Ks), where Kv can be a public/private key pair or a secret key, and Ks in one implementation can be a shared secret key in exactly the same fashion as in the USIM/SIM used for cell phones. The vault <b>20</b> and the AAA component <b>131</b> set up a secure tunnel via a protocol such as IKE, TLS, or even some AKA procedure, and the vault and SIM card establish contact and execute UMTS-AKA in one example. The vault <b>20</b> executes the protocol to the AAA component <b>131</b> of the core network <b>130</b> through the tunnel, or alternatively the AAA component <b>131</b> can signal the Ks to the vault <b>20</b> to allow the vault <b>20</b> to run the protocol itself. The AAA component <b>131</b> then uses the successful completion of UMTS-AKA between the USIM/SIM <b>10</b> and the AAA component <b>131</b> as the establishment of the SIM card <b>10</b> on the particular Femto base station <b>110</b>.</p>
