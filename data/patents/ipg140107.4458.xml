<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;EUTRA&#x201d;) aimed at high speed communication has been examined by a standardized group, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), by introducing technology examined for a 4th generation frequency bandwidth into a 3rd generation frequency bandwidth (Non-Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In EUTRA, as a communication method, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA) is used. OFDMA is a communication method which is strong against multi-path interference and suitable for high speed transmission. In addition, a specification for an operation of an upper layer in EUTRA includes low latency and low overhead and simplified technology is being employed. The operation of the upper layer includes data transmission control, resource management control, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a cellular mobile communication method, a mobile station device needs to be wirelessly synchronized with a base station device in advance in a cell or a sector. For this reason, the base station device transmits a synchronization channel (SCH) having a defined structure to the mobile station device. Then, the mobile station device is synchronized with the base station device by detecting the synchronization channel (SCH). The cell or the sector is a communication area of the base station device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In EUTRA, as the synchronization channel (SCH), a P-SCH (primary SCH, primary synchronization channel) and an S-SCH (secondary SCH, secondary synchronization channel) are prepared. Each cell (or sector) is identified by the mobile station device by the use of a cell ID determined by the signals of the primary synchronization channel (P-SCH) and the secondary synchronization channel (S-SCH).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The cell ID is determined by a combination of 3 types of primary synchronization channels (P-SCHs) and 168 types of secondary synchronization channels (S-SCHs), for a total of 504 (3&#xd7;168=504).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a flowchart showing a process in a conventional cell search method.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The mobile station device performs a P-SCH identification process by correlating a replica signal of a primary synchronization channel (P-SCH) with a received signal. Accordingly, the mobile station device acquires slot timing (step S<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The mobile station device then performs an S-SCH identification process by correlating a replica signal of a secondary synchronization channel (S-SCH) with the received signal. Accordingly, the mobile station device acquires frame timing by an acquired transmission pattern of the secondary synchronization channel (S-SCH). In addition, the mobile station device acquires a cell identification (ID) for identifying the base station device (step S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Such a series of control, that is, a step control up to the mobile station device executing wireless synchronization with the base station device and specifying the cell ID of the base station device is referred to as a cell search procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a cellular mobile communication method including EUTRA, a mobile station device communicates with a base station device within a cell (or a sector) that is a communication area of the base station device. When the mobile station device is wirelessly connected to a certain base station device, a cell where the mobile station device is located is referred to as a serving cell. Meanwhile, a cell located around the serving cell is referred to as a neighboring cell.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The mobile station device can determine a cell having a satisfactory quality by measuring and comparing the reception qualities of the serving cell and the neighboring cell. A process in which the mobile station device moves from the serving cell to the neighboring cell to change a cell to which the mobile station device is wirelessly connected is referred to as a handover.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this case, a signal used for the mobile station device to determine the levels of reception qualities of cells is referred to as a downlink reference signal. The downlink reference signal is a predetermined signal sequence corresponding to a cell ID. That is, it is possible to uniquely specify a downlink reference signal simultaneously transmitted from a cell by identifying a cell ID of the cell (Non-Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a diagram showing an example of a configuration of a radio frame in EUTRA. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the horizontal axis indicates time, and the vertical axis indicates frequency. The radio frame consists of an area (a shaded area of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) including a predetermined frequency area (BR) and a predetermined transmission time interval (slot) as one unit (Non-Patent Document 1). The frequency area (BR) is the assembly of a plurality of sub-carriers arranged on the frequency axis.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The transmission time interval consisting of the integer times of one slot is referred to as a sub-frame. A combination of a plurality of sub-frames is referred to as a frame. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, one sub-frame consists of two slots.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An area (the shaded area of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) divided by the predetermined frequency area (BR) and the length of one slot is referred to as a resource block. In addition, one frame consists of 10 sub-frames. BW of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> indicates a bandwidth of a system, and BR indicates a bandwidth of the resource block.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a flowchart showing a handover procedure used in EUTRA. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a control operation in which the mobile station device communicates with a cell of a handover source (hereinafter, referred to as a source cell), and a handover to a cell of a handover destination (hereinafter, referred to as a neighboring cell) is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The following procedure will be described on the assumption that the cell ID of the source cell is CID_A, and the cell ID of the neighboring cell is CID_B. Here, the mobile station device receives each of the downlink reference signals of the CID_A and the CID_B from each of the base station device having the cell ID of CID_A and the base station device having the cell ID of CID_B (steps S<b>001</b> and S<b>002</b>). Then, the mobile station device measures the reception quality acquired from each of the downlink reference signals.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The mobile station device then performs a measurement report process (step S<b>003</b>). That is, the base station device having the cell ID of CID_A is notified of the measurement result of the mobile station device as a measurement report message (step S<b>004</b>). The base station device having the cell ID of CID_A determines whether the handover to the base station device having the cell ID of CID_B is necessary based on the contents of the measurement report message. When it is determined that the handover is necessary, the base station device having the cell ID of CID_A notifies the mobile station device of the necessity of the handover to the base station device having the cell ID of CID_B using a handover request message (step S<b>005</b>), and requests the preparation for the handover.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When it is determined that the handover can be performed, the base station device having the cell ID of CID_B that has received the handover request message notifies the base station device having the cell ID of CID_A of a handover request permission message (step S<b>006</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The base station device having the cell ID of CID_A that has received the handover request permission message notifies the mobile station device of a handover command message (referred to as a handover command) (step S<b>007</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the mobile station device receives the message, the handover process starts (step S<b>008</b>). When a handover execution time is included in the handover command message, the mobile station device performs the handover when the handover execution time lapses.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some cases, immediate execution may be designated as the handover execution time. The mobile station device changes a control parameter of a transmission/reception circuit or a radio frequency designated by the handover command message at the handover execution time. Subsequently, the mobile station device performs a downlink synchronization setup process for setting up downlink wireless synchronization with the base station device having the cell ID of CID_B (handover process).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The control parameter for the downlink synchronization setup process is included in the prior handover command message, or the mobile station device is informed or notified thereof in advance by the cell having the cell ID of CID_A. After the downlink synchronization setup is completed, the mobile station device performs a random access transmission so as to set up uplink synchronization with the cell having the cell ID of CID_B (step S<b>009</b>). This process may be called a handover access.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In fact, the random access is performed by using a (contention-based) channel which may cause conflict. However, a method is proposed which allocates a preamble sequence (dedicated preamble) in the handover command message to each mobile station device in advance, for the purpose of the (contention-free) random access transmission not causing conflict (Non-Patent Document 2).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The mobile station device performs the random access transmission using the preamble sequence designated in the handover command message. The base station device having the cell ID of CID_B that has received the preamble sequence determines that the handover of the corresponding mobile station device is completed. Then, the base station device having the cell ID of CID_B notifies the mobile station device of uplink resource allocation information for transmitting a handover completion message (which may be called a handover confirm) and uplink synchronization information for adjusting the uplink transmission timing (step S<b>010</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The mobile station device adjusts the uplink transmission timing based on the above-described information, transmits the handover completion message to the base station device having the cell ID of CID_B using the designated uplink resource, and then completes the handover (step S<b>011</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, whether the downlink reference signal is described as downlink reference signal (Reference signal) or DL-RS (Downlink Reference signal) in Non-Patent Document 1, the meaning is the same.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">However, in the cell search procedure and the handover procedure of the conventional art, when the same cell ID is allocated to the base station device, that is, a plurality of base station devices having the same primary synchronization channel (P-SCH) and secondary synchronization channel (S-SCH) are in an area, it is not possible to guarantee the operation of the mobile station device in that area. This will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a flowchart showing the handover procedure when the same cell ID is measured by the mobile station device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a case where the conflicting cell having the same cell ID (CID_B) as the neighboring cell of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is in the same area.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Here, the mobile station device receives the downlink reference signal from each of the source cell (CID_A), the neighboring cell (CID_B), and the conflicting cell (CID_B) (steps S<b>020</b>, S<b>021</b>, and S<b>022</b>). Then, the mobile station device measures the reception quality acquired from each of the downlink reference signals.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">However, in the cell search procedure of the conventional art, since the mobile station device can detect only 2 types of cell IDs of CID_A and CID_B, the mobile station device cannot recognize if there are two cells having the same cell ID (CID_B).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For this reason, the downlink reference signals of the neighboring cell (CID_B) and the conflicting cell (CID_B) are measured without distinguishing them, and the CID_A is notified of the measurement report message (step S<b>024</b>) according to the measurement report process (step S<b>023</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">That is, when the neighboring cell (CID_B) and the conflicting cell (CID_B) are synchronized, the synthesized downlink reference signal is measured in the mobile station device. In addition, when the neighboring cell (CID_B) and the conflicting cell (CID_B) are not synchronized, one of the downlink reference signals is determined as a delay wave in the mobile station device.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the state where the cell IDs conflict with each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a plurality of problems arise. For example, the source cell (CID_A) cannot recognize whether the reception quality of the CID_B cell included in the measurement report message from the mobile station device belongs to the neighboring cell (CID_B) or the conflicting cell (CID_B).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, when it is reported that the reception quality of the CID_B cell is acquired by synthesizing the reception qualities of the neighboring cell (CID_B) and the conflicting cell (CID_B), the reception quality cannot be suitably used for the handover reference. Further, even when the source cell (CID_A) transmits the handover command message to the neighboring cell (CID_B) to the mobile station device, it is not possible to clearly designate the neighboring cell (CID_B) as the cell of the handover destination. Accordingly, there is a possibility of the mobile station device executing the handover to the conflicting cell (CID_B).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In Non-Patent Document 3, in order to solve the problem caused by the same cell IDs, a method is disclosed in which unique IDs (Global Cell Identity, hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;GCID&#x201d;) prepared sufficiently more than at least 504 types of cell IDs are allocated to all cells together with the cell IDs.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Because of using the GCID, it is possible to identify conflicting cells that cannot be identified by only the cell ID, using the GCID. In addition, by designating the cell of the handover destination using the GCID in the handover command message, it is possible to clearly designate the cell of the handover destination of the mobile station device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the method using the GCID shown in Non-Patent Document 3, even when the same cell ID is allocated to at least two cells (conflicting cells) in the measurement area, the mobile station device needs to autonomously identify the conflicting cell based on the synchronization channel (SCH) and the downlink reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">However, it is difficult for the mobile station device to autonomously detect the allocation of the same cell ID, and divide and receive each of the radio signals.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For this reason, when there is a conflicting cell, a problem arises in that the process in the communication between the mobile station device and the base station device becomes complicated.

<p id="p-0081" num="0111">Hereinafter, respective embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0112">Physical channels according to the respective embodiments of the present invention include a broadcast channel, an uplink data channel, a downlink data channel, a downlink common control channel, an uplink common control channel, a random access channel, a synchronization channel (SCH), and a reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0113">In the respective embodiments of the present invention, the uplink data channel and the downlink data channel are classified as data channels. In addition, the broadcast channel, the downlink common control channel, the uplink common control channel, and the random access channel are classified as control channels.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0114">Further, the synchronization channel (SCH) and the reference signal are classified as radio signals. There is a possibility for a physical channel to be further added in the future, but the description of the embodiments of the present invention is not influenced by the added physical channel. Furthermore, examples of the reference signal include a downlink reference signal and an uplink reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0115">Since the physical channels according to the respective embodiments of the present invention are the broadcast channel and the downlink reference signal, the detailed description of the other physical channels is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0116">The broadcast channel (BCH) is transmitted from the base station device to the mobile station device for the purpose of notifying the control parameter commonly used in the mobile station devices in the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0117">The broadcast channel (BCH) is classified into a P-BCH (primary BCH, primary broadcast channel) and a D-BCH (dynamic BCH, dynamic broadcast channel).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0118">The primary broadcast channel (P-BCH) is determined in advance to be transmitted in a predetermined period in terms of time and frequency, and the mobile station device can receive the P-BCH for the cell having the identified cell ID. The primary broadcast channel (P-BCH) is transmitted from the base station device to the mobile station device using a central sub-carrier of a sub-frame #0.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0119">Meanwhile, the dynamic broadcast channel (D-BCH) is transmitted from the base station device to the mobile station device using the downlink common control channel, and a transmission location may be changed for each cell.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0120">The downlink reference signal is a pilot signal which is transmitted from the base station device to the mobile station device by quasi-static power for each cell. In addition, the downlink reference signal is repeated periodically at a predetermined time interval (for example, one frame). The mobile station device receives the downlink reference signal at a predetermined time interval, and uses the downlink reference signal to determine the reception quality for each cell.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0121">The downlink reference signal is also used as a reference signal for demodulating downlink data transmitted together with the downlink reference signal. Any arbitrary sequence that can be uniquely identified for each cell can be used as the sequence used in the downlink reference signal.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0161">Here, the reception quality is a SUTRA carrier RSSI (received signal strength indicator), RSRP (reference signal received power), RSRQ (reference signal reception quality), path loss, or the like.</p>

<p id="p-0134" num="0164">For example, a method of restricting an output corresponding to the cell having the conflicting cell ID when outputting the correlation signal or the reference data may be adopted.</p>

The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> starts when the mobile station device <b>100</b> receives the conflicting cell ID information.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0166">First, the received conflicting cell ID information is recorded in the cell ID management unit <b>1073</b><i>a </i>(step S<b>11</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0167">Subsequently, it is determined whether the cell ID designated by the conflicting cell ID information (a conflicting cell ID) is included in the cell ID input to the sequence selection unit <b>1072</b><i>a </i>(a detected cell ID) (step S<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0168">When the conflicting cell ID is included (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; in step S<b>12</b>), the signal other than the downlink reference signal corresponding to the conflicting cell ID is selected by the sequence selection unit <b>1072</b><i>a </i>(step S<b>13</b>). When the conflicting cell ID is not included (&#x201c;NO&#x201d; in step S<b>12</b>), the downlink reference signal based on the reception control signal is selected by the sequence selection unit <b>1072</b><i>a </i>(step S<b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0169">The correlation processing unit <b>1074</b><i>a </i>correlates the extracted signal of the received downlink reference signal with the selected signal of step S<b>13</b> or S<b>14</b> (step S<b>15</b>) and outputs a correlation signal.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0170">According to the present embodiment, the measurement report of the reception quality of the cell of the conflicting cell ID from the mobile station device <b>100</b> to the base station device <b>200</b> is not performed. For this reason, the reception quality of the cell of the conflicting cell ID is not used as the handover reference, and the cell of the handover destination is not designated by the handover command message. The management of GCID is performed only by the base station device <b>200</b>, and the management is not performed by the mobile station device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0171">According to the present embodiment, since the base station device <b>200</b> explicitly indicates that the same cell IDs exist and conflict with each other, the mobile station device <b>100</b> does not need to measure the downlink reference signal of the conflicting cell. Accordingly, it is possible to improve the possibility of success of the handover by removing uncertainty during the handover of not recognizing to which of the conflicting cells the mobile station device <b>100</b> is handed over.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0172">In addition, the mobile station device does not need to measure the unnecessary reception quality of the conflicting cell. Further, since the measurement report message of the conflicting cell is not transmitted from the mobile station device <b>100</b> to the base station device <b>200</b>, it is possible to reduce consumption power in the mobile station device.</p>

<p id="p-0143" num="0173">Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. A mobile communication system according to the second embodiment includes a base station device and a mobile station device.

<p id="p-0144" num="0174">However, the mobile station device <b>100</b> according to the second embodiment includes a downlink reference signal processing unit <b>107</b><i>b </i>instead of the downlink reference signal processing unit <b>107</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0175">The second embodiment provides a structure in which the mobile station device <b>100</b> acquiring the conflicting cell ID information can identify the reception quality of each of the conflicting cell IDs by receiving the GCID before the measurement report process.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0176">The present embodiment is preferable when the transmission timings between the base station devices <b>200</b> are not synchronized, but may also be applied when the transmission timings between the base station devices <b>200</b> are synchronized.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a sequence diagram showing a handover procedure according to the second embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the handover procedure in the event of conflict of the cell IDs. The relationship of the mobile station device <b>100</b> and the serving cell and the neighboring cell is the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In addition, the transmission (steps S<b>102</b>, S<b>103</b>, and S<b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the downlink reference signal from the respective cells is not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0178">The source cell notifies the mobile station device <b>100</b> before or during the measurement of the conflicting cell ID information (step S<b>201</b>). The conflicting cell ID information includes at least a cell ID (CID_B). When notifying the mobile station device of the conflicting cell ID information, the source cell (CID_A) may use the broadcast channel (any one of P-BCH and D-BCH), or the downlink common control channel.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0179">Other arbitrary physical channels or messages that enable the source cell to notify the mobile station device <b>100</b> of the conflicting cell ID information may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0180">The mobile station device <b>100</b> acquiring the conflicting cell ID information performs a GCID acquisition process (step S<b>202</b>). In the GCID acquisition process, a broadcast channel is received from the cell having the cell ID (CID_B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) transmitted in the conflicting cell ID information, and a GCID (GCID_B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) allocated to the cell having the designated cell ID is acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0181">The mobile station device <b>100</b> receives the GCID (steps S<b>203</b> and S<b>204</b>) and performs a measurement involved with the acquired GCID and the cell ID in a measurement report process in conflicting occasion (step S<b>205</b>). Specifically, in the case where the cells are not synchronized, when the reception timings of the downlink reference signal and the broadcast channel are the same, it is determined that it is a channel transmitted from the same cell. For each cell, the reception quality of the downlink reference signal is correlated with the GCID acquired from the broadcast channel.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0182">When the cells are synchronized, the mobile station device predicts the reception quality of the received downlink reference signal for each cell based on the reception quality (the received power, the block error rate (BLER), and the like) of the broadcast channel. Then, the mobile station device correlates the predicted reception quality of the downlink reference signal with the GCID acquired from the broadcast channel.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0183">For example, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when a reception power ratio of the broadcast channel of the GCID_C and the broadcast channel of the GCID_B is 1 to 2, the reception quality of the downlink reference signal received through the CID_B is divided according to the GCID_B:GCID_C=1:2 and reported as respective reception qualities. Alternatively, the downlink reference signal of the cell having the conflicting cell ID information is not synthesized with the received signal and respective qualities of the signals are measured and reported as the reception qualities.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0184">By the measurement report process in conflicting occasion, the source cell is transmitted the measurement result through the measurement report message (CID_A) (step S<b>206</b>). In this case, the reception quality that correlates the cell ID with the acquired GCID is set in the measurement report message. However, the reception quality of a cell other than the cell ID transmitted as the conflicting cell ID information may correspond to only the cell ID in the normal case.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0185">The source cell (CID_A) can determine whether the reception quality measured by the mobile station device <b>100</b> belongs to the neighboring cell (CID_B) or the conflicting cell (CID_B) based on the contents of the measurement report message. When the source cell determines that the handover to the neighboring cell (CID_B) is necessary, the source cell (CID_A) notifies the neighboring cell (CID_B) of the necessity of the handover of the mobile station device <b>100</b> in the handover request message to request the preparation for the handover (step S<b>207</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0186">When it is determined that the handover can be performed, the neighboring cell (CID_B) receiving the handover request message notifies the source cell (CID_A) of the handover request permission message (step S<b>208</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0187">The source cell (CID_A) receiving the handover request permission message notifies the mobile station device <b>100</b> of the handover command message (step S<b>209</b>). At this time, when the cell of the conflicting cell ID is designated by the handover command message, the handover command message including both the cell ID and the GCID is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0188">The handover process starts when the mobile station device <b>100</b> receives the message. When the handover execution time is included in the handover command message, the mobile station device <b>100</b> performs the handover when the handover execution time lapses (step S<b>210</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0189">In some cases, immediate execution may be designated as the handover execution time. The mobile station device <b>100</b> changes the control parameter of the transmission/reception circuit or the radio frequency designated by the handover command message at the handover execution time. Subsequently, the mobile station device <b>100</b> performs a downlink synchronization setup process for setting up the downlink wireless synchronization with the designated neighboring cell CID_B (handover process).</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0190">The control parameter for the downlink synchronization setup process is included in the prior handover command message, or the mobile station device is informed or transmitted thereof in advance by the source cell (CID_A). After completing the downlink synchronization setup, the mobile station device <b>100</b> performs a random access transmission so as to set up uplink synchronization with the neighboring cell (CID_B) (step S<b>211</b>). Since the process of steps S<b>212</b> and S<b>213</b> is the same as the process of steps S<b>212</b> and S<b>213</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a description thereof is omitted.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0209" num="0239">Next, a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described. The mobile communication system according to the fourth embodiment includes the base station device and the mobile station device. Since the configurations of the base station device and the mobile station device according to the fourth embodiment are the same as those of the base station device <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the mobile station device <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) according to the first embodiment, a description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0240">The fourth embodiment provides a structure capable of identifying the reception quality of the cell having each conflicting cell ID by including the cell ID and the GCID in the conflicting cell ID information and receiving and the GCID before the measurement report process. In addition, the present embodiment provides a structure in which the reception quality of the cell having the designated GCID is not reported by the mobile station device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0241">The present embodiment is preferable when the transmission timings between the base station devices <b>200</b> are not synchronized. However, the present embodiment may be applied even when the transmission timings between the base station devices <b>200</b> are synchronized.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0242"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a sequence diagram showing a measurement report process in the mobile station device <b>100</b> according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the measurement report process in the mobile station device <b>100</b> in the event of conflict of the cell ID. The relationship of the mobile station device <b>100</b>, the serving cell and neighboring cells is the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0243">The source cell notifies the mobile station device <b>100</b> before or during measurement of the conflicting cell ID information (step S<b>401</b>). The conflicting cell ID information includes at least the cell ID (for example, CID_B) and the GCID (for example, GCID_C).</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0244">When notifying the mobile station device <b>100</b> of the conflicting cell ID information, the source cell (CID_A) may use the broadcast channel (any one of P-BCH and D-BCH), or the downlink common control channel.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0245">Other arbitrary physical channels or messages that enable the source cell to notify mobile station device <b>100</b> of the conflicting cell ID information may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0246">The mobile station device <b>100</b> acquiring the conflicting cell ID information performs a GCID acquisition process (step S<b>402</b>). In the GCID acquisition process, the broadcast channel is received from the cell having the cell ID (CID_B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) transmitted by the conflicting cell ID information, and the GCID allocated to the cell having the designated cell ID is acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0247">The mobile station device <b>100</b> receives the GCID (steps S<b>403</b> and S<b>404</b>), and performs a conflicting GCID exception process (step S<b>405</b>). In the conflicting GCID exception process, the process of receiving the downlink reference signal for the cell having the GCID (GCID_C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) indicated by the conflicting cell ID information, and the reception quality measurement are restricted to perform a control so that it is not used to determine the reception quality of the cells, or a report of an event (for example, establishment of a handover condition or the like) based on the reception quality of the cell of the GCID indicated by the conflicting cell ID information is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0248">Specifically, in the case where the cells are not synchronized, when the reception timings of the downlink reference signal and the broadcast channel are the same, the mobile station device <b>100</b> determines that it is a channel transmitted from the same cell. Then, the mobile station device <b>100</b> correlates the reception quality of the downlink reference signal with the GCID acquired from the broadcast channel for each cell. Then, the mobile station device <b>100</b> restricts the report of the downlink reference signal to the cell having the GCID as the conflicting cell.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0249">When the cells are synchronized, the mobile station device <b>100</b> predicts the reception quality of the received downlink reference signal for each cell based on the reception quality (the received power, the BLER, and the like) of the broadcast channel. Then, the mobile station device <b>100</b> correlates the predicted reception quality of the downlink reference signal with the GCID acquired from the broadcast channel. Alternatively, the mobile station device <b>100</b> measures qualities of the downlink reference signal of the cell having the conflicting cell ID information and the received signal, with the signals not being synthesized, and correlates the qualities with the GCID acquired from the broadcast channel.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0250">The report of the downlink reference signal to the cell having the GCID as the conflicting cell is restricted. In the conflicting cell ID exception process, the mobile station device <b>100</b> restricts the process of receiving the downlink reference signal for the cell having the GCID (GCID_C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) indicated by the conflicting cell ID information, and the reception quality measurement to perform a control so that it is not used to determine the reception quality of the cells. Accordingly, the reception quality of the cell having the GCID_C is not included in the measurement report message in the measurement report process (step S<b>406</b>), and is transmitted to the source cell (CID_A) (step S<b>407</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0251">Since the downlink reference signal processing unit of the mobile station device <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment can be the same as the downlink reference signal processing unit <b>107</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a detailed description thereof is omitted. However, a process capable of outputting a reference data other than the downlink reference signal involved with the cell having the designated GCID is performed in the downlink reference signal processing unit <b>107</b><i>b </i>of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0252">For example, when the selected signal, the correlation signal, or the reference data is output, the output corresponding to the cell having the GCID designated by the conflicting cell ID information (the conflicting cell ID) is restricted. In addition, the GCID acquisition process may be the same as the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0253"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a flowchart showing a GCID exception process in the downlink reference signal processing unit <b>107</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the mobile station device <b>100</b> according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> starts when the mobile station device <b>100</b> receives the conflicting cell ID information. First, the mobile station device <b>100</b> records the received conflicting cell ID information in the cell ID management unit <b>1073</b><i>b </i>(step S<b>41</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0254">Subsequently, it is determined whether the cell ID designated by the conflicting cell ID information (the conflicting cell ID) is included in the cell ID input to the sequence selection unit <b>1072</b><i>b </i>(a detected cell ID) (step S<b>42</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0255">When the conflicting cell ID is included (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; in step S<b>42</b>), the sequence selection unit <b>1072</b><i>b </i>further determines whether the conflicting cell ID is the GCID designated by the conflicting cell ID information (step S<b>43</b>). When the conflicting cell ID is the designated GCID (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; in step S<b>43</b>), the sequence selection unit <b>1072</b><i>b </i>selects the signal other than the downlink reference signal corresponding to the GCID of the conflicting cell ID (step S<b>44</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0256">When the conflicting cell ID is not included, or the conflicting cell ID is not the designated GCID (&#x201c;NO&#x201d; in step S<b>42</b>, and &#x201c;NO&#x201d; in step S<b>43</b>), the downlink reference signal based on the reception control signal is selected by the sequence selection unit <b>1072</b><i>b </i>(step S<b>45</b>). The correlation processing unit <b>1074</b><i>b </i>then correlates the selected signal of step S<b>45</b> with the extracted signal of the received downlink reference signal (step S<b>46</b>), and outputs the correlation signal.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0257">In addition, in the present embodiment, the mobile station device <b>100</b> may not exclude the reception quality of the cell having the GCID designated by the conflicting cell ID information, but may exclude the reception quality of the cell other than the designated GCID.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0258">According to the present embodiment, the measurement report of the reception quality of the cell having the designated GCID among the conflicting cell IDs is not performed in the mobile station device <b>100</b>. For this reason, the reception quality of the cell having the designated GCID is not used as the handover reference, and the cell of the handover destination is not designated by the handover command message.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0259">In addition, when the mobile station device <b>100</b> has received the conflicting cell ID information, the mobile station device <b>100</b> may acquire only the GCID of the designated cell, and accordingly, a measurement processing procedure in an area without the conflicting cells may be the same as that of the normal case.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0260">According to the present embodiment, since the base station device <b>200</b> explicitly indicates that the same cell IDs are present and conflict with each other, the mobile station device <b>100</b> need not measure the downlink reference signal of the cell having the designated GCID among the conflicting cell IDS. Accordingly, it is possible to improve the success possibility of the handover by removing uncertainty during the handover of not recognizing to which of the conflicting cells the mobile station device <b>100</b> is handed over.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0261">In addition, the mobile station device <b>100</b> need not measure the unnecessary reception quality for the cell of the designated GCID among the conflicting cell IDs. Further, since the mobile station device <b>100</b> does not transmit the measurement report message for the cell of the designated GCID, it is possible to reduce consumption power.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0262">In addition, in the above-described embodiments, the control of the mobile station device <b>100</b> or the base station device <b>200</b> may be performed in such a manner that a program for realizing the functions of the respective components of the mobile station device <b>100</b> or the base station device <b>200</b> according to the first to fourth embodiments is recorded in a recording medium which can be read by a computer, and the program recorded in the recording medium is read by a computer system. In addition, the &#x201c;computer system&#x201d; mentioned herein includes an Operating System or hardware such as peripheral devices.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0263">The &#x201c;computer-readable recording medium&#x201d; includes a storage unit, including a portable medium such as a flexible disk, a magnetic optical disk, a ROM, and a CD-ROM, and a hard disk embedded in the computer system. Further, the &#x201c;computer-readable recording medium&#x201d; may include a medium for temporarily and dynamically storing programs, like a communication line when a program is transmitted via a network such as the Internet or a communication line such as a telephone line, and a medium for storing programs for a predetermined time, like a volatile memory inside a computer system consisting of a server and a client in that case. The program may be a program for realizing some of the above-described functions. Alternatively, the program may be a program capable of realizing the above-described functions through a combination with a program previously stored in a computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0264">While the embodiments of the present invention have been described with reference to the drawings, the detailed configuration is not limited to the embodiments, and the design and the like of the scope not departing from the spirit of the present invention are included in the scope of the claims.</p>
