<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) the benefit of Taiwanese Application No. 100124360, filed Jul. 8, 2011, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to packaging substrates and methods of fabricating the same, and, more particularly, to a coreless packaging substrate and a method of fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the rapid development of electronic industry, electronic products gradually move toward a trend of multi-functional and high performance. Currently, structure of semiconductor package has been developed into various types. For example, wire-bonding type or flip-chip type, is to set semiconductor chip on a packaging substrate. Besides, the semiconductor chip is connected to packaging substrate by bonding wires or solder bumps.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to meet the demand of high integration and miniaturization for connection and carrying of more active, passive components and wires, packaging substrate gradually evolves from double-layer board to multi-layer board. So that circuit area of packaging substrate can be broaden within limited space by interlayer connection, and can satisfy the operation requirement of integrated circuit with high circuit density. Moreover, thickness of packaging substrate can be lowered and the purpose of low-profiled and compact-sized structure and improved electric function can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In prior art, packaging substrate is composed of core board with internal circuit and symmetric, built-up circuit structure. Owing to the thickness increment of overall structure using core board, it is difficult to satisfy the needs of improving function while shrinking substrate volume.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, a coreless packaging substrate has been developed. Catch the trend of high-frequency and miniaturization by shortening circuit length and thickness of overall structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a coreless packaging substrate <b>1</b> is fabricated by the following steps of: forming a first dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>a </i>on a carrier board (not shown) and forming a first circuit layer <b>11</b> on the first dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>a</i>; forming a built-up structure <b>12</b> on the first dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>a </i>and the first circuit layer <b>11</b>, the built-up structure <b>12</b> having second, third and fourth dielectric layers <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>120</b><i>c </i>and <b>120</b><i>d</i>, on which second circuit layers <b>121</b> that are electrically connected to one another by conductive vias <b>122</b> are formed; removing the carrier board to expose the first dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>a</i>; forming a solder mask <b>14</b><i>a </i>on the first dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>a</i>, and forming another solder mask <b>14</b><i>b </i>on the fourth dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>d </i>and the second circuit layer <b>121</b>; forming openings <b>140</b><i>a </i>on the solder mask <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the first dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>a </i>to expose a portion of the first circuit layer <b>11</b>, and forming another openings <b>140</b><i>b </i>on the solder mask <b>14</b><i>b </i>to expose a portion of the second circuit layer <b>121</b>; and forming metal bumps <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>in the openings <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b</i>, respectively, for bottom solder balls <b>15</b><i>a </i>and top solder balls <b>15</b><i>b </i>to be combined with, respectively, wherein a chip (not shown) may be disposed on the top solder balls <b>15</b><i>b</i>, and a circuit board (not shown) may be disposed on the bottom solder balls <b>15</b><i>a</i>. In the prior art, the packaging substrate <b>1</b> is fabricated in a bottom-up manner. In other words, the bottom side (i.e., a surface that is in contact with the carrier board) of packaging substrate <b>1</b> is fabricated first, then the intermediate components, such as the first to fourth dielectric layers <b>120</b><i>a </i>to <b>120</b><i>d</i>, are fabricated sequentially, and the metal bump <b>13</b><i>b </i>and the solder mask <b>14</b><i>b </i>are fabricated in the final step. In short, the packaging substrate <b>1</b> is fabricated from one side where the bottom solder balls <b>15</b><i>a </i>are implanted to the other side where the chip may be disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Wherein, one curing process needs to be performed whenever one of the dielectric layers <b>120</b><i>a </i>to <b>120</b><i>d </i>is formed, in order to cure the newly formed and half cured dielectric layers <b>120</b><i>a </i>to <b>120</b><i>d</i>. Besides, the greater the number of the curing process performed is, the more complete the gathering and shrinking of molecules in one of the dielectric layers <b>120</b><i>a </i>to <b>120</b><i>d </i>become. The curing processes affect all the dielectric layers. In the packaging substrate <b>1</b>, the curing process is performed four, three, two and one time on the first to fourth dielectric layers <b>120</b><i>a </i>to <b>120</b><i>d</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As above-mentioned, because of the different number of the curing process performed on the first to fourth dielectric layers <b>120</b><i>a </i>to <b>120</b><i>d</i>, the first to fourth dielectric layers <b>120</b><i>a </i>to <b>120</b><i>d </i>have different residual stress to gather and shrink. Since the curing process is performed on the first dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>a </i>four times and is performed on the fourth dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>d </i>one time only, the first dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>a </i>has less residual stress than the fourth dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>d</i>. Because each dielectric layer exerts centralizing, residual stress on the packaging substrate <b>1</b>, in the prior art the packaging substrate <b>1</b> presents a phenomenon of warpage that the fourth dielectric layer side <b>120</b><i>d </i>is sunken and the first dielectric layer side <b>120</b><i>a </i>is bulged. To be more detailed, the packaging substrate <b>1</b> in which the chip-disposing side is an upper side is in the shape of &#x201c;smile,&#x201d; which is a characteristic of this kind of process, and the warpage phenomenon causes trouble to packaging substrate manufacture and to following packaging process, and then affects yield.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Notice that solder masks <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>are disposed on the first dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>a </i>and fourth dielectric layer <b>120</b><i>d</i>, respectively, and because the opening <b>140</b><i>a </i>of the solder masks on the lower side <b>14</b><i>a </i>is greater than the opening <b>140</b><i>b </i>of the solder mask on the upper side <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the actual covered area by the solder mask on the lower side <b>14</b><i>a </i>is smaller than that by the solder mask on the upper side <b>14</b><i>b</i>. That is, the upper solder mask <b>14</b><i>b </i>has more material than the lower solder mask <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The solder masks <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>also have residual stress to gather and shrink, so that the pull force from the upper solder mask <b>14</b><i>b </i>exerted on the packaging substrate is greater than that from the lower solder mask <b>14</b><i>a</i>, which causes warpage of packaging substrate <b>1</b> more serious (as indicated by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, the solder mask in the prior art and the external circuit layer it covers are non-coplanar, which also affects the yield and density of the package.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention further discloses a method of fabricating a packaging substrate, including: providing a carrier board having two opposite surfaces, on which a plurality of first conductive pads formed for semiconductor chips to be disposed on the first conductive pads; forming first metal bumps on the first conductive pads, each of the first metal bumps having a first end and an opposite second end, wherein the second end is disposed on one of the first conductive pads; covering the surfaces of the carrier board, the first conductive pads and the first metal bumps with a first dielectric layer that has a plurality of first intaglios for exposing top and side surfaces of the first ends of the first metal bumps, respectively; forming a conductive seedlayer on the first dielectric layer and the first ends of the first metal bumps; forming a metal layer on the conductive seedlayer; removing a portion of the metal layer and the conductive seedlayer that is over a top surface of the first dielectric layer, and forming a first circuit layer in the first intaglios; forming a built-up structure on the first circuit layer and the first dielectric layer, an outermost layer of the built-up structure having second conductive pads for an external electronic device to be disposed on the second conductive pads; and removing the carrier board.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">From the foregoing contents, the packaging substrate of the disclosed embodiments are fabricated from chip-disposing side to side that connects an external electronic device. This made the overall packaging substrate with final chip-disposing side up in the shape of &#x201c;anti-smile.&#x201d; But removed area of first dielectric layer (top dielectric layer) is smaller than that of bottom dielectric layer, generating a stress that makes packaging substrate in the shape of &#x201c;smile.&#x201d; Finally, the stress of &#x201c;smile&#x201d; and &#x201c;anti-smile&#x201d; offset each other, causing overall packaging substrate to be more flat.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, packaging substrate made by the disclosed embodiments with conductive pads and dielectric layer flush on the surface is beneficial to package process of high density for the increment of density of conductive pads.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Besides, the disclosed embodiments replace solder mask of green painting in prior art with dielectric layer, so that material of each layer of packaging substrate is uniform and pure, which is beneficial to the stability and smoothness of overall packaging substrate. The yield is also promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, method of laser ablation is not necessary for process of metal bumps in the disclosed embodiments. Although laser is capable of raising overall speed through adjustment, laser forms one via at a time. Thus, the disclosed embodiments can reduce process time effectively by forming a plurality of metal bumps simultaneously. The cost is also lowered. And reliability of combination in disclosed embodiments is raised by embedding metal bumps into circuit layer.</p>
