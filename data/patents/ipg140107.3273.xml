<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a signal processing system <b>10</b> according to various embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>10</b> includes resistors <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, and <b>16</b>C, a frequency signal generator module <b>30</b>, and a controllable module <b>40</b>. The frequency signal generator module <b>30</b> may generate signals <b>20</b>B including various frequencies from audio to radio frequency (RF). A control or bias signal <b>20</b>A may be coupled to the controllable module <b>40</b> via the resistor <b>16</b>A. The controllable module <b>40</b> may process the signal <b>20</b>B based on the signal <b>20</b>A. The module <b>40</b> processed signal <b>20</b>C may be read across resistor <b>16</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, the controllable module <b>40</b> may include one or more controllable elements or modules such as an n-type complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor N-CMOS transistor <b>42</b> or other electronic modules including a semiconductor transistor <b>42</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a block diagram of a semiconductor circuit or module <b>50</b> according to various embodiments. In an embodiment the module <b>50</b> may be any electronic circuit including a semiconductor. The module <b>50</b> may be a transistor such as an NMOS or a PMOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment the transistor or module <b>50</b> may include a first submodule, cell, or channel <b>52</b>A, a third submodule, cell, or channel <b>56</b>A, and a second submodule, cell, or channel <b>54</b>A. In a NMOS transistor the first submodule may represent a source channel or cell <b>52</b>A and may include a p-type silicon well in a silicon substrate, an n-type silicon channel, and a top insulator such as silicon dioxide. The second submodule may represent a drain channel or cell <b>54</b>A and may include an n-type silicon channel in the p-type silicon well in the silicon substrate and a top insulator such as silicon dioxide. The third submodule may represent a gate channel or cell <b>56</b>A and may include an n-channel in the p-type silicon well in the silicon substrate, a top insulator, and a metal track (metallization), finger, or electrode electrically coupled to the third submodule or gate channel or cell.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Similarly in a PMOS transistor the first submodule may represent a source channel or cell <b>52</b>A and may include an n-type silicon well in a silicon substrate, a p-type silicon channel, and a top insulator such as silicon dioxide. The second submodule may represent a drain channel or cell <b>54</b>A and may include a p-type silicon channel in the n-type silicon well in the silicon substrate and a top insulator such as silicon dioxide. The third submodule may represent a gate channel or cell <b>56</b>A and may include a p-channel in the n-type silicon well in the silicon substrate, a top insulator, and a metal track (metallization), electrode, or finger electrically coupled to the third submodule or gate channel or cell. The transistor or module <b>50</b> is shown from a top level. Other semiconductor configurations may be employed according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a transistor or module <b>50</b>, a metal track or metallization may be applied to a channel or cell <b>52</b>A, <b>56</b>A, <b>54</b>A to provide an electrically conducting coupling or electrode for the transistor segment, channel or cell such as the n-type or p-type channel (for NMOS or PMOS, respectively). Similarly, another metal track, metallization or finger may be applied to another transistor segment, channel or cell <b>52</b>A, <b>54</b>A, <b>56</b>A such as the n-type or p-type channel (for NMOS or PMOS, respectively) to form an electrode for the channel or cell. In an embodiment the channel, cell, or section <b>54</b>A may represent a second submodule, channel, or cell (drain in an embodiment) and the channel, cell, or section <b>52</b>A may represent a first submodule, channel, or cell (source in an embodiment) for a MOS transistor or module <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Electromigration in the submodules <b>52</b>A, <b>54</b>A, <b>56</b>A (source, drain, and gate in an embodiment) in the respective metallizations, fingers or metal tracks (<b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B, and <b>56</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> for example) may affect the resistance or conductance of the submodules <b>52</b>A, <b>54</b>A, <b>56</b>A. The submodules <b>52</b>A, <b>54</b>A, <b>56</b>A (source, drain, and gate in an embodiment) respective metallizations, fingers or metal tracks (<b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B, an <b>56</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> for example) configuration or geometry may create parasitic capacitances in the respective transistor or module <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a block diagram of the semiconductor transistor or module <b>50</b> with a metallization, fingers, or tracks <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B for the first submodule, channel, cell (or source) <b>52</b>A and the second submodule, channel, cell (or drain <b>54</b>A) according to various embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> metallization, finger, electrode, or track <b>58</b>A may include a wide, proximal narrow, distal section <b>65</b>A and a narrower, distal section <b>63</b>A of metal or alloy applied to the channel or cell <b>52</b>A. The metallization, finger, or track <b>58</b>A may be comprised of any conducting metal or alloy including aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first submodule, channel, or cell <b>52</b>A (source in an embodiment) metallization, finger, electrode, or track <b>58</b>A may include a plurality of contact pads <b>62</b>A coupling the metallization, finger, or track <b>58</b>A, sections <b>63</b>A, <b>65</b>A to the first submodule, channel, cell <b>52</b>A or source in an embodiment semiconductor channel (n-type or p-type) or other section, segment, or layer. The metallization <b>58</b>A sections <b>63</b>A, <b>65</b>A may be contiguous metal or alloy. In an embodiment, the electrical current at the metallization, track, or finger's <b>58</b>A wide, proximal section <b>65</b>A may be greater at its base and lower at its distal section <b>63</b>A. The wider proximal section <b>65</b>A of the finger or track <b>58</b>A may reduce the effect of electromigration in an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The second submodule, channel, cell (or drain) <b>58</b>B metallization, finger, electrode, or track metallization, finger, electrode, or track <b>58</b>B may also include two sections: a distal narrow, section <b>63</b>B and a wide proximal section <b>65</b>B with a plurality of contact pads <b>62</b>B. In an embodiment the electrical current at the metallization, track, or finger's <b>58</b>B wide, proximal section <b>65</b>B may be greater at its base and lower at its distal section <b>63</b>B. The wider proximal section <b>65</b>B of the finger or track <b>58</b>B may reduce the effect of electromigration in an embodiment. Further the parasitic capacitance of the module <b>50</b> may be reduced due to the narrow, distal sections <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B of the tracks or fingers <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B of the channels or submodules <b>52</b>A, <b>54</b>A being adjacent the wider sections <b>65</b>A, <b>65</b>B of the channels or fingers <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B, i.e., the respective geometries of the fingers or channels <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B where the higher electrical currents of the respective channels <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B are at opposite ends from each other. In an embodiment the tracks, or metallizations or electrodes <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B may extend substantially along the length of their respective submodule <b>52</b>A, <b>54</b>A semiconductor material. In the transistor or module <b>50</b> the first submodule, channel, or cell <b>52</b>A (source) metallization, finger, electrode, or track <b>58</b>A may be configured to be coupled to a circuit at an end opposite where the second submodule, channel, or cell <b>54</b>A (drain) metallization, finger, electrode, or track <b>58</b>B is coupled to a circuit. In an embodiment, the metallizations, electrodes or tracks <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B are wider <b>65</b>A, <b>65</b>B at their respective bases or proximal to the circuit coupling sections and may become narrower <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B at their distal sections.</p>
