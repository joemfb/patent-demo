<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure is generally related to a communications network, and more particularly to providing additional information to called parties in a communications network.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Automatic Number Identification (ANI) is a system utilized by telephone companies to identify the Directory Number (DN) of a calling subscriber. ANI serves a function similar to Caller ID, but may utilize different underlying technology. ANI was originally developed for telephone company billing purposes and is now offered to commercial customers who may benefit from knowing who is calling them. In addition, ANI is one of the core technologies behind the 911 emergency service.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In commercial applications, a user may have an integrated or extraneous display affixed to a telephone. Such a display presents the ANI or telephone number of the calling party. In addition, the display may present the caller's name or calling name, also known as CNAM. As such, what is needed is a system, method, and computer readable medium that can provide additional information to called parties.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method for providing additional information to a called party in a communications network is provided. A call is received from a calling party. A lookup of information relating to the calling party is performed in a database via an Internet Protocol connection based on an identifier including at least one of the calling party and the called party. The information is provided to a called party if the information is located in the database.</p>

A query is sent with an identifier to the database. A determination is made as to whether the identifier is located in the database. If the identifier is located in the database, information associated with the calling party is returned.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The call may also comprise a number of the called party and the information may comprise information intended for the called party. A query is sent with the number to the database. A determination is made as to whether the information associated with the calling party is intended for the called party based on the number. If the information is intended for the called party, the information is returned. However, if the information is not intended for the called party, generic information is returned.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A system for providing additional information to a called party is provided.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention provides additional information to a called party or called parties. In the context of the present disclosure, a calling party is a party initiating or sending a call. A called party is a party receiving the call. The called party and the calling party each use at least one electronic device. The present invention is initiated when the called party is able to receive an ANI and is able to display related information to such a service or to a related service. The at least one electronic device is at least one of a computer, a server, a wireless phone, an Internet Protocol (IP) enabled phone, or a device that can receive and/or transmit information. The computer readable medium comprising instructions (or software) of the present invention is stored on and/or runs on at least one of the above mentioned electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a system <b>100</b> for providing additional information to called parties in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. System <b>100</b> includes a device <b>102</b>, which is able to send information to a called party device <b>104</b>. Called party device <b>104</b> may be communicably coupled to device <b>102</b> via an RJ 11 (telephone wire) port or a wireless port <b>130</b> and is able to display information on a display <b>108</b>. In this embodiment, the display <b>108</b> is integrated within device <b>102</b>. However, display <b>108</b> may be implemented as a standalone device without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. Further, the device <b>102</b> may be connected to the one or more displays via a wired and/or wireless connection.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, device <b>102</b> may receive information from a plurality of sources including public switched telephone network (PSTN) <b>110</b> which includes a central office <b>112</b> which is coupled to a calling party device <b>114</b>. The information may be received by a RJ11 (telephone wire) port <b>106</b> of device <b>102</b>. Other sources include a wireless network or data network (not shown) supporting other devices such as a computer or IP enabled phones. Currently, information received by device <b>102</b> may include telephone number of the calling party and the calling party name (CNAM).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Aspects of the present invention provide additional information to called parties, such as called party device <b>104</b>, by providing an ability to retrieve calling party information from a CNAM database <b>116</b> and/or other database <b>118</b>. CNAM database <b>116</b> and other database <b>118</b> comprise information relating to the calling party, for example, calling party name, telephone number, messages, location, and other information associated with the calling party. In addition, the information relating to the calling party may be a name, a city, a state, an address, a hyperlink, a photo, a video, and any information that can be sent via an Internet Protocol connection. When a calling party initiates a call using calling party device <b>114</b>, calling party device <b>114</b> sends an automatic number identification (ANI) or other identifier of the calling party to RJ11 (telephone wire) port <b>106</b> of device <b>102</b>. An example of another identifier may include an IP address of the calling party device <b>114</b> or a unique identifier of the calling party that can be received and transmitted by the calling party device <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In response to receiving the ANI or other identifier, device <b>102</b> sends a query for the calling party name to CNAM database <b>116</b> and/or other database <b>118</b>. The query may be sent via the RJ45 (Ethernet) port or a USB port <b>120</b> of device <b>102</b> to databases <b>116</b> or <b>118</b> via a direct connection or via a data network (not shown). Once the query is received, a lookup is performed in CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> for the calling party name. If the calling party name is found, the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> returns the calling party name and additional information associated with the calling party to device <b>102</b>. Upon receiving the information, device <b>102</b> may display it on display <b>108</b>. Prior to performing the lookup, device <b>102</b> may first determine whether the called number is a paying subscriber. To determine if the subscriber is a paying subscriber, the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> may send information of the called number, including, the called party name, a credit card number, or a zipcode, to another database for verification. If the verification is acceptable, the CNAM database <b>112</b> or other database <b>114</b> then returns a response to the device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition to displaying the information, device <b>102</b> may send the information to other called party devices, such as called party devices <b>104</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>126</b>, to be contemporaneously displayed on displays <b>109</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>128</b> respectively. In this example, displays <b>109</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>128</b> are implemented as standalone devices. In other embodiments, the displays <b>109</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>128</b> can be communicably coupled to called party devices <b>104</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>126</b> or may be integrated with called party devices <b>104</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> without departing the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. For example, display <b>128</b> may be integrated as part of called party device <b>126</b> and device <b>102</b> may send information directly to called party device <b>126</b> to be displayed on display <b>128</b>. The information may be sent from the RJ11 (telephone wire) port of device <b>102</b> or via wireless connection <b>130</b>. However, if the calling name is not found, a lookup is performed in other databases (not shown) to determine where the ANI or identifier of the calling party is stored. Once the ANI or identifier is located, the calling party information may be provided to device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a flowchart of a method or computer readable medium comprising instructions for providing additional information to called parties is depicted in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure. In this example, process <b>200</b> may be implemented as instructions executed within device <b>102</b>. Process <b>200</b> begins at step <b>202</b> with receiving an ANI or identifier of the calling party from a calling party device. The ANI or identifier may be received at an RJ11 or other port of device <b>102</b>. Next, process <b>200</b> continues to step <b>204</b> to query CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> for the calling party name based on the ANI or identifier. The query may be sent via RJ45, USB, or other port of device <b>102</b>. Process <b>200</b> then continues to step <b>206</b> to determine if the calling party name is found in the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b>. If the calling party name is found in the database, process <b>200</b> continues to step <b>208</b> to receive the calling party name and additional information associated with the calling party. The information may be received at RJ45, USB, or other port <b>120</b> of device <b>102</b>. Process <b>200</b> then completes at step <b>212</b> to forward the calling party name and additional information to other displays and/or called party devices. The information may be forwarded from the RJ11 or other port of device <b>102</b> or via a wireless connection <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">If the calling party name is not found in the database, process <b>200</b> continues to step <b>210</b> to locate the ANI or identifier of the calling party in other databases or locations. Process <b>200</b> then continues to step <b>208</b> to receive the calling party name and additional information associated with the calling party and to step <b>212</b> to forward the calling party name and additional information to other called party devices.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition to sending additional information to called parties, aspects of the present invention may provide specific information to called parties by providing the ability to retrieve information intended for the called party from the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b>. When the calling party initiates a call using calling party device <b>114</b>, the calling party device <b>114</b> sends the called number of the called party device to CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b>. Upon receiving the called number of the called party device, a lookup is performed in the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> for additional information intended for the called party based on the called number.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">If additional information intended for the called party is found in the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b>, the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> returns the additional information specific to the called number to device <b>102</b>. Upon receiving the information, device <b>102</b> may display it on display <b>108</b>. In addition, device <b>102</b> may send the information to other called party devices, such as called party devices <b>104</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>126</b>, to be displayed on displays <b>109</b>, <b>124</b> and <b>128</b> respectively. The information may be sent from the RJ11 or other port of the device <b>102</b> or via a wireless connection <b>130</b>. In this way, additional information specific to a called party may be sent based on the called number. However, if called number is not found in the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b>, the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> may return a generic message to the device <b>102</b>, which in turn sends it to called party devices <b>104</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The additional information may be placed in the CNAM database <b>116</b>, other database <b>118</b>, or another location (not shown) accessible (either directly or indirectly) by the device <b>102</b>, previous to, during, or after the calling party initiated call. Further, the additional information may be altered or appended to previous to, during, or after the calling party initiated call. This additional information can be placed directly by the entity controlling the databases <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, or other location or directly by the entity providing the additional information.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a flowchart of a method or computer readable medium comprising instructions for providing additional information is depicted in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure. In this example, process <b>300</b> may be implemented as instructions executing within device <b>102</b>. Process <b>300</b> begins at step <b>302</b> with receiving the calling number, retrieving a called number from the device <b>102</b>, and appending the called number to the calling number. The called number may be stored in memory (not shown) on the device <b>102</b> or may be retrieved from another source such as a server or database. Next, process <b>300</b> continues to step <b>304</b> to query a CNAM database or other database for the called number. The query may be sent via an RJ45, USB, or other port of device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Process <b>300</b> then continues to step <b>306</b> to determine if the additional information intended for the called party is found based on the called number. If no additional information intended for the called party is found based on the called number, process <b>300</b> continues to step <b>310</b> to receive a generic message from the database and to step <b>312</b> to forward the generic message to other called party devices.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">However if additional information intended for the called party is found based on the called number, process <b>300</b> continues to step <b>308</b> to receive the additional information from the database. The information may be received at the RJ45, USB, or other port (not shown) of device <b>102</b>. Process <b>300</b> then continues to step <b>312</b> to forward the additional information to other called party devices. The information may be forwarded from the RJ11 or other port of device <b>102</b> or via a wireless connection such as wireless connection <b>130</b>. In this way, information specific to or customized for a called party may be delivered based on the called number. It is noted that process <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and process <b>300</b> may be performed individually or in combination to provide additional information to the called parties without departing the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, the additional information intended for a called party may include alerts in response to an occurrence of an event. For example, a called party has ordered a refill of prescription from a pharmacy. When the prescription is ready for pickup, the pharmacy may initiate a call to the called party. In response, the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> may return a message to device <b>102</b> intended for the called party. The message may indicate that the prescription is ready for pickup in addition to the pharmacy's name and telephone number. Also, the message may include helpful information including directions to the pharmacy, operating hours of the pharmacy, allergic reactions to the prescription, web sites for additional information about the prescription and/or the affliction the prescription is intending to solve, links to such web sites that can be accessed directly from one or more of the displays, and coupons or codes for use with the prescription and/or for other items in the pharmacy that can be used in person and/or on-line.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Another alternative for additional information intended for a called party may include informative and promotional information from a service provider. For example, a called party is subscribed to television cable service from a cable company. The cable company may initiate a call upon issuance of a new bill to a called party. In response, the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> may return a message to device <b>102</b> intended for the called party. The message may indicate that a bill is ready for review in addition to the company's name and telephone number. In addition, the message may include promotional information, such as television shows that are scheduled for the evening or movies ready for order by the called party.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Yet another alternative for additional information intended for a called party may include situational information from an emergency service provider. For example, a tornado may be heading towards a called party. The emergency service provider, such as the police or fire department, may initiate a call to the device <b>102</b> which may be located at the called party's residence. In response, the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> may return an emergency message to device <b>102</b> intended for the called party. The message may indicate that a tornado is heading towards the residence in addition to the emergency service provider's name and telephone number. Also, the message may include the location and speed of the tornado based on the latest data and directions to nearby tornado shelters or other information related to the event. Also, the types of messages sent from the CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> may be based on a seriousness of the situation. For example, a typical text message may be sent for less serious event while a text message in addition to a message that causes an LED or other light source (not shown) to flash on the device <b>102</b> may be sent for an emergency event. The message may be delivered in the form of a message, text, sound, graphic, video, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In other embodiments, the calling party can also send a voice message or initiate a live call to the called party before, during, or after the information is sent or received by the called party. For example, after the called party has received the information, the calling party can call, send an email to, or mail the called party regarding additional features or services that can be provided to the called party when the called party visits the retail establishment (or other entity) or based on the location of the called party. The device <b>102</b> also includes storage that can store the received information as well as a power adapter and/or a battery compartment that provides power to the device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, the device <b>102</b> may be implemented as a standalone device or an integrated device with other called party devices. Alternatively, the device <b>102</b> may be implemented as a mobile device with functionalities of both device <b>102</b> and called party devices <b>104</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a system <b>400</b> for providing additional information to called parties is depicted in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure. System <b>400</b> is similar to system <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that instead of device <b>102</b> being implemented as a standalone device. Device <b>102</b> is being implemented as a mobile phone <b>402</b>, a smart phone <b>404</b>, or a personal digital assistant (PDA) <b>406</b>. To send and receive information to and from CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b>, one or more of mobile devices <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, and <b>406</b> are wired or wirelessly communicably coupled to a service provider site <b>408</b>, which is also communicably coupled to databases <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> via a data network (not shown) and calling party device(s) <b>114</b> via PSTN <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, aspects of the present disclosure are provided within mobile devices <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, and <b>406</b>. Thus, when calling party device <b>114</b> initiates a call to mobiles devices <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, or <b>406</b>, the service provider site <b>408</b> forwards the ANI or identifier of the calling party to devices <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, or <b>406</b>. The devices send a query message (or similar message) to CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> via the service provider site <b>408</b>. The query message may be sent by mobile devices using common wireless communication protocols. In response to identifying the calling party name, telephone number, or additional information intended for mobile devices <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, or <b>406</b>, CNAM database <b>116</b> or other database <b>118</b> returns the information to devices <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, or <b>406</b> via the service provider site <b>408</b> using wireless communication protocols. Upon receiving the information, mobile devices <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, or <b>406</b> may display the information to mobile users on displays or forward the information to other mobile devices or non-mobile devices (such as displays <b>109</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>128</b>) using wireless and wired communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Although an exemplary embodiment of the system, method, and computer readable medium of the present disclosure has been illustrated in the accompanied drawings and described in the foregoing detailed description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications, and substitutions without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure as set forth and defined by the following claims.
