<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a radiation detecting device including a scintillator and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A radiation detecting device, such as a flat panel detector (FPD) used in X-ray imaging performed in the medical practice or the like, includes a scintillator that receives X-rays transmitted through an object and photodetectors that detect light emitted from the scintillator. Thus, the radiation detecting device indirectly detects radiation such as X-rays. An image sensor included in such a radiation detecting device includes a plurality of pixels arranged in a two-dimensional matrix, for example, 2600&#xd7;2600 pixels. If light emitted from the scintillator diffuses over a plurality of pixels, so-called crosstalk occurs and the accuracy of the resultant image is reduced. To avoid this, there is a known technique in which the scintillator is divided into separate portions provided in correspondence with the pixels, and light is confined within each portion of the scintillator by utilizing total reflection of light caused by the difference in refractive index between the scintillator and air at the boundaries between pixels, whereby the occurrence of crosstalk is reduced or suppressed. An example of such a technique is disclosed by Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-027863. Specifically, convexities or concavities are formed on a substrate, on which a scintillator is to be formed, at respective portions corresponding to the boundaries between pixels. Subsequently, a scintillator is formed over the convexities or concavities. Then, the resultant substrate is cooled, so that cracks are formed in the scintillator along the convexities or concavities. Thus, the scintillator is divided into separate portions provided in correspondence with the pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the technique disclosed by Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 7-027863 has another problem in a case where pixels are arranged in a fine pattern, for example, at a pitch of 100 &#x3bc;m and with a distance between pixels of 10 &#x3bc;m, and the convexities or concavities are formed only in portions corresponding to the boundaries between pixels, i.e., portions where cracks are to be formed. In such a case, while a scintillator material having deposited on the substrate is being cooled so that cracks are formed in the resultant scintillator along with the contraction of the scintillator material, the stress occurring between the scintillator material and the substrate increases, increasing the probability that the scintillator may peel off of the substrate.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Radiation detecting devices and methods of manufacturing the same according to embodiments of the present invention will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are schematic sectional views of exemplary radiation detecting devices according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the radiation detecting devices according to the embodiments each include a photodetector layer <b>14</b> including a plurality of photodetectors <b>13</b> and a scintillator layer <b>18</b> provided above the photodetector layer <b>14</b>. Each of the radiation detecting devices illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> may also include a protective layer <b>15</b> provided between the scintillator layer <b>18</b> and the photodetector layer <b>14</b>, and a reflective layer <b>19</b> provided above the scintillator layer <b>18</b>. The protective layer <b>15</b> mechanically and electrically protects the photodetectors <b>13</b>. The reflective layer <b>19</b> increases the factor of utilization of light emitted from the scintillator layer <b>18</b>. The radiation detecting devices differ from each other in that the device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes a convex pattern layer <b>17</b> between the scintillator layer <b>18</b> and the photodetector layer <b>14</b>, whereas the device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> includes the convex pattern layer <b>17</b> between the scintillator layer <b>18</b> and the reflective layer <b>19</b>. The convex pattern layer <b>17</b> includes a plurality of convex patterns each including a plurality of convexities. As used herein, the term &#x201c;convexities&#x201d; refers to 3-dimensional microstructures (micron-sized structures) having an outward surface. Incidentally, the term &#x201c;convex pattern&#x201d; refers to a substantially planar distribution of convexities arranged two-dimensionally in predetermined patterns, such as a honeycomb or the like, as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The double arrow illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> represents a direction in which the layers are stacked (hereinafter referred to as stacking direction). In each device, the scintillator layer <b>18</b> has cracks extending in the stacking direction. The convex patterns will be described in detail separately below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 3C</figref> together with a method of manufacturing a radiation detecting device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate steps of manufacturing a substrate carrying a photodetector layer <b>14</b> including a plurality of photodetectors <b>13</b> and a convex pattern layer <b>17</b> including a plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b> each including a plurality of convexities <b>20</b>, the convex patterns <b>21</b> coincide with the respective photodetectors <b>13</b> in the stacking direction. Specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a resist <b>23</b> is provided over a substrate <b>10</b> carrying a photodetector layer <b>14</b> including a plurality of photodetectors <b>13</b>. Here, a protective layer <b>15</b> may be interposed between the resist <b>23</b> and the photodetector layer <b>14</b>. Subsequently, the resist <b>23</b> is exposed to light through a mask <b>24</b> and is then developed. Thus, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>each including a plurality of convexities <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>respectively are provided. Adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>have different designs of convexities <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> and described in detail below. Therefore, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, adjacent convex patterns <b>21</b> are denoted by reference numerals <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>, respectively. When there is no need to distinguish between the convex pattern <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the convex pattern <b>21</b><i>b</i>, both are hereinafter generally referred to as convex patterns <b>21</b>. Other members may also be generally denoted without the suffixes a or b of respective reference numerals thereof. In accordance with the above steps, several types of substrates <b>10</b> each having a plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b> that are arranged in such a manner as to coincide with the respective photodetectors <b>13</b> can be obtained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> are top views of some substrates <b>10</b> each having a plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b> manufactured as described above. In each substrate <b>10</b>, adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b> have different designs of convexities <b>20</b>. Note that each of the convex patterns <b>21</b> is formed of a plurality of convexities <b>20</b>, and satisfies the below-described conditions provided for the pitch of the convexities <b>20</b>, the distance between adjacent ones of the convexities <b>20</b>, the shape (diameter and height) of each convexity <b>20</b>, and the distance between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>. Subsequently, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a scintillator layer <b>18</b> is formed on the resultant convex pattern layer <b>17</b> on the substrate <b>10</b> in such a manner as to extend over the plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b>. Subsequently, the substrate <b>10</b> now carrying the scintillator layer <b>18</b> is cooled, whereby a crack is formed in a portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> that coincides, in the stacking direction, with a gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are a top view and a sectional view, respectively, illustrating part of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> having the crack. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, portions <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coincide with the convex patterns <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>, respectively, that are adjacent to each other, and a portion <b>18</b><i>c </i>of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> forms the crack that coincides, in the stacking direction, with the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>. The radiation detecting device manufactured as described above solves the problem of peeling of the scintillator layer occurring in the related-art radiation detecting device. Moreover, the radiation detecting device manufactured as described above has less crosstalk. These effects will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The convex patterns <b>21</b> according to the embodiments will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref>. The convex patterns <b>21</b> satisfy conditions 0.6&#x2266;s/t&#x3c;0.9 (Expression 1) and d&#x3c;D&#x3c;4.6h (Expression 2), where t denotes the pitch of the convexities <b>20</b>, s denotes the size (diameter) of the top surface of each convexity <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b> that is in contact with the scintillator layer <b>18</b> (hereinafter also referred to as top size), h denotes the height of each convexity <b>20</b>, d denotes the distance between adjacent ones of the convexities <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b>, and D denotes the average distance between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref> and <b>7</b>A to <b>7</b>C. The average distance D illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref> will be described in detail separately below. In the embodiments, Expressions 1 and 2 are satisfied, whereby the crack is formed in the portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b>, which extends over the plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b>, coinciding in the stacking direction with the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>. Thus, any cracks are prevented from being formed in other portions of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> that coincide with the respective convex patterns <b>21</b> in the stacking direction. Furthermore, since no cracks are formed in the portions of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding with the respective convex patterns <b>21</b>, each of the convex patterns <b>21</b> and the scintillator layer <b>18</b> are in close contact with each other. Consequently, the scintillator layer <b>18</b> is prevented from peeling off the convex patterns <b>21</b>. More specifically, as a result of our diligent study, it has been found that satisfying Expression 1 prevents both formation of any cracks in the portions of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding with the respective convex patterns <b>21</b> and peeling of the scintillator layer <b>18</b>. This is because of the following reasons. If 0.6&#x2266;s/t is satisfied, the distance between adjacent ones of the convexities <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b> is suppressed to a small value relative to the top size of each convexity <b>20</b>. This prevents the formation of any cracks in a portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding with a gap between adjacent ones of the convexities <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b>. Furthermore, if s/t&#x3c;0.9 is satisfied, the distance between adjacent ones of the convexities <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b> does not become too small relative to the top size of each convexity <b>20</b>. Therefore, the stress occurring in portions of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> that are in contact with the top surfaces of the convexities <b>20</b> is reduced. Consequently, peeling of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> is prevented. The relationship of s/t is more preferably 0.6&#x2266;s/t&#x2266;0.8. It has also been found that satisfying Expression 2 forms a crack in the portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding in the stacking direction with the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b> while preventing the formation of any cracks in the portions of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding in the stacking direction with the respective convex patterns <b>21</b>. That is, a crack is selectively formed in the portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding with the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>. This is because of the following reasons. If d&#x3c;D is satisfied, the stress occurring in the portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding in the stacking direction with the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b> becomes larger than the stress occurring in the portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding with the gap between adjacent ones of the convexities <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b>. Therefore, a crack is selectively formed in the portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding in the stacking direction with the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>. Furthermore, if D&#x3c;4.6h is satisfied, the scintillator layer <b>18</b> is prevented from spreading into, or filling, the gap (a depression) between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>. Therefore, the crack is formed successfully. More preferably, d&#x3c;D&#x3c;4.6h and 1.9h&#x3c;D&#x3c;3.8h are satisfied. Thus, the manufacturing method according to the embodiments provides a radiation detecting device having less crosstalk and less occurrence of peeling of the scintillator layer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref>, if the pitch t of the convexities <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b> and the size (diameter) s of the top surface of each convexity <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b> that is in contact with the scintillator layer <b>18</b> differ between the convex patterns <b>21</b>, the convex patterns <b>21</b> need to individually satisfy Expression 1. Similarly, if the height h of each convexity <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b> and the distance d between adjacent ones of the convexities <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b> differ between the convex patterns <b>21</b>, Expression 2 needs to be satisfied between each convex pattern <b>21</b> and another convex pattern <b>21</b> adjacent thereto. The size (diameter) s of the top surface of each convexity <b>20</b> that is in contact with the scintillator layer <b>18</b> refers to the size of the convexity <b>20</b> seen from the top. If the top surface of the convexity <b>20</b> has a circular shape, the size s corresponds to the diameter. If the top surface of the convexity <b>20</b> has a square shape, the size s corresponds to the length of each side. The average distance D between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b> is calculated as follows. In a case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the average distance D between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b> corresponds to a distance dd. In a case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, if, in each convex pattern <b>21</b>, a column-direction distance ddd between adjacent ones of convexities <b>20</b><i>c </i>that are in a column nearest to an adjacent convex pattern <b>21</b> is larger than the top size (diameter) s of each convexity <b>20</b>, the average distance D is dd+(&#xbc;)t<b>1</b>+(&#xbc;)t<b>2</b>. This will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is an enlarged view of relevant part illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> and includes a diagram illustrating respective portions of adjacent convex patterns <b>21</b> and a gap defined therebetween and a diagram illustrating only the gap. In the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the gap defined between the adjacent convex patterns <b>21</b> has a substantially rectangular shape. In the cases illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 7A</figref>, the gap defined between the adjacent convex patterns <b>21</b> has a shape that is a combination of a rectangle and triangles each having a side length t<b>1</b> or t<b>2</b>, which corresponds to the pitch of the convexities <b>20</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. The portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding with the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b> receives a stress corresponding to the area of the gap. In the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 7A</figref>, when the shape of the gap is converted into a rectangle having the same area while a column-direction length H is unchanged, the length of a side extending in a direction orthogonal to the column direction corresponds to the average distance D between the adjacent convex patterns <b>21</b>. Similarly, in cases illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 7C</figref>, the average distance D is dd+(&#xbc;)t<b>1</b> and dd+(&#xbc;)t<b>2</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The above description concerns embodiments in which a scintillator layer <b>18</b> is formed on a substrate <b>10</b> carrying a plurality of photodetectors <b>13</b> and a plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b> each including a plurality of convexities <b>20</b>, the plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b> coinciding with the respective photodetectors <b>13</b> in the stacking direction. The present invention is not limited to such embodiments. For example, in the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the radiation detecting device may be manufactured as follows. A scintillator layer <b>18</b> is formed on a substrate carrying a plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b> each including a plurality of convexities <b>20</b> such that the scintillator layer <b>18</b> extends over the plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b>. Subsequently, the substrate now carrying the scintillator layer <b>18</b> is cooled, whereby a crack is formed in a portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding with a gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>. Subsequently, the substrate carrying the scintillator layer <b>18</b> having the crack is arranged in such a manner as to face a plurality of photodetectors <b>13</b> and such that the crack coincides with a gap between adjacent ones of the photodetectors <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The pitch t of the convexities <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b> is preferably 1 &#x3bc;m or larger and 15 &#x3bc;m or smaller. If the pitch t is 1 &#x3bc;m or larger, a sufficient quantity of light emission is obtained. This is because the diffusion lengths of high-energy electrons and holes produced by the radiation entering the radiation detecting device are expected to fall within the foregoing range. If the pitch t is smaller than 1 &#x3bc;m, the quantity of light emission is expected to decrease. If the pitch t is 15 &#x3bc;m or smaller, the area of contact between the scintillator layer <b>18</b> and each convexity <b>20</b> is prevented from becoming too large. Consequently, the occurrence of peeling of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The convexities <b>20</b> in each convex pattern <b>21</b> may be in a honeycomb arrangement. Thus, the portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding with each convex pattern <b>21</b> is maintained to be in good condition.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The manufacturing method may further include a step of filling the crack with a member that diffuses light. Thus, crosstalk is further reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The individual members included in the radiation detecting device according to the embodiments will now be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The substrate <b>10</b> is made of glass or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The protective layer <b>15</b> is made of resin such as polyimide.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An underlayer <b>16</b> may be provided so as to protect the photodetectors <b>13</b> together with the protective layer <b>15</b>.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The reflective layer <b>19</b> increases the factor of utilization of light emitted from the scintillator layer <b>18</b>. In the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the convex pattern layer <b>17</b> may also function as a reflective layer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The convex pattern layer <b>17</b> including the convexities <b>20</b> is made of epoxy resin or the like.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the step of forming convexities <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, if the resist <b>23</b> that is to become the convexities <b>20</b> as described above is an epoxy-resin negative photoresist, the thickness and pattern size of the resist <b>23</b> are adjustable by adjusting the exposure value and the post-exposure bake time. Portions of the resist <b>23</b> that have been exposed to light through the mask <b>24</b> having a Cr pattern that is discontinuous at a portion corresponding to a boundary <b>12</b> between adjacent ones of pixels (<b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>) are subjected to post-exposure bake, whereby cross-linking and fixation progress in those portions of the resist <b>23</b> occur. Subsequently, the other portions of the resist <b>23</b> that have not been exposed to light are removed with a developer. Thus, a convex pattern layer <b>17</b> formed of the portions of the resist <b>23</b> that have been exposed to radiative energy is obtained. The size of each pixel (<b>11</b><i>a </i>or <b>11</b><i>b </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>) is about 50 &#x3bc;m to about 200 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> that are top views illustrating different patterns of convexities <b>20</b>, the convexities <b>20</b> are arranged at a pitch smaller than the size of each pixel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates a case where both the pitch t of the convexities <b>20</b> and the top size s of each convexity <b>20</b> are different between adjacent ones of the pixels (convex patterns <b>21</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates a case where both the pitch t of the convexities <b>20</b> and the top size s of each convexity <b>20</b> are the same between adjacent ones of the pixels (convex patterns <b>21</b>) but the respective patterns of convexities <b>20</b> in the adjacent pixels are staggered from each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates a case where one of the pitch t of the convexities <b>20</b> and the top size s of each convexity <b>20</b> is different between adjacent ones of the pixels (convex patterns <b>21</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The convexities <b>20</b> are not necessarily formed by processing a resist into a certain pattern as described above and may be formed by processing a substrate. For example, a pattern of convexities <b>20</b> may be formed by applying a resist onto a substrate made of Si, glass, or a carbon material, processing the resist, and etching the substrate through the resultant resist. Alternatively, an imprint method may be employed considering costs. In any case, the material for the convex pattern layer <b>17</b> may be mainly composed of a light element in a periodic table of the elements.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The scintillator layer <b>18</b> may be formed by vacuum deposition, which is a practical method that realizes quick film formation. For example, CsI powder and TlI powder are put into respective deposition boats. The boat for CsI and the boat for TlI are heated to 700&#xb0; C. and 300&#xb0; C., respectively, and co-deposition is performed. Suppose that while the convexities <b>20</b> are heated to a temperature higher than room temperature, for example, 200&#xb0; C., the co-deposition is performed under an Ar gas pressure of 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>Pa, with a Tl content at the emission center of about 1 mol % to about 2 mol %, and with a film thickness of 200 &#x3bc;m. Then, there grows, as the scintillator layer <b>18</b>, a CsI polycrystalline film in which faces of most grains that are in contact with and are parallel to the top surfaces of the convexities <b>20</b> in the convex patterns <b>21</b> extend in a (<b>110</b>) plane. Thus, the embodiments employ a CsI film with grains oriented in a [<b>110</b>] direction. Depending on conditions for deposition, a CsI film with grains oriented in another direction such as [<b>200</b>] or a CsI film with a mixture of grains oriented in different directions may grow. In the CsI film according to the embodiments in which grains are oriented in the [<b>110</b>] direction, the grains grown at positions farther from the top surfaces of the convexities <b>20</b> in the convex pattern layer <b>17</b> in the thickness direction are in surface contact with each other to a greater degree. Hence, the stress occurring in the scintillator layer <b>18</b> is larger in upper portions and smaller in lower portions that are in contact with the top surfaces of the convexities <b>20</b>. Therefore, while the CsI film is retained not to peel from the substrate <b>10</b>, or the convexities <b>20</b>, the stress concentrates in each portion of the CsI film coinciding with the boundary <b>12</b> between adjacent ones of the pixels (the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>). Considering the powder intensity ratio used in the X-ray diffractometry (XRD), it is desirable to obtain, through vacuum deposition, a CsI polycrystalline film in which the (<b>110</b>) diffraction peak is the largest among different diffraction peaks, that is, most grains have faces extending in the (<b>110</b>) plane.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the substrate <b>10</b> carrying the scintillator layer <b>18</b> is cooled, a crack is formed in the portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding with the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b> (pixels). The crack is formed with a stress applied to the scintillator layer <b>18</b> when the substrate is cooled to, for example, room temperature or below. This mechanism is as follows. The portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding with the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b> (the boundary <b>12</b> between adjacent ones of the pixels) is vulnerable to the stress as described above. In a case where the convex patterns <b>21</b> and the convexities <b>20</b> satisfy Expressions 1 and 2, when the scintillator layer <b>18</b> formed over the convex patterns <b>21</b> contracts with a thermal stress, the scintillator layer <b>18</b> cracks from the vulnerable portion.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Embodiments of the present invention have been described above. Now, examples of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a table summarizing examples of the present invention and comparative examples. In the examples and the comparative examples, there were prepared different substrates <b>10</b> carrying respective convex pattern layers <b>17</b> including convexities <b>20</b> arranged in different patterns each being discontinuous at the boundary <b>12</b> between adjacent ones of the pixels (convex patterns <b>21</b>), and a scintillator layer <b>18</b> was formed on each of the substrates <b>10</b> in such manner as to extend over the adjacent convex patterns <b>21</b>. Subsequently, the resultant substrates <b>10</b> were cooled. Adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b> had different arrangements of convexities <b>20</b>. Therefore, in the table, the adjacent convex patterns <b>21</b> are referred to as a first convex pattern and a second convex pattern, respectively, as a matter of convenience. The table summarizes the status of crack formation at the boundary <b>12</b> between the adjacent pixels (the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>), the occurrence of peeling of the scintillator layer <b>18</b>, and the modulation transfer function (MTF), i.e., the spatial resolution of the resultant image, realized by the photodetectors <b>13</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In accordance with the process of forming a convex pattern layer <b>17</b> described above, a plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b> were formed on the upper surface of a glass substrate <b>10</b> carrying a photodetector layer <b>14</b> including photodetectors <b>13</b> and a polyimide protective layer <b>15</b>. Furthermore, in accordance with the process of forming a scintillator layer <b>18</b> described above, a CsI film was deposited over the entirety of the substrate <b>10</b> in such a manner as to extend over the plurality of convex patterns <b>21</b>. In Comparative Example 1, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the convex patterns <b>21</b> were formed with a pitch of 100 &#x3bc;m, a top size s of each convexity <b>20</b> of 90 &#x3bc;m, and a gap between adjacent ones of the convexities <b>20</b> of 10 &#x3bc;m and such that the gap was positioned between adjacent ones of the photodetectors <b>13</b>.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In accordance with the process of forming a convex pattern layer <b>17</b> described in the above embodiments, an epoxy-resin negative photoresist, for example, SU-8, was applied as the resist <b>23</b> onto the upper surface of a glass substrate <b>10</b> carrying a photodetector layer <b>14</b> including photodetectors <b>13</b> and a polyimide protective layer <b>15</b>, and convex patterns <b>21</b> including convexities <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> were photolithographically formed. When SU-8 is employed as the resist <b>23</b>, the thickness and pattern size of the resist <b>23</b> are adjustable by adjusting the exposure value and the post-exposure bake time. Portions of the resist <b>23</b> that had been exposed to light through a mask <b>24</b> having a Cr pattern were subjected to post-exposure bake at 65&#xb0; C. for one minute and at 90&#xb0; C. for two minutes, whereby cross-linking and fixation progressed in those portions of the resist <b>23</b>. Subsequently, the other portions of the resist <b>23</b> that had not been exposed to light were removed with a developing solution called SU-8 developer. Thus, a convex pattern layer <b>17</b> composed of SU-8 was obtained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates a top view of the convex pattern layer <b>17</b>. The convex pattern layer <b>17</b> was observed through a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-5500 manufactured by Hitachi). There were formed a first convex pattern (<b>21</b><i>a</i>) in which the pitch t<b>1</b> of the convexities <b>20</b><i>a </i>was 10 &#x3bc;m, the top size s<b>1</b> of each convexity <b>20</b><i>a </i>was 8 &#x3bc;m, the height h of each convexity <b>20</b><i>a </i>was 3 &#x3bc;m, and the distance d<b>1</b> between adjacent ones of the convexities <b>20</b><i>a </i>was 2 &#x3bc;m; and a second convex pattern (<b>21</b><i>b</i>) in which the pitch t<b>2</b> of the convexities <b>20</b><i>b </i>was 5 &#x3bc;m, the top size s<b>2</b> of each convexity <b>20</b><i>b </i>was 3 &#x3bc;m, the height h of each convexity <b>20</b><i>b </i>was 3 &#x3bc;m, and the distance d<b>2</b> between adjacent ones of the convexities <b>20</b><i>b </i>was 2 &#x3bc;m.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Subsequently, a scintillator layer <b>18</b> was formed over the first convex pattern and the second convex pattern in the same manner as in Comparative Example 1.

When the scintillator layer <b>18</b> was observed through a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-5500 manufactured by Hitachi), the scintillator layer <b>18</b> was found to include grains that had grown in correspondence with the convexities <b>20</b> in the convex pattern layer <b>17</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In Example 1, according to the SEM image, the crack was formed in the portion of the scintillator layer <b>18</b> coinciding with the boundary <b>12</b> between adjacent ones of the pixels, i.e., the gap between adjacent ones of the convex patterns <b>21</b>. With this crack, crosstalk among pixels was reduced. Consequently, the MTF was improved.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The convex pattern layer <b>17</b> in Example 1 included the convexities <b>20</b> arranged as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, as a top view of the convex patterns <b>21</b>.
