<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a differential locking assembly that utilizes an electronic coil to actuate a differential lock shift collar.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicle drive axles typically include a pair of axle shafts for driving vehicle wheels. The drive axle uses a differential to control input speed and torque to the axle shafts. Under ideal conditions, when the vehicle is driven along a straight path, the wheels will be turning at approximately the same speed and the torque will be equally split between both wheels. When the vehicle negotiates a turn, the outer wheel must travel over a greater distance than the inner wheel. The differential allows the inner wheel to turn at a slower speed than the outer wheel as the vehicle turns.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Power is transmitted from a vehicle drive shaft to a pinion gear that is in constant mesh with a differential ring gear. The ring gear is bolted to a differential housing or case that turns with the ring gear. A differential spider having four (4) support shafts orientated in the shape of a cross, has four (4) differential pinion gears. One pinion gear is supported for rotation on each support shaft. Power is transferred from the differential housing to side gears that are splined to the axle shafts. The side gears are in constant mesh with the side differential pinion gears. The outer ends of the axle shafts are bolted to the brake drum hubs to which the wheels are also bolted.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the vehicle is driven in a straight path, the ring gear, differential housing, spider, and differential pinion gears all rotate as one unit to transfer power to the axle shafts. There is no relative movement between the differential pinion gears and the side gears. When the vehicle turns, the differential pinion gears rotate on their respective shafts to speed up the rotation of one axle shaft while slowing the rotation of the other axle shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Often the differential includes a differential locking mechanism. When there are poor road conditions, i.e., slippery or rough surfaced roads, the locking mechanism allows maximum wheel and tire traction for improved control. If the differential does not have a locking mechanism and one tire is on ice, all of the torque and speed will be transferred to the wheel on ice. Thus, the tire just spins on the ice and the vehicle is prohibited from traveling forward. A locking mechanism allows the axle shafts to rotate at the same speed while transferring all available torque to the tire not on the ice. If the tractive effort at this tire is sufficient, the vehicle can be moved off of the ice. When the differential is locked, power is transmitted through the locked differential housing, gearing, and axle shafts rather than through the differential gearing only.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One type of differential locking mechanism is comprised of an air actuated shift collar that locks the differential housing to the axle shafts. An air operated shift fork cooperates with the shift collar to engage or disengage the locking mechanism via a driver-controlled switch. In this configuration, one of the axle shafts has two sets of splines. An inner set of splines, closest to the differential, is engaged with one differential side gear, while an outer set of splines cooperates with the shift collar. The shift collar, although engaged with the outer splines at this time, is not engaged with the differential casing, thus the outer splines will rotate at the same speed as this side gear when the main differential is in an unlocked or disengaged position allowing the main differential to operate in a normal manner.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the driver-controlled switch is activated, air pressure causes a shift linkage to move the shift collar towards the differential. This allows the collar to engage with the differential casing, as well as remaining engaged with the axle shaft outer splines. Power transfer through the differential is now achieved through the locked differential casing, gearing, and both axle shafts together, rather than through the differential gearing alone.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some disadvantages with the air actuation method are the significant number of components that are required, leakage, and component wear. The significant number of components that are required to operate this system increase assembly time and drive up the overall system cost. Requiring an air connect to actuate the system introduces possible air leaks to the system, which can lead to inadequate system performance. Further, the differential gearing, axle shafts, and shift collar operates in an oil-lubed environment and the additional components for the air actuation method increase the risk of oil leaks in the system. Further, repeated engagements and disengagements between the shift fork and shift collar, especially if engaged at high wheel speeds, can lead to premature component wear as well as introducing premature wear onto related components such as the differential gearing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, it is desirable to have a simplified actuating mechanism for a differential lock that reduces the overall number of components, operates more efficiently, and is more cost effective, as well as overcoming the other above-mentioned deficiencies with the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A differential locking mechanism includes a clutch or shift collar that is movable in response to an electronic signal from an unlocked position where axle shaft speed differentiation under predetermined conditions is permitted to a locked position where axle shaft speed differentiation is not permitted. The differential locking mechanism is incorporated into a drive axle assembly that includes a differential having a differential gear assembly supported within a differential case. A pair of axle shafts are driven by the differential gear assembly, which receives driving input from a ring and pinion gear set coupled to a drive shaft. An electronic actuator generates an electronic signal to move the shift collar from the unlocked position to the locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the electronic actuator comprises a coil that surrounds a portion of the shift collar. The coil is selectively energized in response to an input command to lock the differential. When the coil is energized, the shift collar is moved in an inboard direction, toward the differential, to engage the differential case, which locks the differential. A resilient member, such as a spring, for example, automatically disengages the shift collar from the differential case and moves the shift collar back to the unlocked position when the coil is not energized.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one disclosed embodiment, the shift collar includes an inboard end having a splined surface for selective engagement with a mating splined surface on the differential case and an outboard end, which is surrounded by the coil. Preferably, the outboard end is smaller in diameter than the inboard end. The outboard end includes a splined bore in constant engagement with a mating splined surface on one of the axle shafts. A washer is mounted to the outboard end of the shift collar. The resilient member reacts between the washer and the coil to return the shift collar to the unlocked position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The method for controlling the differential lock assembly includes the following steps: energizing the coil surrounding the shift collar; and in response to the coil being energized, moving the shift collar from the unlocked position where speed differentiation between the pair axle shafts is permitted under predetermined conditions to a locked position where both of the axle shafts rotate at a common speed by fixing the shift collar to the differential case.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The subject invention provides a simplified and effective differential lock that significantly reduces the number of components from traditional designs, reduces assembly time, and reduces cost. These and other features of the present invention can be best understood from the following specifications and drawings, the following of which is a brief description.</p>

The powertrain <b>12</b> includes an engine <b>14</b>, transmission <b>16</b>, and drive shaft <b>18</b> that is coupled to a drive axle <b>20</b>. The drive axle <b>20</b> includes a carrier <b>22</b> positioned within an axle housing <b>24</b> as known. The carrier <b>22</b> includes a pinion gear <b>26</b>, operably coupled to the drive shaft <b>18</b>, and which is in driving engagement with a ring gear <b>28</b>. The ring gear <b>28</b> drives a differential <b>30</b>, which in turn drives a pair of axle shafts <b>32</b> that drive the vehicle wheels (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The differential <b>30</b> includes a differential locking mechanism, shown generally at <b>34</b>, which is actuated via an air supply connection <b>36</b>. The differential locking mechanism <b>34</b> is movable between an unlocked position where axle shaft speed differentiation is permitted and a locked position where the axle shafts are locked together to rotate at a common speed. The differential locking mechanism <b>34</b> includes a shift collar <b>38</b> and an air actuated shift fork <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the differential <b>30</b> includes a differential gear assembly, shown generally at <b>42</b>, and a two-piece differential housing case <b>44</b>. The two-piece differential case <b>44</b> includes a flange case half <b>44</b><i>a </i>that is attached to the ring gear <b>28</b> with a plurality of fasteners (not shown) such that the flange case half <b>44</b><i>a </i>and ring gear <b>28</b> rotate together as a single unit. The differential gear assembly <b>42</b> includes a differential spider <b>46</b> that has four (4) support shafts <b>48</b> orientated in the shape of a cross and has four (4) differential pinion gears <b>50</b>. One differential pinion gear <b>50</b> is supported for rotation on each support shaft <b>48</b>. The second piece of the two-piece differential case <b>44</b> comprises a plain case half <b>44</b><i>b </i>that includes four (4) slots <b>52</b> (only three (3) are shown). Each of the support shafts <b>48</b> is received within one of the slots <b>52</b> and the plain case half <b>44</b><i>b </i>is attached to the flange case half <b>44</b><i>a </i>with a plurality of fasteners (not shown). The differential gear assembly <b>42</b> also includes a pair of side gears <b>54</b> that are in meshing engagement with the differential pinion gears <b>50</b>. One side gear <b>54</b> is splined to each axle shaft <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Power is transferred from the pinion gear <b>26</b> to the differential case <b>44</b> to the axle shafts <b>32</b> via the side gears <b>54</b>. The side gears <b>54</b> are in constant mesh with the differential pinion gears <b>50</b>. When the vehicle is driven in a straight path, the ring gear <b>28</b>, differential case <b>44</b>, differential spider <b>46</b>, and differential pinion gears <b>50</b> all rotate as one unit to transfer power to the axle shafts <b>32</b> via the side gears <b>54</b>. There is no relative movement between the differential pinion gears <b>50</b> and the side gears <b>54</b>. When the vehicle turns, the differential pinion gears <b>50</b> rotate on their respective shafts <b>48</b> to speed up the rotation of one axle shaft <b>32</b> while slowing the rotation of the other axle shaft <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For adverse road conditions, the differential locking mechanism <b>34</b> is actuated to provide maximum wheel and tire traction for improved control. The locking mechanism <b>34</b> allows the axle shafts <b>32</b> to rotate at the same speed while transferring all available torque to the tire supported on the higher friction surface. For example if the tires at one end of the axle <b>20</b> were supported on an icy surface with the tire on the opposite end of the axle being supported on pavement, all available torque would be transferred to the tires on the pavement. If the tractive effort at these tires is sufficient, the vehicle can be moved off of the ice. When the differential <b>30</b> is locked, power is transmitted through the locked differential case <b>44</b>, differential gear assembly <b>42</b>, and axle shafts <b>32</b> rather than through the differential gear assembly <b>42</b> only.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described above and as shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the traditional differential locking mechanism <b>34</b> includes the air actuated shift collar <b>38</b> that locks the differential case <b>44</b> to the axle shafts <b>32</b>. The air operated shift fork <b>40</b> cooperates with the shift collar <b>38</b> to engage or disengage the locking mechanism <b>34</b> via a driver controlled switch (not shown). A push rod and spring assembly, shown generally at <b>56</b>, are activated pneumatically via an air connect <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The shift collar <b>38</b> is locked to the differential case <b>44</b> in the following manner. One of the axle shafts <b>32</b> includes an inboard set of splines <b>60</b>, closest to the differential <b>30</b>, and an outboard set of splines <b>62</b>. The inboard set of splines <b>60</b> are engaged with one differential side gear <b>54</b>, while the outboard set of splines <b>62</b> cooperate with the shift collar <b>38</b>. The shift collar <b>38</b>, although engaged with the outboard set of splines <b>62</b> in an unlocked position (shown in solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), is not engaged with the differential case <b>44</b>, thus the outboard set of splines <b>62</b> will rotate at the same speed as the respective side gear <b>54</b> when the differential <b>30</b> is in an unlocked or disengaged position allowing the main differential to operate in a normal manner.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the driver controlled switch is activated, air pressure causes the push rod and spring assembly <b>56</b> to move the shift collar <b>38</b> towards the differential <b>30</b> with the shift fork <b>40</b>. This allows the shift collar <b>38</b> to engage with the differential case <b>44</b>, while still remaining engaged with the axle shaft outboard set of splines <b>62</b> to achieve the locked position (shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Power transfer through the differential <b>30</b> is now achieved through the locked differential case <b>44</b>, differential gear assembly <b>42</b>, and both axle shafts <b>32</b> together, rather than through the differential gear assembly <b>42</b> alone.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An exploded view of the traditional differential locking mechanism <b>34</b> showing the shift fork <b>40</b>, shift collar <b>38</b>, and push rod and spring assembly <b>56</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The push rod and spring assembly <b>56</b> includes a push rod <b>64</b> with a piston <b>66</b>, o-ring <b>68</b>, and gasket <b>70</b> supported on one end. Four (4) cap screws <b>72</b> and four (4) associated washers <b>74</b> (only one set is shown) attach an air cylinder cover <b>76</b> with associated plug <b>78</b> to the gasket <b>70</b>. A spring <b>80</b> surrounds an opposite end of the push rod <b>64</b> and reacts between the piston <b>66</b> and shift fork <b>40</b>. A pair of pins <b>82</b> cooperate with the shift fork <b>40</b> to maintain proper orientation. A microswitch <b>84</b> and associated attachment nut <b>86</b> are also included in the differential locking mechanism <b>34</b> to monitor and inform the driver of the status of the differential <b>30</b>. Thus, over twenty (20) separate components are required to operate a traditional differential locking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">This significant number of components in addition to increasing material costs makes assembly more difficult, which increases assembly time and also adds to the overall cost. Further, requiring an air connect to actuate the system introduces possible air leaks to the system, which can lead to inadequate system performance. Also, the differential gear assembly <b>42</b> operates in an oil-lubed environment and the air actuation increases the risk of oil leaks in the system. Further, repeated engagement and disengagements between the shift fork <b>40</b> and shift collar <b>38</b>, especially if engaged at high speeds, can lead to premature component wear as well as introducing premature wear onto related components such as the differential gear assembly <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The subject invention provides an improved locking mechanism that significantly reduces the number of components and reduces overall cost and assembly time. A powertrain incorporating the subject invention is shown generally at <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The powertrain <b>100</b> includes an engine <b>102</b>, transmission <b>104</b>, and drive shaft <b>106</b> that is coupled to a drive axle <b>108</b>. The drive axle <b>108</b> includes a carrier <b>110</b> positioned within an axle housing <b>111</b> as known. It should be understood that the axle housing <b>111</b> includes housing portions that substantially enclose the axle shafts <b>118</b> and the carrier <b>110</b> within the housing <b>111</b>. Additionally, the housing <b>111</b> can be formed as a single piece or can be formed from multiple pieces that are attached together to form the complete axle and carrier housing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The carrier <b>110</b> includes a pinion gear <b>112</b>, operably coupled to the drive shaft <b>106</b>, and which is in driving engagement with a ring gear <b>114</b>. The ring gear <b>114</b> drives a differential <b>116</b>, which in turn drive a pair of axle shafts <b>118</b> that drive the vehicle wheels (not shown). The pinion gear <b>112</b> defines a longitudinal axis <b>120</b> and the axle shafts <b>118</b> define a lateral axis <b>122</b> that is transverse to the longitudinal axis <b>120</b>. It should be understood that the differential <b>116</b> includes similar components and operates in a similar manner to that described with regard to differential <b>30</b> above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The differential <b>116</b> includes a differential locking mechanism, shown generally at <b>124</b>, which includes a shift collar <b>126</b> that is electronically actuated via a coil <b>128</b>. The coil <b>128</b> is comprised of a coiled wire that surrounds a portion of the shift collar <b>126</b>. The coil <b>128</b> is connected to a power source <b>130</b>, such as a battery, that selectively energizes the coil <b>128</b> via an electronic signal <b>132</b>. When the coil <b>128</b> is energized via an input command <b>134</b> from a driver or other input source, the shift collar <b>126</b> acts as an electromagnet and can be moved from an unlocked position to a locked position. The operation of electromagnets is well known in the art and will not be discussed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An exploded view of the differential locking mechanism <b>124</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The coil <b>128</b> includes mount portions <b>136</b> that cooperate with fastener and nut assemblies <b>138</b> to attach the coil <b>128</b> to a portion of the carrier or axle housing <b>111</b>. The coil <b>128</b> forms a bore <b>140</b> in which one end of the shift collar <b>126</b> is received. A resilient return member <b>142</b>, such as a coil spring, spring discs, or other similar mechanism, cooperates with a washer <b>144</b> to return the shift collar <b>126</b> to an unlocked position once the coil <b>128</b> is no longer energized. A microswitch <b>146</b> and associated attachment nut <b>148</b> are also included in the differential locking mechanism <b>124</b> to monitor and inform the driver of the status of the differential <b>116</b>. Thus, the number of components for the differential locking mechanism <b>124</b> are reduced by over half when compared to the traditional air actuated design.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the differential locking mechanism <b>124</b> in the unlocked or disengaged position with the coil <b>128</b> in an unenergized state. The shift collar <b>126</b>, splined to the axle shaft <b>118</b> in a manner similar to that described above, is positioned outboard of and is disengaged from the differential case <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the differential locking mechanism <b>124</b> in the engaged or locked position. In this position, the coil <b>128</b> is energized via the power source <b>130</b>, which moves the shift collar <b>126</b> linearly in an inboard direction along the lateral axis <b>122</b> until a spline attachment <b>150</b> is achieved with the differential case <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The axle shaft <b>118</b> includes an inboard set of splines <b>152</b>, closest to the differential <b>116</b>, and an outboard set of splines <b>154</b>. The inboard set of splines <b>152</b> are engaged with one differential side gear <b>54</b>, while the outboard set of splines <b>154</b> cooperate with the shift collar <b>126</b>. The shift collar <b>126</b>, although engaged with the outboard set of splines <b>154</b> in an unlocked position (shown in solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), is not engaged with the differential case <b>44</b>, thus the outboard set of splines <b>62</b> will rotate at the same speed as the respective side gear <b>54</b> when the differential <b>116</b> is in an unlocked or disengaged position allowing the main differential to operate in a normal manner. When the input command <b>134</b> is issued, the power source <b>130</b> is energized, which causes the shift collar <b>126</b> to move towards the differential <b>116</b>. This allows the shift collar <b>126</b> to engage with the differential case <b>44</b>, while still remaining engaged with the axle shaft outboard set of splines <b>154</b> to achieve the locked position (shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Power transfer through the differential <b>116</b> is now achieved through the locked differential case <b>44</b>, differential gear assembly <b>42</b>, and both axle shafts <b>118</b> together, rather than through the differential gear assembly <b>42</b> alone.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The shift collar <b>126</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The shift collar <b>126</b> includes an inboard end <b>160</b> and an outboard end <b>162</b> that is smaller in diameter than the inboard end <b>160</b>. A central bore <b>164</b> extends through the shift collar <b>126</b> and receives the axle shaft <b>118</b>. The central bore <b>164</b> includes a splined surface <b>166</b> that mates with the outboard set of splines <b>154</b> of the axle shaft <b>118</b>. The inboard end <b>160</b> includes a splined surface <b>168</b> that engages a mating splined surface <b>170</b> on the differential case <b>44</b> indicated at <b>150</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The washer <b>144</b> is mounted to the outboard end <b>162</b> of the shift collar <b>126</b>. The washer <b>144</b>, shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, includes a central bore <b>172</b> that is received over the <b>126</b>. A plurality of slots <b>174</b> are formed about the circumference of the washer <b>144</b> which is greater in diameter than the outboard end <b>162</b> but smaller in diameter than the inboard end <b>160</b>. The resilient return member <b>142</b> reacts between the washer <b>144</b> and the coil <b>128</b> to return the shift collar <b>126</b> to the unlocked position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The method for controlling the differential locking mechanism <b>124</b> for the drive axle <b>108</b> includes the steps of energizing the coil <b>128</b>, which surrounds a portion of the outboard end <b>162</b> of the shift collar <b>126</b>; and in response to energizing the coil <b>128</b>, moving the shift collar <b>126</b> from the unlocked position where speed differentiation between the pair axle shafts <b>118</b> is permitted under predetermined conditions to a locked position where both of the axle shafts <b>118</b> rotate at a common speed by fixing the shift collar <b>126</b> to the differential case <b>44</b>. Additionally, the shift collar <b>126</b> is automatically returned to the unlocked position, i.e. is disengaged from the differential case <b>44</b>, when the power supply <b>130</b> is cut from the coil <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The subject invention provides a simplified and effective differential lock that significantly reduces the number of components from traditional designs, reduces assembly time, and reduces cost.
