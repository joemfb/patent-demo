<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for perforating a web in the cross machine direction. Additionally, the present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for perforating a web in the cross-machine direction wherein the web includes elastic members extending in a machine direction.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In conventional perforating methods, a line of perforations is formed by cutting or punching through a web at spaced intervals to form a line of discontinuous cuts defined by cut segments separated by uncut regions. Conventional perforating is frequently undertaken with a standard knife and anvil system wherein the knife includes a plurality of notches in the cutting edge that corresponded to the uncut regions in the line of discontinuous cuts. In conventional perforating methods, changing the relative density and/or size of the cut segments and/or the uncut regions requires obtaining new knives having notches of the appropriate size and spacing to create the desired new pattern. Additionally, in conventional systems, as old knives become dull, new knives must be modified with the appropriate notch sizes and spacing to create the desired pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, conventional perforating methods are not optimal for perforating webs with elastic members or other reinforcing members extending in the machine direction because the elastics disposed in the cut segments are cut and the elastics disposed in the uncut regions remain whole and thus retain their strength. This provides an impediment to separation of the web along the line of perforation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, inherent variability in the cross-directional tracking of the web and cross-directional placement of the elastics results in a varying number of elastics being cut at various times. As such, the force required to break the web at the line of perforation also varies over time and causes difficulties in processing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there exists a need for a method and apparatus for perforating a web wherein the perforation pattern can be changed without changing the knife. There also exists a need for a method and apparatus for perforating a web wherein the knives do not need to be altered to achieve the desired perforation pattern. Finally, there exists a need for a method and apparatus for perforating a web having elastic members extending in the machine direction wherein each of the elastic members are consistently cut or damaged.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present invention provides an anvil roll. The anvil roll includes an anvil surface having a plurality of grooves. The grooves have a variable cross-machine direction groove width. In some embodiments, the plurality of grooves may be angled. In some embodiments, the anvil surface may be part of an insert. In some embodiments, the anvil surface may be made of cobalt sub-micron HIP carbide. In some embodiments, the anvil surface may have a radius in the machine direction of 6 to 12 inches. In some embodiments, the cross-machine direction groove width may vary from about 0.015 inches to about 0.006 inches. In some embodiments, the grooves may be spaced apart by about 0.1 inches as measured in the machine direction. In some embodiments, the grooves may be spaced apart by about 0.160 inches as measured in the cross machine direction. In some embodiments, the grooves may have a groove angle of about 25 degrees to 45 degrees. In some embodiments, a majority of the grooves may have a straight edge taper.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a particular embodiment, the plurality of grooves may be angled, the anvil surface may be part of an insert, the grooves may have a groove angle of 25 to 45 degrees, and the grooves may have a straight edge taper.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, the present invention provides a perforation apparatus. The apparatus includes a knife roll, an anvil roll, and a cutting nip. The knife roll is adapted to be rotated about a knife roll axis. The knife roll includes at least one cutting edge. The anvil roll is adapted to be rotated about an anvil roll axis. The anvil roll axis is parallel with the knife roll axis. The anvil roll has an outer surface wherein at least a portion of the outer surface defines an anvil surface. The anvil surface includes a plurality of angled grooves. The cutting nip is defined by the point wherein the cutting edge contacts the anvil surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In various embodiments, the cutting edge may be continuous. In some embodiments, the cutting edge may be aligned parallel with the knife roll axis.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention provides a grooved anvil that may be used in conjunction with a cutting edge in a pinch cut operation to perforate a web. The web may include one or more elastics extending in the machine direction. The grooves in the anvil may be positioned at an angle relative to the machine direction such that an elastic running in the machine direction would be less likely to align with the groove in the anvil and more likely to be cut or damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the present invention provides a grooved anvil that may be used in conjunction with a pinch cut knife to perforate a web and the grooves may be tapered so that the uncut portion of the web can be adjusted by changing the position wherein the knife hits the anvil (i.e., the machine direction cutting position). This allows fine-tuning of the perforation pattern to suit various materials, process conditions, and/or grade changes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a web <b>10</b> and a perforation apparatus <b>12</b> are illustrated in a perspective view. The web <b>10</b> is illustrated as moving in a machine direction <b>14</b>. The web <b>10</b> passes through the perforation apparatus <b>12</b> resulting in a perforation <b>11</b> that extends generally in a cross-machine direction <b>16</b>. The cross-machine direction is defined as the direction perpendicular to the machine direction <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The perforation apparatus <b>12</b> includes a rotatable knife roll <b>18</b>. The rotatable knife roll <b>18</b> has a knife roll outer surface <b>20</b> and may be adapted to rotate about a knife roll axis <b>22</b>. The outer surface <b>20</b> of the rotatable knife roll <b>18</b> includes at least one cutting edge <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the knife roll axis <b>22</b> may be parallel with the cross machine direction <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The perforation apparatus <b>12</b> also includes a rotatable anvil roll <b>26</b>. The rotatable anvil roll <b>26</b> has an anvil roll outer surface <b>28</b> and may be adapted to rotate about an anvil roll axis <b>30</b>. At least a portion of the outer surface <b>28</b> of the anvil roll <b>26</b> defines an anvil surface <b>32</b>. In some embodiments, the anvil surface <b>32</b> may be an integral portion of the outer surface <b>28</b> of the anvil roll <b>26</b>. For example, the entire outer surface <b>28</b> of the anvil roll <b>26</b> may be hardened to function as the anvil surface <b>32</b>. This arrangement would not require phasing as the cutting edge could strike any portion of the anvil roll <b>26</b>. In other embodiments, the anvil surface <b>32</b> may be associated with one or more anvil inserts <b>34</b> which are adapted to coordinate with the outer surface <b>28</b> of the anvil roll <b>26</b> as representatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This arrangement allows the replacement of worn inserts <b>34</b> without replacing the remainder of the anvil roll <b>26</b>. Furthermore, anvil inserts <b>34</b> allow for specialty materials to be used as the anvil surface <b>32</b> that may be too costly to use for the entire outer surface <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In various embodiments, the knife roll axis <b>22</b> may be parallel to the anvil roll axis <b>30</b>. In some embodiments, the knife roll axis <b>22</b> may be non-parallel to the anvil roll axis <b>30</b>. In some embodiments, the knife roll axis <b>22</b> and/or the anvil roll axis <b>30</b> may be parallel or non-parallel with the cross-machine direction <b>16</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the knife roll axis <b>22</b> is parallel with the anvil roll axis <b>30</b> and parallel with the cross-machine direction <b>16</b>. In other words, the knife roll axis <b>22</b> and the anvil roll axis <b>30</b> are both perpendicular to the machine direction <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The perforation apparatus <b>12</b> also includes a cutting nip <b>36</b>. The cutting nip <b>36</b> has a nip gap measured at the point wherein the cutting edge <b>24</b> of the knife roll <b>18</b> passes in closest proximity to the anvil surface <b>32</b> of the anvil roll <b>26</b>. The nip gap may be any suitable distance based on the composition of the web <b>10</b> being perforated. In various embodiments, there may be no nip gap and the cutting edge <b>24</b> of the knife roll <b>18</b> may contact the anvil surface <b>32</b> of the anvil roll <b>26</b> with varying degrees of interference. For example, the cutting edge <b>24</b> may contact the anvil surface <b>32</b> with at least 0.001 inch, at least 0.002 inch, at least 0.003 inch, at least 0.004 inch, at least 0.005 inch, or at least 0.006 inch of interference.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the anvil insert <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated in a perspective view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> representatively illustrates an enlarged top view of the anvil insert <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> representatively illustrates an end view of the anvil insert <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. While characteristics of the anvil surface <b>32</b> are illustrated herein as part of an anvil insert <b>34</b>, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the characteristics of the anvil surface <b>32</b>, as discussed herein, are equally applicable to anvil surfaces <b>32</b> that form an integral part of the outer surface <b>28</b> of the anvil roll <b>26</b> and combinations of integral anvil surfaces and inserts.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The anvil surface <b>32</b> of the present invention may be made of any suitable material or combinations of materials. For example, the anvil surface <b>32</b> may be made from any suitable metal, alloy, ceramic, or the like, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the anvil surface <b>32</b> may include sintered alumina; silicon nitride; high speed specialty steel; high carbon steel; high chrome specialty steel; tungsten carbide; submicron tungsten/cobalt carbide, or the like, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the carbide may be Sinter HIP submicron ranging from 6% to 15% binder. In some embodiments, the binder may be nickel. In a particular embodiment, the anvil surface <b>32</b> may be made of 10% cobalt sub-micron HIP carbide.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the anvil surface <b>32</b> may include one or more coating materials. For example, the anvil surface <b>32</b> may include titanium nitride coatings, Teflon brand coating, nickel coating, chrome plating, or the like, or combinations thereof. Suitable anvils and corresponding anvil surfaces are available from Everwear, Inc. having offices at 401 Stag Industry Blvd, Lake St. Louis, Mo., USA.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the anvil surface <b>32</b> may have an anvil surface radius <b>38</b> in the machine direction <b>14</b> and measured relative to the anvil roll axis <b>30</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The anvil surface radius <b>38</b> may be any suitable dimension to coordinate with the surface radius of the anvil roll outer surface <b>28</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the anvil surface radius <b>38</b> may be 2 to 24 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the anvil insert <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is illustrated in an enlarged top view. The anvil insert <b>34</b> has an anvil surface <b>32</b>. The anvil surface <b>32</b> includes a plurality of grooves <b>40</b>. In various embodiments, the grooves <b>40</b> may be parallel to the machine direction <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the grooves <b>40</b> may be angled relative to the anvil roll axis <b>30</b> and relative to the cross-machine direction <b>16</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;angled&#x201d; describes grooves <b>40</b> that form acute groove angles <b>42</b> of more than zero degrees and less than 90 degrees relative to the anvil roll axis <b>30</b> and relative to the cross-machine direction <b>16</b>. In other words, the grooves <b>40</b> may form groove angles <b>42</b> that are not parallel with machine direction <b>14</b> and are not parallel with the cross-machine direction <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In various embodiments, the acute groove angles <b>42</b> formed by the grooves <b>40</b> may be 1 to 89 degrees, 10 to 75 degrees, or 20 to 50 degrees. In some embodiments, the acute groove angle <b>42</b> may be 25 to 45 degrees relative to the anvil roll axis of rotation <b>30</b> and/or the cross-machine direction <b>16</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the grooves <b>40</b> are angled and form acute groove angles <b>42</b> of about 30 degrees relative to the cross-machine direction <b>16</b> and the anvil roll axis <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order to more clearly illustrate the details of the present invention, portions of the anvil surface <b>32</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are designated as detail A, detail B, and detail C. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> representatively illustrates an enlarged view of the portion of the anvil surface <b>32</b> designated as detail A. Likewise, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref> representatively illustrate enlarged views of the portions of the anvil surface <b>32</b> designated as detail B and detail C respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the anvil surface <b>32</b> includes a plurality of grooves <b>40</b> having a plurality of groove centerlines <b>44</b>. The anvil surface <b>32</b> may include a first edge <b>46</b> defining the transition, in the machine direction <b>14</b>, from the anvil roll outer surface <b>28</b> to the anvil surface <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The anvil surface <b>32</b> may also include a second edge <b>48</b> defining the transition, in the machine direction <b>14</b>, from the anvil surface <b>32</b> to the anvil roll outer surface <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In various embodiments, one or more of the grooves <b>40</b> may extend from the first edge <b>46</b> to the second edge <b>48</b>. In some embodiments, one or more of the grooves <b>40</b> may stop short of the first edge <b>46</b> and/or the second edge <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The grooves <b>40</b> may have a first groove width <b>50</b> as measured at the portion of the groove <b>40</b> most proximate the first edge <b>46</b>. The grooves <b>40</b> may have a second groove width <b>52</b> measured at the portion of the groove <b>40</b> most proximate the second edge <b>48</b>. The first width <b>50</b> and the second width <b>52</b> are measured perpendicular to the groove centerline <b>44</b>. In various embodiments, the first groove width <b>50</b> may be the same as the second groove width <b>52</b> or may be different. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the first groove width <b>50</b> is greater than the second groove width <b>52</b> thereby creating tapered grooves <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The grooves <b>40</b> may also have a first cross-machine direction (CD) width <b>54</b>, as measured in the cross-machine direction <b>16</b>, at the portion of the groove <b>40</b> most proximate the first edge <b>46</b>. Likewise, the grooves <b>40</b> may have a second cross-machine direction (CD) width <b>56</b>, as measured in the cross-machine direction <b>16</b>, at the portion of the groove <b>40</b> most proximate the second edge <b>48</b>. In various embodiments, the first CD width <b>54</b> may be the same as the second CD width <b>56</b> or may be different. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the first CD width <b>54</b> is greater than the second CD width <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the groove width and/or groove CD width may be variable. As used herein, the term &#x201c;variable&#x201d; describes a groove <b>40</b> having a centerline <b>44</b> wherein the width of the groove at a first location is different than the width of the groove at a second location as measured perpendicularly to the centerline <b>44</b>. For example, the grooves <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> are variable. Specifically, the grooves <b>40</b> are illustrated as having a straight taper with the wider end at the first edge <b>46</b> and the narrower end at the second edge <b>48</b>. In some embodiments, the groove width tapers from about 0.0150 inches to about 0.0060 inches. One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the taper could have any suitable size and rate of divergence and/or convergence. Furthermore, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the taper could easily be reversed such that the wider end of the taper was proximate the second edge <b>48</b> and the narrower end of the taper was proximate the first edge <b>46</b>. In embodiments wherein the grooves <b>40</b> have a variable width, the groove angle <b>42</b> is measured with reference to the centerline <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In various embodiments, the grooves <b>40</b> may have any suitable machine direction spacing. In some embodiments, the grooves <b>40</b> may have a first groove spacing <b>58</b> and a second groove spacing <b>60</b> as measured in the machine direction <b>14</b>. The first groove spacing <b>58</b> and the second groove spacing <b>60</b> may be the same or different (i.e., variable machine direction groove spacing). For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the first groove spacing <b>58</b> is the same as the second groove spacing <b>60</b>. In various embodiments, the machine direction groove spacing may be any suitable distance. For example, in some embodiments, the grooves <b>40</b> may all be spaced apart by about 0.1 inches as measured in the machine direction <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In various embodiments, the grooves <b>40</b> may have any suitable cross-machine direction spacing. In some embodiments, the grooves <b>40</b> may have a first groove spacing <b>62</b>, as measured in the cross-machine direction <b>16</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. The grooves <b>40</b> have a second groove spacing <b>64</b>, as measured in the cross-machine direction <b>16</b> and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The first groove spacing <b>62</b> and the second groove spacing <b>64</b> may be the same or may be different (i.e., variable CD groove spacing). For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the first groove spacing <b>62</b> is the same as the second groove spacing <b>64</b>. In various embodiments, the groove spacing may be any suitable distance. For example, in some embodiments, the grooves may all be spaced apart by about 0.16 inches as measured in the cross-machine direction <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In various embodiments, one or more of the grooves <b>40</b> may have any suitable length, width, depth, cross-sectional shape, and/or groove angle. In various embodiments, one or more of the grooves may have a variable intra-groove (i.e., within a single groove) width, depth, cross-sectional shape, and/or groove angle. In some embodiments, the various grooves may have variable inter-groove (i.e., between two different grooves) spacing, length, width, depth, cross-sectional shape, and/or groove angle. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates a plurality of grooves <b>40</b> wherein each groove <b>40</b> has a variable intra-groove width. However, the grooves <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> are generally uniform from groove to groove (inter-groove).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the majority of the grooves <b>40</b> have a variable intra-groove width. For example, in some embodiments, the majority of the grooves may have a straight edge taper as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3B</figref>. As a result of this taper, the grooves <b>40</b> may have various CD widths at various machine direction (MD) cutting positions. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the effective CD width of the grooves can be changed by changing the MD cutting position. Specifically, at a first MD cutting position <b>72</b> the grooves <b>40</b> may have a first CD width <b>84</b>. At a second MD cutting position <b>74</b>, the grooves <b>40</b> may have a second CD width <b>86</b> greater than the first CD width <b>84</b>. Likewise, at a third MD cutting position <b>76</b>, the grooves <b>40</b> may have a third CD width <b>88</b> greater than the second CD width <b>86</b>. Finally, at a fourth MD cutting position <b>78</b>, the grooves <b>40</b> may have a fourth CD width <b>90</b> greater than the third CD width <b>88</b>. One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that any number of MD cutting positions may be chosen to achieve the corresponding CD width that is desired. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that increasing the rate of taper of the groove will increase the rate of change of CD groove width associated with each MD cutting position change.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The perforation apparatus of claim <b>10</b> may include any suitable cutting edge <b>24</b>. While the cutting edge <b>24</b> is illustrated herein as a rotary cutter, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that reciprocating die cutters or any other suitable cutters could also be utilized. Furthermore, while the cutting edge <b>24</b> is illustrated herein as a pinch cutter, any suitable cutting mechanism or combination, such as a shear cutter, is also contemplated. In various embodiments, the cutting edge <b>24</b> may be made of any suitable material. For example, the cutting edge <b>24</b> may be made from any suitable metal, alloy, ceramic, or the like, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the cutting edge <b>24</b> may include sintered alumina; silicon nitride; high speed specialty steel; high carbon, high chrome specialty steel; tungsten carbide; submicron tungsten/cobalt carbide, or the like, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the carbide may be Sinter HIP submicron ranging from 6% to 15% binder. In some embodiments, a nickel binder may also be suitable. In some embodiments the cutting edge <b>24</b> may include a submicron carbide insert and a stainless steel body.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the cutting edge <b>24</b> may include one or more coating materials. For example, the cutting edge <b>24</b> may include titanium nitride coatings, Teflon brand coating, nickel coating, chrome plating, or the like, or combinations thereof.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In various embodiments, the cutting edge <b>24</b> may be notched or may be continuous. As used herein, the term &#x201c;continuous&#x201d; is used to define a cutting edge having no nicks, gaps, spaces, notches or the like greater than 1 mm wide by 1 mm deep.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus <b>12</b> described herein is suitably used as part of a method for perforating a web <b>10</b>. The method may include providing the web <b>10</b>, passing the web <b>10</b> through the apparatus <b>12</b> in the machine direction <b>14</b> to create perforations <b>11</b>. The apparatus <b>12</b> includes an anvil roll <b>26</b> which includes an anvil surface <b>32</b>. The anvil roll <b>26</b> is adapted to rotate about the anvil roll axis <b>30</b> in the direction indicated by arrow <b>66</b>. The anvil surface <b>32</b> may include a plurality of grooves <b>40</b> separated by a plurality of lands <b>70</b>. In some embodiments, the grooves <b>40</b> may be parallel with the machine direction <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the grooves <b>40</b> may form acute groove angles <b>42</b> of more than zero degrees and less than 90 degrees relative to the cross-machine direction <b>14</b> and the anvil roll axis <b>30</b> as described herein. In various embodiments, the grooves <b>40</b> may have a variable groove width as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The apparatus <b>12</b> may further include a knife roll <b>18</b> which includes a cutting edge <b>24</b>. The knife roll <b>18</b> is adapted to rotate about the knife roll axis <b>22</b> in the direction indicated by arrow <b>68</b>. The method includes perforating the web <b>10</b> in a cutting nip <b>36</b> defined by the point wherein the cutting edge <b>24</b> contacts or comes into closest proximity to the anvil surface <b>32</b>. The web <b>10</b> is pressed between the cutting edge <b>24</b> and the anvil surface <b>32</b> in the cutting nip <b>35</b> to create perforations <b>11</b> in the web <b>10</b>. The perforations <b>11</b> include a plurality of connectors <b>82</b> separated by a plurality of slits <b>80</b> as representatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an enlarged view of the detail D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, in various embodiments, the method may include contacting the cutting edge <b>24</b> against the anvil surface <b>32</b> at a first machine direction cutting position <b>72</b> which corresponds to a first CD groove width <b>84</b>. The pressure of the cutting edge <b>24</b> against the anvil surface <b>32</b> cuts the web <b>10</b> at the lands <b>70</b> resulting in slits <b>80</b> and maintains the web <b>10</b> at the grooves <b>40</b> resulting in connectors <b>82</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>

Creating the perforation <b>11</b> at the second machine direction cutting position <b>74</b> results in smaller slits <b>80</b> and larger connectors <b>82</b> due to the increased CD groove width <b>86</b> which in turn is due to the variable width of the grooves <b>40</b>. Likewise, in various embodiments, the relative size of the connectors <b>82</b> and the slits <b>80</b> can be altered by phasing the apparatus <b>12</b> so as to contact the cutting edge <b>24</b> against the anvil surface <b>32</b> at a third and fourth machine direction cutting positions <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> to effectively alter the CD groove widths <b>88</b> and <b>90</b> respectively.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The CD groove widths <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, and <b>90</b> may be any suitable size depending on the application. In some embodiments, the CD groove widths <b>84</b>-<b>90</b> may range from about 0.0015 inches to about 0.030 inches. In a specific embodiment, the CD groove width <b>84</b> may be about 0.015 inches, the CD groove width <b>86</b> may be about 0.019 inches, the CD groove width <b>88</b> may be about 0.023 inches, and the CD groove width <b>90</b> may be about 0.27 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In various embodiments, the method and apparatus may be used with any suitable web <b>10</b>. The web <b>10</b> may be made of any suitable material or combination of materials. For example, the web <b>10</b> may include woven materials, nonwoven materials, films, mesh, scrim, reinforcement strands, and the like, and combinations thereof. The web <b>10</b> may be a single layer of material or the web <b>10</b> may be a laminate material including two or more layers. The various layers may be coextensive in width or one layer may be wider or narrower than another. The web <b>10</b> may further include one or more discrete pieces of material. In some embodiments, the web <b>10</b> may include at least one strand of elastic material, reinforcement material, or the like. In some embodiments, the web <b>10</b> may include at least one carrier material <b>92</b> and a plurality of elastic strands <b>94</b> extending in the machine direction <b>14</b>. In these embodiments, the method may further include perforating the web <b>10</b> by cutting or damaging one or more of the strands of elastic <b>94</b> and maintaining portions of the carrier <b>92</b> as the connectors <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the web <b>10</b> may be a laminate material. The laminate may include a carrier layer made of a nonwoven material or a tissue. The nonwoven material may be a spunbond-meltblown-spunbond laminate. The carrier layer may include a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or more elastics extending in the machine direction. The carrier layer may be folded around the elastic strands which may be adhesively encapsulated therein. The elastic strands may have a diameter of about 0.005 to about 0.030 inches. In some embodiments, the elastic strands may have an average diameter of about 0.009 inches to about 0.020 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In embodiments wherein the grooves <b>40</b> are angled, the elastic strands <b>94</b> running in the machine direction <b>14</b> cannot align perfectly with the grooves <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, the elastic strands <b>94</b> may be aligned with the lands <b>70</b> in the cutting nip <b>36</b> such than the elastic strands <b>94</b> are cut during perforation. In other embodiments wherein the cutting edge <b>24</b> contacts the elastic strand <b>94</b> directly over a groove <b>40</b>, the elastic strand <b>94</b> will be forced over a leading edge <b>96</b> and a trailing edge <b>98</b> of the groove <b>40</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> representatively illustrates an enlarged view of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an elastic strand <b>94</b> extending in the machine direction <b>14</b> across an anvil surface <b>32</b>. The anvil surface <b>32</b> includes grooves <b>40</b> which are angled. A cutting edge <b>24</b> is shown in phantom to better illustrate the groove. The cutting edge contacts the anvil surface <b>32</b> to define a cutting nip <b>36</b>. The web is removed to better illustrate the apparatus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the situation wherein the elastic strand <b>94</b> aligns over a groove <b>40</b> in the cutting nip <b>36</b>. In these situations, it is believed that the elastic strand <b>94</b> is pressed over a leading edge <b>96</b> and a trailing edge <b>98</b> of the groove <b>40</b> as the cutting edge <b>24</b> presses a portion of the elastic strand <b>94</b> into the groove <b>40</b>. Thus, even if the elastic strand <b>94</b> is not cut completely, the elastic strand <b>94</b> is pinched against the leading edge <b>96</b> and the trailing edge <b>98</b> and is believed to be sufficiently damaged to minimize the impact on the method. In other words, the angled grooves <b>40</b> minimize the likelihood that the elastic strands <b>94</b> perfectly align with a groove <b>40</b> and thereby avoid being, at least partially, cut or damaged between the cutting edge <b>24</b> and the anvil surface <b>32</b>.</p>
