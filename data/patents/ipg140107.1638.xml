<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-121389, filed on Apr. 19, 2005; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application is related to the co-pending U.S. patent application entitled &#x201c;GAMING MACHINE, GAMING INFORMATION AUTHENTICATION AND ACQUISITION DEVICE, AND GAMING INFORMATION ACQUISITION DEVICE&#x201d; referred to as the Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-121397, filed in Japan on Apr. 19, 2005. The co-pending application including the specification, drawing and claims are expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a gaming machine, a gaming information authenticating and loading device, and an loading device for loading gaming information, whereby gaming information recorded on a portable storage medium can be authenticated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Related Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the prior art, various types of gaming machines are known, such as gaming machines known as video game machines, slot machines, Pachislo machines, Pachinko machines, or the like, which provide image-based gaming by using images displayed on image display means. In recent years, in this type of gaming machine, it has become possible to supply a program (hereinafter, called a &#x201c;gaming program&#x201d;) used to control the operations required for playing the game, such as controlling the progress of the game, controlling the display of images, and judging whether or not a prize has been won (a hit or miss judgment), and various types of game used for playing the game (hereinafter, collectively referred to as &#x201c;gaming information&#x201d;), by means of a storage medium. For example, gaming information is stored in a small, portable storage medium, such as a compact flash memory (registered trademark; also called &#x201c;CF card&#x201d;), and the gaming machine has a component which allows attachment and detachment of the storage medium, gaming information being supplied to the gaming machine by means of this storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Nevertheless, since the storage medium which stores the gaming information is detachable with respect to the gaming machine, then there is a risk that the medium could be removed from the gaming machine and used to perform illegal actions, such as duplicating or manipulating the gaming information stored on the medium. Therefore, in cases where gaming information is supplied by means of a storage medium, it is necessary to prevent illegal actions relating to the storage medium which stores the gaming information.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With regard to this point, for example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2001-344096 discloses a method in which, when a storage medium is attached to a game device, storing identification information that is unique to the game device is stored on the storage medium from the game device, and identification information that is unique to the gaming information is also stored on the game device from the storage medium. Then, according to the method, the software stored on the storage medium is executed if the two sets of the identification information are the same in the game device and the storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2002-341957 discloses technology relating to the startup of a computer when a removable unit is attached to a computer main body, whereby the content of a user code stored in the removable unit is compared with the content of a unit code stored in the computer main body, and permission to start up the system is decided according to whether or not the respective contents are matching.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Hei. 8-241194 discloses a video game system in which a security check is performed repeatedly during the progress of a game, in order to compare a security code set in an information processing device, with an accumulation device (storage medium) which stores a game program and a security code.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in the conventional examples described in the aforementioned publications, there is a problem in that only the storage medium itself is authenticated, whereas authentication of the actual gaming information is not performed, in other words, it is not checked and verified that the gaming information stored on the storage medium has not been manipulated in some way.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In other words, the technology described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2001-344096 simply makes it possible to prevent illegal actions of duplicating the gaming information stored on the storage medium, but it does not make it possible to prevent manipulation of the actual gaming information. Furthermore, in the technology described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2002-341957, although authentication is carried out in respect of the removable unit itself, the data stored in the unit is not authenticated, and therefore, this technology does not make it possible to prevent manipulation of the data stored in the unit. Moreover, in the video game system described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Hei. 8-241194, although transfer to and execution of illegal software after the security check is prevented, it is not possible to prevent manipulation of the data stored on the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, the present invention is devised in order to resolve the aforementioned problems, an object thereof being to provide a gaming machine, a gaming information authenticating and loading device, and an loading device for loading gaming information, whereby the gaming information stored on a storage medium can be authenticated.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, a gaming machine comprises a gaming operation execution device executing gaming operations for playing a game; a loading device including a connector for connecting a storage medium which stores gaming information to be used in playing the game, a program memory for storing an authentication program for authenticating the gaming information stored on the storage medium connected to the connector, and a processor for authenticating the gaming information with the authentication program stored in the program memory; and a processing device connected to the loading device, including a readable and writable memory, a reading unit for reading out the gaming information authenticated by the processor, a writing unit for writing the gaming information read out by the reading unit to the readable and writable memory, and an operation control unit for controlling the gaming operation execution device in accordance with the gaming information written to the readable and writable memory by the writing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this gaming machine, since the loading device is connected to the processing device, by connecting a storage medium storing gaming information to the connector of the loading device, it is possible to load the gaming information stored on the storage medium and to store the information in the readable and writable memory of the processing device. Furthermore, since an authentication program for authenticating the gaming information is stored in the program memory of the loading device, the loading process is carried out after the processor has performed authentication processing with the authentication program.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, the processor of the loading device may send an authentication completion signal to the reading unit of the processing device when completing authentication of the gaming information, and the reading unit may suspend readout of the gaming information until receiving the authentication completion signal from the processor. In this case, it is possible reliably to prevent situations where the reading unit reads out the gaming information before the authentication process of the gaming information by the processor has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, the reading unit may perform readout of the gaming information after detecting completion of authentication of the gaming information by the processor. In this case, it is possible reliably to prevent situations where the reading unit reads out the gaming information before the authentication process of the gaming information by the processor has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the invention, the gaming information authenticating and loading device comprises a loading device including a connector for connecting a storage medium which stores gaming information to be used in playing a game, a program memory for storing an authentication program for authenticating the gaming information stored on the storage medium connected to the connector, and a processor for authenticating the gaming information with the authentication program stored in the program memory; and a processing device connected to the loading device, including a readable and writable memory, a reading unit for reading out the gaming information authenticated by the processor, a writing unit for writing the gaming information read out by the reading unit to the readable and writable memory.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this gaming information authenticating and loading device, since the loading device is connected to the processing device, by connecting a storage medium storing gaming information to the connector of the loading device, it is possible to load the gaming information stored on the storage medium and to store the information in the readable and writable memory of the processing device. Furthermore, since an authentication program for authenticating the gaming information is stored in the program memory of the loading device, the loading process is carried out after the processor has performed authentication processing with the authentication program.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Moreover, the processor of the loading device may send an authentication completion signal to the reading unit of the processing device when completing authentication of the gaming information, and the reading unit may suspend readout of the gaming information until receiving the authentication completion signal from the processor. In this case, it is possible reliably to prevent situations where the reading unit reads out the gaming information before the authentication process of the gaming information by the processor has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, the reading unit may perform readout of the gaming information after detecting completion of authentication of the gaming information by the processor. In this case, it is possible reliably to prevent situations where the reading unit reads out the gaming information before the authentication process of the gaming information by the processor has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the invention, the gaming information loading device is for loading stored gaming information to be used in playing a game from a storage medium and for sending the gaming information into a connected motherboard. The gaming information loading device comprises a connector for connecting a storage medium which stores the gaming information to be used in playing the game; a program memory for storing an authentication program for authenticating the gaming information stored on the storage medium connected to the connector; and a processor for authenticating the gaming information with the authentication program stored in the program memory.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the gaming information loading device is connected to the motherboard, it is possible to carry out authentication processing for the gaming information with the authentication program before the gaming information stored in a storage medium connected to the connector is read out by the motherboard.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Moreover, the slot machine <b>41</b> comprises, as the aforementioned gaming operation execution devices, a lamp drive circuit <b>59</b>, a lamp <b>60</b>, an LED drive circuit <b>61</b>, an LED <b>62</b>, a hopper drive circuit <b>63</b>, a hopper <b>64</b>, a pay-out completion signal circuit <b>65</b>, a coin detector unit <b>66</b>, an image control circuit <b>71</b> and an audio control circuit <b>72</b>. The elements from the lamp drive circuit <b>59</b> until the audio control circuit <b>72</b> constitute a group of gaming operation execution devices.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The lamp drive circuit <b>59</b> outputs a signal to the lamp <b>60</b> for causing the lamp <b>60</b> to light up and switching the lamp <b>60</b> on and off during the game. By means of this switching on and off, a game performance is created. The LED drive circuit <b>61</b> controls the on and off display of the LED <b>62</b>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, the power supply unit <b>39</b> is connected to the other constituent elements, as well as the motherboard <b>20</b>, but in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in order to simplify the diagram, the connections between the power source unit <b>39</b> and the constituent elements other than the motherboard <b>20</b> are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">(Operation of gaming information authenticating and loading device and slot machine)</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, the details of the operation of the gaming information authenticating and loading device <b>1</b>, and the slot machine <b>41</b>, having the constitution described above, are explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram showing the procedure of a gaming information authenticating and loading process in the gaming information authenticating and loading device <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a chart showing the procedure of an authenticating and loading process for gaming information performed by the gaming board <b>10</b> and the motherboard <b>20</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, &#x201c;step&#x201d; is abbreviated to &#x201c;S&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the gaming information authenticating and loading device <b>1</b> and the slot machine <b>41</b>, during the authenticating and loading processing for gaming information, firstly, the power supply switch in the power source unit <b>39</b> is switched on (the power source is switched on), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and the motherboard <b>20</b> and the gaming board <b>10</b> are started up (Step <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>, Step <b>2</b>-<b>1</b>). In a substantially simultaneous fashion with the switching on of the power supply switch, the memory card <b>30</b> is inserted into the card slot <b>12</b> in the gaming board <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When the motherboard <b>20</b> and the gaming board <b>10</b> are started up, their independent processes are carried out respectively, in parallel fashion. More specifically, in the gaming board <b>10</b>, the CPU <b>17</b> reads out the authentication program <b>11</b><i>a </i>stored in the boot ROM <b>11</b>, and in accordance with the authentication program <b>11</b><i>a </i>thus read out, the CPU <b>17</b> operates as the processor of the present invention, and performs authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.) with respect to the gaming information stored on the memory card <b>30</b> (in other words, the CPU <b>17</b> authenticates the game program <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the game system program <b>30</b><i>b </i>with the authentication program <b>11</b><i>a</i>), before the gaming information is loaded into the motherboard <b>20</b> (Step <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although not shown in the drawings, if an abnormality occurs during the authentication process for a reason of some kind, for instance, if the game system program <b>30</b><i>b </i>has been manipulated, and the CPU <b>17</b> has not normally completed the authentication process, then the CPU <b>17</b> halts the authentication process, and sends an error signal to the main CPU <b>21</b>, via the PCI bus <b>31</b>. The main CPU <b>21</b> then reports the occurrence of an abnormality, for instance, by issuing an error display on the upper-side image display panel <b>43</b>. In this case, the loading processes r<b>2</b>, r<b>3</b> described below are not carried out. In other words, the game program <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the game system program <b>30</b><i>b </i>are introduced into the motherboard <b>20</b> only when they have been authenticated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">On the other hand, in the motherboard <b>20</b>, the main CPU <b>21</b> executes the BIOS <b>22</b><i>a </i>and develops the compressed data included in the BIOS <b>22</b><i>a </i>into the RAM <b>23</b> (Step <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>). When the main CPU <b>21</b> advances to Step <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>, the main CPU <b>21</b> executes the BIOS <b>22</b><i>a </i>developed into the RAM <b>23</b> and then carries out diagnosis and initialization of the various peripheral devices. In this case, the main CPU <b>21</b> carries out a check to see what devices are connected to the IDE bus <b>32</b>, and then accesses the memory card <b>30</b> inserted into the card slot <b>12</b>, via the IDE bus <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As the next step, <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>, the main CPU <b>21</b> operates as the reading unit of the present invention, and reads out the gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>from the memory card <b>30</b>. Further, the main CPU <b>21</b> operates as the writing unit of the present invention, and performs an loading process r<b>2</b> for the game system program <b>30</b><i>b </i>authenticated by CPU <b>17</b>, and an loading process r<b>3</b> for the game program <b>30</b><i>a </i>authenticated by CPU <b>17</b>, and writing and storing the game program <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the game system program <b>30</b><i>b </i>in the RAM <b>23</b>. In the loading process r<b>2</b> and the loading process r<b>3</b>, in accordance with the functions of the standard BIOS in the BIOS <b>22</b><i>a</i>, the main CPU <b>21</b> takes the check sum acquired by an ADDSUM method (standard check function), and the main CPU <b>21</b> stores the game program <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the game system program <b>30</b><i>b </i>in the RAM <b>23</b>, while carrying out a confirmation process f<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to see whether or not storage has been completed without any errors.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In this way, the authenticating and loading processing is completed by the processing in steps <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> performed by the CPU <b>17</b>, and steps <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> performed by the main CPU <b>21</b>, and the gaming information authenticating and loading device <b>1</b> accomplishes the process.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Continuously, in the slot machine <b>41</b>, the main CPU <b>21</b> advances to Step <b>1</b>-<b>5</b>, where the main CPU <b>21</b> operates as the operation control unit, and implements control in such a manner that the respective gaming operation execution devices carry out gaming operations, in accordance with the game program <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the game system program <b>30</b><i>b </i>stored in the RAM <b>23</b>. Thereby, the plurality of constituent elements for gaming operation execution devices which constitute a group of gaming operation execution devices perform respective gaming operations. For example, the image control circuit <b>71</b> displays gaming information used in playing a game, such as simulated reels, on the lower-side image display panel <b>44</b>, and furthermore, the lamp drive circuit <b>59</b> lights up the lamp <b>60</b>, or the like, principally in order to create a game effect, in accordance with the progress of the game. Moreover, the hopper drive circuit <b>63</b> operates the hopper <b>64</b> in accordance with the game winnings result, and thus pays out coins. The player is able to play a slot game by observing the simulated reels.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this way, in a slot machine <b>41</b>, the gaming operation execution devices carry out gaming operations in accordance with the game program <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the game system program <b>30</b><i>b </i>supplied by means of the memory card <b>30</b> and stored in the RAM <b>23</b> after the programs <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>are authenticated. Thereby, the player is able to play a slot game.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described above, in the gaming information authenticating and loading device <b>1</b> and the slot machine <b>41</b>, since the gaming board <b>10</b> is connected to a generic motherboard <b>20</b>, then by inserting the memory card <b>30</b> storing gaming information into the card slot <b>12</b> of the gaming board <b>10</b>, the stored gaming information can be read out and stored in the RAM <b>23</b> of the motherboard <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, since the authentication program <b>11</b><i>a </i>which states a procedure for authenticating the gaming information is stored in the boot ROM <b>11</b> of the gaming board <b>10</b>, then before loading the gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>into the motherboard <b>20</b>, an authentication process is performed in accordance with the authentication program <b>11</b><i>a</i>, and it is checked and verified that the gaming information has not been manipulated. Consequently, in the authenticating and loading device <b>1</b> and the slot machine <b>41</b>, even if gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>is supplied from a source that is external to the slot machine <b>41</b>, it is certain that the gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>thus loaded is legitimate gaming information which has not been manipulated. Therefore, illegal actions relating to the actual gaming information are reliably prevented. Furthermore, the authentication program <b>11</b><i>a </i>used to authenticate the gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>is stored in the boot ROM <b>11</b>, in a non-rewritable fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Moreover, in the gaming information authenticating and loading device <b>1</b> and the slot machine <b>41</b>, since the motherboard <b>20</b> is constituted by a commercially available generic motherboard, the motherboard <b>20</b> has highly generic characteristics and, consequently, it is possible to reduce manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the foregoing description, a game program <b>30</b><i>a </i>and a game system program <b>30</b><i>b </i>for a slot game are loaded, but instead of this, it is also possible to load a separate game program <b>30</b><i>a </i>and a game system program <b>30</b><i>b </i>for another game. In this case, the slot machine <b>41</b> becomes a game machine (for instance, a card game machine) which implements another game (for example, a card game which displays card images of trump cards).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Instead of the procedure of the gaming information authenticating and loading process performed by the gaming board <b>10</b> and the motherboard <b>20</b> described above, it is also possible to adopt a procedure such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Specifically, the procedure of the gaming information authenticating and loading process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is different from the aforementioned procedure in that reset control of the main CPU <b>21</b> is carried out, when the CPU <b>17</b> performs authentication of the gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">More specifically, similarly to the procedure of the authenticating and loading process for gaming information described above, the power supply switch on the power source unit <b>39</b> is switched on (the power supply is switched on), and the motherboard <b>20</b> and the gaming board <b>10</b> are started up (Step <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>, Step <b>2</b>-<b>1</b>). Thereby, in the gaming board <b>10</b>, the CPU <b>17</b> advances to Step <b>2</b>-<b>10</b>, and a reset signal output process P<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is performed by the main CPU <b>21</b>, via the PCI bus <b>31</b>. By carrying out the reset control output process PI, the main CPU <b>21</b> is held in a reset state and the readout process of the gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>is not executed, until there is an output process P<b>2</b> of the reset release signal (authentication completion signal) at the subsequent step, Step <b>2</b>-<b>11</b>. Thereupon, the CPU <b>17</b> advances to Step <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>, performs readout of the authentication program <b>11</b><i>a </i>stored in the boot ROM <b>11</b>, and carries out the authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> in accordance with the authentication program <b>11</b><i>a </i>thus read out. When the authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> have been completed normally, the procedure advances to Step <b>2</b>-<b>11</b>, and the CPU <b>17</b> performs a reset release signal output process P<b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), thereby releasing the reset state of the main CPU <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As described above, by adopting reset control using a reset signal and a reset release signal, the readout of the gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>by the main CPU <b>21</b> in the motherboard <b>20</b> is suspended, until the authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> by the CPU <b>17</b> on the gaming board <b>10</b> have been completed, and therefore, it is possible reliably to avoid a situation where the main CPU <b>21</b> reads out the gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>before the authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> have been completed by the CPU <b>17</b>. Furthermore, by adopting reset control of this kind, it is possible to avoid a situation in which tie CPU <b>17</b> and the main CPU <b>21</b> access the PCI bus <b>31</b> at the same timing, thus causing a conflict of signals, without using separate means, such as a bus switching device.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">However, in general, the execution time of the BIOS <b>22</b><i>a </i>by the main CPU <b>21</b> (the sequence of processing from Step <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> to Step <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>) is significantly longer than the processing time of the authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> (Step <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>) by the CPU <b>17</b>. Therefore, it is desirable that the CPU <b>17</b> and the main CPU <b>21</b> should be carried out in parallel without adopting reset control, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, from the viewpoint of being able to shorten the time period until the gaming information is executed at Step <b>1</b>-<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In an embodiment where the CPU <b>17</b> and the main CPU <b>21</b> carry out processing in parallel, it is also possible to avoid situations where the main CPU <b>21</b> reads out the gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>before the authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> by the CPU <b>17</b> have been completed, by a method other than reset control. Specifically, a prescribed storage region (for example, a register or memory) for confirming the completion of the authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> is provided previously in either the gaming board <b>10</b> or the motherboard <b>20</b>. When the authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> have been completed, the CPU <b>17</b> rewrites the contents of the prescribed storage region, and by means of the main CPU <b>21</b> monitoring this rewriting process, the main CPU <b>21</b> is able to determine the completion of the authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> by the CPU <b>17</b>. After determining that the authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> have completed, the main CPU <b>21</b> performs readout of the gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b</i>, thereby preventing situations in which the main CPU <b>21</b> reads out the gaming information <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>before the authentication processes f<b>6</b>, f<b>7</b> by the CPU <b>17</b> have completed. At the same time, it is also possible to avoid situations in which the CPU <b>17</b> and the main CPU <b>21</b> access the PCI bus <b>31</b> simultaneously, thus producing signal conflicts, without having to use separate means, such as a bus switching device.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the aforementioned embodiments, a slot machine <b>41</b> which performs a slot game is described as an example of a gaming machine, but the present invention may also be applied to gaming machines which implement other types of games. For example, the present invention may also be applied to a card game machine which implements a card game using card images showing trump cards, a Mahjong game machine which implements a Mahjong game, or a Pachinko game machine which uses game balls. Furthermore, in the case of a slot machine, the machine is not limited to being a video slot machine such as the slot machine <b>41</b>, but may also be a rotating cylinder type of slot machine which has mechanical reels. In this case, the mechanical reels constitute the gaming operation execution device of the present invention. In the embodiments described above, the gaming information is constituted by two types of programs, namely, a game program and a game system program, but the gaming information may also be modified appropriately to gaming information constituted by one type of program, or three or more types of program.</p>
