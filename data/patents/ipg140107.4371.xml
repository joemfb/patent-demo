<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-0083266, filed on Aug. 26, 2008 in the KIPO (Korean Intellectual Property Office), the disclosure of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. Further, this application is the National Phase application of International Application No. PCT/KR2009/003188, filed Jun. 15, 2009, which designates the United States and was published in English. Each of these applications is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety into the present application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a system for measuring a transmission bandwidth for media streaming and a method thereof, and more particularly, to a system for measuring a transmission bandwidth for media streaming and a method thereof that are capable of calculating the transmission bandwidth by using a transmission packet to be transmitted to a receiver without transmitting a proving packet to the receiver and streaming media data to a receiver by using the transmission bandwidth in a service for streaming the media data such as a moving picture in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, Internet transmits and receives data in the unit of a packet. At this time, a transmission bandwidth between two terminals that communicate with each other is not always ensured but if a path is selected, data is transmitted and received while dynamically occupying the bandwidth in the unit of each packet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Due to such a network characteristic, a call quality is not ensured at predetermined level and the packet is lost or delayed depending on Internet conditions, thus, the call quality may be deteriorated. As Internet supply is spread, the performance or capacity of a network system itself is improved and an environment where Internet is connectable is also increased.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in spite of a situation where a demand for the capacity of a network bandwidth is rapidly increased with an increase in the number of Internet users and the number of real-time media communication applications, a bandwidth enough to deal with the real-time communication application is not substantially easy to ensure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further Internet cannot continuously occupy a bandwidth required during call connection due to characteristics of the network. Therefore, a bandwidth usable during call or depending on a call time is rapidly changed. A bandwidth approximately 5 to 10 times larger than a voice call is required to transmit and receive video data comparatively more than voice data in a good quality and if this condition is not satisfied, a video call quality may remarkably be deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A function to control the bandwidth is very important in a video call and in general, a video terminal previously determines a bandwidth to be used before the call and can transmit and receive a video in accordance with the bandwidth. However, it is difficult to deal with a bandwidth which dynamically varies during the call by the above scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram for describing a known method for measuring a transmission bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a server transmits two or more proving packets to a receiver (S<b>110</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">At this time, the server transmits a proving packet including information on a transmission time to the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The receiver receives the proving packet including the transmission time information and acquires a reception interval between the two received packets and thereafter, calculates the transmission bandwidth as shown in Equation 1 on the basis of the reception interval (S<b>120</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, the receiver transmits the calculated transmission bandwidth to the server (S<b>130</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, the server streams media by using the transmission bandwidth received from the receiver (S<b>140</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the known transmission bandwidth measuring method requires a process in which the proving packet is transmitted from the server to the receiver separately from the transmission data for verification.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, since the proving packet is transmitted separately from the transmission data, the transmission bandwidth is additionally occupied by the proving packet.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, an object of the present invention is to provide a system for measuring a transmission bandwidth for media streaming and a method thereof that are capable of calculating the transmission bandwidth by using a transmission packet to be transmitted to a receiver without transmitting a proving packet to the receiver and streaming media data to a receiver by using the transmission bandwidth in a service for streaming the media data such as a moving picture in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, according to an embodiment of the present invention, a system for measuring a transmission bandwidth includes: a server that transmits transmission data to a receiver in a packet pair and receives a time stamp of a received time when the transmission data is received from the receiver, calculates the transmission bandwidth on the basis of the time stamp of the received time, and streams media to the receiver by using the transmission bandwidth; and a receiver that receives the transmission data, records the time stamp of the received time for each packet of the received transmission data, transmits the time stamp of the received time recorded at a predetermined cycle and thereafter, receives media from the server through streaming.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, the server stores the packet size and a time stamp of a transmitted time of the transmission data, which correspond to each packet.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, the server calculates the transmission bandwidth by dividing the sizes of two continuously sent i-th packets by a reception interval between two packets received in the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Moreover, the server acquires a final transmission bandwidth by taking a median for a set of transmission bandwidth values measured between the packet pairs in each cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Meanwhile, in order to achieve the above-mentioned object, according to another embodiment of the present invention, a server includes: a communicator for communicating with a receiver; a data transmitter that transmits transmission data to the receiver in a packet pair; a bandwidth calculator that calculates the transmission bandwidth on the basis of a time stamp of a received time received from the receiver; and a controller that controls to transmit the transmission data through the data transmitter in a packet pair, calculate the transmission bandwidth through the bandwidth calculator on the basis of the time stamp of the received time received from the receiver, and stream media to the receiver by using the calculated transmission bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, the server further includes a storage that stores the packet size and a time stamp of a transmitted time of the transmission data, which correspond to each packet.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the bandwidth calculator calculates the transmission bandwidth by dividing the sizes L<sub>i </sub>of two continuously sent i-th packets by a reception interval tr<sub>i+1</sub>&#x2212;tr<sub>i </sub>between two packets received in the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, the bandwidth calculator acquires a final transmission bandwidth by taking a median for a set of transmission bandwidth values measured between packet pairs in each cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Meanwhile, in order to achieve the above-mentioned object, according to yet another embodiment of the present invention, a receiver includes: a received time storage that records and stores a time stamp of a received time for each packet of transmission data received from the server; and a controller that controls to transmit the time stamp of the received time for each packet of the transmission data to the server at a predetermined cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, the controller transmits the time stamp of the received time to the server at the predetermined cycle and thereafter, receives media transmitted from the server by using the transmission bandwidth acquired based on the time stamp of the received time through streaming.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Meanwhile, in order to achieve the above-mentioned object, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, a method for measuring a transmission bandwidth of a system including a server and a receiver includes: (a) allowing the server to transmit transmission data to the receiver in a packet pair; (b) allowing the receiver to receive the transmission data and transmit a time stamp of a received time of the received transmission data to the server; (c) allowing the server to receive the time stamp of the received time and calculate the transmission bandwidth on the basis of the time stamp of the received time; and (d) allowing the server to stream media to the receiver by using the transmission bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, at step (b), the receiver records the time stamp of the received time for each packet of the transmission data and transmits the time stamp of the received time recorded at a predetermined cycle to the server.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, at step (c), the server calculates the transmission bandwidth by dividing the sizes L<sub>i </sub>of two continuously sent i-th packets by a reception interval tr<sub>i+1</sub>&#x2212;tr<sub>i </sub>between two packets received in the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Moreover, at step (c), a final transmission bandwidth is acquired by taking a median for a set of transmission bandwidth values measured between the packet pairs in each cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Meanwhile, in order to achieve the above-mentioned object, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, a method for measuring a transmission bandwidth of a server streaming media to a receiver by using the transmission bandwidth includes: (a) transmitting transmission data to the receiver in a packet pair; (b) receiving a time stamp of a received time of the transmission data from the receiver; and (c) calculating the transmission bandwidth on the basis of the time stamp of the received time.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, at step (b), the time stamp of the received time of the transmission data is received from the receiver at a predetermined cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, at step (c), the transmission bandwidth is calculated by dividing the sizes L<sub>i </sub>of two continuously sent i-th packets by a reception interval tr<sub>i+1</sub>&#x2212;tr<sub>i </sub>between two packets received in the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Moreover, at step (c), a final transmission bandwidth is acquired by taking a median for a set of transmission bandwidth values measured between the packet pairs in each cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, the method may further include (d) streaming media to the receiver by using the calculated transmission bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to an embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to actually measure a transmission bandwidth by using transmission data without using a proving packet.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, it is possible to prevent the loss of the bandwidth by an additional proving packet and efficiently stream media such as a moving picture, etc. in accordance with the bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, as the media is streamed in accordance with the transmission bandwidth, it is possible to provide a service satisfying a quality of service (QoS).</p>
