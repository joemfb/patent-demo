<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/683,371 filed on Jan. 6, 2010, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/399,487, filed Mar. 6, 2009, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,875,176 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are widely used for wastewater treatment because of their improved performance resulting in better water quality and minimal space requirements compared to conventional treatment processes. MBRs include immersed porous membranes to extract clean water (i.e., permeate water) from waste that is mixed with a biomass including active aerobic organisms. This mixture of waste and biomass is generally called a mixed liquor. The immersed membranes generally include tubular hollow fiber membranes or plate-type filtration membranes. Permeate water is removed from the mixed liquor by passing through the pores of the membranes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Membrane fouling remains a significant challenge for conventional MBRs. This is due to the accumulation of soluble and particulate materials from the mixed liquor onto and into the porous membranes. Fouling of the porous membranes leads to increased energy costs, poor operating conditions, poor efficiency, and frequent membrane replacement. Conventional treatments for cleaning the porous membranes include aeration, intermittent permeation, permeate backwashing, air backwashing, and chemical cleaning. Aeration generally involves streams of large, coarse air bubbles being provided at the base of the membranes in order to scour the fibers as they float upward toward the top of the membranes. Aeration (both coarse and fine bubble aeration) is also used to circulate the mixed liquor to help re-suspend solids. Due to the air bubbles only being released at the base of the membranes, dead zones deprived of sufficient cleaning or circulation are often present in conventional MBRs. The other conventional treatments for cleaning the porous membranes require periodically stopping filtration, which increases energy costs and decreases permeate flow.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some conventional MBRs use moveable fibers to help mitigate the fouling problem. The moveable fibers are fixed only at one end so that they can sway and rub against each other to help reduce fouling. However, breakage is a problem with these moveable fibers due to higher mechanical stress at their fixed ends, as well as abrasion due to rubbing against each other. As a result, these moveable fibers must be reinforced, which increases membrane costs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some embodiments of the invention provide a membrane module including a plurality of fibers that are helically wound in layers. The plurality of fibers can be capable of filtering fluids. The plurality of fibers can create a mono helix through which fluids flow radially with respect to a longitudinal axis of the mono helix or parallel to the longitudinal axis of the mono helix.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some embodiments of the invention provide a membrane module including a first plurality of fibers and a second plurality of fibers. The first plurality of fibers can be capable of filtering fluids. The second plurality of fibers can be helically wound along at least a portion of a length of the first plurality of fibers in order to create a dual helix. The second plurality of fibers can have different properties than the first plurality of fibers in order to achieve different filtering functionalities.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Some embodiments of the invention provide a membrane module including a plurality of fibers that are helically wound in layers to create a mono helix. Other embodiments of the invention provide a membrane module including a first plurality of fibers and a second plurality of fibers that are helically wound to create a dual helix. The mono and dual helix membrane modules are capable of filtering fluids for purposes of various fluid filtration applications. For example, embodiments of the invention can be used in several general categories of applications, including drinking water purification, wastewater treatment, and industrial process water treatment. More specifically, embodiments of the invention can be used in various fluid treatment systems, including but not limited to, the following: MBR wastewater treatment systems, ultrafiltration chemical reactor systems, ultrafiltration membrane systems, dairy dewatering systems, protein fractionation systems, oil and water separation systems, gas addition systems, etc. Although embodiments of the invention can be used in each of these types of fluid filtration systems, the invention is generally described herein as being used in a MBR wastewater treatment process.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates non-MBR and MBR wastewater treatment processes <b>10</b>. The water treatment processes <b>10</b> can be used in municipal, industrial, commercial, or residential wastewater treatment for various applications including, but not limited to, food and beverage production, chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, irrigation, landfill leachate, metal finishing and steel production, and pulp and paper processing. The first step includes collecting the water to be treated or the raw sewage (step <b>12</b>). The raw sewage is then filtered through a screen to remove grit and larger objects (step <b>14</b>). The process steps in box <b>16</b> (steps <b>18</b>-<b>38</b>) represent steps during a non-MBR water treatment process. In the non-MBR process, the filtrate from the screening grit removal (step <b>14</b>) goes through a primary clarifier to remove solids (step <b>18</b>), and then into an aeration basin where the activated sludge removes or converts soluble contaminants (step <b>20</b>). The activated sludge then goes through a secondary clarifier (step <b>22</b>), a live softening process (step <b>24</b>), another clarification process (step <b>26</b>), air stripping (step <b>28</b>), recarbonation (step <b>30</b>), sand filtration (step <b>32</b>), and gas absorption (step <b>34</b>). Sludge removed during the primary and secondary clarifier (steps <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>) is drained into a sludge digester to be broken down (step <b>36</b>). Sludge from the sludge digester (step <b>36</b>) and sludge removed during the other clarification process (step <b>26</b>) is sent to the sludge dewatering disposal (step <b>38</b>). The resulting filtrate from the gas absorption step (step <b>34</b>) is the final treated water, ready to be discharged (step <b>40</b>). Sludge can also be recirculated from the clarification process (step <b>26</b>) to the secondary clarifier (step <b>22</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For a MBR water treatment process, the steps in box <b>16</b> (steps <b>18</b>-<b>38</b>) can be replaced by the steps in box <b>42</b> (steps <b>44</b>-<b>48</b>). The filtrate from the screening grit removal (step <b>14</b>) is processed in a membrane bioreactor <b>50</b> (step <b>44</b>) to separate water from sludge and remove soluble substances. Dewatered sludge (from step <b>44</b>) can be removed by a sludge dewatering disposal (step <b>46</b>). Permeate water from the membrane bioreactor <b>50</b> (from step <b>44</b>) can be further filtered by ultrafiltration (step <b>48</b>). Step <b>48</b> can be replaced by other filtration processes, such as microfiltration or nanofiltration, depending on the application. The resulting filtrate or permeate water from ultrafiltration (step <b>48</b>) is the final treated water, ready to be discharged (step <b>40</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the use of the membrane bioreactor <b>50</b> can significantly simplify the water treatment process <b>10</b>. In some embodiments of the invention, the components of the membrane bioreactor <b>50</b> (step <b>44</b>) and the components of the ultrafiltration process (step <b>48</b>) can be positioned in the same or separate tanks, chambers, or pressurized vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> according to one embodiment of the invention for use in the membrane bioreactor <b>50</b>, for example. The mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> can include a core <b>54</b> and fibers <b>56</b> helically wound around the core <b>54</b>. Although the core <b>54</b> is shown as a cylinder with a circular cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, some embodiments can include a core having other cross-sections, such as square, elliptical, triangular, etc. The core <b>54</b> can be a solid cylinder or a porous, hollow cylinder. In some embodiments, the inside of the core <b>54</b> can include a packed bed of filtration media. In some embodiments, the core <b>54</b> can be perforated at one or more portions along its length. An ultraviolet light source inside or outside the core <b>54</b> can be included, in some embodiments, for sterilization purposes. In other embodiments, the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> does not include a core <b>54</b>, but rather the fibers <b>56</b> are helically wound into a similar cylindrical shape, with a supporting structure at either end.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the fibers <b>56</b> can be permeable, hollow ultrafiltration membranes and can be coupled or potted (along with the core <b>54</b> or the supporting structures) at one or both ends to a header or tubesheet <b>58</b>. The header <b>58</b> can be coupled to a permeate manifold in order to collect and direct permeate water. In other embodiments, the fibers <b>56</b> can be microfiltration or nanofiltration fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The fibers <b>56</b> can be wound helically around the core <b>54</b> at a consistent or variable wind angle. The wind angle, defined with respect to the core <b>54</b> in a horizontal position, can be the angle at which the fiber <b>56</b> is laid across the core <b>54</b> with respect to the vertical axis. For example, fibers <b>56</b> wound at a 90-degree wind angle would be parallel to the horizontally-positioned core <b>54</b>. The fibers <b>56</b> can be wound around the core <b>54</b> in layers, where a layer is defined as a fiber <b>56</b> wound from one end to the other end and the return of the fiber <b>56</b> to the first end constitutes another separate layer. In some embodiments, the fibers <b>56</b> can be wound as disclosed in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0072754 in the names of Burban et al., the entire contents of which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The layers of fibers <b>56</b> can be asymmetrically wound about the core <b>54</b> to create a mono helix <b>60</b>. The density of the layers can change with respect to either a radial distance from a center of the core <b>54</b> or an axial distance from an end of the core <b>54</b>. For example, the mono helix <b>60</b> can be more dense in an interior portion (i.e., closer to the center of the core <b>54</b>) and become less dense in an exterior portion (i.e., further from the center of the core <b>54</b>). In addition, the fibers <b>56</b> can vary in texture, cross-sectional shapes, surface structure, and/or dimensions (such as lumen size), in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The fibers <b>56</b> can be constructed of a polymeric, hydrophilic material with a lumen <b>62</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For example, the fibers <b>56</b> can be constructed of polysulfone, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene, etc. The pressure inside of the lumens <b>62</b> can be lower than the pressure outside the fibers <b>56</b>, creating a vacuum in the lumens <b>62</b>. For example, a vacuum can be applied to the lumen <b>62</b> or the environment outside the fibers <b>56</b> and can be held at a pressure above atmospheric pressure. Due to the pressure difference, permeate water <b>64</b> from a surrounding mixed liquor <b>66</b> can be drawn through pores of the fibers <b>56</b> into the lumen <b>62</b> for an outside-in filtration configuration. In other embodiments, the fibers <b>56</b> can be used in an inside-out filtration configuration, where the mixed liquor <b>66</b> is circulated through the lumen <b>62</b> at a higher pressure and permeate water <b>64</b> is drawn outside of the fibers <b>56</b> through the pores to a lower-pressure environment. The pores of the fibers <b>56</b> can be consistent or variable in size and can be between about 0.01 microns and about 0.2 microns in diameter. The pores can also vary outside this range, depending on the application. In addition, the mono helix <b>60</b> can have consistent or varying patterned porosities along its axial length.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> can include one or more mono helixes <b>60</b> coupled together to the header <b>58</b> that is submersed in a membrane bioreactor tank. In other embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> can include one or more mono helixes <b>60</b> in a cylindrical housing or cartridge <b>68</b> with end caps <b>70</b>. The mono helix or helixes <b>60</b> can be fixed at both ends to headers <b>58</b> so that the fibers <b>56</b> are substantially stationary or can be fixed at only one end to a single header <b>58</b> so that the fibers <b>56</b> are moveable (i.e., can sway).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the stationary configuration, the use of the core <b>54</b> and the design of the mono helix <b>60</b> supports the fibers <b>56</b> and prevents them from breaking. Also, in the stationary configuration, the reinforcement of the core <b>54</b> and the mono helix <b>60</b> can allow reduced fiber maintenance, as well as the use of finer and cheaper fibers <b>56</b>, reducing the cost of the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b>. In the dynamic configuration, the swaying motion can help reduce fouling on the fibers <b>56</b>. In addition, the mechanical strength of the mono helix <b>60</b> reinforces the fibers <b>56</b> and prevents fiber breakage due to increased mechanical stresses from the swaying.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a schematic illustration of a portion of the MBR <b>50</b> with the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b>. Pressurized feed water <b>72</b> is introduced outside the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> into the mixed liquor <b>66</b>. The mixed liquor <b>66</b> includes bacteria and protozoa to help breakdown large organic waste <b>74</b> and develop biological floc to maintain total suspended solids (TSS) in the mixed liquor <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the pressurized feed water <b>72</b> is introduced outside the fiber <b>56</b> into the mixed liquor <b>66</b> and permeate water <b>64</b> is drawn into the lumens <b>62</b> of the fibers <b>56</b>. The permeate water <b>64</b> can then be carried out one or both ends of the fibers <b>56</b>. In other embodiments, pressurized air can be used at one end of the fibers <b>56</b> to force permeate water <b>64</b> out of each fiber <b>56</b>. In some embodiments, the core <b>54</b> is porous and can collect permeate water <b>64</b> from the fibers <b>56</b>. The feed water <b>72</b> can be introduced near the bottom of the MBR <b>50</b>. However, the feed water <b>72</b> can alternatively or additionally be introduced near the top and/or sides of the MBR <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Outside the fibers <b>56</b>, air, oxygen, or other inert gases can be used to sparge the mixed liquor <b>66</b> using an aerator <b>76</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B, and <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B. Dotted arrows <b>78</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>A, and <b>7</b>A indicate a direction of flow of small or fine bubbles <b>80</b> and large or coarse bubbles <b>82</b>. The aerator <b>76</b> can introduce the fine bubbles <b>80</b> into the mixed liquor <b>66</b> for aeration and circulation. The aerator <b>76</b> or a separate aerator can introduce the coarse bubbles <b>82</b> for scouring to help reduce fouling on the fibers <b>56</b>. The MBR <b>50</b> can also include an air sparge or back flush cycle to push high pressure air or permeate water <b>64</b> back through the fibers <b>56</b> to help reduce fouling on the fibers <b>56</b>. The design of the helically-wound fibers <b>56</b>, in some embodiments, can help capture solids and also can help back flush efficiency. Rather than, or in addition to the aerator <b>76</b>, the core <b>54</b> can include an aerator to aerate and/or scour the mono helix <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b> according to another embodiment of the invention. The dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b> can include a first set of fibers <b>56</b> and a second set of fibers <b>86</b> helically wound together around a core <b>54</b> and secured to headers <b>58</b>. The layers of fibers <b>56</b> and <b>86</b> can be asymmetrically or symmetrically wound around the core <b>54</b> to create a dual helix <b>88</b>. The second set of fibers <b>86</b> can be hydrophobic or hydrophillic, microporous fibers with pores of about 0.1 microns in diameter, in some embodiments. The second set of fibers <b>86</b> can be used to deliver gas, air, or oxygen to scour the dual helix <b>88</b> and/or aerate the mixed liquor <b>66</b> in a localized manner. For example, aeration can be provided by the second set of fibers <b>86</b> in very close proximity to the first set of fibers <b>56</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, gas <b>90</b> can be provided to the interior or lumen of the second set of fibers <b>86</b> at a pressure above local hydrostatic pressure. The gas <b>90</b> will then be delivered out from the pores around the dual helix <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The core <b>54</b> and the sets of fibers <b>56</b>, <b>86</b> can be constructed and can be operated similar to the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> described above. For example, in some embodiments, the MBR <b>50</b> can include one or more dual-helix fiber membranes <b>86</b> coupled together to a permeate water manifold and submersed in a membrane bioreactor tank. In other embodiments, the MBR <b>50</b> can include a single dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b> in a cylindrical housing, or cartridge <b>68</b>, with end caps <b>70</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The dual helix or helixes <b>88</b> can be fixed at both ends to headers <b>58</b> so that the sets of fibers <b>56</b>, <b>86</b> are substantially stationary or can be fixed at only one end to a single manifold <b>58</b> so that the sets of fibers <b>56</b>, <b>86</b> are moveable (i.e., can sway). In some embodiments, the layers of the dual helix <b>88</b> can be regularly intertwined as follows: fibers <b>56</b>, fibers <b>86</b>, fibers <b>56</b>, fibers <b>86</b>, etc., where different sizes of the fibers <b>56</b>, <b>86</b> can help define spacing between layers. In other embodiments, the layering of the sets of fibers <b>56</b>, <b>86</b> in the dual helix <b>88</b> can be relatively random.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the second set of fibers <b>86</b> can allow the gas <b>90</b> to be delivered locally along the length of the dual helix <b>88</b>. The dual helix <b>88</b> can increase the effectiveness of scouring, because conventional scouring techniques generally only release air from an aerator at one end of the MBR <b>50</b>. Local aeration with the second set of fibers <b>86</b> can help prevent the development of dead zones in the MBR <b>50</b>. In addition, the dual helix <b>88</b> can also decrease energy usage, as the pressure only needs to be great enough to diffuse gas out into a small, localized area, rather than up the entire length of the MBR <b>50</b>. Also, back flushing periods are needed less frequently.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The dual helix <b>88</b> can have consistent or varying distribution characteristics in both sets of fibers <b>56</b>, <b>86</b>, such as patterned porosities, densities, texture, surface structure, cross-sectional shapes, and/or dimensions (such as lumen size). The varying patterned porosities and densities can allow controllable local environments and improve bio-reactivity by permitting combined aerobic and anaerobic conditions or various bubble sizes in the second set of fibers <b>86</b> in the MBR <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The structured designs of the mono helix <b>60</b> and the dual helix <b>88</b> can offer controlled spacing between sets of fibers <b>56</b> and/or <b>86</b>. The varying density from interior to exterior portions can allow better fluid-to-fiber contact and more surface area, in comparison to conventional random-packing fiber designs.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, pressurized feed water <b>72</b> can be introduced outside the sets of fibers <b>56</b> and <b>86</b> into the mixed liquor <b>66</b> and permeate water <b>64</b> can be drawn through the lumen <b>62</b> of the first set of fibers <b>56</b>. In some embodiments, vacuum can be applied to the lumen <b>62</b> to create a pressure driving force to drive the permeate water <b>64</b> through the lumen <b>62</b>. In some embodiments, a combination of a pressurized feed of fluid to be treated and a vacuum applied to the lumen <b>62</b> can create a pressure driving force to drive the permeate water <b>64</b> through the lumen <b>62</b>. The permeate water <b>64</b> can then be carried out one or both ends of the first set of fibers <b>56</b>. In some embodiments, the core <b>54</b> is porous and can collect permeate water <b>64</b> from the first set of fibers <b>56</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the second set of fibers <b>86</b> can release air to scour the dual helix <b>88</b> with coarse bubbles <b>82</b> and reduce fouling. In some embodiments, the localized scouring of the first set of fibers <b>56</b> can temporarily reduce or substantially stop the permeate flux through the first set of fibers <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, portions of the dual helix <b>88</b> can include bacteria-promoting chemicals and/or the dual helix <b>88</b> can include varying surface energy zones along its length to promote various bacterial growth patterns. Also, portions of the dual helix <b>88</b> can include varying fiber chemistries in order to create anaerobic and aerobic zones for particular bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, one or more types of additional filtration media (not shown) can be wrapped around the core <b>54</b> between the sets of fibers <b>56</b> and/or <b>86</b>. The additional filtration media can be another set of fibers and/or a porous sheet and can be structured to achieve aeration and/or filtration functions for specific applications. The additional filtration media can also help define spacing between the layers of the sets of fibers <b>56</b> and/or <b>86</b> and can act as a support for a biofilm.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the permeate water <b>64</b> collected from the MBR <b>50</b> can be further filtered with another filtering device, such as a reverse osmosis (RO) module (not shown). In some embodiments, the permeate water <b>64</b> that feeds the RO module can also be recycled through the lumen <b>62</b> of the first set of fibers <b>56</b>. Salts and organics from the permeate water <b>64</b> in the lumen <b>62</b> can accumulate to a steady state, and the salts can create an osmotic draw of the permeate water <b>64</b>, lowering the energy required to achieve a constant permeate flux. In addition, the organics can diffuse back into the mixed liquor <b>66</b>, improving the efficiency of biological digestion. The salts can also have a local anti-fouling effect, acting as a bactericide on the surfaces of the sets of fibers <b>56</b>, <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to some embodiments of the invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates radial flow of fluid through the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b>. In the radial flow mode, the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b> can be wound around a core <b>90</b>, positioned in the cylindrical housing or cartridge <b>68</b>, and secured with headers or tubesheets <b>92</b>. Fluid to be treated can be directed into the interior of the core <b>90</b> and can then flow radially outward through the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b>. The core <b>90</b> can be perforated or otherwise sufficiently porous to allow fluid to flow through it radially. The fluid can flow radially (as indicated by arrows <b>94</b>) with respect to a longitudinal axis <b>96</b> of the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b>, the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b>, and/or the core <b>90</b>. The fluid can then flow into a space <b>98</b> adjacent to an internal annular wall <b>100</b> of the cartridge <b>68</b> and then toward one or more outlets <b>102</b>. This radial flow of fluid can help reduce the fluid pressure drop across the membrane, while still providing enough residence time to achieve filtration. Although shown positioned inside a cartridge <b>68</b>, the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b> can be submerged in a open chamber or tank.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to some embodiments of the invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates parallel flow of fluid through the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b>. The mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b> can be wound around the core <b>90</b>, positioned in the cylindrical housing or cartridge <b>68</b>, and secured with headers or tubesheets <b>92</b>. An impervious wrap <b>104</b> can be wrapped around the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b>. The entire mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b> between the tubesheets <b>92</b> can be covered with the impervious wrap <b>104</b>, except for an open portion <b>106</b> (e.g., a portion adjacent to one of the tubesheets <b>92</b>). A seal <b>108</b> can be placed between the impervious wrap <b>104</b> and the internal annular wall <b>100</b> of the cartridge <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Fluid to be treated can be directed into the interior of the core <b>90</b> and can then flow through one or more passageways <b>110</b> to the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b>. Due to the impervious wrap <b>104</b> and/or the seal <b>108</b>, the fluid entering through the passageways <b>110</b> can flow down the length of the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b> until it reaches the open portion <b>106</b>, where it can flow toward the outlets <b>102</b>. The fluid can flow parallel (as indicated by arrows <b>112</b>) to the longitudinal axis <b>96</b> of the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b>, the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b>, and/or the core <b>90</b>. The core <b>90</b> can include a &#x201c;dead-end&#x201d; <b>114</b> to ensure that all fluid flows through the passageways <b>110</b> toward the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b>. Although shown positioned inside a cartridge <b>68</b>, the mono-helix fiber membrane <b>52</b> or the dual-helix fiber membrane <b>84</b> can be submerged in a open chamber or tank.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">During the process of fluid filtration, some or all of the fluid permeates through the membrane walls of the fibers. As a result, there is a decrease in volumetric flow of the fluid on the outside of the fibers. In a membrane module with a constant packing fraction for the fibers or a constant cross-sectional area between the fibers, this decrease in volumetric flow results in a decrease in the velocity of the fluid. Also, as fluid permeates through the membrane walls, the remaining fluid becomes more concentrated in the particles and species rejected by the membrane walls. These two phenomenon of reduced velocity and increased concentration reduce the mass transfer performance of the membrane and a reduction in performance is often observed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments of the invention, the winding parameters of the fibers in the membrane module can be altered in order to increase the packing fraction of the fibers in the direction of fluid flow (i.e., to pack the fibers more tightly). Increasing the packing fraction of the fibers results in decreasing the free space between the outside of the fibers. In other words, the cross-sectional area where fluid flows between the fibers decreases in the direction of fluid flow. In this manner, some embodiments of the invention can be used to maintain a higher fluid velocity and high mass transfer efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The increase in packing fraction and decrease in cross-sectional area between the fibers can be used in the radial flow mode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or the cross flow mode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in situations where extra flow recirculation is often used to offset the reduction in fluid velocity. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the packing fraction can be increased in the direction of the radial flow (as indicated by arrows <b>94</b>) to maintain fluid flow velocity on the outside of the fibers. In other words, the fibers can be packed more loosely adjacent to the core <b>90</b> and more tightly as the distance between the fibers and the core <b>90</b> increases. More specifically, each layer of fibers can be wound using a different packing fraction in order to compensate for the drop in fluid velocity as the fluid flows radially outward away from the core <b>90</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the packing fraction can be increased in the direction of fluid flow (as indicated by the arrows <b>112</b>). This increase in packing fraction can result in a smaller diameter at one end of the mono or dual helix. Alternatively, this increase in packing fraction can result in the mono or dual helix being more dense at one end with the same diameter along its longitudinal length.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The increase in packing fraction and decrease in cross-sectional area between the fibers can also be used in the radial flow dead-end mode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or the parallel flow dead-end mode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> where substantially all the fluid permeates through the membrane walls. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the packing fraction can be increased in the direction of the radial flow (as indicated by the arrows <b>94</b>) to maintain fluid flow velocity on the outside of the fibers. In other words, the fibers can be packed more loosely adjacent to the core <b>90</b> and more tightly as the distance between the fibers and the core <b>90</b> increases.
