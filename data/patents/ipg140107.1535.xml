<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 35 USC 371 application of PCT/EP2008/062723 filed on Sep. 24, 2008.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a pump element for installation in a pump bore of a hydraulic block, to a hydraulic block for a brake system of a motor vehicle, and to an installation method for a pump element.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Piston pumps received in a hydraulic block are used in hydraulic vehicle brake systems of motor vehicles and are often called return pumps. In traction control, they serve to lower or raise the brake pressure in the wheel brake cylinders selectively, to enable regulating the brake pressure in the wheel brake cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Known piston pumps have a pump element which must first be installed before it can be fixed in a pump bore of a hydraulic block. In known pump elements, the last installation step before installing the pump element in the pump bore of the hydraulic block is joining together a preassembled piston assembly, which has an inlet valve, and a preassembled outlet valve assembly. The two assemblies, mounted on separate assembly belts, are fixed to one another by means of a filter element, and the filter element radially outwardly surrounds one portion of the piston assembly and is affixed to a cylinder element of the outlet valve assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the known pump element and the installation method for installing the known pump element, it is disadvantageous that at least two assembly belts are needed in order to mount the two assemblies separately. The installation is moreover complicated because it is necessary to produce many pressure bonds, so that the assemblies that are separate from one another will form stable units that do not fall apart. For instance, in the case of the piston assembly, a pressure bond must be made between a high-pressure seal, affixed to the pump piston by means of a press fit, and an inlet valve cap.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object of the invention is to propose a pump element which is simple to install, preferably in a purely forward direction. Moreover, the object is to propose a hydraulic block having a correspondingly optimized pump element. The object further comprises proposing a simplified installation method for installing a pump element.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This object is attained with regard to the pump element according to the invention, with regard to the hydraulic block according to the invention, and with regard to the installation method according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention is based on the concept of no longer embodying the high-pressure seal as a separate component from the inlet valve cap but rather embodying it in one piece with the inlet valve cap, so that the high-pressure seal forms a portion, preferably oriented toward the pump piston, of the inlet valve cap. What is essential is that the inlet valve cap, preferably with its high-pressure sealing portion, is pressed, with the aid of the restoring spring for the pump piston that acts on the inlet valve cap, preferably directly on the high-pressure sealing portion, in the axial direction against a valve seat element. In contrast to the known pump elements, the valve seat element of the invention is embodied as a separate component from the pump piston and is preferably of plastic. In particular, it is an injection-molded part. In order that the pump element, after its assembly and before its introduction into the pump bore, will form a stable unit whose components are held firmly together in such a way that unintended loosening of components before or during the assembly is avoided, it is provided according to the invention that the pump piston, at least before the installation of the pump element in the pump bore, is connected by nonpositive engagement to the valve seat element. In other words, the valve seat element is affixed to the pump piston, so that a tensile load can be exerted on the pump piston without the pump piston coming (directly) loose from the valve seat element. In order, with a pump element embodied in this way, to enable installation of the components of the pump element in the axial direction without the necessity of first assembling two separate assemblies and then putting them together, it is an essential characteristic of a pump element embodied in accordance with the concept of the invention that centering elements, which make easier finding of the components relative to one another possible, are provided on the high-pressure sealing portion and/or on the valve seat element. Preferably, the valve seat element after its installation protrudes into the inlet valve cap or into the high-pressure sealing portion of the inlet valve cap in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A pump element embodied according to the concept of the invention has considerable advantages over known pump elements for hydraulic brake systems. For instance, the complexity of the installation system can be reduced, since a pump element embodied in accordance with the concept of the invention can be installed entirely in one piece using forward installation, that is, installed in the axial direction. Moreover, greater flexibility in terms of the type of pump piston portion of the pump element is obtained, especially because the valve seat element is a separate component affixed to the pump piston. Since an assembly belt can be dispensed with, the space in the entire assembly line is reduced because of the invention. Furthermore, greater scalability of the assembly line is obtained. Moreover, a pump element embodied in accordance with the concept of the invention can be handled entirely as bulk material. One essential advantage of a pump element of the invention is that intermediate assembly steps and subsidiary units are eliminated, and the assembly steps per se are simplified. Moreover, the production costs for a pump element embodied in accordance with the concept of the invention are reduced markedly in comparison to known pump elements.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An embodiment of the pump element in which the inlet valve cap, and in particular its high-pressure sealing portion, rests solely on the valve seat element is advantageous. In other words, an embodiment, particularly for attaining forward installation of the entire pump element, in which a connection by nonpositive engagement between the inlet valve cap and the valve seat element is dispensed is advantageous. Expressed in still other words, in a refinement of the invention it is provided that the inlet valve cap rests without fixation on the valve seat element, so that the connection (purely contact) of the inlet valve cap and valve seat element cannot absorb any tensile forces. In this way, a pressure bond is dispensed with; in forward installation, a pressure bond would be problematic, because the abutment for exerting a contrary force to attain a sufficiently heavy-duty pressure bond, in purely forward installation, would have to be the restoring spring for the pump piston.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An embodiment of the pump element in which the centering elements with which the valve seat element can be centered relative to the inlet valve cap include at least one chamfer is of particular advantage. Preferably, this chamfer is made on an end region, toward the inlet valve cap, of the valve seat element; the chamfer serves to facilitate finding a receiving portion in the inlet valve cap, and this portion is formed by a preferably encompassing circumferential wall portion of the inlet valve cap or of the high-pressure sealing portion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An especially preferable embodiment is one in which the inlet valve and the pump piston affixed to the valve seat of the inlet valve are retained by means of a filter element on a cylinder element, and the cylinder element receives the restoring spring for the pump piston within itself. The restoring spring is braced axially on the inlet valve cap, preferably on its high-pressure sealing portion, and thus presses the inlet valve cap against the valve seat element. The valve seat element in turn is pressed by the spring force of the restoring spring axially against a filter element, preferably against a bottom portion of the filter element, and the filter element absorbs this spring force since it is retained on the cylinder element, preferably by means of a detent connection.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For embodying the nonpositive-engagement connection between the valve seat element and the pump piston, the most various possibilities exist. An embodiment in which the pump piston is received in a receptacle of the valve seat element and a clamping bond is attained is preferred. It is especially preferable if this clamping bond between the pump piston and the valve seat element is attained via a radial force component, which results from the exertion of spring force on the valve seat element in the axial direction and the bracing of the filter element and the valve seat element relative to one another on at least one oblique contact face. The result of the exertion of axial force by the restoring spring is thus a radially inward-oriented contact pressure, with which an encompassing circumferential wall portion, preferably comprising a plurality of subsidiary portions that in particular are flexible, is pressed in the radial direction inward against the circumferential wall of the pump piston.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Independently of the variant fastening described above, in addition or alternatively a pressure bond can be attained between the pump piston and the valve seat element. For instance, the pump piston and the valve seat element can protrude axially into one another for that purpose, and the contrary force upon axial joining is made available for the pump piston by the restoring spring. In addition or alternatively, the pump piston connected by nonpositive engagement to the valve seat element in the radial direction. The contrary force upon radial pressing can be attained by means of a pair of assembly tongs that exerts pressure inward in the radial direction on the valve seat element. One possible embodiment provides for installing the pressure bond in a separate assembly unit and then forward-installing the component, now comprising the pump piston and the valve seat element, on the inlet valve cap. However, an embodiment in which the assembly of all the components of the pump element is done in forward installation, that is, in succession in the axial direction, is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Instead of a pressure bond, an adhesive bond can also be attained between the pump piston and the valve seat element. In it, the pump piston can be connected axially and/or radially to the valve seat element by means of adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention also leads to a hydraulic block for a brake system of a motor vehicle, in which a pump element as described above is received in a pump bore inside the hydraulic block and advantageously cooperates with a rotatable eccentric element. The axis of rotation of the eccentric element preferably extends at a right angle to the longitudinal center axis of the pump piston. Preferably, when the pump element is received in the pump bore, the valve seat element no longer rests on the filter element.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The invention also leads to an installation method for a pump element, preferably for a pump element as described above. According to the invention, the installation method includes the steps of axially thrusting the inlet valve cap, with the high-pressure sealing portion embodied on it, onto a restoring spring, which is received in a cylinder element that in particular is compressed by a closure cap. Next, a closing spring and after that a closing body are introduced in the axial direction into the inlet valve cap. This is followed by axially thrusting a valve seat element onto the inlet valve cap, preferably onto the high-pressure sealing portion of the inlet valve cap. An embodiment in which the pump piston is installed in the axial direction only after the valve seat element has been thrust on is especially preferred. However, an embodiment in which the pump piston together with the valve seat element already affixed to it is made to rest on the inlet valve cap in the axial direction is also attainable.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An embodiment of the installation method in which all the components of the pump element are installed in forward installation is especially preferred. This embodiment makes it possible to equip the assembly belt in tempo. This means that while one pump element is being assembled on an assembly belt, the assembly of a further pump element has already begun.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An especially preferable embodiment of the installation method is one in which, as the final assembly step of the pump element before the introduction of the pump element into a pump bore in a hydraulic block, a filter element is thrust onto the pump piston and press-fitted onto a cylinder element, in such a way that the filter element is connected to the cylinder element by nonpositive engagement, in particular via a detent connection, so that the filter element can absorb axial forces exerted on it by the valve seat element, the axial forces being the result of the exertion of spring force on the inlet valve cap by the restoring spring.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the drawings, identical components and components having the same function are identified by the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>, an optimized installation method, in which all the components of a pump element <b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) are assembled in forward installation, will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that first, an outlet valve cap <b>2</b> is placed on a tool holder, not shown. The outlet valve cap <b>2</b> is equipped in the axial direction with an outlet valve closing spring <b>3</b> and with an outlet valve closing body <b>4</b>, embodied as a ball.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that next, a cylinder element <b>5</b> is connected by nonpositive engagement to the outlet valve cap <b>2</b> by being pressed into it. Next, the cylinder element <b>5</b> is equipped in the axial direction with a restoring spring <b>6</b> for the pump piston <b>7</b> that can for instance be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A cup-shaped inlet valve cap <b>8</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>) is countersunk in portions in the axial direction into the restoring spring <b>6</b>, and the inlet valve cap <b>8</b>, on its end remote from the cylinder element <b>5</b>, has a high-pressure sealing portion <b>9</b> which in the assembled state cooperates in sealing fashion with the inside circumference of the cylinder element <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">After that, the inlet valve cap is equipped in the axial direction with a closing spring <b>10</b> and a closing body <b>11</b>, embodied as a ball, of an inlet valve <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After the equipping of the inlet valve cap <b>8</b> with the closing spring <b>10</b> and the closing body <b>11</b>, a valve seat element <b>13</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is placed in the axial direction on the inlet valve cap, whereupon the pump piston <b>7</b> is introduced in the axial direction by its end portion into the valve seat element <b>13</b> and connected to it by nonpositive engagement. In an alternative embodiment of the installation method, before the valve seat element <b>13</b> is placed on the inlet valve cap <b>8</b>, the pump piston <b>7</b> is connected in a separate assembly device to the valve seat element <b>13</b> by nonpositive engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As the final assembly step, a sleevelike filter element <b>14</b> is thrust in the axial direction onto the pump piston <b>7</b> and affixed with the aid of detent hooks <b>15</b> by positive engagement on a collar <b>16</b> of the cylinder element <b>5</b>. In the assembled state, the restoring spring <b>6</b> urges the valve seat element <b>13</b> in the axial direction against a bottom portion <b>17</b> of the filter element <b>14</b>, which is capable of absorbing this axial force since it is connected to the cylinder element <b>5</b> by positive engagement via the detent hooks <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, transverse conduits <b>18</b> in the valve seat element <b>13</b> are shown, which communicate with the bottom of the central blind bore <b>19</b> in the valve seat element <b>13</b>. Fuel flows radially inward into the hydraulic block, not shown, through the filter element <b>14</b> to the transverse conduits <b>18</b>, through them to the blind bore <b>19</b>, and through it in the axial direction to the closing body <b>11</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the face-end valve seat <b>20</b> of the inlet valve <b>12</b>, which is embodied on the valve seat element <b>13</b>, is shaped as an internally conical valve seat.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The pump element <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that is obtained after assembly is capable of being handled like bulk material. The pump element can be received in a pump bore of a hydraulic block. Inside the hydraulic block, the free face end <b>21</b> of the pump piston <b>7</b> cooperates with an eccentric element, which is driven rotatably and drives the pump piston <b>7</b> to an axial reciprocating motion; the restoring spring <b>6</b> ensures a corresponding axial reverse motion. The hydraulic block, not shown and known per se, includes besides the pump element <b>1</b> still other components, not shown, of traction control in a hydraulic vehicle brake system, such as solenoid valves, check valves, and hydraulic reservoirs that are interconnected with one another. The hydraulic block forms a pump housing for the pump element <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, in respective sectional views, a detail of an assembled pump element <b>1</b> is shown; from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, one possible nonpositive-engagement connection, embodied as a clamping bond, between the pump piston <b>7</b> and the valve seat element <b>13</b> can be seen. Alternative nonpositive-engagement connections, described in the more general portion of this specification, can be attained as an alternative or in addition.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, an arrow <b>22</b> indicates the axial force exerted by the restoring spring on the valve seat element <b>13</b>. This axial force acts counter to a retention force <b>23</b>, which results from the nonpositive-engagement connection of the filter element <b>14</b> with the cylinder element <b>5</b>. On an annular axial extension <b>24</b> (or circumferential wall portion), an oblique contact face <b>25</b> is disposed radially on the outside; it cooperates with a congruently shaped oblique contact face <b>26</b> radially on the outside of the filter element <b>14</b>. Because of the oblique bracing of the valve seat element <b>13</b> and of the filter element <b>14</b> on one another, a radial force component <b>27</b> is created, which with force urges the axial extension <b>24</b> radially inward against the pump piston <b>7</b>. Accordingly, the pump piston <b>7</b> is clamped in the radial direction (clamping bond).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>it can be seen that centering means <b>29</b> are provided, with which the valve seat element <b>13</b> can be centered relative to the inlet valve cap <b>8</b>. The centering means <b>29</b> includes an encompassing, terminal chamfer <b>30</b> on the valve seat element <b>13</b>, and the chamfer cooperates with an axially pointing lower wall portion <b>31</b> of the high-pressure sealing portion <b>9</b> of the inlet valve cap <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the axial extension <b>24</b> (or circumferential wall portion) is formed by a plurality of circumferentially spaced-apart subsidiary portions <b>28</b>, which radially on the outside have an oblique contact face <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>) that cooperates with a corresponding contact face <b>26</b> of the filter element <b>14</b>, so that the subsidiary portions <b>28</b> are adjusted spring-elastically radially inward onto the pump piston <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The foregoing relates to the preferred exemplary embodiments of the invention, it being understood that other variants and embodiments thereof are possible within the spirit and scope of the invention, the latter being defined by the appended claims.</p>
