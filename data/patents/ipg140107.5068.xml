<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Methods and systems for dynamically switching user devices to preferred wireless carriers are described. User devices may be any content rendering devices including, for example, electronic book readers, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), portable media players, tablet computers, netbooks, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, a server computer system (&#x201c;server&#x201d;) detects a condition triggering a rule that requires or recommends a switch to a specified wireless carrier. The rule may be based on one or more performance characteristics (throughput, signal strength, network load, etc.) of the specified wireless carrier and/or one or more cost characteristics (billing rate, surcharge, etc.) of the specified wireless carrier. In response to the detected condition, the server identifies one or more user devices to which the rule is applicable, and sends the message to each of these user devices, requesting or recommending a switch to the specified wireless carrier. In some embodiments, the server also sends a device profile of the specified wireless carrier to the user device. In other embodiments, the user devices store device profiles of various carriers including the device profile of the specified carrier and therefore do not need to receive the device profile from the server. In response to the message from the server, the user device reprograms its modem using the device profile of the specified wireless carrier, and establishes a network connection using the device profile of the specified wireless carrier. In another embodiment, in response to the message from the server, the user device determines whether to follow the recommendation of the server, and if this determination is positive, the user device reprograms the modem using the device profile of the specified wireless carrier, and establishes a network connection using the device profile of the specified wireless carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In alternative embodiments, a switch to a different wireless carrier is initiated by a user device itself. In particular, a user device may contain a subset of rules that specify conditions for carrier switching. These conditions may include, for example, a change in the user device location, a denial of network access via a current wireless carrier, a change in a performance characteristic, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, embodiments of the invention facilitate dynamic switching of user devices to preferred wireless carriers. Dynamic switching consumes only a small amount of time and client resources and does not require any user interaction. As a result, the cost associated with network connectivity is significantly reduced, and network access performance characteristics are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary network architecture <b>100</b> in which embodiments of the invention may operate. The network architecture <b>100</b> may include an item providing system <b>104</b> and multiple user devices <b>102</b> coupled to the item providing system <b>104</b> via a network <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The user devices <b>102</b> are variously configured with different functionality to enable consumption of one or more types of media items. The media items may be any type or format of digital content, including, for example, electronic texts (eBooks, electronic magazines, digital newspapers, etc.), digital audio (music, audible books, etc.), digital video (movies, television, short clips, etc.), images (art, photographs, etc.), and multi-media content. The user devices <b>102</b> may include any type of content rendering devices such as electronic book readers, portable digital assistants, mobile phones, laptop computers, portable media players, tablet computers, cameras, video cameras, netbooks, notebooks, desktop computers, gaming consoles, DVD players, media centers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The item providing system <b>104</b> downloads items, upgrades, and/or other information to the user devices <b>102</b> via the network <b>106</b>. The item providing system <b>104</b> also receives various requests, instructions and other data from the user devices <b>102</b> via the network <b>106</b>. The item providing system <b>104</b> may include one or more machines (one or more server computer systems, routers, gateways, etc.) that have processing and storage capabilities to provide the above functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the illustrated implementation, communication between the item providing system <b>104</b> and the user device <b>102</b> is enabled via a communication infrastructure that includes a combination of a wide area network (WAN) <b>106</b> and wireless infrastructure, which allows a user to use the user device <b>102</b> to purchase items and consume items without being tethered to the item providing system <b>104</b> via hardwired links. The wireless infrastructure is provided by a wireless carrier system <b>114</b> that can be implemented using various data processing equipment, communication towers, etc. Alternatively, or in addition, the wireless carrier system <b>114</b> may rely on WiFi or satellite technology to exchange information with the user device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The communication infrastructure also includes a communication-enabling system <b>108</b> that serves as an intermediary in passing information between the item providing system <b>104</b> and the wireless carrier. The communication-enabling system <b>108</b> may communicate with the wireless carrier system <b>114</b> via a dedicated channel, and may communicate with the item providing system <b>104</b> via a non-dedicated communication mechanism, e.g., a public network such as the Internet. By virtue of this intermediary role, the communication enabling system <b>108</b> may be referred to as a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE), while the item providing system <b>104</b> may be referred to as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The item providing system <b>104</b> may pay the wireless carrier a fee based on the aggregate use of the wireless carrier system <b>114</b> by all of the user devices <b>102</b>. The item providing system <b>104</b> may recoup these costs through fees charged to the end-users separately or as part of other purchases (e.g., purchase of digital content) made by the end-users. Alternatively, the wireless carrier may submit bills directly to individual users, or may submits bills to either the item providing system <b>104</b> (in aggregate) or to the individual users, at the option of the individual respective users.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A user device <b>102</b> may be associated with a specific wireless carrier by means of subscriber identity module (SIM) data that may be stored on a physical SIM card or included in a SIM profile. The SIM data includes information identifying the user device to the specific wireless carrier. This information may include a unique international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) containing a mobile country code (MCC), a mobile network code (MNC) and a mobile station identification number (MSIN) within the wireless carrier's customer base. The SIM data may also include security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to, etc. In addition to the association via SIM data, a wireless modem of a user device may be pre-configured with a modem profile that defines network connection parameters for a relevant wireless carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Depending on the location of the user device <b>102</b>, the wireless carrier that the user device <b>102</b> is associated with may not be a preferred carrier in terms of existing contracts with the item providing system <b>104</b> or the end-user, billing rates and/or provided performance characteristics (coverage, signal strength, speed network load, etc.). Hence, the device's network usage can result in increased costs (e.g., roaming charges or higher billing rates) and/or undesirable performance.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments of the invention overcome the above shortcomings by supporting dynamic switching of user devices to preferred wireless carriers. The modem of the user device is programmed with a SIM profile that includes settings of a currently-used wireless carrier such as the IMSI, security authentication and ciphering information, etc. When a switch to a preferred wireless carrier is triggered, the modem is automatically re-programmed with the SIM profile of the preferred wireless carrier. In addition, in some embodiments, the modem is also reconfigured with a modem profile that defines connection parameters for the preferred wireless carrier, such as a GSM frequency band parameter, the format for presenting the wireless carrier name on the user device, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A switch to a preferred wireless carrier may be initiated upon detecting a condition that triggers a rule or detecting a parameter that exceeds a threshold. Various rules and/or thresholds may be maintained based on cost and performance characteristics pertaining to different wireless carriers. The cost characteristics may include, for example, billing rates, surcharges, initial fees and other charges of a wireless carrier. The performance characteristics may include, for example, availability of coverage, throughput, signal strength, network load, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the item providing system <b>104</b> hosts a rule creation module <b>116</b> that collects the above characteristics and creates rules and/or thresholds based on these characteristics.

For example, a rule may require/recommend a switch from carrier 1 to carrier 2 if the current billing rate of carrier 1 exceeds the current billing rate of carrier 2 by at least X amount. In another example, a rule may require/recommend a switch from carrier 1 to carrier 2 if the signal strength of carrier 2 exceeds the signal strength of carrier 1 by Y dBm. In yet another example, a rule may require/recommend a switch from carrier 1 to carrier 2 if the current billing rate of carrier 1 exceeds the current billing rate of carrier 2 by at least X amount, and the signal strength of carrier 1 does not exceed the signal strength of carrier 2 by more than Y dBm.</p>

The rule server <b>110</b> detects conditions that trigger the above rules and/or cause the above thresholds to be exceeded. The conditions may include, for example, a change in a fee charged by a wireless carrier, a change in a location of a user device, a change in a performance characteristic of a network of a wireless carrier, a change in a contractual agreement between the item providing system <b>104</b> and a wireless carrier, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When a rule is triggered (or a threshold is exceeded), the rule server <b>110</b> identifies user devices <b>102</b> to which the rule or threshold is applicable, and sends a message to the identified user devices requesting them to switch to an alternative wireless carrier.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the rule creation module periodically collects performance characteristics per carrier and/or per device (blocks <b>502</b>).

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At block <b>504</b>, the rule creation module periodically collects cost characteristics per carrier. Cost characteristics of a wireless carrier may include, for example, billing rates charged at different locations and on different days/times, discount information, initial fees, surcharges, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At block <b>506</b>, the rule creation module creates rules and/or thresholds based on performance characteristics and/or cost characteristics. A rule may include one or more conditions using any combination of performance characteristics and/or cost characteristics.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the rule creation module also creates rules and/or thresholds for switching between different delivery mechanisms or different communication channels within the same wireless network. For example, if a wireless carrier has higher billing rates for use of the multimedia messaging service (MMS) than the short message service (SMS) in a certain geographical area, a rule may require or recommend a switch from the SMS to the MMS when the user travels to this area.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At block <b>508</b>, the rule creation module sends rules and/or thresholds to the rule server. In some embodiments, the rules creation module also sends to a user device a subset of the rules and/or thresholds that is relevant to the user device.</p>

In one embodiment, embodiments of the method are performed by a computer system hosting a rule server (e.g., a rule server <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the rule sever receives various carrier switching rules and/or thresholds from the item providing system and stores them in a rules store.

At block <b>604</b>, the rule server identifies one or more user devices to which the rule or threshold is applicable. For example, if the rule requests or recommends a switch to carrier A for all devices located in area X, the rule server identifies all user devices in area X that are presently using a wireless carrier other than carrier A.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At block <b>606</b>, the rule server sends a message to each identified user device to request or recommend a switch to the preferred wireless carrier.

The device profile includes a SIM profile associated with the preferred wireless carrier, and optionally in one embodiment a modem profile that define network connection parameters for the preferred wireless carrier. In another embodiment, the rule server sends the identifier of the device profile associated with the preferred carrier to the user device but not the device profile itself.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">At block <b>608</b>, the rule server stores the switching message in a message store. In one embodiment, prior to sending a message to the user device, the rule server determines how many times the user device was requested or recommended to switch over the last N hours or when the last switch of the user device took place. If the number of switches or requests/recommendations exceeds a predefined threshold or the last switch has occurred (or a request/recommendation was sent) less than a predefined number of hours ago, the rule server does not send a switching message to the user device.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one embodiment, several device profiles may be maintained for a single wireless carrier, each of these device profiles corresponding to a different delivery mechanism or a different communication channel within the same wireless network.

The rule server can maintain rules and/or thresholds to initiate or recommend a switch to a preferred delivery mechanism or communication channel when a specific condition occurs. When the rule server detects a condition triggering one of the above rules or causing one of the above thresholds to be exceeded, the rule server identifies user devices to which this rule or threshold applies, and sends these user devices a message, requesting or recommending that the user devices switch to a preferred delivery mechanism or communication channel.
