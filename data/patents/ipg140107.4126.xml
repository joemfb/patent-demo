<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An objective-type dark-field illumination device for a microfluidic channel is provided and includes an optical stop having a pair of symmetric curved slits used to adjust the optical path and inner numerical aperture of a dark-field light source generated by the device. The dark-field illumination can focus on a smaller spot to illuminate a sample in the microfluidic channel by matching a pin-hole combined with a transmitter objective lens. The optical path and smaller spot is advantageous to solve the problem of a traditional dark-field illumination that may generate background light noise scattered from inner walls of the microfluidic channel to lower the image contrast. Therefore, the signal or image resolution of capturing the scattered light and/or emitted fluorescent light emitted from the sample in the microfluidic channel can be enhanced. Meanwhile, the device can simultaneously excite and detect multiple fluorescent samples with different excited wavelengths in the microfluidic channel.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an objective-type dark-field illumination device for a microfluidic channel, and more particularly to an objective-type dark-field illumination device which includes an optical stop having a pair of symmetric curved slits to adjust the light path field for producing a pair of parallel light with curved profile, and combines with a transmitter objective lens to generate a dark-field illumination for illuminating a tested sample in a microfluidic channel by a smaller focused spot due to a small pin-hole.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A traditional dark-field illumination system is used to observe an un-stained semi-transparent material (such as cells, micro-algae or other biological samples) in a transparent medium. The main technology of the dark-field illumination system is based on the principle that scattered and reflective light will be generated when a light passes through a sample substance, and thus the system can only receive the scattered light and a portion of the reflective light by changing the relative angle and position of an observer and a light detection device. Thus, the scattered light and reflective light provide information-rich signals including the profile, the structural variation and the refraction variation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A dark-field condenser is a common accessory used in a microscope system, wherein the dark-field condenser is co-axially disposed on a light path to generate a hollow-cone illumination for observing micro-particles, micro-pore defect structures or other to-be-observed micro-structures in a transparent medium. A traditional dark-field condenser comprises a positive lens and a circular optical stop. Further, the dark-field condenser can further comprise a reflective mirror or a curved mirror, in order to increase the numerical aperture (N.A.). However, although the foregoing co-axial dark-field focusing method can change the light path by various manners, most of the light path is an annular light field.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,259,557 disclosed a traditional device and method for dark field illumination, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein the device comprises: a light source <b>11</b> to provide light, two light collection lenses <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>to collect the light, a pin-hole stop <b>13</b> having a pin-hole <b>131</b> to form a light source spot, a field lens <b>14</b> through which the light source spot passes to form parallel light, a ring diaphragm <b>15</b> having a ring slit <b>151</b> through which the parallel light passes, a ring-shape reflection mirror <b>16</b> to reflect the parallel light, a fly-eye optical device <b>17</b> through which the reflected parallel light passes to form even annular light, and a ring-shape condenser lens <b>18</b> through which the annular light passes to form a spot which focuses on a focal plane <b>19</b> of an objective lens(not-shown). The purpose of the dark field illumination is to evenly emit light onto the surface of the sample, and to provide higher brightness and contrast image for satisfying needs of observing reflective samples. The focused spot still forms a relatively large excitation region of a diameter about 4-8 mm on the focal plane <b>19</b> of the objective lens.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, because the traditional device of dark field illumination is generally used to satisfy needs of large excitation region and high numerical aperture for image observation, the excitation spot focused by the traditional device is greater than the size scale of 100 micrometer (&#x3bc;m). Thus, when the focal plane <b>19</b> is located within a microfluidic channel of a microfluidic chip and the width of the microfluidic channel and samples therein are smaller than 100 &#x3bc;m, the excitation spot focused by the traditional device will be greater than the width of the microfluidic channel and samples therein. As a result, the excitation spot may illuminate inner walls of the microfluidic channel to cause a large number of background noise due to the scattering of the channel wall, so that the traditional device cannot provide a suitable dark-field illumination for clearly observing the samples in the microfluidic channel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is necessary to provide an objective-type dark-field illumination device for a microfluidic channel to solve the foregoing problems, as described above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A primary object of the present invention is to provide an objective-type dark-field illumination device for detecting samples in a microfluidic channel, which includes: an optical stop having a pair of symmetric curved slits used to adjust the optical path and inner numerical aperture (N.A.) of a dark-field light source generated by the device; the outer N.A. is determined by the match of a high N.A. of an excited objective lens; the inner N.A. and the outer N.A. of the dark-field illumination can be adjusted to determine the path of the excitation light by the optical stop pattern. As a result, the path behavior of this invented dark-field illumination can be conveniently and rapidly adjusted for illuminating a tested sample in a microfluidic channel, while the device is advantageous to efficiently solve the problem of a traditional dark-field illumination that may generate noise scattered from inner walls of the microfluidic channel to lower the image contrast. Therefore, the signal resolution of capturing the scattered light and/or emitted fluorescence from the tested sample in the microfluidic channel during observation can be enhanced. Meanwhile, the device can simultaneously detect various fluorescent samples with different excited wavelengths in the microfluidic channel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A secondary object of the present invention is to provide an objective-type dark-field illumination device for sample detection in a microfluidic channel, which uses a pair of symmetric curved slits to generate a dark-field illumination, and rapidly adjusts the size of the spot by changing the size of the pin-hole, so that the installation structure of the dark-field illumination device can be simplified, the control convenience of adjusting the spot size can be enhanced, and the cost of purchase, repair and design change can be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the above object, the objective-type dark-field illumination device for detecting sample in a microfluidic channel of a preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises: a parallel light source assembly for generating a parallel light; an optical stop having a pair of curved slits arranged along a direction parallel to an extension direction of a microfluidic channel, wherein the parallel light passes through the two curved slits to generate two curved parallel light; and a transmitter objective lens with high numerical aperture (N.A.) for converting the two curved parallel light into two curved conical illumination focusing on a spot in the microfluidic channel, so as to illuminate tested samples in the microfluidic channel and to lower the light scattering behavior of inner walls of the microfluidic channel, wherein the diameter of the spot is smaller than or equal to the width of the inner walls of the microfluidic channel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment of the present invention, the size of the two curved slits is equal to each other and the two curved slits are symmetrically arranged on the optical stop.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment of the present invention, each of the two curved slits has two ends by defining an included angle in relation to a geometric center of the optical stop, and the included angle is ranged between 60 and 90 degree, such as 80 degree.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment of the present invention, each of the two curved slits has a radial width equal to or smaller than 3 millimeter (mm), such as 2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment of the present invention, the parallel light source assembly comprises a continuous light source, a condenser lens, a pin-hole stop, a reflective mirror and a field lens in turn.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment of the present invention, the pin-hole stop has a pin-hole, and the diameter of the pin-hole is ranged between 0.1 and 2 mm, such as 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment of the present invention, the pin-hole size is a factor to determine the diameter of the excitation spot which is varied by adjusting the diameter of pin-hole.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment of the present invention, the N.A. value of the transmitter objective lens is ranged between 0.7 and 1.2, such as 0.75.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment of the present invention, an entrance pupil of the transmitter objective lens is ranged between 10 to 20 mm, such as 15 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment of the present invention, the diameter of the excitation spot is smaller than 100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment of the present invention, the present invention further comprises a receiver objective lens with low numerical aperture (N.A.) for receiving scattered light and/or emitted fluorescence from sample passing through the interrogated region in the microfluidic channel.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment of the present invention, the N.A. value of the receiver objective lens, such as 0.45, is smaller than that of the transmitter objective lens.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment of the present invention, the receiver objective lens further guides the received scattered light and/or emitted fluorescence from samples into an optical detection system, such as charge-coupled device (CCD), photomultipliers (PMT), spectrometer or spectrophotometer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment of the present invention, the radial width s of the curved slits is determined according to equations (I) and (II), as follows:

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>, an objective-type dark-field illumination device for a microfluidic channel according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. As shown, an objective-type dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> is generally provided on a first side of a microfluidic chip <b>3</b>, wherein the dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> comprises a parallel light source assembly <b>21</b>, an optical stop <b>22</b> and a transmitter objective lens <b>23</b> with high numerical aperture (N.A.). The dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> is used to provide a suitable dark-field illumination to illuminate samples <b>32</b> in a microfluidic channel <b>31</b> of the microfluidic chip <b>3</b>, so as to considerably lower background light noise scattered from inner walls of the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> for the purpose of increasing the contrast and signal/noise ratio of sample images and detection signals. In addition, a receiver objective lens <b>4</b> is provided on a second side of the microfluidic chip <b>3</b> to receive the signals (such as images, scattered light, emitted fluorescence) from samples with high contrast and low noise.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the objective-type dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> is installed in an inverted optical microscope (not shown), wherein the parallel light source assembly <b>21</b> can be an existed element in the inverted optical microscope. In the embodiment, the parallel light source assembly <b>21</b> is used to generate a parallel light L<b>1</b>, wherein the parallel light assembly <b>21</b> comprises a continuous light source <b>211</b>, a condenser lens <b>212</b>, a pin-hole stop <b>213</b>, a reflective mirror <b>214</b> and a field lens <b>215</b> in turn. The continuous light source <b>211</b> can be selected from continuous light generated by a 100 W tungsten lamp. The condenser lens <b>212</b> is generally a convex lens, wherein the continuous light source <b>211</b> passes through the condenser lens <b>212</b> to focus on a plane of a pin-hole <b>213</b><i>a </i>of the pin-hole stop <b>213</b>, wherein the diameter of the pin-hole <b>213</b><i>a </i>is ranged between 0.1 and 2 mm, such as preferably 1 mm. After the continuous light source <b>211</b> passes through the pin-hole <b>213</b><i>a</i>, the continuous light source <b>211</b> radiates onto the reflective mirror <b>214</b>, and then reflects to pass through the field lens <b>215</b>, so as to generate the parallel light L<b>1</b>, wherein the field lens <b>215</b> can be a convex lens, while the position of the pin-hole <b>213</b><i>a </i>is located on a focal plane of the condenser lens <b>212</b> and the field lens <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2A</figref>, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the optical stop <b>22</b> has two curved slits <b>221</b>, wherein the size of the two curved slits <b>221</b> is equal to each other and the two curved slits <b>221</b> are symmetrically arranged on the optical stop <b>22</b>. In the embodiment, the optical stop <b>22</b> is a transparent plastic plate which is printed with a dark ink pattern on the surface thereof to pattern two curved transparent regions without being covered by the dark ink, so as to define the two curved slits <b>221</b>. Alternatively, the transparent plastic plate can be entirely printed with the dark ink, and then cut to form two curved through holes by a cutter or laser, so as to define the two curved slits <b>221</b>. The foregoing manufacturing method of plastic photomask can advantageously lower the manufacture cost of the optical stop <b>22</b>. After manufacturing, the optical stop <b>22</b> is used to adjust an optical path for entering the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b>. In other words, the parallel light L<b>1</b> of the parallel light source assembly <b>21</b> can pass through the two curved slits <b>221</b> to form two curved parallel light L<b>2</b>, and then the two curved parallel light L<b>2</b> enters the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b>. Furthermore, the two curved slits <b>221</b> are arranged along a direction (such as a direction from right to left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) parallel to an extension direction of the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> in the microfluidic chip <b>3</b> (such as a direction from right to left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, each of the two curved slits <b>221</b> has two ends by defining an included angle &#x3b8; in relation to a geometric center <b>220</b> of the optical stop <b>22</b>, and the included angle &#x3b8; is ranged between 60 and 90 degree, such as preferably 80 degree. Meanwhile, each of the two curved slits <b>221</b> has a radial width s which is equal to or smaller than 3 mm, such as 2 mm. For the optical stop <b>22</b>, the radial width s and the included angle &#x3b8; of the two curved slits <b>221</b> can be used to vary an optical path of dark-field illumination, wherein the radial width s can vary the inner numerical aperture (N.A.) of dark-field illumination, while the included angle &#x3b8; can vary the direction of the optical path of dark-field illumination, which will be described more detailed hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b> is a microscope objective lens of high numerical aperture (N.A.). In the embodiment, the N.A. value of the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b> is ranged between 0.7 and 1.2, such as preferably 0.75. An entrance pupil of the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b> is ranged between 10 to 20 mm, such as preferably 15 mm. Moreover, the rate of the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b> is 20&#xd7;, the working distance (W.D.) thereof is 1 mm, and the focal length (f<sub>0</sub>) thereof is 10 mm. The transmitter objective lens <b>23</b> is used to change the optical path of dark-field illumination after being focused, i.e. to convert the two inputted curved parallel light L<b>2</b> into two curved conical light L<b>3</b>. The two curved conical light L<b>3</b> can be focus on a spot L<b>4</b> in the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> of the microfluidic chip <b>3</b> for illuminating a tested sample <b>32</b> in the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> and forming a plurality of scattered light (or emitted fluorescent light) from samples L<b>5</b>. In the present invention, because the two curved slits <b>221</b> are arranged along a direction parallel to the extension direction of the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> in the microfluidic chip <b>3</b> and the radial width s and the included angle &#x3b8; of the two curved slits <b>221</b> can be suitably controlled to vary an optical path of dark-field illumination. In the present invention, the diameter of the spot L<b>4</b> is set according to the width of the inner walls of the microfluidic channel <b>31</b>. In the present invention, the pin-hole <b>213</b><i>a </i>with a diameter of 1 mm can form the spot L<b>4</b> with a diameter of about 100 &#x3bc;m, so that the diameter of the spot L<b>4</b> can be smaller than or equal to the width of the inner walls of the microfluidic channel <b>31</b>. As a result, the two curved slits <b>221</b> of the present invention can efficiently solve the problem of a traditional dark-field light source that may generate background noise scattered from inner walls of the microfluidic channel to lower the image contrast. Thus, during observation, the signal resolution of capturing the scattered light L<b>5</b> (and/or emitted fluorescent light) from the tested sample <b>32</b> in the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the microfluidic channel <b>3</b> can be selected from various types of biochips or detection chips having at least one microfluidic channel <b>31</b>, but the present invention is not limited to the shape of the microfluidic channel <b>3</b> or the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> and the type of the tested sample <b>32</b>. Only if the substrate of the microfluidic channel <b>3</b> is transparent for light to pass through the microfluidic channel <b>31</b>, the type of the microfluidic channel <b>3</b> can be applied to the present invention, so that the objective-type dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> of the present invention can provide a dark-field light source to illuminate the tested sample <b>32</b> in the microfluidic channel <b>31</b>. The tested sample <b>32</b> can be selected from various biological or chemical samples, such as cells, organelles, bacteria or nano-microspheres; or cells, organelles, bacteria, virus, protein microparticles or DNA fragments having nano-microspheres or fluorescent tags, but not limited thereto. Furthermore, according to light type needed by the tested sample <b>32</b> (such as white light, single color light, lasers and etc.), the parallel light source assembly <b>21</b> can correspondingly change the bulb type of the continuous light source <b>211</b>, or additionally add a filter, in order to satisfy the optical detection need of the tested sample <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the preferred embodiment of the present invention further comprises a receiver objective lens <b>4</b> with low numerical aperture (N.A.), such as a microscope objective lens of low numerical aperture (N.A.). In the embodiment, the N.A. value of the receiver objective lens <b>4</b>, such as 0.45, is smaller than that of the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b>. Moreover, the rate of the receiver objective lens <b>4</b> is 20&#xd7;, the working distance (W.D.) thereof is 1 mm, and the focal length (f<sub>0</sub>) thereof is 10 mm. The receiver objective lens <b>4</b> with low N.A. is used to receive the scattered light (or excited fluorescent light) L<b>5</b> of the tested sample <b>32</b> passed through the microfluidic channel <b>31</b>. Then, the receiver objective lens <b>4</b> can further guide the scattered light (and/or emitted fluorescent light) L<b>5</b> into an optical detection system, such as charge-coupled device (CCD), photomultipliers (PMT), spectrometer or spectrophotometer for executing the analysis of images, light intensity, spectrum or spectrophotometry.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the radial width s of the two curved slits <b>221</b> can vary the inner numerical aperture (N.A.) of dark-field illumination, while the included angle &#x3b8; of the two curved slits <b>221</b> can vary the direction of the optical path of dark-field illumination, wherein the radial width s of the curved slits <b>221</b> is determined according to equations (I) and (II), as follows:

</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">wherein N.A. is an numerical aperture value of the receiver objective lens <b>4</b>; f<sub>0 </sub>is a focal length of the receiver objective lens <b>4</b>; D<sub>i </sub>is the calculated entrance pupil of the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b> when N.A. is equal to the receiver objective lens <b>4</b> or an inner diameter of the curved slits <b>221</b>; D<sub>0 </sub>is the entrance pupil of the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b> or an outer diameter of the curved slits <b>221</b>; and s is the radial width of the curved slits <b>221</b>. The N.A. value of the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b> is greater than that of the N.A. value of the receiver objective lens <b>4</b>, so that it can prevent the receiver objective lens <b>4</b> from receiving unnecessary emitting light L<b>6</b>, and thus the receiver objective lens <b>4</b> can simply receive the scattered light (and/or excited fluorescent light) L<b>5</b> of the tested sample <b>32</b> for analysis without background light noise.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, when the N.A. value of the receiver objective lens <b>4</b> can be 0.45 and the focal length (f<sub>0</sub>) of the transmitter objective lens thereof is 10 mm, the calculated entrance pupil of the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b> when N.A. is equal to the receiver objective lens <b>4</b> or the inner diameter of the curved slits <b>221</b> can be:

</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, when the entrance pupil of the transmitter objective lens <b>23</b> or the outer diameter of the curved slits <b>221</b> (i.e. the value D<sub>0</sub>) is 15 mm, the radial width s of the curved slits <b>221</b> can be:

</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the present invention, the radial width s is preferably 2 mm, while the included angle &#x3b8; of the curved slits <b>221</b> is preferably 80 degree. The diameter of the spot L<b>4</b> in the present invention can be smaller than 100 &#x3bc;m, so as to be suitably applied to various microfluidic channels <b>31</b> with an wall width W greater than or equal to the diameter of the spot L<b>4</b> for providing maximum luminous flux and minimum background light noise, i.e. the present invention allows the scattered light (and/or emitted fluorescent light) L<b>5</b> of the tested sample <b>32</b> to have optimal contrast. Moreover, when the objective-type dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> is applied to another microfluidic channels <b>31</b> with different wall width W, the present invention can change the radial width s of the two curved slits <b>221</b> to generate a suitable optical path and a dark-field light source with a smaller spot L<b>4</b>, and also can adjust the size of the pin-hole <b>213</b><i>a </i>of the pin-hole stop <b>213</b> to rapidly change the diameter of the spot L<b>4</b>. Therefore, in the present invention, the design of the two symmetrical curved slits <b>221</b> of the optical stop <b>22</b> can advantageously simplify the installation structure of the objective-type dark-field illumination device <b>2</b>, enhance the control convenience of adjusting the size of the spot L<b>4</b>, and lower the cost of purchase, repair and design change of the dark-field illumination device <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C illustrate schematic views of a first traditional dark-field illumination device, a second traditional dark-field illumination device with ring-style stop and the objective-type dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, each of which provides a dark-field illumination and has a receiver objective lens <b>4</b> to receive scattered light (or excited fluorescent light) L<b>5</b> and guide it into an optical detection system (such as a CCD camera) for generating microscopic photographs of the microfluidic channel <b>31</b>, wherein flowing liquid in the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> contains fluorescent tags which are used to simulate the tested sample <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4A</figref>, a first traditional dark-field illumination device <b>5</b> comprises a continuous light source <b>51</b>, a patterned stop <b>52</b> and a condenser unit <b>53</b>, wherein the continuous light source <b>51</b> passes through the patterned stop <b>52</b> to form a ring-shape parallel light source which then passes through the condenser unit <b>53</b> to form a ring-shape conical light source to focus on a spot <b>54</b>. However, the diameter of the spot <b>54</b> is considerably greater than the wall width W of the microfluidic channel <b>31</b>, such that the focusing effect of the spot <b>54</b> is poor. As a result, the liquid in the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> is excited to generate an image with excess fluorescent light intensity, and a large number of background light noise is scattered from the inner wall of the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> and the surface of the microfluidic chip <b>3</b>, resulting in considerably lowering the optical contrast of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4B</figref>, a second traditional dark-field illumination device is similar to the objective-type dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> of the present invention, but an optical stop <b>6</b> of the second traditional dark-field illumination device only has a ring-shape slit <b>61</b>. In comparison with the spot <b>54</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the ring-shape slit <b>61</b> generates a dark-field light source having a size relatively smaller than that of the focused spot <b>54</b> to enhance the image contrast inside/outside the microfluidic channel <b>31</b>. However, the background light noise scattered from inner walls of the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> is still considerable and thus lowers the signal/noise ratio of the tested sample <b>32</b> in the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> during detection.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In contrast, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4C</figref>, the optical stop <b>22</b> of the objective-type dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> of the present invention has the two symmetrical curved slits <b>221</b> arranged along a direction parallel to an extension direction of the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> of the microfluidic chip <b>3</b>, while the radial width s and the included angle &#x3b8; of the two curved slits <b>221</b> can be suitably controlled to vary the optical path of dark-field light source. Thus, the present invention can eliminate the background light noise scattered from the inner walls of the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> to prevent the two curved conical light source L<b>3</b> from being orthogonal to the inner walls and thus generating the background scattered light noise to lower the contrast. As a result, it is advantageous to enhance the image resolution of capturing the scattered light (and/or emitted fluorescent light) L<b>5</b> emitted from the tested sample <b>32</b> in the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> by the receiver objective lens <b>4</b> with low N.A. during observation.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it illustrates a curve diagram of light intensity (a.u.) and molar concentration (M) of the tested sample by using the first traditional dark-field illumination device <b>5</b> (represented by &#x201c;&#x25b4;&#x201d;) and the objective-type dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention (represented by &#x201c;&#x25aa;&#x201d;), each of which provides the dark-field illumination and has the receiver objective <b>4</b> to receive scattered light (or excited fluorescent light) L<b>5</b> and guide it into the optical detection system (such as a photomultipliers) for obtaining the light intensity (a.u.) of the tested sample <b>32</b>, wherein a plurality of liquids containing different molar concentration (M) of fluorescent tags are used to simulate the tested sample <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the objective-type dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> of the present invention has the two symmetrical curved slits <b>221</b> which can relatively enhance the detection sensitivity of the tested sample <b>32</b> with low molar concentration, and thus can apparently increase the light intensity signal and the detection threshold of the fluorescent tags in the microfluidic channel <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it illustrates a curve diagram of electrophoresis detection of the time (sec), wavelength (nm) and fluorescent intensity (a.u.) of four fluorescent samples having four fluorescent tags with different wavelengths in the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> continuously detected by the optical detection system and the objective-type dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention which uses a light source of continuous wavelengths, wherein the four fluorescent tags are 2,7-DCF (max excitation wavelength: 495 nm; max emission wavelength: 525 nm), RhB (max excitation wavelength: 543 nm; max emission wavelength: 578 nm), Atto610 (max excitation wavelength: 608 nm; max emission wavelength: 634 nm) and Atto647N (max excitation wavelength: 648 nm; max emission wavelength: 668 nm), while the downstream of the receiver objective lens <b>4</b> is a optical detection system selected from spectrometer or spectrophotometer. Because the excitation light L<b>6</b> does not directly enter the receiver objective lens <b>4</b>, the receiver objective lens <b>4</b> can only detect the emitted fluorescent signals from the four fluorescent tags. Thus, it can directly and simultaneously obtain multiple fluorescent signals without adding any expensive optical filter. Because the light source of continuous wavelengths is used to excite the four or more fluorescent tags simultaneously, the dark-field illumination device <b>2</b> of the present invention can simultaneously detect various mixed fluorescent samples with different excited wavelengths in the microfluidic channel <b>31</b> by a single detection operation.</p>
