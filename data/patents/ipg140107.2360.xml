<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed is a sputtering target that can suppress the occurrence of anomalous discharge in the formation of an oxide semiconductor film by sputtering method and can continuously and stably form a film. Also disclosed is an oxide for a sputtering target that has a rare earth oxide C-type crystal structure and has a surface free from white spots (a poor appearance such as concaves and convexes formed on the surface of the sputtering target). Further disclosed is an oxide sintered compact that has a bixbyite structure and contains indium oxide, gallium oxide, and zinc oxide. The composition amounts (atomic %) of indium (In), gallium (Ga), and zinc (Zn) fall within a composition range satisfying the following formula: In/(In+Ga+Zn)&#x3c;0.75.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a sputtering target suitable for forming a oxide thin film and a process for producing thereof, wherein the oxide thin film is composed of an oxide sintered body which comprises indium oxide having a bixbyite structure, and a Yb<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7 </sub>structure compound represented by the formula: In<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>7</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention also relates to a sputtering target suitable for forming a oxide semi-conductor and a method for producing thereof, wherein the oxide semi-conductor comprises oxides of indium (In), gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn), and is composed of an oxide sintered body which comprises indium oxide having a bixbyite structure and a homologous structure compound InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is a natural number of 1 to 4).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a sintered body having a crystal structure of rare-earth oxide C type.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a target having a crystal structure of rare-earth oxide C type, especially relates to a target suitable for forming an amorphous oxide film by sputtering and a method for producing thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Background of the Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An oxide semi-conductor film composed of a metallic composite oxide includes, for example, an oxide semi-conductor film composed of oxides of In, Ga and Zn (IGZO) (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;oxide thin film&#x201d;). An oxide semi-conductor film which film is formed by IGZO sputtering target draws attention as one having mobility greater than that of an amorphous Si film. Such an oxide semi-conductor film has mobility and visible light permeability greater than that of an amorphous Si film, and thus the film also draws attention as one to be applied for a switching element (thin film transistor) such as a liquid crystal display device or a thin film electroluminescence display device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The IGZO sputtering target is known as one containing a compound represented by InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is a natural number of 1 to 20) as a main component. However, when a sputtering (DC sputtering) is conducted by using the IGZO sputtering target, an abnormal electrical discharge caused by anomalous growth of the compound shown by InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m</sub>, and thus there was a problem about defects on the obtained film. In addition, specific resistance of the obtained sputtering target was at least around 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>&#x3a9;cm, this resistance is high and thus a plasma discharge is not stable, and DC sputtering was thus difficult, on top of that, a target which causes cracks during sputtering could not obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A sputtering target intended to form an amorphous oxide film is known (Patent Document 1). In this document, a sintered body indicating crystal structure having homologous phase (InGa(ZnO)<sub>m</sub>; m is natural number of less than 6) is used, and then the major component thereof is different from that of the present invention. In addition, the specific resistance of the target is around 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>&#x3a9;cm or more which is so high, the target is not appropriate for conducting DC sputtering method having good productivity. The spattering target composed of a compound single phase represented by homologues structure InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is natural number of 1 to 4) disclosed in the Patent Document 1 has different structure compounds of a sintered body from those of the present invention. The production process to obtain the sintered body of the compound single phase is complicated, sintering time is long, and thus a target sintered body having low cost could not be obtained. In addition, sintering conditions for forming a (single phase) sintered body consisting only of this homologues structure InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>are limited. Furthermore, bulk resistance of this homologues structure InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is natural number of 1 to 4) was usually high such as 10<sup>2 </sup>to 10<sup>3 </sup>&#x3a9;cm, therefore, the bulk resistance was reduced by conducting reduction treatment after sintering. However, the bulk resistance after the reduction was at most around 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>&#x3a9;cm, and thus effect of reducing the bulk resistance was small compared to a high number of production steps thereof. Further, the sputtering target composed of a sintered body only consisting of a compound represented by the homologues structure InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>causes an abnormal electrical discharge by anomalous growth during film-forming by sputtering, and thus there was a problem about defects on the obtained film.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, a compound represented by In<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>7 </sub>or In<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>7-d </sub>which has oxygen defect d is known as an oxide sintered body used as an electrode for a liquid crystal display, an EL display and a solar cell (Patent Documents 2 and 3). In this case, electrically conductive is applied by introducing an amount of oxygen defect d to a compound represented by In<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>7</sub>, but the inventions of these documents have different crystal structure from that of the present invention. Therefore, in the production steps of an oxide sintered body, it was impossible to shorten a reduction step and to elongate a sintering time, and thus neither productivity could be heightened, nor cost could be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is a report by Kimizuka, et. al. concerning a phase diagram of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;Ga<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;ZnO at 1350&#xb0; C. However, the invention of this document has different crystal structure from that of the present invention. Therefore, in the production steps of an oxide sintered body, it was impossible to shorten a reduction step and to elongate a sintering time, and thus neither productivity could be heightened, nor cost could be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A field effect type transistor such as a thin-film transistor (TFT) is widely used for a unit electron device for a semi-conductor memory integrated circuit, a high-frequency signal amplifier device, a device for driving a liquid crystal, and is the most practically used electric device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Among the above, because of recent dramatic progress in a display device, TFT is heavily used as a switching device for driving a display device by adding drive voltage to a display device among various kind of a display device such as a liquid crystal display device (LCD), an electroluminescence display device (EL), or a field emotion display (FED).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A silicon semi-conductor compound is most widely used as a material for a semi-conductor layer which is a primary member of a field effect type transistor. A silicon single crystal is generally used for a high-frequency signal amplifier device or a device for an integrated circuit where high-speed operation is required. For a device for driving a liquid crystal, an amorphous silicon semi-conductor (amorphous silicon) is used because of a request for one having large-area.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, as the TFT, there is an opposite stagger structure which laminates a gate electrode, a gate insulation layer, a semi-conductor layer such as a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), a source electrode and drain electrode on a substrate such as a glass. This TFT is used for an image sensor, as well as a driving device for a flat panel display represented by an active matrix type liquid crystal display, within a field of a large-area device. Among these usages, high-speed driving is required based on high-functionalization, even though conventional amorphous silicon is used.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Currently, a switching device for driving a display device mainly uses a device using a silicon semi-conductor film, because a silicon thin film has various good properties such as stability, good workability, and high switching speed. This silicon thin film is generally prepared by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A crystalline silicon thin film requires, for example, high temperature of 800&#xb0; C. or more during crystallization, and thus it is difficult to compose it on a glass substrate or an organic material substrate. Therefore, there are several problems, for example, the film can be formed only on an expensive substrate having high heat resistance such as a silicon wafer or quartz, and the production thereof requires a lot of energy and many steps.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A crystalline silicon thin film is limited to a top-gate structure for a devise structure of an ordinary TFT, and thus it is difficult to reduce costs by cutting a number of masks down.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An amorphous silicon thin film can form under comparatively low temperature. However, switching speed of the film is slower than that of the crystalline film, and therefore, when the film is used for a switching device for driving a display device, displaying high-speed motion picture cannot be achieved sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Specifically, a liquid crystal television having VGA definition can use an amorphous silicon having 0.5 to 1 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs in mobility. But if the definition becomes SXGA, UXGA, QXGA, or higher, the mobility requires 2 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or more. If driving frequency is raised for enhancing image quality, the mobility also must become higher.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An organic light emitting display is driven by current. Therefore, if an amorphous silicon which varies its properties by DC stress is used, there is a problem where image quality is degraded based on its long-term use.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, if a crystalline silicon is used for the above usages, it becomes difficult to apply it to large-area. There is also a problem where production cost becomes higher, because high temperature heating treatment is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Under these situations, recently, an oxide semi-conductor thin film using oxides is coming up as one having excellent stability rather than that of a silicon semi-conductor thin film</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, TFT using zinc oxide as a semi-conductor layer is released.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">However, this semi-conductor layer has low mobility: about 1 cm<sup>2</sup>/V&#xb7;sec, and low ON-OFF ratio. In addition, leak current is easy to occur, and thus it was difficult to put it into industrial, practical use. Furthermore, many attempts were taken place for an oxide semi-conductor containing crystalline material using zinc oxide, but the following problems were present when a film was formed by a sputtering method which is commercially and commonly used.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">That is, mobility is low, ON-OFF ratio is low, leak current is high, pinch-off is unclear, normally-ON is easy to occur, and thus properties in TFT are lowered. The obtained film has less chemical resistance, and thus process or usage environment is limited, for example, wet-etching is difficult. Further, a film must be formed under high pressure in order to improve its properties, but film-forming speed is slow as well as 700&#xb0; C. or more of high temperature is required, and thus there are problems in industrialization. In addition, TFT properties such as mobility in a bottom-gate structure is low, and thus a TFT device structure is also limited, for example, top-gate structure and 50 nm or more of thickness are required for raising its properties.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In order to solve these problems, a method for producing an amorphous oxide semi-conductor film composed of indium oxide, zinc oxide and gallium oxide so as to drive a thin film transistor is discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For instance, a target composed of a sintered body indicating a homologous crystal structure comprising indium oxide, zinc oxide and gallium oxide is disclosed (Patent Documents 4 and 5). However, the homologous crystal structure has less heat stability, and thus crystalline morphology is varied based on small change of sintering temperature or sintering time. Therefore, there are problems concerning instability in properties such as density in a target, bulk resistance, bending strength and surface roughness. In addition, if the target is used as one for making a thin film transistor, there are problems particularly for a homologous crystal structure where properties of the transistor is significantly varied between at the start of forming a film and at the end of forming a film.

        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0029">A target composed of indium oxide, zinc oxide, and gallium oxide having 2.2 to 40 atom % of Ga, 50 to 90 atom % of In and 95% or more of relative density is disclosed (Patent Document 6). However, there is no discussion about a target having less than 50 atom % of In.</li>

<p id="p-0030" num="0030">It is known that In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(indium oxide) has a crystal structure of rare-earth oxide C type, and having high mobility caused by the crystal structure of rare-earth oxide C type. However, it has been difficult to make a sintered body which can readily incorporate oxygen at the time of sintering to have low resistance. A sputtering target composed of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(indium oxide) or containing plenty of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(indium oxide) has problems concerning that nodules (agglomerates found on a surface of the sputtering target) are easily created, that there are many particles (dusts of a sputter material found during sputtering), and that an abnormal electrical discharge during sputtering is easily occurred. It is known that if In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(indium oxide) contains an atom other than In, a crystalline type other than rare-earth oxide C type such as &#x3b2;-GaInO<sub>3</sub>, &#x3b2;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZnGa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>is formed. Especially, it is also known that if Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is contained in an amount of 10 mass % or more (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>becomes 90 mass % or less), &#x3b2;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is formed (Non-Patent Document 1). If a crystalline type other than rare-earth oxide C type, especially &#x3b2;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is formed, problems such as crack being formed, bulk resistance being high, relative density being low, bending strength (JIS R1601) being low, difficulty in obtaining a sputtering target being uniformity in various physical properties such as a structure, are easily occurred, and thus it becomes not appropriate for applying it to a sputtering target for industrial use. If it is used for forming a semi-conductor film, there are possibilities to cause ununiformity parts so as not to obtain in-plain uniformity, to cause reduction in yield ratio, or to cause reduction in reliability (stability).

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">The present inventors intently made their studies and then the inventors conceived the present invention, since they found that if an oxide sintered body composed of indium oxide having a bixbyite structure and an oxide comprising Yb<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7 </sub>structure compound represented by the formula: In<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>7</sub>, which is obtained by combining indium (In), gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn) in the specific composition ratio and then sintering it under the specific condition, is used as a sputtering target, occurrence of abnormal electrical discharge during film-forming of an oxide thin film using a sputtering method is reduced, and then the film can be formed continuously and stably.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">The present inventors intently made their studies and then the inventors conceived the present invention, since they also found that if an oxide sintered body which comprises indium oxide having a bixbyite structure, and a homologous structure compound of InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is a natural number of 1 to 4) is used as a oxide sintered body used for a sputtering target, then an excellent effect on reducing bulk resistance is acquired, manufacture steps can be simplified, occurrence of abnormal electrical discharge during film-forming of an oxide thin film using a sputtering method is reduced, and then the film can be formed continuously and stably.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051">In addition, as stated above, a sintered body of an oxide of indium (In) (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(indium oxide)) only comprising indium (In) as a metal atom has a crystal structure of rare-earth oxide C type. However, if atoms other than In are contained as a metal atom, a crystalline structure such as &#x3b2;-GaInO<sub>3</sub>, &#x3b2;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZnGa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>is formed, and then the crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type is disappeared.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0052">However, the present inventors found that when 100 atom % is based on the atomicity of all the atoms included in oxides at issue other than oxide, even if an oxide only contains indium (In) in an atom ratio of 49 atom % or less, in accordance with the combination of composition ratio in the oxide and sintering condition of the oxide, a crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type which was supposed to be disappeared because of the present of a metal atom other than In can be re-constructed. Unexpectedly, by using a sintered body of the finally obtained oxide, even if the content of In is low, a sputtering target having low bulk resistance, high relative density, and high bending strength can be provided. In addition, a target which creates extremely less nodules release during sputtering can also be provided, comparing it with a target containing a lot of In.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0053">By preparing a thin film transistor using this sputtering target, a thin film transistor having high transistor properties and manufactural stability is obtained.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(1) Sputtering Target</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0063">A sputtering target of the present invention is composed of an oxide sintered body containing indium oxide having a bixbyite structure and a Yb<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7 </sub>structure compound represented by the formula: In<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>7</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0064">The oxide sintered body concerning the sputtering target of the present invention has reduced bulk resistance caused by oxygen defect on indium oxide, and thus d=0 may be allowed in In<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>7-d</sub>. That is, by combining indium oxide having a bixbyite structure and In<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>7</sub>, bulk resistance on the oxide sintered body can be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0065">In this connection, an oxide sintered body is one sintered a crude oxide burned under high temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0066">As for another embodiment, the sputtering target of the present invention may be a sputtering target composed of oxides of indium (In), gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn), and may be composed of an oxide sintered body comprising indium oxide having a bixbyite structure and a homologous structure compound InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is a natural number of 1 to 4).</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(2) Bixbyite Structure</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0067">A bixbyite structure is a structure showing the peak pattern of 06-0416 of X-ray diffraction JCPDS (Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standards) data base or an analogous (or shifted) pattern thereof. In general, indium oxide having a bixbyite structure is easy to cause oxygen defect, and is a transparent and electric conductive oxide. Although the present invention does not limit the amount of the oxygen defect, presence of oxygen defect is preferable, since bulk resistance of a target sintered body can be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0068">A part of In in indium oxide having a bixbyite structure may be subjected to solid solution substitution by another element. Such an element subjected to solid solution substitution by In is preferably Ga or Zn, ether or both of Ga and Zn may be subjected to solid solution substitution. By solid solution substitution of a part of elements of In by another element, an electron can be injected into an oxide. The solid solution substitution of a part of elements of In by another element can be confirmed by a shift of lattice constant (interstitial distance) calculated from X-ray diffraction, or structural analysis using high brightness emitted light. Specifically, based on a peak shift of X-ray diffraction pattern, it can be confirmed by a change in axis length of a crystalline structure. If the axis length becomes shortened by the solid solution substitution, a peak of X-ray diffraction pattern shifts to high angle side. Further, the lattice constant is decided by Rietveld analysis.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(3) Homologous Structure Compound</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0069">Homologous structure compound is a compound having Homologous phase. Homologous phase (homologated product series phase) is Magneli phase, for example, represented by the formula Ti<sub>n</sub>O<sub>2n-1 </sub>wherein n is natural number. Such a phase includes a group of compounds where n is changed continuously. Specific example of a homologous stricture compound includes In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is a natural number of 2 to 20). A homologous stricture compound InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is a natural number) includes the compound having m=1 to 20 (&#x201c;Solid Physics (Kotai-Butsuri)&#x201d;, vol. 28, No. 5 p. 317 (1993)). In case of m=1, nGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO) shows a peak pattern of 38-1104 of JCPDS data base or an analogous (or shifted) pattern thereof. In case of m=2, InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>2 </sub>shows a peak pattern of 40-0252 of JCPDS data base or an analogous (or shifted) pattern thereof. In case of m=3, InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>3 </sub>shows a peak pattern of 40-0253 of JCPDS data base or an analogous (or shifted) pattern thereof. In case of m=4, InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>4 </sub>shows a peak pattern of 40-0254 of JCPDS data base or an analogous (or shifted) pattern thereof. Crystal structure of the homologous phase is confirmed by, for example, X-ray diffraction pattern of a target ground powder, or by the correspondence with X-ray diffraction pattern of a crystal structure of homologous phase assumed by composition ratio. Specifically, it is confirmed when the pattern corresponds to X-ray diffraction pattern of a crystal structure of homologous phase obtained from JCPDS (Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standards) cards.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0070">In the present invention, since bulk resistance is lowered by oxygen defect on indium oxide having a bixbyite structure, and thus bulk resistance is lowered rather than that of a sintered body consisting only of a compound represented by a homologous structure InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is a natural number). Namely, by combining indium oxide having a bixbyite structure and InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is a natural number of 1 to 4), bulk resistance on the sputtering target can be lowered.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0085">In order to obtain a sintered body having high relative density, sintering in the production method of the sputtering target stated below preferably follows after cold isostatic press (CIP) or hot isostatic press (HIP).</p>

<p id="h-0024" num="0000">(e) an optional step for processing the sintered body to a configuration suitable for loading the body to a sputtering device (processing step).</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">(a) Mixing Step</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0093">Mixing step is an essential step for mixing metal oxides used as crude materials for a sputtering target.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0094">Crude materials may comprise metal oxides such as oxides of Indium element (In), Gallium element (Ga), Zinc element (Zn) and a metal element (X) having positive four or more valences.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0095">An average diameter of a zinc compound powder used as the crude material is preferably smaller than that of an indium compound powder. The average diameter of a metal oxide powder used as the crude materials can be measured by a method described in JIS R 1619. Indium compounds include, for example, indium oxide and indium hydroxide. Gallium compounds include, for example, gallium oxide. Zinc compounds include, for example, zinc oxide and zinc hydroxide. Oxide is preferable for each compound because of its ease of sintering or small amount of by-products to be appeared.</p>

Purity of each crude material is normally 99.9 mass % (3N) or more, preferably 99.99 mass % (4N) or more, further preferably 99.995 mass % or more, and especially preferably 99.999 mass % (5N) or more. If the purity of each crude material is 99.9 mass % (3N) or more, properties of a semi-conductor is not declined by impurities such as Fe, Al, Si, Ni, and Cu, and thus credibility is sufficiently kept. Specifically, if Na content is less than 100 ppm, credibility at the time of making a thin-film transistor is preferably going up.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0097">The above-mentioned crude oxide powder is mixed. The mixing is preferably conducted by using a normal mixing and grinding machine, for example, a wet-type ball mill, a beads mill or an ultrasonic device so as to mix and grind it uniformly. Average particle diameter of the mixture obtained after the mixing and grinding is usually 10 &#x3bc;m or less, preferably 1 to 9 &#x3bc;m, and especially preferably 1 to 6 &#x3bc;m. If the average particle diameter is 10 &#x3bc;m or less, density of a sputtering target to be obtained is preferably high.

<p id="p-0090" num="0098">Specific surface area of the crude oxide powder is, for example, 2 to 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and preferably 4 to 8 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The difference in the specific surface areas for each crude oxide powder is 5 m<sup>2</sup>/g or less, preferably 3 m<sup>2</sup>/g. If the difference in the specific surface area is smaller, the crude oxide powder can be ground and mixed more efficiently, and especially, it is preferable that no gallium oxide particle is remained in an obtained oxide. In addition, the specific surface area for an indium oxide powder is preferably the same as that for a gallium oxide powder, so that the crude oxide powder can be ground and mixed more efficiently. In this connection, the specific surface area can be determined by, for example, BET method. Further, it is preferable that the crude material contains a mixed powder comprising an oxide indium powder, an oxide gallium powder, a zinc powder or a complex oxide powder having the specific surface area of 3 to 16 m<sup>2</sup>/g in which the specific area of the whole powder is 3 to 16 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The specific surface area of each oxide powder is preferably almost the same as one another. This crude material makes grinding and mixing more effectively. Specifically, a ratio of the specific surface area is preferably in &#xbc; to 4 times, especially preferably in &#xbd; to 2 times.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0099">The mixed powder is mixed and ground by, for example, a wet-type medium agitating mill.

Presence of a crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type can be confirmed from the indication of JCPDS Card No. 6-0416 pattern by X-ray diffraction.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0162">The crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type is the same structure as a fluorite type crystalline structure which is one of the crystalline structures of compounds indicated by MX<sub>2 </sub>(M: cation, X: anion) except that one out of four anions is missing due to its stoichiometry being M<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3</sub>. Anions (oxygen for normal oxides) are six-coordinated against cation, and two anion sites are empty (empty anion sites are called as quasi-ion sites.) (cf. above mentioned &#x201c;Tomei Dodenmaku no Gijutu (Technique for Transparent Conductive Layer) 2nd edition&#x201d;). The crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type where oxygen (anions) is six-coordinated against cation has an oxygen octahedral edge-sharing structure. If there is the oxygen octahedral edge-sharing structure, ns orbits in p metal of a cation are overlapped to form one another to form an electronic conducting pathway, and then effective mass becomes low so as to show high mobility. In this connection, the mobility is measured by Hall effect or TOF (Time of flight), or determined from its field effect mobility by making a field effect transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0163">The crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type may shift from stoichiometric ratio of M<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3 </sub>as long as showing the peak pattern of JCPDS card No. 06-0416 of X-ray diffraction. That is, the crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type may be M<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3</sub>-d. Oxygen defect amount d is preferably in the range of 3&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to 3&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This d can be controlled by atmosphere at sintering, temperature increasing, or temperature decreasing.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0164">This d can also be controlled by reduction treatment after sintering. The oxygen defect amount is a value, shown by mole unit, of a number of oxygen ion contained in one mole of oxygen crystalline being deducted from a number of oxygen ion of stoichimetric amount. The number of oxygen ion contained in oxygen crystalline may be, for example, calculated from an amount of carbon dioxide produced by heating an oxide crystal in carbon powder by using an infrared absorption spectrum. The number of oxygen ion of stoichimetric amount can be calculated from mass of the oxide crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0165">&#x201c;Having a crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type&#x201d; means that the crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type is a major component. Being a major component means that, based on X-ray diffraction, the maximum strength of a peak belonging to the crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type is twice or more of the maximum strength of a peak belonging to another crystalline type. The maximum strength of a peak belonging to the crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type based on X-ray diffraction is preferably five fold or more, more preferably 10 fold or more, and especially preferably 20 fold or more of the maximum strength of a peak belonging to another crystalline type. If there is a &#x3b2;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>structure, there is a possibility to increase resistance of a sintered body or to decrease bending strength. Therefore, the &#x3b2;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>structure is preferably unconfirmed by X-ray diffraction.</p>

<p id="p-0179" num="0187">The oxide of the present invention as another embodiment may be prepared by the following method.</p>
<p id="h-0044" num="0000">(a) preparing a mixture comprising a powder of an indium compound, a powder of a zinc compound, and a powder of a gallium compound;</p>
<p id="h-0045" num="0000">(b) forming a formed body by press forming the mixture; and</p>
<p id="h-0046" num="0000">(c) sintering the formed body.</p>
<p id="h-0047" num="0000">Step (a): A step for preparing a mixture comprising a powder of an indium compound, a powder of a zinc compound, and a powder of a gallium compound</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0188">It is preferable that each powder of each compound as a crude material (a crude powder) preferably has the specific surface area of 2 to 16 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and more preferably 3 to 15 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The specific surface area of each oxide powder to be used is preferably almost the same as one another. This crude material makes grinding and mixing more effectively. By limiting the above, grinding and mixing can be conducted more efficiently. Specifically, a ratio of the specific surface area is preferably in &#xbc; to 4 times, especially preferably in &#xbd; to 2 times.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0189">Average median diameter (d50) of the crude powder is, for example, 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m, preferably 0.15 to 0.5 &#x3bc;m, and more preferably 0.2 to 3 &#x3bc;m. If the average median diameter (d50) of the crude powder is 0.1 &#x3bc;m or more, reduction of sintered density caused by pinhole (air vessel) in a sintered body can be avoided. If it is 10 &#x3bc;m or more, increase of particle size of a sintered body is also preferably avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0190">The specific surface area of each powder is determined by BET method. The average median diameter is a value obtained by determining median diameter of the crude powder five times and averaged them. These values can be adjusted by grinding the powder using a dry-type grinding method or a wet-type grinding method.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0191">Purity of each crude powder is normally 99.9% (3N) or more, preferably 99.99% (4N) or more, further preferably 99.995% or more, and especially preferably 99.999% (5N) or more. If the purity of each crude material is 99.9% (3N) or more, properties of a semi-conductor is not declined by impurities, defective appearance such as color heterogeneity or spots is not found, and thus high credibility can be kept.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0192">A composite oxide such as In&#x2014;Zn oxides, In&#x2014;Ga oxides, or Ga&#x2014;Zn oxides can be used as a crude material. Especially, using In&#x2014;Zn oxides or Ga&#x2014;Zn oxides is preferable so that sublimation of Zn is inhibited.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0193">Mixing of the powder is conducted by, for example, a wet-type medium agitating mill. The mill for mixing and grinding comprises, for example, a beads mill, a ball mill, a roll mill, a planetary mill, or a jet mill. If a beads mill is used, grind medium (beads) is preferably zirconia, alumina, quartz, silicon nitride, stainless, mullite, glass beads, or SiC. Its particle size is preferably 0.1 to 2 mm. Especially preferably, a solid particle of zirconia beads can be used. If the beads are mixed with medium, specific surface area of the obtained mixed powder can be increased. For example, the mixing and grinding is conducted so as to obtain 1.5 to 2.5 m<sup>2</sup>/g, preferably 1.8 to 2.3 m<sup>2</sup>/g increase in the specific surface area after the grinding rather than that of a crude mix powder, or so as to obtain 0.6 to 1 &#x3bc;m in an average median diameter of the mixture obtained after the mixing and grinding. By using thus controlled crude powder, an oxide sintered body having a high density can be obtained without any calcining step. A reducing step is also unnecessary. If the increase in the specific surface area of the crude mix powder is 1.5 m<sup>2</sup>/g or more, or the average median diameter after the grinding is 1 &#x3bc;m or less, it is preferable that sintered density is sufficiently increased. If the increase in the specific surface area of the crude mix powder is 2.5 m<sup>2</sup>/g or less, or the average median diameter after the grinding is 0.6 &#x3bc;m or more, it is preferable that contamination (amount of impurity) from a grinder during grinding is not increased.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0194">The specific surface area and the average median diameter of each powder of the above crude materials can be controlled by grinding the powder using a dry-type grinding method or a wet-type grinding method.</p>
<p id="h-0048" num="0000">(a)&#x2032; Calcining Step</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0195">A step for calcining the mixture obtained by the step (a) may be contained between the steps (a) and (b). The calcining step is a step for calcining the mixture obtained by the step (a) so as to oxidize a lower oxide or a non-oxidized moiety sufficiently. At the calcining step, the mixture obtained of a metal oxide is preferably heated at 500 to 1200&#xb0; C. for 1 to 100 hours. If the heating condition is 500&#xb0; C. or more for 1 hour or more, thermal decomposition of an indium compound, a zinc compound and a tin compound is sufficiently conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0196">A heating condition at 1200&#xb0; C. or less for 100 hours or less is also preferable, since particles rarely create a bulk.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0197">Thus heating (calcining) at 800 to 1200&#xb0; C. for 2 to 50 hours is especially preferable.</p>

<p id="p-0190" num="0198">After the above step (a) or optional step (a)&#x2032;, the obtained mixture is formed to make a desired sputtering target configuration. The forming can be conducted by a known method, for example, press forming or cold isostatic press.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0199">Press forming, Cold Press method and Hot Press method are more preferable for the forming, and press forming is especially preferable. The press forming is conducted, for example, by filling an obtained mixture in a metal mold and press forming it by a Cold Press device. The press forming is also conducted, for example, at ambient temperature (25&#xb0; C.), under 100 to 100000 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and preferably 500 to 10000 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0200">The Cold Press method and Hot Press method are explained in detail below. By the Cold Press method, the mixture obtained by the step (a) is filled in a forming die to prepare a formed body and then the body is sintered. By the Hot Press method, the mixture is directly sintered in a forming die.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0201">As for the Cold Press method of a dry-process, a crude material obtained after the step (a) is dried by a spray dryer and so on, and then formed. The forming may be conducted by methods known in the art, for example, press forming, cold isostatic press, metal molding, casting forming, or injection molding. In order to obtain a sintered body (a sputtering target) having high sintered density, the forming is preferably conducted by a method accompany with cold isostatic press (CIP). During the forming processing, a forming auxiliary agent such as polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose, polywax, or oleic acid may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0202">A filtering forming method (see Japanese published unexamined application No. 11-286002) is preferably used as the above wet-processes. This filtering forming method uses a filtering forming die comprising a water-insoluble material which is used for obtaining a formed body by vacuum-pumping water out from ceramic crude material slurry. The body comprises a lower forming die having one or more drain holes, a filter having water flowable property in which filter is placed on the lower forming die, and a forming die flame which clips the filter from the upper side through a seal material for sealing it. Each of the lower forming die, the forming die flame, the sealing material and the filter is disassemblably structured. By using the filtering forming die which vacuum-pumps water in the slurry out only from the filter side, slurry containing a mixture obtained from the step (a), ion-exchange water and an organic additive is prepared. This slurry is injected in the filtering forming die, and then a formed body is prepared by vacuum-pumping water in the slurry out only from the filter side. After the obtained ceramic formed body is dry-delipidated, the body is sintered.</p>
<p id="h-0050" num="0000">Step (c)</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0203">The obtained formed body is then sintered to prepare a sintered body. The sintering can be conducted by using a known sintering method. For example, sintering by using an electric furnace is desirable. The sintering is preferably conducted, for example, under the present of air, preferably oxygen atmosphere. Sintering is more preferably conducted under oxygen atmosphere by flowing oxygen. Sintering is further preferably conducted under a pressure. Under these conditions, zinc transpiration is inhibited, and a sintered body having no void (cavity) can be obtained. Thus obtained sintered body has high density so that fewer nodules or fewer particles are made during using it. Therefore, an oxide semi-conductor film having excellent film properties is prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0204">The sintering are conducted at 1360 to 1700&#xb0; C. of the surface temperature of a mixture powder to be sintered for 1 to 500 hours, more preferably 1440 to 1650&#xb0; C. for 1 to 100 hours, further preferably 1450 to 1600&#xb0; C. for 2 to 50 hours. If the temperature is 1360&#xb0; C. or more, a crystal of rare-earth oxide C type is sufficiently obtained, and thus sufficiently high bulk density is expected.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0205">If the temperature is 1700&#xb0; C. or less, zinc does not transpired so as to vary a composition of a sintered body, and no void (cavity) caused by the transpiration is appeared in the sintered body. If the time period for sintering is longer, composition area where the crystalline form of the present invention can be obtained is wider. Sintering is preferably conducted under the presence of oxygen. Sintering is more preferably conducted under oxygen atmosphere by flowing oxygen, or under a pressure. Under these conditions, zinc transpiration is inhibited, and a sintered body having no void (cavity) can be obtained. Thus obtained sintered body has high density so that fewer nodules or fewer particles are made during using it. Therefore, an oxide semi-conductor film having excellent film properties can be prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0206">Temperature profile at the sintering is 0.1&#xb0; C./min. or more in rate of temperature increase until 600&#xb0; C., preferably 0.5 to 10&#xb0; C./min.; 0.1&#xb0; C./min. or more in rate of temperature increase until 800&#xb0; C., preferably 0.5 to 10&#xb0; C./min.; and 0.5&#xb0; C./min. or more in rate of temperature increase until 1500&#xb0; C., preferably 1 to 10&#xb0; C./min. Rate of temperature decrease during cooling is desirably 0.1&#xb0; C./min. or more, and preferably 0.5 to 10&#xb0; C./min. If the rate of temperature increase is 1&#xb0; C./min. or more, decomposition of oxides does not progress, and no pinhole is appeared.

<p id="p-0202" num="0210">The above obtained sintered body may be ground (grinding step (f)). The above obtained sintered body is ground, for example, by a flat-surface grinding machine to make average surface roughness Ra of 5 &#x3bc;m or less, preferably 4 &#x3bc;m or less, more preferably 0.1 to 3 &#x3bc;m. Furthermore, mirror-like finishing is provided on a sputter side of a target, and then average surface roughness Ra of it is 100 nm or less, preferably 50 nm or less, more preferably 1 to 30 nm or less. The average surface roughness (Ra) means center line average roughness. This mirror-like finishing (grinding) may be conducted by known grinding techniques such as mechanical grinding, chemical grinding, mechanochemical grinding (combination of mechanical grinding and chemical grinding). For example, a fixed abrasive grain polisher (polish liquid: water) is used for polishing #2000 or more (inch base), or a free abrasive grain lap (abrasive: SiC paste, etc.) is used for lapping, and then the abrasive may be changed to a diamond paste so as to lap and obtain an end product.

Film forming method includes, for example, a sputtering method, a PLD (pulse-laser deposition) method, a vacuum deposition method and an ion-plating method. The backing plate is preferably made of oxygen free copper. The bonding preferably uses Indium solder.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0213">A cleaning processing of a target may use air blow, flowing water cleaning, etc. Eliminating foreign substances by the air brow can be efficiently conducted by vacuuming air using a dust collector from the opposite side of a nozzle.</p>

<p id="p-0208" num="0216">Relative density of the oxide of another embodiment of the present invention is, for example, 95% or more, preferably 98% or more, and more preferably 99% or more. If relative density is 95% or more, when the oxide of the present invention is used as a sputtering target, the target is less breakable, and no abnormal electric discharge is occurred, and thus it is preferable. The relative density is density relatively calculated from theoretical density obtained by weighted average. A density calculated by weighted average of the density of each crude powder is the theoretical density, which density is set as 100%. For example, the relative density was obtained from theoretical density calculated from density of a crude powder and density of a sintered body determined by Archimedes method using the following formula.

<p id="p-0210" num="0218">Bulk resistance of the oxide of another embodiment of the present invention is, for example, determined based on JISR1637. The bulk resistance is, for example, 20 m&#x3a9;cm or less, preferably 0.1 to 10 m&#x3a9;cm, and more preferably 0.3 to 5 m&#x3a9;cm. If the bulk resistance is 0.1 m&#x3a9;cm or more, no abnormal discharge between particles of a sputtering material during sputtering is caused, and thus it is preferable. If the bulk resistance is 20 m&#x3a9;cm or less, it is preferable since the target is less breakable, discharge is not unstable, and particles are not increase even when the oxide of the present invention is used as a sputtering target.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0219">In addition, it is desirable that the range of variation (uniformity) of the bulk resistance of the oxide is in 3%, and preferably in 1%. The variation (uniformity) is a value indicated by standard deviation against an average value of the bulk resistance. The bulk resistance is determined by, for example, measuring an oxide surface at around 10 to 50 of equally spaced points, by a four-point probe method using LORESTA (Mitsubishi chemical Co.).</p>

The variation means a value indicated by standard deviation against an average value. The average and standard deviation are obtained by cutting 20 or more of small pieces out of an oxide and then determining a content of each positive metal element other than zinc by an ICP, and thus the variation is determined. The variation (uniformity) can be obtained from the following formula based on the average and standard deviation.

No directional character on a polished surface is preferable so that no abnormal discharge is caused and the presence of particles can be reduced. If the surface roughness (Ra) is 0.5 &#x3bc;m or less, abnormal discharge during sputtering is inhibited, creation of dusts (particles) of a sputtering material is reduced, and thus it is preferable.

<p id="h-0059" num="0000">(f) Pinhole</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0223">The surface of the oxide of another embodiment of the present invention preferably has no pinhole. The pinhole is a void created between oxide particles during the preparation of the oxide of the present invention by sintering the oxide particles. Number of the pinhole can be evaluated by horizontal Feret diameter. When the pinhole is deemed as a particle, the horizontal Feret diameter means a distance between two parallel lines toward a certain direction in which the lines are clipping the particle. The horizontal Feret diameter can be determined by observing a SEM image having 100&#xd7; magnification ratio. The horizontal Feret diameter of the surface of the oxide of the present invention is preferably 50 pinholes/mm<sup>2 </sup>or less where the pinholes have 2 &#x3bc;m or greater Feret diameter present in an oxide per unit area (1 mm&#xd7;1 mm). 20 pinholes/mm<sup>2 </sup>or less is more preferable, and 5 pinholes/mm<sup>2 </sup>or less is further preferable.

If weight saving is required, a resin substrate or a polymer base material is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0228">Semi-Conductor Layer</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0229">A semi-conductor layer includes a composite oxide of In (indium), Zn (zinc), and Ga (gallium). Such a semi-conductor layer can be prepared, for example, by forming a thin film using a sputtering target of the present invention (composite oxide target) (a target for a semi-conductor).</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0230">In the present invention, the semi-conductor layer is preferably an amorphous film. By using such an amorphous film, its contact property to an insulation film or a protective layer has improved, and then uniform transistor property can be easily obtained even if it is large area. Whether or not the semi-conductor layer is an amorphous film can be confirmed by X-ray crystal structure analysis. If no clear peak is monitored, the semi-conductor layer is amorphous.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0231">Electric carrier concentration of the semi-conductor layer is preferably 10<sup>13 </sup>to 10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, and especially preferably 10<sup>14 </sup>to 10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. If electric carrier concentration is in the above range, the semi-conductor layer becomes readily a non-degeneration semi-conductor, and then balance between mobility and ON-OFF ratio is preferably improved when it is used as a transistor. Band gap is preferably 2.0 to 6.0 eV, and more preferably 2.8 to 5.0 eV. If the band gap is 2.0 eV or more, a field effect type transistor causes less improper operation by absorbing visible light.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0232">If the band gap is 6.0 eV or less, a field effect type transistor rarely lose its function by less supplement of carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0233">A semi-conductor layer is preferably a non-degeneration semi-conductor having thermal active property. If a non-degeneration semi-conductor is used, some disadvantages such as off-current and gate-leak current increase caused by excess of carrier, or normally-ON caused by negative threshold can be avoided. Whether or not the semi-conductor layer is a non-degeneration semi-conductor can be confirmed by measuring mobility and carrier density as a result of temperature changes using Hall effect.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0234">In order to make a semi-conductor layer being a non-degeneration semi-conductor, partial pressure for oxygen during preparing a film may be adjusted, and carrier density may be optimized by post treatment for controlling the number of oxygen defects.</p>

<p id="p-0228" num="0236">The semi-conductor layer is preferably an amorphous film maintaining at least a part of an edge-sharing structure in a bixbyite structure of indium oxide. Whether the amorphous film containing indium oxide maintains at least a part of an edge-sharing structure in a bixbyite structure of indium oxide may be confirmed by radial distribution function (RDF) obtained by Grazing Incidence X-ray Scattering (GIXS) in which a peak showing In&#x2014;X (X is In or Zn) is in 0.3 to 0.36 nm (specifically, see F.

<p id="p-0230" num="0238">If A/B is 0.7 or more, mobility is rarely reduced, and threshold or S value is rarely increased too high. Small A/B seems to reflect poor short distance orderliness in an amorphous film.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0239">Average bond distance of In&#x2014;In is preferably 0.3 to 0.322 nm, and especially preferably 0.31 to 0.32 nm. Average bond distance of In&#x2014;In can be measured by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The measurement by the X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) expanded from rising to a high energy portion such as several hundred eV higher. EXAFS is caused by backscattering of electrons by atoms surrounding excited atoms. Interference effect between releasing electron wave and backscattered wave is occurred. The interference depends on wavelength of electron state, and light path length traversing between surrounding excited atoms. Radial distribution function (RDF) is obtained by conducting Fourier transform of EXAFS. Average bond distance can be evaluated from RDF peak.</p>

<p id="p-0254" num="0267">The formed film may be subject to patterning by several etching methods, a photo-lithography method and a lift-off method.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0268">In the present invention, a semi-conductive film is preferably formed using the target of the present invention by DC or AC sputtering. By using DC or AC sputtering, damage at the film forming can be reduced in comparison with an RF sputtering. Therefore, in a case with a field effect type transistor and a thin film transistor, reduction of threshold voltage shift, enhancement of mobility, reduction of threshold voltage, reduction of S value and so on can be expected.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0269">In the present invention, heat treatment is preferably conducted at 70 to 350&#xb0; C. after film forming of a semi-conductor layer. Especially, the heat treatment is preferably conducted at 70 to 350&#xb0; C. after forming a semi-conductor layer and a protective layer of the semi-conductor layer. If the temperature is 70&#xb0; C. or more, the obtained transistor may keep its sufficient heat stability, heat resistance, and sufficient mobility, and there is no rick to become S value or threshold voltage too high. If the temperature is 350&#xb0; C. or less, a substrate having no heat resistance can be used, and facility cost for heat treatment is not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0270">Heat treating temperature is more preferably 80 to 260&#xb0; C., further preferably 90 to 180&#xb0; C., and especially preferably 100 to 150&#xb0; C. Specifically, if the heat treating temperature is 180&#xb0; C. or less, it is preferable because a resin substrate having low heat resistance such as PEN can be used as a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0271">Heat treating time is usually preferably 1 second to 24 hours, but it is also preferable that the heat treating time is controlled based on treating temperature. For example, when the temperature is from 70 to 180&#xb0; C., 10 minutes to 24 hours is more preferable, 20 minutes to 6 hours is further preferable, and 30 minutes to 3 hours is especially preferable. When the temperature is from 180 to 260&#xb0; C., 6 minutes to 4 hours is more preferable, and 15 minutes to 2 hours is further preferable. When the temperature is from 260 to 300&#xb0; C., 30 seconds to 4 hours is more preferable, and 1 minute to 2 hours is especially preferable. When the temperature is from 300 to 350&#xb0; C., 1 second to 1 hour is more preferable, and 2 seconds to 30 minutes is especially preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0272">Heat treatment is preferably conducted in an inert gas under 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>Pa or less of oxygen partial pressure, or after a semi-conductor layer is covered with a protective layer. If either of conditions is selected, reproducibility is improved.</p>
<p id="h-0063" num="0000">(10-3) Thin Film Transistor Properties</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0273">In the thin film transistor of the present invention, mobility is preferably 1 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or more, more preferably 3 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or more, and especially preferably 8 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or more. If the mobility is 1 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or more, switching rate does not become slow, and then the transistor is preferably used for big-screen, high-fineness display.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0274">ON-OFF rate is preferably 10<sup>6 </sup>or more, more preferably 10<sup>7 </sup>or more, and especially preferably 10<sup>8 </sup>or more.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0275">OFF current is preferably 2 pA or less, and more preferably 1 pA or less. If the OFF current is 2 pA or less, sufficient contrast is obtained and excellent uniformity of display is also obtained when the transistor is used for TFT of the display.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0276">Gate-leak current is preferably 1 pA or less. If the gate-leak current is 1 pA or more, excellent contrast is obtained when the transistor is used for TFT of the display.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0277">Threshold voltage is usually 0 to 10V, preferably 0 to 4V, more preferably 0 to 3V, and especially preferably 0 to 2V. If the threshold voltage is 0V or more, normally-ON is avoided, no voltage is needed during OFF, and then electric power consumption can be kept lower. If the threshold voltage is 10V or more, driving voltage can be kept lower, electric power consumption can be kept lower, and mobility can also be kept lower.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0278">S value is preferably 0.8V/dec or less, more preferably 0.3V/dec or less, further preferably 0.25V/dec or less, and especially preferably 0.2V/dec or less. If S value is 0.8V/dec or less, driving voltage does not become higher and then electric power consumption becomes lower. Especially, when the transistor is used for an organic light emitting display, because of direct current drive, if S value is 0.3V/dec or less, electric power consumption is preferably and enormously reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0279">S value (Swing Factor) is to show stepness of drain current which rises rapidly from OFF position to ON position when gate voltage is increased from Off position. As defined by the following formula, increment of gate voltage when drain current increases single digit (10 times) is S value.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>S </i>value=dVg/dlog (<i>Ids</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0280">Lower S value means higher steepness in rising (cf. Yasuhiro Ukai, &#x201c;Hakumaku-trangista gijutu no subete (All about Thin Film Transistor Technique)&#x201d;, Kogyo Chosa Kai, 2007). If the S value is low, high gate voltage is not needed at the time of switching from ON to OFF, and thus electric power consumption can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0281">Threshold voltage shift between before and after applying 10 pA of direct current voltage at 50&#xb0; C. for 100 hours is preferably 1.0V or less, and more preferably 0.5V or less. If the shift is 1.0V or less, image quality does not change if the transistor is used for a transistor of an organic light emitting display.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0282">Smaller hysteresis during gate voltage being up and down in transfer curve is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0283">Ratio of channel width W and channel length L: W/L is normally 0.1 to 100, preferably 0.5 to 20, and especially preferably 1 to 8. If W/L is 100 or less, leak current does not increase, ON-OFF ratio would be lowered. If W/L is 0.1 or more, field effect mobility is not lowered, and pinch off becomes clear. The channel length L is normally 0.1 to 1000 &#x3bc;m, preferably 1 to 100 &#x3bc;m, and more preferably 2 to 10 &#x3bc;m. If the channel length L is 0.1 &#x3bc;m or more, there is no possibility to become industrial manufacture difficult and to become leak current higher. If the channel length L is 1000 &#x3bc;m or less, an element does not become too big.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0284">The thin film transistor (field effect type transistor) of the present invention preferably has a structure for shading a semi-conductor layer. If there is a structure for shading a semi-conductor layer (e.g. a shading layer), there is no possibility to excite a carrier electron when light comes in the semi-conductor layer and then to become OFF current higher. The shading layer preferably includes a thin film having absorption between 300 nm and 800 nm. The shading layer may be located on either upper or lower portion of the semi-conductor layer, but the shading layer is preferably located on both upper and lower portions. The shading layer may also be used as a gate insulation film and a black matrix. If the shading layer is present only on one side, it is necessary to improve its structure not to radiate light to a semi-conductor layer from another side where no shading layer is present.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0285">The thin film transistor of the present invention may have a contact layer between a semi-conductor layer and a source electrode or a drain electrode. The contact layer preferably has lower resistance than that of a semi-conductor layer. Forming materials of the contact layer may include a composite oxide having similar composition to that of the above-mentioned semi-conductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0286">That is, the contact layer preferably contains each element such as In, Zn or Zr. If these elements are included, transfer of elements between the contact layer and the semi-conductor layer is not occurred, and threshold voltage shift during stress test, etc. does not become too big.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0287">There is not limitation for a preparation method of the contact layer, but a contact layer having the same composition ratio as that of the semi-conductor layer may be formed by changing film forming conditions; a layer having different composition ratio from that of the semi-conductor layer may be formed; a layer may be constructed by heightening resistance at a portion contacting with an electrode of the semi-conductor by plasma treatment or ozone treatment; or a layer having higher resistance by varying film forming conditions such as partial pressure for oxygen may be formed during forming a semi-conductor. The thin film transistor (field effect type transistor) of the present invention preferably contains an oxygen resistance layer having a resistance higher than that of the semi-conductor layer between a semi-conductor layer and a gate insulation layer, and/or between a semi-conductor layer and a protective layer. If there is an oxide resistance layer, OFF current is not detected, normally-ON caused by negative threshold can be avoided, and there is no deterioration on properties caused by changing semi-conductor's quality during post-treating step such as forming a protective film or etching.</p>

<p id="p-0364" num="0382">The specific surface area is a value determined by a BET method.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0383">The average median size is obtained from particle size distribution determined by using laser diffraction, scattering method (micro-track method).</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0384">In addition, 200 g of zirconia beads having an average diameter of 2 mm were added in the polyamide container to obtain a mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0385">This mixture was wet-mixed by using a planetary ball mill device provided by Fritz Japan for one hour. Ethanol was used as a disperse media. Each mixed powder was calcined in an alumina crucible under ambient pressure at 1000&#xb0; C. for 5 hours, then unraveled using the planetary ball mill device again for 1 hour. Thus prepared calcined powder was formed in a disc configuration having 20 mm in diameter by a uniaxial pressing (100 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>), and sintered under ambient pressure at 1500&#xb0; C. for 20 hours, and then obtained a sintered body.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0386">The sintered body was ground and analyzed by ICP, and then atom ratio of metals contained in Example A was In:Ga:Zn=33:33:34. Based on the analytical result from X-ray diffraction (XRD), crystalline type was rare-earth oxide C type (JCPDS Card No. 14-0564). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was shifted to high angle side, and thus it was confirmed that lattice constant became smaller than In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>single crystal. Therefore, it seems that either or both of Ga and Zn were subjected to solid solution substitution in a crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type of indium oxide so as to make unit cell of a crystal small.</p>

<p id="p-0373" num="0391">The sintered body was ground and analyzed by ICP, and then atom ratio of metals contained in Comparative example A was In:Ga:Zn=33:33:34. Based on the analytical result from X-ray diffraction (XRD), crystalline type was not rare-earth oxide C type, but the crystalline type was InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>(JCPDS Card No. 38-1104) which type is the same as that of the patent documents 4, 5 and 7.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0392">It should be surprised that a crystalline type of an oxide composed of complex elements which contains indium oxide in an amount of only &#x2153; of the total indicates rare-earth oxide C type derived from indium oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0393">Comparing a type of the crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type with that a conventional type based on the same composition, the type of the crystalline structure of rare-earth oxide C type has higher density and lower bulk resistance than those of the conventional type.</p>

<p id="p-0378" num="0396">An In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>powder having 15 m<sup>2</sup>/g of specific surface area, 5 &#x3bc;m of average median size, and 99.99% purity, a Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>powder having 14 m<sup>2</sup>/g of specific surface area, 5 &#x3bc;m of average median size, and 99.99% purity, and a ZnO powder having 4 m<sup>2</sup>/g of specific surface area, 2 &#x3bc;m of average median size, and 99.99% purity were compounded, and then mixed and ground until each crude powder has 1 &#x3bc;m or less of average median size. The specific surface area is a value determined by a BET method. The average median size is obtained from particle size distribution determined by using laser diffraction, scattering method (micro-track method).</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0397">Thus obtained mixture was subject to quick dry granulation by a spray dryer under 140 ml/min. of supply ratio of the mixture, 140&#xb0; C. of heated air temperature and 8 Nm<sup>3</sup>/min. of the amount of the heated air. Then the granulated substance was formed by a cold isostatic press under 25&#xb0; C. and a pressure of 3000 kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>to form a formed body.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0398">Then, under ambient pressure, the formed body was subjected to raising temperature at rate of 0.5&#xb0; C./min. until 600&#xb0; C. at the surface temperature of the formed body, while oxygen gas was introduced at a flow rate of 10 L/min., raising temperature at rate of 1&#xb0; C./min. between 600 to 800&#xb0; C., and further raising temperature at rate of 3&#xb0; C./min. between 800 to 1500&#xb0; C. Then, temperature was kept at 1500&#xb0; C. for 2 hours to obtain a sintered body.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0399">The sintered body was analyzed by ICP, and then composition ratio was In:Ga:Zn=35:20:45 by the atom ratio other than oxygen. Density of the obtained sintered body was calculated by mass and geometric size of the sintered body. Based on the result from X-ray diffraction, the sintered body was composed of a multicrystal of rare-earth oxide C type (JCPDS Card No. 14-0564). Lattice constant a is 10.05 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0400">Oxygen defect d is 1&#xd7;10<sup>3</sup>. The range of variation of the number of positive metal elements other than zinc is 3% or less. The range of variation of density in the sintered body is 3% or less. The number of pinholes having 2 &#x3bc;m or greater Feret diameter was 5 pinholes/mm<sup>2 </sup>or less. The average crystalline particle diameter determined by EPMA was 17 &#x3bc;m.</p>

<p id="p-0383" num="0401">Oxide sintered bodies were obtained by the same way as that of Example 1 except that sintering time, sintering temperature, composition, a crude material, and a granulating method were different. In addition, EPMA figure of Example 15 is also shown (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0111" num="0000">[Evaluation]</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0402">Bulk resistance, bending strength and presence or absence of crack at sintering were evaluated. The obtained results are shown in Table 6. Each evaluation was conducted by the following method.</p>
<p id="h-0112" num="0000">Relative Density</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0403">The relative density was obtained from theoretical density calculated from density of a crude powder and density of a sintered body determined by Archimedes method using the following formula.

Average Crystalline Particle Diameter
</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0404">The maximum particle diameters was determined by embedding a sintered body in a resin, polishing its surface by aluminum particles having particle size of 0.05 &#x3bc;m, and then, measuring a maximum particle diameter of crystal particles at five locations observed within 40 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;40 &#x3bc;m square frame of the sintered body surface by X-ray microanalyzer (EPMA) named JXA-8621MX (JOEL Ltd.), and then the average of them was considered as an average crystalline particle diameters.</p>
<p id="h-0113" num="0000">Bulk Resistance</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0405">Bulk resistance was determined by a resistance meter (Mitsubishi chemical Co., LORESTA) using four-point probe method (JIS R 1637), and calculated from an average value taken from 10 locations.</p>
<p id="h-0114" num="0000">Uniformity of Bulk Resistance</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0406">Uniformity of bulk resistance was determined by measuring bulk resistance at 10 locations on the identical target surface, and then obtained a ratio between maximum value and minimum value (maximum value/minimum value). Evaluation was conducted based on 4 levels, from those having excellent uniformity, up to 5: &#x229a;, up to 10: &#x25ef;, up to 20: &#x394;, and more than 20: X.</p>
<p id="h-0115" num="0000">Bending Strength (Crossbreaking Strength)</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0407">Bending strength was evaluated based on JIS R1601 by using a bending strength tester.</p>

&#x3c;Preparation of Sputtering Target&#x3e;
</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0416">A sputtering target was caved out from the sintered bodies of Examples 13 to 35 and Comparative examples 10 to 23. A side of these sintered bodies of Examples 13 to 35 and Comparative examples 10 to 23 was cut by a diamond cutter, and then the surface thereof was ground by a flat-surface grinding machine to make a target material having surface roughness Ra of 5 &#x3bc;m or less. Then, the surface was air-blew and cleaned using ultrasonic cleaning for 3 minutes by multi-oscillating 12 kinds of frequency in every 25 KHz within frequency from 25 to 300 KHz. This target material was then bonded on a backing plate made by oxygen free copper by using an indium solder so as to prepare a target. Surface roughness of the target is Ra 0.5 &#x3bc;m, and the target has a ground surface with no directional character.</p>

Specifically, a glass substrate made of alkali-free glass (Corning Inc., Corning1737) was prepared as a substrate. On this substrate, Ti having thickness of 5 nm, Au having thickness of 50 nm, and Ti having thickness of 5 nm were laminated in this order by an electron beam vapor deposition method. A gate electrode was formed from the laminated film by a photo-lithography method and a lift-off method.
