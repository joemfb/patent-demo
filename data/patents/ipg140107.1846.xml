<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a new and improved method of performing surgery, and instruments, implants, and other surgical implements that can be used in surgery. The surgery may be of any desired type. The surgery may be performed on joints in a patient's body. The surgery may be performed on any desired joint in a patient's body. Regardless of the type of surgery to be performed, a limited incision may advantageously be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some embodiments, this specification relates to limited incision partial or total knee joint replacements and revisions and is the result of a continuation of work which was previously performed in conjunction with the subject matter of U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,143. This specification also contains subject matter which relates to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,163,949; 5,269,785; 5,549,683; 5,662,710; 5,667,520; 5,961,499; 6,059,817; and 6,099,531. Although this specification refers to knee joints, it should be understood that the subject matter of this application is also applicable to joints in many different portions of a patient's body, for example a shoulder, spine, arm, hand, hip or foot of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During a total or partial knee replacement or revision, an incision is made in a knee portion of a leg of the patient to obtain access to the knee joint. The incision is relatively long to enable instrumentation, such as a femoral alignment guide, anterior resection guide, distal resection guide, femoral cutting guide, and femoral anterior, posterior and chamfer resection guide to be positioned relative to a distal end portion of the femur. In addition, the incision must be relatively large to enable a tibial resection guide to be positioned relative to the proximal end portion of the tibia.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With known procedures of total or partial knee replacement, the incision in the knee portion of the patient is made with the leg of the patient extended (straight) while the patient is lying on his or her back. At this time, the extended leg of the patient is disposed along and rests on a patient support surface. After the incision has been made in the knee portion of the leg of the patient, the leg is flexed and a foot connected with the leg moves along the patient support surface. The knee portion of the flexed leg of the patient is disposed above the patient support surface. This results in the soft tissue in the knee being compressed against the back of the knee joint. This makes it very difficult to access posterior soft tissue to remove bone spurs (ostified), meniscus, posterior capsule, ligaments in the back of the joint, and/or any residual soft tissue or connective tissue that is blocking further flexion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">After the incision has been made and while the leg is flexed with the foot above the patient support surface, the surgeon cannot view arteries, nerves and veins which are sitting just posterior to the knee capsule. Therefore, a surgeon may be very reluctant, or at least very careful, of inserting instruments into the back of the knee joint to remove tissue. This may result in osteophytes, bone spurs and similar types of posterior soft tissue being left in place.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">With known techniques, the patella is commonly everted from its normal position. When the patella is everted, the inner side of the patella is exposed and faces outward away from end portions of the femur and tibia. The outer side of the everted patella faces inward toward the end portions of the femur and the tibia. Moving the everted patella to one side of end portions of the femur and tibia tends to increase the size of the incision which must be made in the knee portion of the patient's leg.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">After implants have been positioned in the knee portion of the patient's leg, it is common to check for flexion and extension balancing of ligaments by flexing and extending the knee portion with the foot above the support surface. If the ligaments are too tight medially or laterally, they can be released to obtain the desired tension. However, the checking of ligament balance by flexing and extending the leg of the patient, ignores rotational balancing of ligaments. Since the femoral implant is movable relative to the tibial implant, the stability of the knee joint is dependent upon balancing of the ligaments in flexion, extension, and rotation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention relates to a new and improved method and apparatus for use in performing any desired type of surgery on a joint in a patient's body. The joint may advantageously be a knee joint. However, the method and apparatus may be used in association with surgery on other joints in a patient's body. There are many different features of the present invention which may used either together or separately in association with many different types of surgery. Although features of the present invention may be used with many different surgical procedures, the invention is described herein in conjunction with surgery on a joint in a patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One of the features of the present invention relates to the making of a limited incision. The limited incision may be in any desired portion of a patient's body. For example, the limited incision may be in a knee portion of a leg of a patient. The limited incision may be made while a lower portion of the leg of the patient is extending downward from the upper portion of the leg of the patient. At this time, a foot connected with the lower portion of the leg of the patient may be below a surface on which the patient is supported. The limited incision may be made while the lower portion of the leg of the patient is suspended from the upper portion of the leg or while the lower portion of the leg and/or the foot of the patient are held by a support device. After the incision has been made, any one of many surgical procedures may be undertaken.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is believed that in certain circumstances, it may be desired to have a main incision of limited length and a secondary incision of even smaller length. The secondary incision may be a portal or stab wound. A cutting tool may be moved through the secondary incision. An implant may be moved through the main incision.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Once the incision has been made, a patella in a knee portion of the patient may be offset to one side of its normal position. When the patella is offset, an inner side of the patella faces inward toward the end portions of a femur and tibia. If desired, the patella can be cut and realigned in situ, with minimal or no subluxation. Additionally, the cutting and/or realignment can be done while the knee is in flexion, which is the natural position, rather than extension.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although any one of many known surgical procedures may be undertaken through the limited incision, down sized instrumentation for use in the making of cuts in a femur and/or tibia may be moved through or part way through the incision. The down sized instrumentation may be smaller than implants to be positioned in the knee portion of the patient. The down sized instrumentation may have opposite ends which are spaced apart by a distance which is less than the distance between lateral and medial epicondyles on a femur or tibia in the leg of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is contemplated that the down sized instrumentation may have cutting tool guide surfaces of reduced length. The length of the cutting tool guide surfaces may be less than the length of a cut to be made on a bone. A cut on a bone in the patient may be completed using previously cut surfaces as a guide for the cutting tool.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is contemplated that at least some, if not all, cuts on a bone may be made using light or other electromagnetic radiation, such as infrared radiation, directed onto the bone as a guide. The light directed onto the bone may be in the form of a three dimensional image. The light directed onto the bone may be a beam along which a cutting or milling tool is moved into engagement with the bone.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">There are several different orders in which cuts may be made on bones in the knee portion of the leg of the patient. It is believed that it may be advantageous to make the patellar and tibial cuts before making the femoral cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">There are many different reasons to check ligament balancing in a knee portion of the leg of a patient. Ligament balancing may be checked while the knee portion of the leg of the patient is flexed and the foot of the patient is below the support surface on which the patient is disposed. Flexion and extension balancing of ligaments may be checked by varying the extent of flexion of the knee portion of the leg of the patient. In addition, rotational stability of the ligaments may be checked by rotating the lower portion of the leg of the patient about its central axis. Balancing of ligaments may also be checked by moving the foot of the patient sideways, rotating the lower portion of the leg of the patient, and/or moving the foot anteriorly or posteriorly.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is believed that it may be advantageous to utilize an endoscope or a similar apparatus to examine portions of the patient's body which are spaced from the incision. It is also contemplated that images of the knee portion of the patient's leg may be obtained by using any one of many known image generating devices other than an endoscope. The images may be obtained while the patient's leg is stationary or in motion. The images may be obtained to assist a surgeon in conducting any desired type of surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Balancing of the ligaments in the knee portion of a patient's leg may be facilitated by the positioning of one or more transducers between tendons, ligaments, and/or bones in the knee portion. One transducer may be positioned relative to a medial side of a knee joint. Another transducer may be positioned relative to a lateral side of the knee joint. During bending of the knee joint, the output from the transducers will vary as a function of variations in tension forces in the ligaments. This enables the tension forces in ligaments in opposite sides of the knee portion to be compared to facilitate balancing of the ligaments.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Patellar tracking may be checked by the positioning of one or more transducers between the patella and the distal end portion of the femur. If desired, one transducer may be placed between a medial portion of the patella and the distal end portion of the femur. A second transducer may be placed between a lateral portion of the patella and the distal end portion of the femur. Output signals from a transducer will vary as a function of variations in force transmitted between the patella and femur during bending of the leg.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The articular surface on the patella may be repaired. The defective original articular surface on the patella may be removed by cutting the patella while an inner side of the patella faces toward a distal end portion of a femur. The step of cutting the patella may be performed while the patella is disposed in situ and is urged toward the distal end portion of the femur by connective tissue. An implant may then be positioned on the patella.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is contemplated that the size of the incision in the knee or other portion of the patient may be minimized by conducting surgery through a cannula. The cannula may be expandable. To facilitate moving of an implant through the cannula, the implant may be formed in two or more portions. The portions of the implant may be interconnected when the portions of the implant have been positioned in the patient's body. Although the implants disclosed herein are associated with a patient's knee, it should be understood that the implants may be positioned at any desired location in a patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An implant may be positioned in a recess formed in a bone in a patient. The implant may contain biological resurfacing and/or bone growth promoting materials. The implant may contain mesenchymal cells and/or tissue inductive factors. Alternatively, the implant may be formed of one or more materials which do not enable bone to grow into the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with one of the features of the present invention, body tissue may be moved or stretched by a device which is expandable. The expandable device may be biodegradable so that it can be left in a patient's body. The expandable device may be expanded to move and/or stretch body tissue and increase a range of motion of a joint. The expandable device may be used to stretch body tissue in which an incision is to be made.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An improved drape system is provided to maintain a sterile field between a surgeon and a patient during movement of the surgeon relative to the patient. The improved drape system includes a drape which extends between the surgeon and a drape for the patient. During surgery on a knee portion of a leg of a patient, the drape system extends beneath a foot portion of the leg of a patient. It is contemplated that the drape system will be utilized during many different types of operations other than surgery on a leg of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An implant may be movable relative to both a femur and a tibia in a leg of a patient during bending of the leg. The implant may include a single member which is disposed between and engaged by end portions of both the femur and tibia. Alternatively, the implant may include a plurality of members which are disposed in engagement with each other. If desired, one of the members of the plurality of members may be secured to a bone and engaged by a member which is not secured to a bone. The implant may be secured to soft tissue in the knee portion of the patient's leg.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">There are many different features to the present invention. It is contemplated that these features may be used together or separately. It is also contemplated that the features may be utilized in association with joints in a patient's body other than a knee joint. For example, features of the present invention may be used in association with surgery on vertebral joints or glenoid joints. However, it is believed that many of the features may be advantageously utilized together during the performance of surgery on a patient's knee. However, the invention should not be limited to any particular combination of features or to surgery on any particular joint in a patient's body. It is contemplated that features of the present invention will be used in association with surgery which is not performed on a joint in a patient's body.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Known Method of Performing Surgery on a Patient's Knee</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">During the performance of surgery using known methods, a patient is supported on an operating table or other support surface <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). When a leg <b>50</b> of the patient is in the extended position illustrated in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a foot <b>54</b> connected with a lower portion <b>56</b> of the leg <b>50</b> is disposed above the support surface <b>52</b>. During an operation on a knee portion <b>58</b> of the leg <b>50</b>, the knee portion is raised and lowered relative to the support surface as the leg <b>50</b> is flexed and extended. However, the foot <b>54</b> is always disposed above the support surface <b>54</b> and may be supported by the support surface throughout the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">During this known operating procedure, an incision is made in the knee portion <b>58</b> of the leg <b>50</b> when the leg is in the extended position illustrated in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At this time, the foot <b>54</b> of the patient may rest on the support surface <b>52</b> or be disposed in a foot support located above the support surface. Once an incision has been formed in the knee portion <b>58</b>, the leg <b>50</b> may be flexed or bent to the position illustrated in solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As the knee portion <b>58</b> is bent, the leg <b>50</b> is flexed and compresses the soft tissue of the knee portion <b>58</b> against the back of the knee joint. This makes it very difficult to access the posterior of the knee portion <b>58</b> to remove bone spurs (osteophytes), the meniscus, the posterior capsule, and/or any residual soft tissue or bone that is blocking further flexion. The catching or pinching of soft tissue in the posterior aspect of the knee portion <b>58</b> may prevent further flexion and limits the range of motion. In addition, arteries, nerves and veins are sitting just posterior of the knee joint.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Due to the lack of access to the posterior of the knee portion <b>58</b>, a surgeon may be very reluctant or, at least, very careful about inserting instruments blindly into the back of the knee joint to remove tissue. This may result in osteophytes, bone spurs and similar types of posterior soft tissue being left in place.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Cuts are made on a femur and tibia with the leg <b>50</b> in the bent or flexed condition, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This results in the distal end portion of the femur and the proximal end portion of the tibia in the leg <b>50</b> being pressed together adjacent to the cuts. This interferes with ligament balancing. The relatively large incision which is necessary to accommodate known instrumentation systems increases time required for the patient to recover from the operation.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Preparation for Operation</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">It is contemplated that various features and/or combinations of features of the present invention will be utilized during surgery on different portions of a patient's body, such as a head, trunk or limbs of a patient. Although at least some of the features of the present invention are believed particularly advantageous when utilized in association with surgery on any one of the many joints in a patient's body, it is believed that the various features and/or combination of the features of the present invention are particularly advantageous when utilized in conjunction with surgery on a knee portion of a leg of a patient. It should be understood that the various features of the present invention may be use separately or in any desired combination of features.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Surgery on the knee portion of the patient may relate to any one of many different aspects of the knee portion, such as ligaments, tendons, articular surfaces, and/or total or partial knee replacements or revisions. Although the disclosure herein frequently refers to one particular type of knee operation, that is, a total knee replacement, features of the invention may be utilized with any desired type of surgery. It is believed that it will be apparent to a person having a knowledge of knee surgery how various features of the invention may be utilized with either a full or partial knee replacement. Therefore, there has been only minimal mention herein of how the features of the invention are applicable to partial knee replacements.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">When knee surgery is to be performed in accordance with one of the features of the present invention, the patient <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is disposed on a support surface <b>64</b> of an operating table <b>66</b>. If desired, a patient support surface <b>64</b> other than an operating table could be used to support the patient. A lower portion <b>68</b> of a leg <b>70</b> extends downward from an upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. A foot <b>74</b> connected with the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is disposed below the support surface <b>64</b>. The leg <b>70</b> is flexed so that a knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg is bent.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In accordance with another of the features of the present invention, the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> can be supported above the support surface <b>64</b> by a leg support <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The leg support <b>80</b> includes a stand or base section <b>82</b> which is connected with the operating table <b>66</b>. The leg support <b>80</b> includes a base <b>84</b> which is connected with an upper end portion of the stand <b>82</b>. The base <b>84</b> is engaged by and supports the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">A generally annular thigh holder <b>86</b> extends around the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient and is connected with the base <b>84</b> and stand <b>82</b>. The base <b>84</b> has a portion which extends along the posterior side of the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient. The base <b>84</b> supports the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> above and spaced from the support surface <b>64</b>. However, the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> could be disposed in engagement with the support surface <b>64</b> if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The leg support <b>80</b> supports the leg <b>70</b> of the patient with a hip <b>88</b> of the patient hyperflexed at an angle of twenty to thirty degrees throughout the operation on the knee portion <b>76</b>. The leg support <b>80</b> may have a known commercial construction or may have a construction similar to that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,373,709 or U.S. Pat. No. 6,012,456. If desired, a tourniquet may be combined with the leg support <b>80</b> in a manner similar to that provided in known leg supports or in a manner similar to that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,457,302.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In accordance with another feature of the invention, the lower portion <b>68</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the leg <b>70</b> is suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg. This enables the foot <b>74</b> and ankle portion <b>86</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient to be freely moved in any direction or a combination of directions. Thus, the foot <b>74</b> and ankle portion <b>86</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient can be moved anteriorly or upward (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to decrease the extent of flexion of the knee portion <b>72</b> or even to extend or straighten the leg <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Alternatively, the foot <b>74</b> and ankle portion <b>86</b> may be moved posteriorly toward the operating table <b>66</b>, from the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to hyperflex the knee portion <b>72</b> of the leg of a patient. The foot <b>74</b> may be moved sidewardly, that is in either a lateral or medial direction. In addition, the foot <b>74</b> may be rotated about the longitudinal central axis of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">It is contemplated that the foot <b>74</b> and ankle portion <b>86</b> may be simultaneously moved in a plurality of the directions previously mentioned. If desired, the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient may be supported on a separate section of the operating table <b>66</b>, in a manner similar to the disclosure in U.S. Pat. No. 5,007,912.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">After a drape <b>90</b> has been positioned over the patient <b>62</b> and the operating table <b>66</b>, in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the leg <b>70</b> extends out of the drape. The drape <b>90</b> may be connected with the leg support <b>80</b> and have an opening <b>92</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) through which the leg of the patient extends. This enables the leg <b>70</b> of a patient to be moved between the extended position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and a hyperflexed position in which the foot <b>74</b> is disposed posteriorly from the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">When the leg <b>70</b> is in a hyperflexed condition, the included angle between the upper and lower portions <b>72</b> and <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is less than ninety degrees. The leg <b>70</b> may be flexed from the extended position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to a hyperflexed position by manually moving the foot <b>74</b> and an ankle portion <b>96</b> of the leg <b>70</b> relative to the operating table <b>66</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) while the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg is held by the leg support <b>80</b>. When the leg <b>70</b> is hyperflexed, a portion of the foot <b>74</b> may be disposed beneath the operating table <b>66</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">An improved drapery system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) includes the drape <b>90</b> and a drape <b>102</b> connected with a gown <b>104</b> on a surgeon <b>106</b>. The illustrated drape <b>102</b> is formed separately from the drape <b>90</b> and gown <b>104</b>. However, the drape <b>102</b> may be integrally formed as one piece with the drape <b>90</b>. Alternatively, the drape <b>102</b> may be integrally formed as one piece with the gown <b>104</b>. If formed integral, drape <b>90</b>, drape <b>102</b>, and/or gown <b>104</b> can be provided with a quick release mechanism, such as serrated edges, to allow surgeon <b>106</b> to rapidly tear away. Thus, drapery system <b>100</b> allows the patient to be a sterile field directly or modularly attached to the surgeon and/or an assistant.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Regardless of whether separate or integral, drape <b>90</b> and/or drape <b>102</b> can include attachments for surgical instruments such as suction, Bovie, arthroscopic equipment, etc. Drape <b>102</b> can have a large pouch to collect all fluid, body parts, blood, etc. so they do not drain all over the floor and are collected in an easily disposable fashion. In this regard, drape <b>102</b> can include a drain, with or without active suction, to remove fluid and other debris.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Drape <b>90</b> could be adhesive drape with a Betadine adhesive or a clear plastic adhesive, either with or without antimicrobial agents impregnated, which covers the skin surrounding the operative field. Drape <b>90</b> could be a two layer drape with a larger drape below which sticks to the patient or is loosely attached to the patient and a narrower surgical field drape above for two layer draping.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the drape <b>102</b> is formed separately from the gown <b>104</b> and the drape <b>90</b>. The drape <b>102</b> is connected to the drape <b>90</b> by suitable clamps <b>108</b>. The drape <b>102</b> is connected with the waist of the surgeon <b>106</b> by clamps <b>110</b> to the gown <b>104</b>. Rather than utilizing clamps <b>108</b> to interconnect the drapes <b>90</b> and <b>102</b>, the drapes could be interconnected by VELCRO, ties, or other known devices. Of course, similar devices could be utilized to connect the drape <b>102</b> with the gown <b>104</b> of the surgeon <b>106</b>. The connection mechanism can be chosen such that, if surgeon <b>106</b> needs to change position with respect to the patient, the connection mechanism allows re-attachment of gown <b>104</b> to various locations of drape <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The improved drapery system <b>100</b> maintains a sterile field between the leg <b>70</b> and the surgeon <b>106</b> during movement of the surgeon relative to the patient <b>62</b>. Thus, when the surgeon is in a seated position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) the drapery system <b>100</b> provides a sterile field which extends from the surgeon to the space beneath and adjacent to the leg <b>70</b>. When the surgeon stands (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) the drapery system <b>100</b> continues to maintain a sterile field between the surgeon and the patient. This enables the surgeon <b>106</b> to move the leg <b>70</b> of a patient during an operation without contaminating the sterile field. The draping system <b>100</b> enables the sterile field to be maintained when the patient's leg is moved between the extended position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> and a hyperflexed position in which the foot <b>74</b> of the patient is disposed beneath the operating table <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">During movement of the surgeon <b>106</b> relative to the patient, for example, between the seated position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the standing position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the drape <b>102</b> moves with the surgeon and maintains a sterile field. Thus, when the surgeon <b>106</b> moves toward and away from the patient, the end portion of the drape <b>102</b> connected with the surgeon also moves toward and away from the patient. As the surgeon moves toward the patient, a portion of the drape <b>102</b> between the surgeon <b>106</b> and patient is lowered. As the surgeon moves away from the patient, the portion of the drape <b>102</b> between the surgeon and patient is raised. The foot <b>74</b> connected with the leg <b>70</b> of the patient is always above the drape <b>102</b> during movement of the surgeon <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Drape <b>102</b> and/or drape <b>90</b> has flexibility and could be provided with flexed sections or may have a large redundant area which would go down to the surgeon's knees or to the floor to maintain the sterile field. By typical sterile technique, anything below the waist level of the surgeon or the support surface is considered un-sterile. However, with drapery system <b>100</b>, if drape <b>102</b> happens to drop down to the floor, it creates a contiguous sterile field and therefore, the surgeon could retrieve dropped objects from the floor if it is contained within drape <b>102</b> or drape <b>90</b>. This could save a significant amount of money by eliminating the need to dispose of (or re-sterilize) fallen surgical instruments or implants.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Although the drapery system <b>100</b> has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> in association with a patient's leg <b>70</b>, the drapery system may be used in association with surgery on any desired portion of a patient's body. For example, the drapery system <b>100</b> could be used to maintain a sterile field between a surgeon and patient during surgery on a trunk portion of a patient's body. Alternatively, the drapery system <b>100</b> could be used to maintain a sterile field during surgery on a head or arm portion of a patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Drapery system <b>100</b> can use disposable drapes or can be re-sterilizable, either in its entirety or portions thereof. Additionally, known current drape technology can be incorporated into drapery system <b>100</b>. This includes the use of disposable independent drapes, &#xbe; sheet, disposable adherent drapes, U-drapes, disposable adhesive drapes, Betadine drapes, VELCRO attached drapes, snap, plastic snap drapes, single piece drapes, multi-drapes, two layer drapes, clear plastic drapes, independent or attached to drapes, one piece drapes with stretchable segment for extremities, arthroscopic drapes, shoulder drapes which incorporate U-drapes, square drapes, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In another embodiment, drapes <b>90</b>, <b>102</b> could be configured to create a mobile field. Specifically, the drapes can be made to have a surgeon's helmet attached to it and part of gown <b>104</b> attached to it so that the surgeon would literally walk into the drape system, his hands and his face would go into the drape to create a mobile surgical field attached to the patient to create even more of a sterile field. The drapery system could have laminar flow system connected to it to create sterile air coming in and then a suction coming out so it could have unidirectional airflow to further sterilize the field.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The drape system could have a tent, a cover over the top of this to create a mobile surgical field so that this could be done in emergency setting such as a military field or otherwise outdoors. Because the drape system can be provided with an attachment for flowing air in and out, maintaining extremely sterile air, the drape system could also be used for organ or tissue harvesting, such as bone harvesting under an emergency situation. The drape system could have the surgeon's gown, face mask, sterilizable hood all attached as part of it. It could be unrolled as one sterile pack adhering to the patient and rolling outward and the surgeon simply walks into the drape as does the assistant. When the procedure is complete, simply roll up the drape and throw it away, thereby maintaining all potential biohazards.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The drape could have a sterile flap where instruments could be passed through and/or a simple opening where the assistant could deliver instruments required through this field or the drape could be a flat open sheet where the assistant could bring the instruments on top of the sterile surgical field. There also may be a separate attachment for the circulating nurse.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">As previously noted, drape <b>90</b> and/or drape <b>102</b> may also include an abbreviated gown <b>104</b> simply with the arms, front portion of the gown. This abbreviated gown could be a portion of drape <b>90</b>, <b>102</b> so the draping system need not extend fully down to the floor. Rather, the abbreviated gown would have arm holes so that the surgeon can put his arms through the holes and the nurse would put gloves on him once they are sterilized. A provision can be made so that at least one person has an independently moveable surgical gown.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Incision</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In accordance with another feature of the present invention, a limited incision <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is formed in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. The incision <b>114</b> is made just medial to the patella <b>120</b>. However, the incision <b>114</b> could be disposed laterally of the patella <b>120</b>. Although the length of the incision <b>114</b> may vary depending upon the circumstances, the incision <b>114</b> will usually have a length of between about seven (7) and about thirteen (13) centimeters. However, even smaller incisions may be made when circumstances permit.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In one embodiment, the incision is made when the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg is flexed and the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg extends downward from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. At this time, the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is supported above the support surface <b>64</b> by the leg support <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">When the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is flexed so that the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg is suspended at an angle of approximately ninety degrees relative to the upper portion <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>), the incision <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) may have a length of approximately ten (10) centimeters. When the leg <b>70</b> is straightened from the flexed condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> to the extended condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the length of the incision <b>114</b> may decrease by between ten and thirty percent. Thus, in one specific instance, an incision <b>114</b> had a length of approximately eleven (11) centimeters when the leg <b>70</b> was in the flexed condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>6</b> and a length of slightly less than ten (10) centimeters when the leg was in the extended condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. By making the incision <b>114</b> with the leg in a flexed condition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>6</b>) and operating on the leg <b>70</b> with the leg in a flexed condition, the overall length of the incision can be reduced from the length of incisions which have previously been made in the leg when it is in the extended condition.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The benefits of having a smaller incision include improved cosmetic results, improved rehab, less dissection of muscle and soft tissue, and preservation of the quadriceps mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">It is preferred to have the incision <b>114</b> located adjacent to the medial edge of the patella <b>120</b>, in the manner illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. However, the incision <b>114</b> could be located adjacent to the lateral edge of the patella <b>120</b> if desired. Alternatively, the incision <b>114</b> could be disposed midway between lateral and medial edges of the patella <b>120</b>. By moving the incision <b>114</b> laterally or medially away from the midline of the knee, less stress is placed on incision <b>114</b> compared to a midline incision.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Although it is desired to minimize the length of the incision <b>114</b>, it is contemplated that the incision may have a length of approximately twice the length of the patella. It may be desired to have the incision <b>114</b> extend from a proximal end of the tibia in the leg <b>70</b> to the epicondylar notch on the distal end portion of the femur in the leg <b>70</b>. The length and location of the incision <b>114</b> may vary depending on the size of the implants to be positioned in the knee portion <b>76</b> and the location at which the implants are to be positioned. It is believed that it may be desired to have the incision <b>114</b> be smaller than the implants even though the implants must move through the incision. The visoelastic nature of the body tissue and mobility of the incision <b>114</b> enables the implants to be larger than the incision and still move through the incision.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">A straight incision <b>114</b> has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. However, the incision <b>114</b> could have a different configuration if desired. For example, the incision <b>114</b> could have an L-shaped configuration. The incision <b>114</b> could be skewed at an acute angle to a longitudinal central axis of the patella <b>120</b>. If desired, the incision <b>114</b> could have a configuration matching the configuration of either the lateral or medial edge of the patella <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Immediately after the incision <b>114</b> is formed, the leg <b>70</b> may be moved from the flexed condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> to the extended condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. While the leg <b>70</b> is in the extended condition, the incision <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is elastically expanded using suitable retractors. The incision <b>114</b> can also be expanded while the leg is in the flexed condition. The retractors apply force against the visoelastic body tissue of the knee portion <b>76</b>. The retractors have a construction similar to that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,308,349. Alternatively, a pneumatic retractor, such as is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/526,949 filed on Mar. 16, 2000 by Peter M. Bonutti may be utilized to expand the incision.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">After the incision <b>114</b> has been elastically expanded, a patella <b>120</b> and tissue on the lateral side of the incision may be everted in a manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Thus, the patella <b>120</b> is moved from the normal orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to the everted or flipped orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, preferably while the leg <b>70</b> of the patient is in the extended orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. At this time, the inner side <b>122</b> of the patella <b>120</b> is facing outward away from other bones in the knee portion <b>76</b>. The outer side of the everted patella <b>120</b> is facing inward toward other bones in the knee portion <b>76</b>. This enables the inner side <b>122</b> of the patella <b>120</b> to be examined.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In order to enable a relatively small incision <b>114</b> to be used for operating on bones in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient, the patella <b>120</b> is returned back to its normal position with the inner side <b>122</b> of the patella facing inward and the outer side of the patella facing outward. As this occurs, the opening at the incision <b>114</b> contracts. The retractors are then utilized to apply force against opposite sides of the incision <b>114</b>. As this occurs, the visoelastic body tissue is extended, the opening at the incision <b>114</b> is again expanded, and the patella <b>120</b> is pushed to the lateral side of the knee portion <b>76</b>. This moves the patella <b>120</b> to a location offset to one side of the incision <b>114</b> in a manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The leg <b>70</b> is then flexed to the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">If desired, the foregoing step of inverting the patella <b>120</b> may be omitted. The patella <b>120</b> may be left in orientations in which the inner side <b>122</b> of the patella faces inward throughout the operation. If this is done, the inner side <b>122</b> of the patella <b>120</b> may be inspected by tilting the patella from its normal orientation and/or using viewing devices, such as an endoscope. Regardless of how the inner side <b>122</b> of the patella <b>120</b> is inspected, moving the patella to the offset position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, with the inner side <b>122</b> facing inward, facilitates utilization of an incision <b>114</b> having a limited length. It is contemplated that many different surgical procedures could be conducted on the knee portion <b>76</b> with the patella <b>120</b> in the offset position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Furthermore, avoiding eversion of the patella <b>120</b> significantly reduces stress on the quadriceps/tendon complex. Applicant has found that the stress on the complex is at least 20% less compared to a procedure with eversion, thereby decreasing the risks of tearing, damage, and strain.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a retractor <b>121</b> can be used to offset patella <b>120</b> and/or maintain patella <b>120</b> in the offset position. In an exemplary embodiment, refractor <b>121</b> is approximately 2-3 mm thick. Refractor <b>121</b> also holds soft tissue away to expose the bone. Accordingly, retractor <b>121</b> can include at least one hole <b>123</b> for receiving a pin <b>125</b> to secure retractor <b>121</b> to bone or other body tissue. Alternatively, a suture or wire can be threaded through hole <b>123</b> to secure retractor <b>121</b> to tissue. In another embodiment, retractor <b>121</b> includes a sharp end to hold retractor <b>121</b> to the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Retractor <b>121</b> can be made out of any suitable material, such as metallic materials typically used for surgical instruments. If retractor <b>121</b> is made of a polymer, it is contemplated that retractor <b>121</b> could be disposable. If this is done, retractor <b>121</b> may be partially or entirely formed of relatively inexpensive polymeric materials. As previously disclosed, the disposable retractors could be sharpened at one end like a Homan. Such a disposable retractor could be made of a polymer such as polyethylene, which may be malleable to a degree. Thus, the disposable refractor could be deformed to a desired shape to expose the joint as required and possibly pin the tissue directly through the malleable portion of the retractor to hold the soft tissue out of the way while one is working on the bone. This would allow enhanced exposure through a smaller incision, visualizing it through flexion and extension.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The retractors could also be a composite with some metal and some plastic with a portion of the device, flexible, malleable and locking into bone to keep the tissue out of the way while one is working on the bone. Additionally, it is contemplated that the retractors could also be heated and malleable intraoperatively. The retractors could be made of a biodegradable material and be left in position to maintain a soft tissue sleeve or exposure so as to minimize scarring the joint. Regardless of the material, the retractors could have ribs or a roughened surface to grip the tissue. The retractors could also be coupled with a balloon retractor (discussed below).</p>

<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Expansion of the incision <b>114</b> with the retractors exposes a distal end portion <b>124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of a femur <b>126</b> in the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. The incision <b>114</b> is movable relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> to maximize exposure of the femur through the limited length of the incision. The femur <b>126</b> is then cut to receive an implant. Although either intramedullary or extramedullary instrumentation can be utilized, intramedullary instrumentation is used in an exemplary embodiment during cutting of the femur <b>126</b>. Therefore, a drill <b>128</b> is utilized to access the intramedullary canal or marrow cavity in the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The drill <b>128</b> is utilized to form a hole <b>130</b> in the center of the intercondylar notch in the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> in a known manner. The drill <b>128</b> is used to form the hole <b>130</b> while the leg <b>70</b> is in the orientation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The patella <b>120</b> is in the offset position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. At this time, the inner side <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the patella faces toward the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">An epicondylar reference guide (not shown) engages the hole in the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> to enable a line parallel to an epicondylar axis peaks of the medial and lateral condyles to be inscribed on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. At this time, the leg <b>70</b> is in the orientation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>. A shaft <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>) of a femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> is then inserted into the intermedullary opening <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> is then aligned with the epicondylar line which extends parallel to the epicondylar axis through the peaks of the lateral and medial condyles on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> is utilized to support an anterior resection guide <b>138</b> and stylus <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>) on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> in the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient. Although only the femur <b>126</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, it should be understood that the leg <b>70</b> is in the orientation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> us supported by the leg support <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In accordance with one of the features of the present invention, the instrumentation is down sized to enable the size of the incision <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) to be minimized. The downsized instrumentation has a transverse dimension which is smaller than a transverse dimension of an implant to be placed in the knee portion <b>76</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Thus, the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and anterior resection guide <b>138</b> have transverse dimensions, perpendicular to a longitudinal central axis of the femur <b>126</b>, which are smaller than transverse dimensions of a femoral implant <b>290</b>, tibial bearing insert <b>294</b>, and a tibial tray <b>286</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal central axis of the femur <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The instrumentation extends from a center portion of the femur <b>126</b> toward one side of the femur (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). In the particular operation illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-12</figref>, the incision <b>114</b> is offset to the medial side of the patella <b>120</b>. Therefore, the instrumentation is offset to the medial side of the femur <b>126</b>. However, if the incision <b>114</b> were offset to the lateral side of the patella <b>120</b>, the instrumentation would be offset to the lateral side of the femur <b>126</b>. If the incision <b>114</b> were centrally disposed relative to the femur <b>126</b>, the instrumentation would be centrally disposed relative to the femur. Thus, the instrumentation is in general alignment with the incision <b>114</b> and extends only part way across the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>) and anterior resection guide <b>138</b> have opposite ends which are spaced apart by distance which is less than a distance between epicondyles <b>148</b> and <b>150</b> on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The distance between opposite ends <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> of the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> is less than two thirds (&#x2154;) of the distance between tips <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> of the lateral and medial epicondyles <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>. Similarly, a distance between an end <b>160</b> and an opposite end <b>162</b> of the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> is less than two thirds (&#x2154;) of the distance between the tips <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> of the lateral and medial epicondyles <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The distance between opposite ends of a known femoral alignment guide and the distance between opposite ends of a known anterior resection guide are approximately the same as or greater than the distance between the tips <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> of the lateral and medial condyles <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>. The distance between opposite ends of the known femoral alignment guide and the distance between opposite ends of the known anterior resection guide are greater than the transverse dimensions of the femoral and tibial implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>). This known anterior resection guide and femoral alignment guide are commercially available from Howmedica Osteonics of 359 Veterans Boulevard, Rutherford, N.J. under the designation &#x201c;Scorpio&#x201d; (trademark) Single Axis Total Knee System.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The incision <b>114</b> must be large enough to enable the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> to pass through the incision. By reducing the size of the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and anterior resection guide <b>138</b>, the size of the incision <b>114</b> can be reduced. Of course, reducing the size of the incision <b>118</b> reduces damage to body tissue of the patient <b>62</b>. The femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> may be larger than the incision <b>114</b>. This is because the incision <b>114</b> can be resiliently stretched and/or moved relative to the femur <b>126</b> to enable the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and anterior resection guide <b>138</b> to move through the incision.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The distance between opposite ends <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> of the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> is less than the distance which a femoral implant extends across the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. Similarly, the distance between opposite ends <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> of the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> is less than the distance which the femoral implant extends across the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> both extend medially from a center portion of the femur <b>126</b>. However, if the incision <b>114</b> were offset laterally of the patella <b>120</b>, the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> would extend laterally from the center portion of the femur <b>126</b>. Similarly, if the incision <b>114</b> was centered relative to the patella <b>120</b>, the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and anterior resection guide <b>138</b> would be centered relative to the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">If leg <b>70</b> is positioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, positioning of the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and anterior resection guide <b>138</b> on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> is facilitated by distracting the knee joint under the influence of the weight of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the patient's leg and the foot <b>74</b>. Thus, when the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and anterior resection guide <b>138</b> are positioned on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>, the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> can be suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg. At this time, the foot <b>74</b> is below the level of the support surface <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) on which the patient is disposed in a supine orientation. The upper portion <b>72</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> is supported above the support surface <b>64</b> by the leg support <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">By distracting the knee joint under the influence of the weight of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg of the patient, the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> is exposed through the relatively small incision <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Exposure of the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> at the limited incision <b>114</b> is promoted by moving the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> and the incision relative to the femur. In addition, exposure of the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> is promoted by having the patella <b>120</b> offset to the lateral side of its normal position. The inner side <b>122</b> of the patella <b>120</b> faces inward toward the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> so that the skin on the knee portion <b>76</b> is not excessively stretched by everting the patella.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In accordance with another feature of the present invention, the instrumentation is at least partially positioned between the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and body tissue of the knee portion <b>76</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). To enable the size of the incision <b>114</b> to be minimized, the instrumentation is moved laterally of the incision so that a portion of the instrumentation moves between the knee capsule and the end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. This results in a portion of the instrumentation being exposed at the incision <b>114</b> and a laterally extending portion of the instrumentation being concealed by body tissue. For example, the end <b>154</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and/or the end <b>160</b> of the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> are overlaid by body tissue adjacent to the lateral edge portion of the incision <b>114</b>. The body tissue which overlies portions of the instrumentation may include skin, the knee capsule, and connective and soft tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">With prior art instrumentation, the soft tissue must be completely dissected so that the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> is fully exposed. In contrast, the instrumentation of the present invention can be at least partially positioned between the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and body tissue of the knee portion <b>76</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). As discussed in more detail below, the soft tissue can be lifted or otherwise retracted. This minimizes the need for dissection.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">When the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and anterior resection guide <b>138</b> are connected with the femur <b>126</b>, central axis of the femoral alignment guide and anterior resection guide are medially offset from the central axis of the femur. Thus, the central axis of the femur <b>216</b> extends through a lateral portion, that is, left portion as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, of the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b>. The anterior resection guide <b>138</b> is almost entirely offset to the right (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the central axis of the femur <b>126</b>. The incision <b>114</b> is disposed along a medial edge, that is, a right edge as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, of the patella <b>120</b> when the patella is in its normal or initial position.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">By having both the incision <b>114</b> and the instrumentation medially offset relative to the femur <b>126</b>, the central portion of the instrumentation is exposed at the incision. Thus, the medial edge of the incision overlaps the medial end <b>156</b> of the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and the medial end <b>162</b> of the anterior resection guide <b>138</b>. Similarly, the lateral edge of the incision <b>114</b> overlaps the lateral end <b>154</b> of the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and the lateral end <b>160</b> of the anterior resection guide <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In view of the foregoing, it can be seen that the leg <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the patient <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is maintained in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> with the foot <b>74</b> of the patient below the support surface <b>64</b> upon which the patient is supported in a supine position during forming of the incision <b>114</b> in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. The upper portion <b>72</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> is supported above the support surface <b>64</b> by the leg support <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In addition, the leg of the patient is maintained in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> during connection of the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and anterior resection guide <b>138</b> with the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Once the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and anterior resection guide <b>138</b> have been mounted on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>, an anterior cut is made in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. During the anterior cut, a blade <b>170</b> of a saw <b>172</b> is utilized to make a cut across anterior portions of the lateral and medial condyles. The saw blade <b>170</b> is moved along guide surface <b>178</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>) on the anterior resection guide <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The guide surface <b>178</b> extends only part way across of the end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref>). The guide surface <b>178</b> does not extend across the lateral portion of the end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. This at least partially results from the fact that the incision <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is offset in a medial direction from the center of the knee portion <b>76</b>. The incision <b>114</b> extends along the medial edge portion of the patella <b>120</b> when the patella is in its normal, that is, initial, position. In addition, the large majority of the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> extends medially from the central axis of the shaft <b>132</b> of the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). By having the anterior resection guide disposed in an overlying relationship with the medial portion of the end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref>), the size of the incision <b>114</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">When anterior portions of the lateral and medial condyles <b>148</b> and <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>) on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> are to be cut with the saw <b>172</b>, the blade <b>170</b> is pivoted sideways (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) so that the cutting end of the blade has an arcuate component of movement. The cutting end of the blade <b>170</b> will move along a straight path during part of the movement of the blade along the guide surface <b>178</b>. However, when the blade <b>170</b> reaches the ends of the guide surface <b>178</b>, the saw <b>172</b> is pivoted to pivot the blade and move the cutting end of the blade along a path having an arcuate configuration. This results in a generally fan shaped cut which extends only part way across the anterior side of the lateral and medial condyles on the end portion <b>124</b> of the femur.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The saw blade may have teeth along opposite longitudinally extending edges. The saw blade <b>170</b> and saw <b>172</b> are of the oscillating type. However, a reciprocating type saw and blade may be utilized if desired. Additionally and as later described, a milling device and associated guides can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Due to the limited length of the anterior resection guide <b>138</b>, the saw blade <b>170</b> is moved along the guide surface <b>178</b> to only partially complete the anterior skim cut on the end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The guide surface <b>178</b> is offset to the medial side of the central axis of femur <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Therefore, the saw blade can only partially form the lateral portion of the anterior skim cut while the saw blade engages the guide surface <b>178</b>. The anterior resection guide <b>138</b> can then disconnected from the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>) and the anterior femur cut is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">During completion of the anterior femur (skim) cut, previously cut surfaces on the end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> can be used to guide the saw blade <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). Thus, an initial portion of the anterior skim cut is made on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> while the saw blade <b>170</b> is moved along one or more guide surfaces on the anterior resection guide <b>138</b>. After the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> has been disconnected from the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b>, the saw blade <b>170</b> is positioned in engagement with the cut surfaces on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. This is accomplished by inserting the saw blade <b>170</b> into a slot or saw kerf formed in the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur during the initial portion of the anterior skim cut.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The saw blade <b>170</b> is then moved along the previously cut surfaces on the distal end portion of the femur <b>126</b> to guide the saw blade during completion of the anterior skim cut.

Although the illustrated saw blade <b>170</b> has teeth <b>180</b> at only one end, the saw blade could also have teeth along opposite longitudinally extending edges.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">By utilizing the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> to guide movement of the saw blade <b>170</b> during only an initial portion of forming the anterior skim cut on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>, the overall length of the anterior resection guide, that is, the distance between the ends <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the anterior resection guide can be limited to a distance which is less than the distance between the epicondyles <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>.

By limiting the length of the anterior resection guide <b>138</b>, the size of the incision <b>114</b> can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">It is contemplated that the initial portion of the anterior skim cut could be made with a first cutting tool and the anterior skim cut completed with a second cutting tool. The initial portion of the anterior skim cut may be made with relatively small oscillating saw blade. The final portion of the anterior skim cut may be made with a larger reciprocating saw blade. Alternatively, a small milling cutter could be used to make the initial portion of the anterior skim cut. The final portion of the skim cut could be made with a relatively long milling cutter or saw blade. It may be desired to make the initial portion of the anterior skim cut with a chisel and to complete the anterior skim cut with either a saw blade or a milling cutter.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The illustrated anterior resection guide <b>138</b> has a slot which forms the guide surface <b>178</b>. This results in the saw blade <b>170</b> being captured so that the saw blade is restrained against both up and down movement (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) relative to the anterior resection guide <b>138</b>. However, in order to reduce the size of the anterior resection guide <b>138</b>, the slot could be eliminated and the saw blade <b>170</b> moved along a flat outer side of the anterior resection guide.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">During making of the anterior skim cut, with and without the anterior resection guide <b>138</b>, body tissue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) overlies at least portions of the lateral and medial condyles being cut. This is due to the relatively short extent of the incision <b>114</b>. Thus, the saw blade <b>170</b> and the portion of the femur <b>126</b> being cut by the saw blade are both at least partially enclosed by body tissue overlying the femur during making of the anterior skim cut. During making of the anterior skim cut, the incision <b>114</b> is moved relative to the femur <b>126</b> to provide clearance for the saw blade.</p>

<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Throughout the making of the anterior skim cut and the formation of the flat anterior cut surface <b>182</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>) on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>, the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> can be suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This results in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> being distracted by the combined weight of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg and the foot <b>74</b>. At this time, the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> dangles from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg. If desired, a holder could be provided to engage either the foot <b>74</b> and/or the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> to maintain the foot <b>74</b> and lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg in a desired position relative to the support surface <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Once the anterior skim cut has been completed, a distal resection guide <b>186</b> is positioned relative to the flat anterior skim cut surface <b>182</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). To position the distal resection guide <b>186</b> relative to the cut surface <b>182</b>, a resection guide stand <b>190</b> is mounted on the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The distal resection guide <b>186</b> is connected with the resection guide stand <b>190</b> by rotating a locking knob <b>192</b>. The distal resection guide <b>186</b> and resection guide stand <b>190</b> may be magnetized to assure correct assembly. Since the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> is medially offset relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>, the distal resection guide <b>186</b> is also medially offset relative to the distal end portion of the femur.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">When the distal resection guide <b>186</b> is to be connected with the resection guide stand <b>190</b>, the distal resection guide is moved between the anterior skim cut surface <b>182</b> and body tissue overlying the anterior skim cut surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Thus, due to the limited extent of the incision <b>114</b>, skin and other body tissues are disposed over the anterior skim cut surface <b>182</b>. The distal resection guide <b>186</b> slides between the anterior skim cut surface <b>182</b> and the body tissue overlying the anterior skim cut surface. A lower (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>) major side of the distal resection guide <b>186</b> engages the anterior skim cut surface <b>182</b>. The opposite or upper (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>) major side of the distal resection guide <b>186</b> is engaged by the body tissue overlying the anterior skim cut surface <b>182</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). The surgeon moves the incision <b>114</b> and/or the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> relative to the distal end portion of the femur <b>126</b> to facilitate movement of the distal resection guide <b>186</b> onto the anterior skim cut surface <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Once the distal resection guide <b>186</b> has been positioned in the desired location on the flat anterior cut surface <b>182</b>, the distal resection guide <b>186</b> is secured in place with pins <b>196</b> and <b>198</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). At this time, body tissue overlies the portion of the distal resection guide <b>186</b> spaced from the distal end of the femur. The distal resection guide <b>186</b> is medially offset from a central portion of the femur <b>126</b> and is aligned with the incision <b>114</b>. The incision <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) is moved relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>216</b> to enable the pins <b>196</b> and <b>198</b> to be forced into the distal end portion of the femur.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and resection guide stand <b>190</b> are then separated from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>). As this is done, the resection guide stand <b>190</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) is separated from the distal resection guide <b>186</b>. Separation of the resection guide stand <b>190</b> from the distal resection guide <b>186</b> is accomplished by rotating the knob <b>192</b> and moving the resection guide stand <b>190</b> upward (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) to disconnect the guide stand <b>190</b> from the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b>. The intramedullary rod <b>132</b> and femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> are then removed from the femur <b>126</b>. The distance between opposite ends <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> of the distal resection guide <b>186</b> is less than two thirds (&#x2154;) of the distance between tips <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the lateral and medial epicondyles <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The distal resection guide <b>186</b>, like the anterior resection guide <b>138</b>, is down sized to enable the distal resection guide to move into the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> through a relatively small incision <b>114</b>. To enable the distal resection guide <b>186</b> to move into the incision through a relatively small incision <b>114</b>, opposite ends <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) of the distal resection guide <b>186</b> are spaced apart by a distance which is less than the distance between the lateral and medial epicondyles <b>148</b> and <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The distance between opposite ends <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> of the distal resection guide <b>186</b> is less than the distance which a femoral implant extends across the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The distal resection guide <b>186</b> is offset medially relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>.

This results in the central portion of the guide surface <b>202</b> being exposed through the incision <b>114</b>. The lateral and medial edges of the incision <b>114</b> overlap opposite ends <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> of the distal resection guide <b>186</b>. The incision <b>114</b> also overlaps the anterior side, that is, the upper side as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, of the distal resection guide.

<p id="p-0213" num="0212">During making of the distal femoral cut, the saw blade <b>170</b> moves along the guide surface <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) on the distal resection guide <b>186</b>. The guide surface <b>202</b> on the down sized distal resection guide <b>186</b> has a length which is less than a transverse dimension of a cut to be made in the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The saw <b>172</b> may be pivoted, in a manner illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, adjacent to opposite ends of the guide surface <b>202</b>. This moves the cutting end of the saw blade <b>170</b> along an arcuate path to form a generally fan shaped distal femoral cut. The saw <b>172</b> may be either a reciprocating or oscillating saw.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Due to the reduced size of the distal resection guide <b>186</b>, the saw blade <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>) is ineffective to complete the distal femoral cut while the saw blade is in engagement with the guide surface <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>). Therefore, after an initial portion of the distal cut has been made by moving the saw blade <b>170</b> along the guide surface <b>202</b>, the distal resection guide <b>186</b> is disconnected from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the distal femoral cut is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">During completion of the distal femoral cut, surfaces formed during the initial portion of the distal femoral cut are effective to guide the saw blade <b>170</b>. The saw blade <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>) is moved into the saw kerf or slot formed during the initial portion of the distal femoral cut. As the saw blade <b>170</b> extends the initial portion of the distal femoral cut, the saw blade slides along cut surfaces formed during the initial portion of the distal femoral cut. Thus, cut surfaces formed during movement of the saw blade <b>170</b> along the guide surface <b>202</b> are utilized to guide movement of the saw blade during completion of the distal femoral cut.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">The initial portion of the distal femoral cut may be made with a first cutting tool and the final portion of the distal femoral cut may be made with a second cutting. For example, the initial portion of the distal femoral cut may be made with a relatively small oscillating saw blade which can be readily inserted through the incision <b>114</b> into engagement with the distal resection guide <b>186</b>. The final portion of the distal femoral cut may be made with a larger saw blade which may be of the reciprocating type. It is contemplated that the initial and/or final portion of the distal femoral cut may be made with a milling cutter. It is also contemplated that a chisel may be used to make the initial and/or final portion of the distal femoral cut.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">When the distal femoral cut is completed, a flat distal end surface <b>209</b> extends across the distal end of the femur <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).

<p id="p-0219" num="0218">A femoral cutting guide <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>) is then positioned on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and utilized to make femoral anterior, posterior and chamfer cuts in a known manner. The femoral cutting guide <b>210</b> is connected with the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> by two pins (not shown) in a known manner.

Therefore, the femoral cutting guide <b>210</b> is separated from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the cuts are completed while guiding movement of the saw blade <b>170</b> or other cutting tool with cut surfaces formed during the making of the initial portions of the femoral anterior, posterior and chamfer cuts. When the femoral anterior, posterior and chamfer cuts are completed, the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> will have the known configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The femoral cutting guide <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>) may have the same construction as a femoral cutting guide which is commercially available from Howmedica Osteonics of 359 Veterans Boulevard, Rutherford, N.J. The femoral cutting guide may have the construction disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,282,803 or 5,749,876.

<p id="p-0237" num="0236">It is contemplated that different cutting tools may be utilized to make the initial and final portions of the proximal tibial cut. Thus, the saw blade <b>170</b> used to make the initial portion of the tibial cut may be a relatively small oscillating blade and the saw blade used to make the final portion of the tibial cut may be a relatively long reciprocating blade. Alternatively, the initial and/or final portion of the tibial cut may be made with a milling cutter. If desired, a chisel could be utilized to make the initial portion of the tibial cut. The incision <b>114</b> may be expanded with suitable retractors during making of the tibial cut. The retractors may have any desired construction, including the construction disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,308,349. Ligaments and other body tissue adjacent to the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> may be shielded with suitable surgical instruments during making of the tibial cut.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Upon completion of the proximal tibial cut on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>, a flat proximal tibia cut surface <b>246</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) is exposed on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> through the incision <b>114</b>. The flat cut surface <b>246</b> has a maximum width, as measured along an axis extending parallel to an axis extending through central axes of the collateral ligaments, which is greater than the distance between opposite ends <b>228</b> and <b>230</b> of the tibial resection guide <b>218</b>. The distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> is also exposed through the incision <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">In order to increase exposure of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> at the incision <b>218</b>, the foot <b>74</b> and lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>) can be moved posteriorly toward the operating table <b>66</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to hyperflex the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> during the making of the proximal tibial cut. When the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is hyperflexed, the ankle <b>86</b> is moved from a position either extending through or anterior of a vertical plane extending perpendicular to a longitudinal central axis of the upper portion <b>72</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> to a position disposed posteriorly of the vertical plane. Thus, as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 24</figref>, the ankle <b>86</b> is moved toward the left. As this occurs, an angle between a longitudinal central axis of the upper portion <b>72</b> of the patient's leg and the longitudinal central axis of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the patient's leg is decreased to an angle of less than ninety degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Hyperflexing the patient's leg <b>70</b> moves the proximal end portion <b>212</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>) of the tibia <b>214</b> anteriorly away from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. At this time, the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg is distracted under the influence of the weight of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the patient's leg and the foot <b>74</b> connected with the lower portion of the patient's leg. If desired, a force pulling the lower portion of the patient's leg downward (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may be applied to the patient's leg to further increase the distraction of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg and the extent of exposure of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">By hyperflexing the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> and applying a downward (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) force against the lower portion <b>68</b> of the patient's leg, the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> is delivered anteriorly that is, toward the surgeon <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>). Application of a downward force against the lower portion <b>68</b> of the patient's leg is effective to open the space between the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> and the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> to the maximum extent permitted by the tendons and ligaments, that is, fibrous connective tissue, interconnecting the femur and tibia.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">This enables the posterior cruciate ligament <b>250</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>) to be checked. In addition, access is provided to the posterior side of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. The surgeon <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>) can manually feel the posterior portion of the knee joint. There is sufficient space between the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> to enable the surgeon <b>106</b> to visually and tactilely check the posterior of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Access to the posterior portion of the knee enables osteophytes, bone spurs and similar types of posterior soft tissue to be removed. This enables tissue which could block further flexion of the knee portion <b>76</b> to be removed. In addition, it is possible to check the collateral ligaments and other fibrous connective tissue associated with the knee.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">At this time, the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>) is suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg. Therefore, the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> hangs from the upper portion <b>72</b>. The foot <b>74</b> may be supported on the surgeon's knee <b>252</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>) or other surface. The foot <b>74</b> is free to move in any direction relative to the knee portion <b>76</b>. By raising or lowering his or her knee <b>252</b>, the surgeon <b>106</b> can move the tibia <b>214</b> relative to the femur <b>126</b> and vary the space between the distal end of the femur and the proximal end of the tibia.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">By varying force indicated by arrows <b>256</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>), the vertical extent of space between the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> and the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>) can be either increased or decreased. The force <b>256</b> is varied by raising and lowering the surgeon's knee <b>252</b>. Increasing the space between the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> and the distal end portion <b>124</b> the femur <b>126</b> maximizes access to the posterior of the knee portion <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">By moving the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> upward, the ligaments and other connective tissue between the tibia <b>214</b> and femur <b>126</b> are relaxed. This enables the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> to be rotated about its longitudinal central axis, in a manner indicated by arrows <b>258</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. Rotational movement of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> about its central axis enables the surgeon to check the collateral ligaments and the resistance encountered to rotation of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg relative to the upper portion <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">In addition, the foot <b>74</b> can be pivoted in a clockwise direction (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>) about the knee portion <b>76</b>, in the manner indicated by arrow <b>259</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, to increase the extent of flexion of the knee portion <b>76</b>. Alternatively, the foot <b>74</b> can be pivoted in a counterclockwise direction about the knee portion <b>76</b> to decrease the extent of flexion of the leg <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">The lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> can also be moved sidewise, in the manner indicated by the arrow <b>260</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. When the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is moved in the manner indicated by the arrow <b>260</b>, the lower portion of the leg is moved along a path extending through lateral and medial surfaces of the foot <b>74</b> and the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. This enables the ligaments and other fibrous connective tissue in the leg to be checked for a range of movement. Although the incision <b>114</b> has not been shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, it should be understood that the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> can be moved in the directions indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> when the knee portion <b>76</b> is in the condition illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">The illustrated instrumentation can be formed of a metal which enables the instrumentation to be sterilized and reused. For example, the instrumentation could be formed of stainless steel. However, known metal instruments are relatively heavy and bulky. This substantially increases transportation expense.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">It is contemplated that it may be desired to use the instrumentation once and then dispose of the instrumentation. If this is done, the instrumentation may be partially or entirely formed of relatively inexpensive polymeric materials. Thus, the femoral resection guide <b>134</b>, anterior resection guide <b>138</b>, distal resection guide <b>186</b>, femoral cutting guide <b>210</b>, and/or tibial resection guide <b>218</b> could be formed of inexpensive polymeric materials. If this was done, the guides could be used once and disposed of without being sterilized. In addition, the polymeric guides would weigh substantially less than metal guides.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Implants</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">After the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> has been prepared and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> is prepared to receive implants (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>) and prior to insertion of the implants, any necessary work on the patella <b>120</b> may be undertaken. During work on the patella, the leg <b>70</b> of the patient may be extended and the patella <b>120</b> may be everted or flipped to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The inner side or articular surface <b>122</b> of the patella <b>120</b> faces outward and is exposed. Known surgical techniques are then utilized to cut the patella <b>120</b> and position an implant on the patella in a known manner. This may be accomplished utilizing any one of many known devices and procedures, such as the devices and procedures disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,565,192; 5,520,692; 5,667,512; 5,716,360; and/or 6,159,246. If desired any necessary work on the patella <b>120</b> may be undertaken after the femoral and tibial implants have been installed.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">As an alternative to the above-described procedure in which patella <b>120</b> is everted or flipped to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, patella <b>120</b> can be resurfaced or otherwise worked upon while maintained in a substantially non-everted, anatomic position. U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,314 B1, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, discloses instrumentation and methods for in situ resurfacing of a patella.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Additionally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,163,949 and progeny, such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,358,266 B1, 6,277,136 B1, and 6,187,023 B1, discloses various embodiments of retractors and method of dissecting tissue. These embodiments include fluid operated retractors, mechanical retractors, and combinations thereof. The retractors and methods disclosed in this line of patents, which is incorporated herein by reference, can be used for patella procedures and/or visualization while the patella is maintained in a substantially non-everted, anatomic position.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Once the femoral and tibial cuts have been made and the patella repaired, femoral and tibial implants are installed in the knee portion of the leg <b>70</b>. Prior to permanently mounting of the implants in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b>, trials are conducted, in a known manner, with provisional femoral and tibial implants. The provisional femoral and tibial implants are releasably positioned relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. As discussed in more detail below, the provisional implants (and/or instrumentation) can be made disposable and can be combined with the cutting guides or other instrumentation so that separate, dedicated provisional implants are not required.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">The provisional implants are intended to aid the surgeon <b>106</b> in assessment of the function and balance of the various ligaments. The trials enable the surgeon <b>106</b> to observe the relationship of the provisional femoral and tibial implants relative to each other during flexion and extension of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. In one embodiment, the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) during the trials with the provisional implants. Therefore, the lower portion of the leg <b>68</b> can be freely moved relative to the upper portion of the leg to check ligament balancing with the provisional implants. Since the lower portion of the leg <b>68</b> is suspended, it is possible to check for flexion and extension balancing of the ligaments and to check for rotational stability and rotational balancing of the ligaments during the trials with provisional implants. The lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> can be moved with a combination of flexion or extension, rotation and sidewise movement.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">The trials also enable the surgeon to check the manner in which the provisional implants interact with each other during flexion, extension, rotation, and sidewise movement. The manner in which the provisional femoral and tibial implants move relative to each other during combined bending and rotational movement of a patient's leg <b>70</b> enables a surgeon to check for the occurrence of excessive space or other undesirable situations between the provisional implants. During trials with provisional implants, the range of motion of the knee joint can be checked in both flexion/extension and rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Utilizing known surgical techniques, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to check for both flexion/extension balancing, rotational balancing, and sidewise balancing during trials with provisional implants. With rotational balancing, the ligaments are balanced through multiple planes. When both flexion/extension and rotation are being checked, the surgeon can locate defects and improve the stability of the knee joint. The surgeon can assess the posterior cruciate ligament, collateral ligament balancing, and posterior capsule balancing. The surgeon can proceed with flexion/extension balancing of ligaments and rotational balancing of the ligaments. This enables the leg <b>70</b> to be examined throughout its range of motion during trials with provisional implants.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">During an operation on the patient's leg <b>70</b>, the surgeon can apply upward force against the foot of the patient by resting the foot <b>74</b> on the surgeon's knee <b>252</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>) and raising the knee of the surgeon. Of course, when the foot <b>74</b> is to be lowered, the surgeon can lower the knee <b>252</b> upon which the foot <b>74</b> of the patient is resting. Alternatively, a pneumatic piston can be utilized to raise and lower the foot <b>74</b> of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Throughout the operation on the patient's knee <b>76</b>, the upper portion <b>72</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> is supported above the support surface <b>64</b> by the leg support <b>80</b>. This causes the hip of the patient to be hyperflexed by between 20 degrees and 40 degrees. Flexing of the hip by 20 degrees to 40 degrees improves rotational positioning and alignment. It also enhances the ability of the surgeon to hyperflex the knee portion <b>76</b> or to extend the knee portion during surgery. In addition, having the upper portion <b>72</b> of the patient's leg supported above the support surface <b>64</b> by the leg support <b>80</b> improves suspension of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg. It is believed that the combination of suspending the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> and having the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg supported above the support surface <b>64</b> by the leg support <b>80</b> will enhance the ability of a surgeon to check ligament balancing in flexion/extension, and rotation during trials during which provisional femoral and tibial components are temporarily connected with the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and with the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">During a portion of the trials, the patella <b>120</b> may be in the normal position relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. Therefore, during trials, it is possible to check tracking of the patella relative to the provisional femoral implant. This is done in order to prevent any possible interference of the patella <b>120</b> with the movement of the knee through its range of motion.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">To install the trial femoral and tibial components, the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> is prepared to receive the trial tibial implant. This is accomplished by positioning a tibial trial base plate <b>270</b> on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). An alignment handle <b>272</b> is connected with the tibial trial base plate <b>270</b> to facilitate positioning of the tibial trial base plate relative to the proximal end portion <b>214</b> of the tibia.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">The trial femoral implant (not shown) is then placed on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur. This may be done in a known manner using a femoral impactor/extractor. A trial tibial bearing insert (not shown) is then mounted on the tibial trial base plate <b>270</b> in a known manner. Once this has been done, the trial provisional implants are used during conducting of trials with flexion/extension and rotational movements of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the patient's leg. When the trials are completed, the trial provisional implants are removed in a known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">After completion of the trials, the tibial trial base plate <b>270</b> is pinned to the proximal end portion <b>214</b> of the tibia. A tibial punch <b>274</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) is positioned in a tibial punch tower (not shown) which is assembled onto the tibial trial base plate <b>270</b>. The tibial punch <b>274</b> is advanced relative to the tibial punch tower by impacting a mallet against the tibial punch. The foot <b>74</b> rests against the knee <b>252</b> of the surgeon during pounding of the tibial punch <b>274</b> into the tibia <b>214</b>. This results in the impaction forces being transmitted to the surgeon's knee <b>252</b> rather than to ligaments interconnecting the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Once the tibial punch <b>274</b> has been advanced until it is fully seated on the base plate, the punch is removed. The tibial trial base plate <b>270</b> is then removed from the proximal end portion <b>214</b> of the tibia. Once the tibial trial base plate <b>270</b> has been removed, an opening <b>282</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) formed in the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> is exposed. The opening <b>282</b> has a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the tibial punch <b>274</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">A tibial tray <b>286</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) forms a base portion of a tibial implant. The tibial tray <b>286</b> has a keel <b>288</b> with a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the tibial punch <b>274</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) and the opening <b>282</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) formed in the tibia <b>214</b>. The keel <b>288</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) of the tibial tray <b>286</b> is covered with a suitable cement prior to being inserted into the opening <b>282</b>. If desired, the cement may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">A tibial component impactor/extractor may be used to insert the tibial tray <b>286</b> into the opening <b>282</b>. Once the tibial tray <b>286</b> has been mounted on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>) of the tibia <b>214</b>, a femoral component <b>290</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) is mounted on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. A known femoral impactor/extractor may be used to position the femoral component <b>290</b> on the distal end portion of the femur. The femoral component <b>290</b> may be provided with or without an intramedullary stem. Cement may or may not be used in association with the femoral component <b>290</b>. Once the femoral component <b>290</b> has been mounted on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>, a tibial bearing insert <b>294</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref>) is positioned in the tibial tray.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">The femoral and tibial implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b>, and <b>294</b> may have any one of many known constructions. For example, the femoral and tibial implants could have the construction of a knee replacement which is commercially available from Howmedica Osteonics of 359 Veterans Boulevard, Rutherford, N.J. under the designation of &#x201c;Scorpio&#x201d; (trademark) total knee. Rather than being a total replacement, the femoral and tibial implants could be for a partial knee replacement. Thus, the femoral and tibial implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> could have a construction which is the same as is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,143. The femoral and tibial implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> may be of either the cemented type or the cementless types.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Once the femoral component <b>290</b> has been positioned on the femur <b>126</b> and the tibial tray <b>286</b> and bearing insert <b>294</b> positioned on the tibia <b>214</b>, ligament balancing is again conducted. The ligament balancing includes a check of stability of the joint in flexion, extension, and rotation. The ligament balancing check is performed with the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg. The upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is held above the support surface <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) by the leg support <b>80</b> during the ligament balancing.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Since the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b>, in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>25</b>, the surgeon has a more natural feel of the true ligamentous structure. This is because tissues are not squashed or bunched in the back of the knee portion <b>76</b>. Since the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg, the joint <b>76</b> is distracted without having the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg jammed back against the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg. With the leg suspended, a surgeon can view the tibial bearing insert <b>294</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) and the femoral component <b>290</b> to determine how the femoral and the tibial implants cooperate with each other and the ligaments, tendons, joint capsule and other tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">The knee portion <b>76</b> may be flexed and extended, by moving the lower portion of the leg <b>70</b> along the path indicated by arrow <b>259</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. In addition, the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> may be moved sideways, that is, laterally and/or medially, as indicated by arrow <b>260</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, to check for the occurrence of slight openings between the tibial bearing insert <b>294</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) and femoral component <b>290</b>. The lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg can also be rotated about its longitudinal central axis, in the manner indicated by the arrow <b>258</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. By simultaneously applying a combination of rotational, sideward, and flexion or extension motion to the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b>, the surgeon can view the interaction between the tibial bearing insert <b>294</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) and femoral component <b>290</b> through the entire range of movement of the leg <b>70</b>, including movement having rotational components.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">By manually feeling resistance to flexion, rotational and/or sideward movement of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>), the surgeon can check the balancing of ligaments and other tissues in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg. In addition, the surgeon can check the manner in which relative movement occurs between the tibial bearing insert <b>294</b> and femoral component <b>290</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>). If a check of the rotational alignment of the femoral and tibial implants indicates that they are misaligned, the surgeon can change the rotational positions of the implants. If the ligaments are too tight medially or laterally, the surgeon can release the ligaments to the extent necessary. Ligaments which are too loose can be tightened. Since the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is suspended, the surgeon can feel the effects of any ligamentous imbalance and take corrective action.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">In contrast to the present invention, the majority of knee arthroplasties are done with the leg in a fixed position. Surgeons do not flex and extend through progressive intervals. As the above discussion illustrates, one aspect of the present invention involves controlling the position of the joint so that when the surgeon wants to work on the quadriceps mechanism the knee is in full extension. Similarly, when the surgeon wants to work on the tibia then he may be in more flexion, more toward 90-100&#xb0;. The controlled positioning can be done in a leg alignment jig which allows reproducible holding positions that can be adjusted as desired. As previously noted, this can be achieved with electric motor, pneumatics, mechanical, or simple ratchets built on to a table, but allow precise positioning of the leg while surgeon goes from flexion to extension. There are existing leg holders, but these are very crude. Most surgeons simply use a sandbag and hold the leg in one position. This position is not precisely controlled, and therefore, somewhat variable. The soft tissue sleeve and relaxation is critical as one goes from flexion to extension, is more relaxed depending on which portion of the joint you want to expose, varying from flexion to extension. Certainly, quadriceps mechanism is the most relaxed in full extension, tighter against the femur in flexion. The tibia exposure may be improved in flexion, but controlling the specific amount of flexion/extension, locking this into position while the cuts are being performed sequentially and precisely is of significant value.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">A portion of the foregoing check of ligamentous balancing may be performed with the patella <b>120</b> offset to one side of the incision <b>114</b>, in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. This enables the surgeon to have a clear view of the tibial bearing insert <b>294</b> and femoral component <b>290</b> through the open incision <b>114</b>. After conducting a complete check of the ligamentous balancing with the patella <b>120</b> offset to one side of its natural position, the patella can be moved back to its natural position.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">When the patella <b>120</b> is moved back to its natural position, the incision <b>114</b> closes so that there is little or no exposure of the tibial bearing insert <b>294</b> and femoral component <b>290</b> to the view of the surgeon. However, the surgeon <b>106</b> can move the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> with flexion/extension motion, indicated by the arrow <b>259</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, and/or rotational motion, indicated by the arrows <b>258</b>, or sideways motion indicated by arrows <b>260</b>. During this motion of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b>, the surgeon can check the manner in which the patella <b>120</b> interacts with the tibial and femoral implants and other tissues in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg. By providing combinations of the foregoing rotational and flexion/extension motion of the lower portion of the leg <b>70</b>, the manner in which the patella <b>120</b>, with or without an implant thereon, tracks relative to the tibial and femoral implants can be readily checked.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">In the foregoing description, the patella <b>120</b> was repaired after making the femoral and tibial cuts and before trials. However, it is contemplated that the patella <b>120</b> may be repaired after trials and after installation of the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b>. Of course, the patella <b>120</b> may not need to be repaired and will be maintained in its original condition.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">It is contemplated that fluid operated devices may be utilized to release ligaments or other tissue. The fluid operated devices may be utilized to apply force to tissue to move tissue relative to a bone, to expand the tissue, or to lengthen the tissue. For example, a balloon or bladder may be placed between tissue at the posterior of the knee portion <b>76</b> prior to mounting of the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b>. The balloon may be inflated with gas or the bladder filled with liquid to move tissue relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and relative to the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. The balloon or bladder may be used to move tissue before or after making of the femoral and/or tibial cuts. The balloon or bladder may be used to move tissue before or after the trial implants are positioned in the knee portion <b>76</b>. The balloon or bladder may be used to move tissue before or after the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> are positioned in the knee portion <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">The balloon or bladder may be formed of biodegradable or non-biodegradable material. If the balloon or bladder is formed of biodegradable material, it may be left in the knee portion during and after closing of the incision <b>114</b>. Of course, the biodegradable balloon or bladder will eventually be absorbed by the patient's body. In this regard, a narcotic or other medicament may be incorporated in the material in the balloon or the fluid used to expand the balloon. This provides a gradual time release of the medicament as the balloon degrades. Regardless of whether the device is biodegradable, capsular tightening and capsular tissue can be expanded or stretched. In the device is left in postoperatively, the balloon or bladder provides for hemostasis and maintenance of the soft tissue sleeve to improve flexion/extension.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">It is contemplated that fluid operated retractors, expanders, and/or dissectors may be used to retract, expand or dissect body tissue. For example, retractors having a construction similar to any one of the constructions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,197,971 may be utilized to release tissue at locations spaced from the incision <b>114</b>. When tissue is to be released at locations where there is limited accessibility from the incision <b>114</b>, a device similar to any one of the devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,295,994 may be utilized. It is believed that devices similar to those disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/526,949 filed Mar. 16, 2000 may be used in ways similar to those disclosed therein to move and/or release body tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">While the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg and while the upper portion of the leg is held above the support surface <b>64</b> by the leg support <b>80</b>, the incision <b>114</b> in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is closed. Prior to closing of the incision <b>114</b>, the incision is thoroughly drained. Tissues in the knee portion <b>78</b> are then interconnected using a suture or other suitable devices. The soft tissues are closed in a normal layered fashion.</p>

<p id="p-0280" num="0279">With the exception of the procedure on the patella <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), all of the foregoing procedures may be performed with the leg <b>70</b> of the patient in the orientation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>25</b>. Thus, with the exception of procedures on the patella <b>120</b>, all of the foregoing procedures may be conducted with the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">The incision <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) was made in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> with the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg suspended. Similarly, the incision <b>114</b> in the knee portion of the leg <b>70</b> was closed with the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg suspended from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg. Thus, from the making of the incision <b>114</b> in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> through the closing of the incision, the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg is almost continuously extended downward from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg and the foot <b>74</b> was below the support surface <b>64</b>. In addition, the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg was supported above the support surface <b>64</b> by the leg support <b>80</b>. Only during everting of the patella <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and resecting of the patella to receive an implant was the leg <b>70</b> of the patient in an extended or straightened orientation. However, the leg <b>70</b> of the patient could be extended or straightened at any time the surgeon desires during the foregoing procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">Throughout the entire procedure, the drapery system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) maintained a sterile field between the surgeon <b>106</b> and the patient. As the surgeon moved between seated and standing positions and moved toward or away from the patient, the drape <b>102</b> would rise or fall. Thus, when the surgeon <b>106</b> moves from the seated position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to the standing position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the drape <b>102</b> tends to rise upward with the surgeon. Similarly, when the surgeon moves from the standing position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> back to the seated position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the drape <b>102</b> tends to move downward. The drape <b>102</b> will tend to move upward as the surgeon moves away from the leg <b>70</b> of the patient and will tend to move downward as the surgeon moves toward the leg <b>70</b> of the patient. Although it is preferred to use the drapery system <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> and the various other embodiments described in connection with these figures, it is contemplated that a different drapery system could be utilized if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">It is believed that it will be particularly advantageous to utilize down sized instrumentation in performing the foregoing procedures on the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient. The femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-15</figref>), anterior resection guide <b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>), resection guide stand <b>190</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), distal resection guide <b>186</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref>), and tibial resection guide <b>218</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) all have sizes which are two thirds (&#x2154;) of their normal sizes or smaller. However, the various down sized instrumentation components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-21</figref> can be utilized in their normal manner and have generally known constructions. Thus, the instrumentation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-21</figref>, with the exception of being down sized, is generally similar to known instrumentation which is commercially available from Howmedica Osteonics Corp. of Rutherford, N.J. under the trademark &#x201c;Scorpio&#x201d; single access total knee system.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">As was previously mentioned, it is contemplated that extramedullary and/or intramedullary instrumentation could be utilized if desired. Although it is believed that it may be preferred to use instrumentation which is anteriorly based, it is contemplated that posteriorly based instrumentation systems could be used if desired. Additionally and as described below, lateral or medial based instrumentation could be used if desired. The present invention also envisions combinations of these various instrumentations.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">In the foregoing description, the saw <b>172</b> and blade <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) were utilized to make cuts in various bones in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient. The saw <b>172</b> and blade <b>170</b> may be of either the oscillating or reciprocating type. However, it is contemplated that other known cutting instruments could be utilized. For example, a milling device could be utilized to form at least some of the cuts. Alternatively, a laser or ultrasonic cutter could be utilized in making some of the cuts. It is believed that it may be particularly advantageous to utilize a laser or ultrasonic cutter to initiate the formation of a cut and then to utilize a saw or other device to complete the cut.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">It is contemplated that either extramedullary or intramedullary instrumentation having a construction which is different than the illustrated construction could be utilized. For example, the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> has a guide surface <b>178</b> which is formed by a slot through which the saw blade extends. If desired, the guide surface <b>178</b> could be provided on an end face without providing for capturing or holding of the saw blade <b>170</b> in a slot.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">The instrumentation may be entirely or partially formed of light weight polymeric materials which are relatively inexpensive. A femoral cutting guide <b>210</b> has a size which corresponds to the size of the specific femoral component <b>290</b> which is to be installed on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of a femur <b>126</b>. An inexpensive femoral cutting guide <b>210</b>, formed of polymeric material, may be packaged along with a femoral component <b>290</b> of the same size. After the femoral component <b>290</b> is installed, the femoral cutting guide <b>210</b> may be discarded. This would minimize investment in instrumentation and would tend to reduce the cost of handling and/or sterilizing cutting guides. The result would be a reduction in cost to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">It is contemplated that the use of guide members, corresponding to the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the distal resection guide <b>186</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, and the tibial resection guide <b>218</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> could be eliminated if desired. If this was done, positioning of a saw blade or other cutting device could be provided in a different manner. For example, light forming a three dimensional image, such as a hologram, could be projected onto the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The three dimensional image would have lines which would be visible on the surface of the end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The saw cut would be formed along these lines. Alternatively, robot type devices having computer controls could be utilized to form the cuts without using guide members.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">It is contemplated that emitters, receivers, and/or reflectors of computer navigation systems could be pinned or otherwise attached onto the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> to provide cutting positions and to facilitate ligament balancing through relatively small incisions. The computer navigation system may utilize three or four separate registers which have optical feedback to a central unit. The computer navigation system may utilize electromagnetic or photo-optical feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">It is contemplated that various known structures could be utilized in association with the leg <b>70</b> of the patient during performing of one or more of the procedures described herein. For example, the apparatus disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,143 could be connected with the leg <b>70</b> of the patient and used to control flexion and extension of the leg. Since the apparatus disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,143 includes separate femoral and tibial sections, it is believed that this apparatus may be particularly well adapted for use with the leg of the patient in the orientation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>25</b>. This apparatus does not interfere with distraction of the knee portion <b>76</b> and can accommodate flexion and extension of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The foregoing description has primarily referred to a full knee replacement. However, it is contemplated that the apparatus and procedures disclosed herein may be utilized in association with a revision or partial knee replacement. For example, the method and apparatus disclosed herein could be utilized in association with a unicompartmental knee replacement of the type disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,143. The method and apparatus disclosed herein could be utilized in association with a revision of a previously installed full or partial knee replacement. It is also contemplated that the procedures disclosed herein and apparatus similar to the apparatus disclosed herein may be utilized with many different types of joints. For example, the procedures and apparatus may be utilized in association with a joint in an arm, shoulder, spine or hip of a patient.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Support Assembly</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">In accordance with one of the features of the invention, a support assembly <b>330</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>) is provided for the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient. Rather than support the foot <b>74</b> of the patient on the knee <b>252</b> of the surgeon (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>), as previously described herein, the support assembly <b>330</b> may be utilized. The support assembly <b>330</b> includes a flat surface <b>332</b> which engages the foot of the patient. A pneumatically actuated piston and cylinder assembly <b>334</b> is operable to raise and lower the foot <b>74</b> of the patient in the manner indicated schematically by an arrow <b>336</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. Mechanisms other than pneumatics, such as a motor, could be used to control piston and cylinder assembly <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">When the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is to be distracted, the piston and cylinder assembly is operated to lower the surface <b>332</b> and foot <b>74</b> of the patient. As this occurs, the weight transferred from the foot <b>74</b> of the patient to the support surface decreases until the support surface <b>332</b> is below and spaced from the foot <b>74</b>. Similarly, when the extent of distraction of the knee portion <b>76</b> is to be decreased, the piston and cylinder assembly <b>334</b> is operated to raise the support surface <b>332</b> and foot <b>74</b> of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">By providing a flat support surface <b>332</b>, the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg of the patient may be rotated about its longitudinal central axis relative to the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg of the patient when the support assembly <b>330</b> is being utilized to at least partially support the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg of the patient. However, it is contemplated that a foot holder could be provided in place of the flat surface <b>332</b>. The foot holder would have the advantage of being able to hold the foot <b>74</b> of the patient in a desired orientation relative to the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient. The foot holder could be constructed so as to have a pneumatically (or other) actuated drive to rotate the foot <b>74</b> about the longitudinal central axis of the leg <b>70</b> and/or lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">The support surface <b>332</b> is raised and lowered by operation of the piston and cylinder assembly <b>334</b>. Therefore, operation of the piston and cylinder assembly <b>334</b> is effective to move the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient in the directions of the arrow <b>256</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. It is contemplated that a drive assembly could be connected with the support surface <b>332</b> to rotate the support surfaces about a vertical axis. The drive assembly may include a rack and pinion drive arrangement or a worm and wheel drive arrangement. By rotating the support surface <b>332</b> about a vertical axis relative to the piston and cylinder assembly <b>334</b>, movement of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> in the directions of the arrow <b>258</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> would be facilitated.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Percutaneous Instrumentation Mounting</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">In accordance with another feature of the invention, it is contemplated that the size of the incision <b>114</b> may be reduced by connecting one or more of the guide members with one or more bones through the skin of the patient. For example, the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>), distal resection guide <b>186</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), femoral cutting guide <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>), and/or tibial resection guide <b>218</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) could be mounted on the outside of the leg <b>70</b> and connected with bone in either the upper portion <b>72</b> or the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient. This would minimize or even eliminate the necessity of moving the guide through the incision <b>114</b> into engagement with the bone. It would also minimize or even eliminate the necessity of sizing the incision <b>114</b> so as to accommodate the guide.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">For example, the distal resection guide <b>186</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref>) is illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> as being mounted outside of the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient. The distal resection guide <b>186</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> as being disposed in engagement with an outer surface of skin <b>342</b> which encloses the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The distal resection guide <b>186</b> is mounted directly outward of the flat anterior cut surface <b>182</b> formed on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The skin <b>342</b> and other body tissue extends between the distal resection guide <b>186</b> and the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">The distal resection guide <b>186</b> is connected with the femur <b>126</b> by the pins <b>196</b> and <b>198</b>. The pins <b>196</b> and <b>198</b> extend through the distal resection guide <b>186</b> and the skin <b>342</b> into the femur <b>126</b>. The pins <b>196</b> and <b>198</b> extend through the flat anterior cut surface <b>182</b> into the femur <b>126</b> and hold the distal resection guide <b>186</b> against movement relative to the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Although a distal resection guide <b>186</b> has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, it is contemplated that an anterior resection guide, corresponding to the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> could be mounted in a similar manner. If this were done, the anterior resection guide <b>138</b> would have a generally L-shaped configuration with a body portion which would extend along the outer surface of the skin <b>342</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>). Pins, corresponding to the pins <b>196</b> and <b>198</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, would extend through the relatively long body portion of the generally L-shaped anterior resection guide <b>138</b>, through the skin <b>342</b> and into the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">The short leg of the L-shaped anterior resection guide <b>138</b> would be positioned adjacent to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The short leg of the anterior resection guide would have a guide surface aligned with the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> at a location corresponding to the location where the flat anterior cut surface <b>182</b> is to be formed. This guide surface could be of the slot or capture type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Alternatively, the guide surface could be formed on a flat end face of the anterior resection guide. This would result in elimination of the slot commonly utilized to capture a saw blade or other cutting instrument. By having a portion of the anterior resection guide disposed outside of the incision <b>114</b> and connected with the femur <b>126</b> through the skin <b>342</b>, the size of the incision <b>114</b> tends to be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">In addition to the aforementioned guides associated with the femur <b>126</b>, it is contemplated that a guide associated with the tibia <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) could be connected with the tibia by pins extending through the skin <b>342</b>. For example, the tibial resection guide <b>218</b> could be placed in abutting engagement with skin which overlies the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. Suitable pins would extend through the tibial resection guide <b>218</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) and through the skin <b>342</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>) into engagement with the distal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia. Although it may be preferred to provide a tibial guide surface <b>242</b> of the slot type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, it is contemplated that only a single guide surface could be provided on a flat end portion of the tibial resection guide if desired.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Inspection</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">It is contemplated that at various times during the performance of the foregoing procedures, it may be desired to inspect locations remote from the incision <b>114</b>. Thus, it may be desired to visually ascertain the condition of soft tissue in the posterior of the knee portion <b>76</b>. In addition, it may be desired to visually check the condition of the collateral ligaments or soft tissue adjacent to the ligaments. The inspections may be conducted before or after the making of femoral and tibial cuts, before or after trials, and/or before or after installation of the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">In accordance with another feature of the invention, locations remote from the limited incision may be visually inspected. To inspect locations remote from the incision <b>114</b>, a leading end portion <b>350</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>) of an endoscope <b>352</b> can be inserted through the incision <b>114</b> and moved to the posterior of the knee portion <b>76</b>. Alternatively, the leading end portion <b>350</b> of the endoscope <b>352</b> can be inserted through a smaller stab wound incision. A camera <b>354</b> transmits an image to a monitor <b>356</b>. The surgeon <b>106</b> can then view images of the posterior of the knee portion <b>76</b> transmitted through the endoscope <b>352</b>. The upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> is supported by the leg support <b>80</b>. The leg <b>70</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> in the same position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">In order to provide the surgeon <b>106</b> with information as to how the femoral and tibial implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> interact with tissues in the knee portion <b>76</b>, the leg <b>70</b> of the patient may be bent between the flexed condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> and the extended condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. In addition, the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> may be rotated about its longitudinal central axis, in the manner indicated by the arrow <b>258</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. During bending of the knee portion <b>76</b>, the surgeon views images of the posterior knee portion transmitted through the endoscope <b>352</b> to the monitor <b>356</b>. This enables the surgeon to detect any present or potential interference of tissue in the knee portion <b>76</b> with the full range of motion of the knee portion. During relative movement between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, the surgeon can view the manner in which the femoral and tibial implants interact with each other and the tissue in the joint capsule.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">It is contemplated that the end portion <b>350</b> of the endoscope <b>352</b> will be moved so as to enable the surgeon <b>106</b> to view the collateral ligaments, particularly the ligament on the lateral side of the knee portion <b>76</b>, during bending of the knee portion. Although the endoscope <b>352</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref> as being utilized after the femoral and tibial implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> have been connected with the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, it is contemplated that the endiscope will be utilized prior to cutting of the femur and tibia, after cutting of the femur and tibia and prior to trials, after trials, and/or during trials.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">It is contemplated that the endoscope <b>352</b> may be inserted into the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient at a location other than through the incision <b>114</b>. Thus, if desired, a separate, very small portal or puncture type incision could be formed in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg of the patient at a location adjacent to a location where it is desired to visually inspect the knee portion of the patient. Although it is believed that it will be desired to inspect the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient while there is relative movement between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, it should be understood that the endoscope <b>352</b> could be utilized to inspect the knee portion <b>76</b> while the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> are stationary relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Although an endoscope <b>352</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>, it is contemplated that other known devices could be utilized to inspect knee portion <b>76</b>. Thus any desired fiber optic type instruments may be utilized to inspect the knee portion <b>76</b>. For example any of the known instruments associated with arthroscopic surgery could be utilized to inspect the knee portion <b>76</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0308" num="0307">In accordance with another feature of the invention, during performance of surgery on a knee portion <b>76</b> of a patient's leg <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>), a known C-arm fluoroscope <b>360</b> or other imaging system is utilized to generate images of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> during movement of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg relative to the upper portion of the leg. Images are transmitted in any fashion from the C-arm fluoroscope <b>360</b> to a control unit <b>362</b>. Video images are transmitted from the control unit <b>362</b> to a video screen <b>364</b> which is viewable by the surgeon <b>106</b> during surgery on the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. A continuous display of images is projected in rapid succession on the screen illustrating the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> when the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg is in various positions relative to the upper portion of the leg.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">Thus, during flexion and/or extension of the leg <b>70</b>, video images are transmitted to the screen <b>364</b> to enable a surgeon to view images of the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> during bending of the knee portion. The video display of images may be undertaken prior to forming of the incision <b>114</b> to enable the surgeon to view the manner in which components of the knee portion <b>76</b> interact prior to surgery. After the incision <b>114</b> has been made, the images provided on the video screen <b>364</b> enable the surgeon to visually determine the relationship between the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> after the patella <b>120</b> has been moved to an offset position and prior to initiating any cuts on the bones in the patient's leg <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">After cuts have been made on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> in the manner previously explained, the lower portion <b>68</b> of the patient's leg can be moved relative to the upper portion <b>72</b> of the patient's leg. The images provided on the video screen <b>364</b> will enable a surgeon to better understand the relationship between the femur, tibia, and ligaments in the patient's leg during preliminary checking of ligament balancing after the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> has been cut and after the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> has been cut.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">During trials when trial tibial and femoral components have been temporarily connected with the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, the images provided at the video screen <b>364</b> will enable the surgeon to better evaluate the interaction between the trial components and body tissue in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>. Once the trials have been completed and the femoral and tibial implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> positioned on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, the images provided at the video screen <b>364</b> will enable the surgeon to evaluate the relationship between the femoral and tibial implants.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">During ligamentous balancing, images provided at the video screen <b>364</b> will indicate to the surgeon whether or not there is any undesired relative movement between the femoral and tibial implants. It is contemplated that the images be transmitted from the control unit <b>362</b> to the video screen <b>364</b> during movement of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> in any one or a combination of the directions indicated by the arrows <b>256</b>, <b>258</b>, <b>259</b> and <b>260</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. Once the surgeon, with the assistance of images provided at the video screen <b>364</b>, is satisfied that the femoral and tibial implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> have been correctly positioned in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>, the incision <b>114</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">The general construction and mode of operation of the C-arm fluoroscope <b>360</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>) and control unit <b>362</b> is the same as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,099,859; 5,772,594; 6,118,845 and/or 6,198,794. However, it is contemplated that other known image generating devices could be utilized in place of the fluoroscope if desired. For example, an image generating device similar to a magnetic resonance imaging unit (MRI) could be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">In accordance with still another feature of the invention, a robot <b>370</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>) is provided to perform cutting and/or implant placement operations on the knee portion <b>76</b> in the leg <b>70</b> of a patient. The robot <b>370</b> includes a base <b>372</b>. A support column <b>374</b> is moveable vertically relative to the base <b>372</b>, in a manner indicated by arrows <b>376</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. In addition, the support column <b>374</b> is rotatable about coincident longitudinal central axes of the base <b>372</b> and support column in a manner indicated schematically by arrows <b>378</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. A main arm <b>382</b> is pivotally attached to an upper end portion of the support column <b>374</b>. Motors and controls <b>386</b> are connected with the main arm <b>382</b>. The main arm is pivotal relative to the support column <b>374</b> in the manner indicated by arrows <b>388</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">A secondary arm <b>390</b> is pivotally mounted on an outer end portion of the main arm <b>382</b>. The secondary arm <b>390</b> is pivotal relative to the main arm <b>382</b> in the manner indicated by arrows <b>392</b>. A mounting section <b>396</b> is rotatable about a longitudinal central axis of the secondary arm <b>390</b> and has a mounting flange <b>397</b> which is rotatable about an axis which extends perpendicular to the longitudinal central axis of the secondary arm <b>390</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">It is contemplated that a cutting tool C, such as the saw <b>172</b>, may be mounted on the mounting section <b>396</b>. Controls for the robot <b>370</b> effect movement of the saw relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> to form the anterior cut surface <b>182</b> on the femur and to form a distal end cut on the femur. In addition, the robot <b>370</b> moves the saw to form chamfer cuts on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">The robot <b>370</b> may also be utilized to move the saw to make the cuts to form the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. Thus, the robot may be utilized to form the proximal tibial cut surface <b>246</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">By using the robot <b>370</b> to move the saw to form the cuts on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>, the need for instrumentation, such as the femoral alignment guide <b>134</b> and anterior resection guide <b>138</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the distal resection guide <b>186</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 18</figref>, and the tibial resection guide <b>218</b>, is eliminated. Controls for the robot <b>370</b> are connected with the C-arm fluoroscope <b>360</b> to enable the position of the saw relative to the femur and tibia to be viewed by the surgeon during an operation.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">The robot <b>370</b> may have any one of many different constructions. Specifically, it is contemplated that the robot <b>370</b> may have the same construction as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,154,717. Alternatively, the robot <b>370</b> could have the construction disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/789,621 filed Feb. 21, 2001 by Peter M. Bonutti. However, it should be understood that other known robots could be utilized if desired. For example, a robot similar to the known &#x201c;Robo Doc&#x201d;&#x2122; could be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">It is contemplated that a computer navigation system may be used with the robot <b>370</b> to guide movement of the cutting tool C, such as a saw or milling cutter, relative to the tibia and femur in the leg <b>70</b> of the patient. Two or more locating devices <b>399</b> are connected with the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. In addition, two or more locating devices <b>399</b> are connected to the proximal end portion of the tibia <b>214</b>. The locating devices <b>399</b> cooperate with motors and computer controls <b>386</b> for the robot <b>370</b> to provide the robot with information as to the position of the mounting section <b>396</b> and cutting tool C relative to the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">The locating devices <b>399</b> may be of the reflective or energy emitting type or energy receiving type. For example, three reflectors may be pinned onto the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. Similarly, three reflectors may be pinned onto the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. Light transmitted from the robot <b>370</b> to the reflectors on the femur and tibia is reflected back to photo cells <b>401</b> on the robot to enable the robot to determine the positions of the femur and tibia. Rather than using reflectors, energy emitting devices may be pinned onto the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. The energy emitting devices may emit either light or radio waves.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">The above-described image guided surgery system is merely intended to be representative of the type of system that can be used with the present invention. However, it should be understood that other known image guided surgery systems, both in conjunction and independent of robotic systems, could be utilized if desired. Examples of commercially available systems include systems the Z-KAT (Hollywood, Fla.) suites, the MEDIVISION system (Oberdorf, Switzerland), the STEALTH NAVIGATOR system (Louisville, Colo.), and the ORTHOPILOT System (Tuttlingen, Germany).</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">It should also be understood that the robot <b>370</b> could have any one of many different constructions. It is also contemplated that the robot <b>370</b> could interact with a surgeon and patient in many different ways. For example, the robot could have a plurality of articulate arms which are controlled by the surgeon. Images provided by the fluoroscope <b>360</b> would enable the surgeon to control the articulate arms. Locating devices connected with the femur and tibia are visible to the surgeon in images provided by the fluoroscope <b>360</b>. Computer controls which respond to the locating devices provide information to the surgeon about cutting tools and/or other instruments being moved by the articulate arms. The surgeon operated controls, the articulate arms, and the fluoroscope or other imaging device may cooperate in the manner disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,063,095 and 6,102,850 if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">It is believed that it may be desired to use a hologram to provide a three-dimensional optical image of cuts to be made. The three-dimensional image would be projected onto the end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and/or onto the end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. The three-dimensional image may be lines indicating where the femur <b>126</b> and/or tibia <b>214</b> are to be cut.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">The three dimensional image would allow a surgeon <b>106</b> to visually monitor operation of the robot <b>370</b> during the making of cuts. If there was even a small discrepancy, the surgeon <b>106</b> could interrupt operation of the robot and take corrective action. It is believed that the projecting of a three-dimensional image onto surfaces to be cut will be particularly advantageous when a robotic system which has surgeon operated articulate arms is utilized. The projection of a hologram generated three-dimensional image would enable a surgeon to visually determine whether or not a robotic system, similar to the system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,095 or 6,102,850, is being operated properly.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Patellar Resection</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">In the foregoing description, the patella <b>120</b> was everted or flipped from its normal position to a position in which an inner side <b>122</b> of the patella faces outward (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The patella <b>120</b> was then cut while it was in the everted position. A patellar implant was then mounted on the patella <b>120</b> in a known manner. The patella <b>120</b> was then returned to its normal position with the inner side of the patella facing inward toward the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. This is a well known manner of performing surgery on a patella to install a patellar implant.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">In accordance with one of the features of the present invention and as discussed above, it is contemplated that the patella <b>120</b> will be cut and an implant positioned on the patella while the patella remains in a substantially normal position relative to the femur <b>126</b>. When the patella <b>120</b> is in its normal position relative to the femur <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>), an inner side <b>122</b> of the patella <b>120</b> is disposed adjacent to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The patella <b>120</b> is urged toward the trochlear groove <b>452</b> in the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> by the patellar tendon <b>456</b> and the patellar ligament <b>458</b>. The patellar tendon <b>456</b> connects the patella <b>120</b> with the quadriceps femoris muscle. The patellar ligament <b>458</b> connects the patella <b>120</b> with the tibia <b>214</b>.

A relatively thin layer on which the inner side <b>122</b> of the patella is disposed, is then removed from the patella <b>120</b>. A patellar prosthesis or implant is then mounted on the cut surface on the inside of the patella while the patella remains in its normal position. A suitable cement can be utilized to connect the implant with the patella.

<p id="p-0334" num="0333">The external tibial alignment guide <b>504</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>) includes a hollow distal shaft <b>508</b>.

When the proximal shaft <b>510</b> has been extended for a desired distance from the distal shaft <b>508</b>, a vertical adjustment knob <b>514</b> is tightened to hold the proximal shaft <b>510</b> against movement relative to the distal shaft <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">The foot or lower end portion of the hollow distal shaft <b>508</b> is connected with the mid-point between the palpable medial and lateral malleoli by a spring clamp <b>518</b>.

<p id="p-0339" num="0338">In accordance with a feature of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>, the external tibial alignment guide <b>504</b> is maintained in position on the tibia <b>214</b> during cutting of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> in a manner similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Maintaining the tibial alignment guide <b>504</b> in place during cutting of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>, enables the tibial alignment guide to be utilized to position the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> relative to the tibia <b>214</b>. This enables the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> to be connected to the tibia <b>214</b> by only the single pin <b>524</b>. In the past, a plurality of pins have been utilized to connect the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> with the tibia <b>214</b> in a manner similar to the disclosures in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,234,433 and 5,643,272. It should be understood that the tibial alignment guide <b>504</b> and a tibial resection guide, similar to the tibial resection guide <b>500</b>, may be utilized during performance of a partial knee replacement in the manner disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,234,433.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">Since, the external tibial alignment guide <b>504</b> is maintained in position during cutting of the tibia, the saw blade <b>170</b> or other cutting tool must be angled around the proximal shaft <b>510</b> of the external tibial alignment guide <b>504</b> as the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> is cut. During movement of the saw blade <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 21</figref>) along the guide surface <b>530</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>), only an initial portion of the cut in the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia is made. This is because the proximal shaft <b>510</b> of the external tibial alignment guide <b>504</b> partially blocks the saw blade <b>170</b>. In addition, the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> is down sized.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">Opposite ends <b>534</b> and <b>536</b> of the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> are space apart by a distance less than two thirds (&#x2154;) of the distance between tips of lateral and medial epicondyles <b>236</b> and <b>238</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>) on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. Therefore, after an initial portion of the cut across the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> has been made while moving the saw blade <b>170</b> along the guide surface <b>530</b>, the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> and external tibial alignment guide <b>504</b> are disconnected from the tibia <b>214</b>. The tibial cut is then completed.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">During completion of the tibial cut, the guide surface <b>530</b> on the resection guide <b>500</b> is not in position to guide the saw blade <b>170</b>. Therefore, cut surfaces formed during the making of the initial portions of the tibial cut are utilized to guide the saw blade. When the tibial cut is to be completed the saw blade <b>170</b> is inserted into a slot or kerf formed in the distal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> by the saw blade <b>170</b> as it moved along the guide surface <b>530</b> and made the initial portion of the tibial cut. During completion of the tibial cut, the cut surfaces which were formed on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> during the initial portion of the tibial cut are used to guide movement of the saw blade.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">The tibial resection guide <b>218</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> has a guide surface <b>242</b> formed by a closed ended slot. The tibial resection guide <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> has a guide surface <b>530</b> formed by an open ended slot. Thus, the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> includes a slot <b>540</b> which has an open end <b>542</b>. The open end <b>542</b> of the slot <b>540</b> facilitates movement of the saw blade <b>170</b> along the slot and angling of the saw blade relative to the slot to maximize the extent of the initial portion of the tibial cut. Thus, the extent of the tibial cut formed during movement of the saw blade along the guide surface <b>530</b> on the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> is maximized by forming the slot <b>540</b> with the open end <b>542</b> so that the saw blade can be angled at the open end <b>542</b> of the slot.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">The tibial resection guide <b>500</b> may be used with a first cutting tool during making of the initial portion of the tibial cut. A second cutting tool may be used to complete the tibial cut. For example, a relatively small blade <b>170</b> of an oscillating saw <b>172</b> may be used to make the initial portion of the tibial cut. A relatively long blade of a reciprocating saw may be used to complete the tibial cut. If desired, a chisel and/or milling cutter could be used to make the initial portion and/or final portion of the tibial cut.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">It is contemplated that it may be desired to set the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>) for any one of a plurality of different resection levels. Thus, the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> could be set to make a tibial cut at a distance of two millimeters from a location on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> which is engaged by the stylus <b>522</b>. Alternatively, the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> could be utilized to make a cut at a distance of eight millimeters from the location where the stylus <b>522</b> engages the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. Of course, the greater the distance at which the tibial cut is made from the location where the stylus <b>522</b> engages the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>, the greater will be the thickness of a layer of bone removed from the distal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">To facilitate movement of the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> between various depths, the stylus <b>522</b> includes a drive assembly <b>548</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>). The drive assembly <b>548</b> is actuated by rotating a knob <b>550</b> on the stylus. Rotation of the knob <b>550</b> through a predetermined distance, that is, one complete revolution, will cause the drive assembly <b>548</b> to move the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> for a predetermined distance along the proximal shaft <b>510</b> of the external tibial alignment guide <b>504</b>. Thus, rotation of the knob <b>550</b> for one complete revolution in a clockwise direction, viewed from above, is effective to move the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> through a distance of two millimeters downwards along the proximal shaft <b>510</b> of the external tibial alignment guide. Of course, this would increase the depth of the tibial cut by a distance of two millimeters. Similarly, rotating the knob <b>550</b> through two complete revolutions is effective to actuate the drive assembly <b>548</b> to move the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> downward (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>) along the proximal shaft <b>510</b> of the external tibial alignment guide <b>504</b> through a distance of four millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">The drive assembly <b>548</b> includes an externally threaded member which is connected with the knob <b>550</b>. An internally threaded member is connected with the tibial resection guide <b>500</b>. The internally threaded member engages the externally threaded member and is held against axial and rotational movement relative to the tibial resection guide <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">After the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> has been moved to a desired position relative to the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>, a locking knob <b>556</b> is rotated to actuate a lock screw to hold the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> against movement along the proximal shaft <b>510</b> of the external tibial alignment guide <b>504</b>. The pin <b>524</b> is then inserted through the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> into the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">Rather than moving the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> along the proximal shaft <b>510</b> of the external alignment guide <b>504</b> under the influence of force transmitted from the knob <b>550</b> through the drive assembly <b>548</b> to the tibial resection guide, the drive assembly could be connected with the knob <b>556</b>. For example, the knob <b>556</b> could be connected with a pinion gear of a rack and pinion drive arrangement. The rack portion of the drive arrangement could be mounted on the proximal shaft <b>510</b>. If this was done, rotation of the knob <b>556</b> would cause the rack and pinion gear set to move the tibial resection guide along the proximal shaft <b>510</b> through a distance which is a function of the extent of rotation of the knob <b>556</b>. The stylus <b>552</b> would be connected to the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> and would engage the proximal end of the tibia <b>214</b> to indicate when the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> had moved to a desired position relative to proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">It is contemplated that the stylus <b>522</b> could be eliminated if desired. The tibial resection guide <b>500</b> could be positioned by sliding a thin member, such as a blade, beneath tissue overlying the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the femur <b>214</b>. A reference surface on the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> would then be moved into engagement with the blade or other thin member. The reference surface may be disposed on the upper (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>) end of the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> or may be disposed in a slot in the tibial resection guide. The reference surface may also be utilized to guide movement of a saw or other cutting tool.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">If desired a hook or sickle shaped locating member could be extended from the tibial resection guide <b>500</b> to position the tibial resection guide relative to the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. When the incision <b>114</b> and tibial resection guide <b>500</b> are medially offset relative to the tibia <b>214</b>, the locating member would extend along the medial side of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia. This would enable the stylus <b>522</b> to be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">It is contemplated that retractors may be mounted on the proximal shaft <b>510</b> of the external tibial alignment guide <b>504</b>. The retractors engage opposite sides of the incision. The retractors are effective to expand the incision <b>114</b> and/or maintain the incision in a desired position relative to the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Cannula</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">In accordance with another feature of the invention, access to the interior of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> may be obtained through a cannula <b>564</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>). The cannula <b>564</b> is inserted into the incision <b>114</b>. If desired, the patient's leg <b>70</b> can be in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>25</b>. The upper portion of the patient's leg is supported by the leg support <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">The incision <b>114</b> is formed with a relatively short length in the manner previously described herein. The cannula <b>564</b> has an initial size, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, which stretches the viscoelastic material of tissues forming the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. Therefore, initial insertion of the cannula <b>564</b> into the incision <b>114</b> is effective to expand the incision.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">Compact cutting tools, similar to those utilized for arthroscopic, endoscopic, or fiber optic assisted surgery may be at least partially moved through a passage <b>566</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>) formed by an inner side <b>568</b> of the cannula <b>564</b>. The cutting tools may have a construction similar to the construction illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,695 or 5,609,603. Alternatively, the cutting tools may have a construction similar to the construction disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/483,676 filed Jan. 14, 2000 by Peter M. Bonutti and having a disclosure which corresponds to U.S. Pat. No. 5,269,785.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">The cannula <b>564</b> is advantageously expandable to further stretch the viscoelastic tissue of the knee portion <b>76</b>. Of course, expanding the cannula <b>564</b> increases the size of the passage <b>566</b> to enable a relatively large object to pass through the passage. Thus, the cannula <b>564</b> may be expanded to facilitate movement of the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> through the cannula. The leg <b>70</b> is in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>24</b> during expansion of the cannula and movement of objects through the passage <b>566</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">It is contemplated that the expandable cannula <b>564</b> may have many different known constructions. The illustrated cannula <b>564</b> is formed of elastomeric material and has the same construction as is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/470,142 filed Jun. 6, 1995 by Peter M. Bonutti, et al. and having a disclosure which corresponds to the disclosure in U.S. Pat. No. 5,961,499. It should be understood that the cannula <b>564</b> could have a different construction, for example, a construction similar to the constructions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,811,449 or 5,183,464.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">The cannula <b>564</b> can be expanded in many different ways other than under the influence of force transmitted directly to the cannula from an object moving through the cannula. For example, the cannula may be expanded by force transmitted from an implant <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and/or <b>294</b> to the cannula. The cannula <b>564</b> may be expanded by inserting tubular members into the cannula. Alternatively, fluid pressure could be used to expand the cannula <b>564</b> in the manner disclosed in the aforementioned Bonutti, et al. patent application Ser. No. 08/470,142 filed Jun. 6, 1995.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">Rather than being expanded by inserting the expandable cannula <b>564</b> into the incision <b>114</b>, the incision may be expanded by utilizing pneumatic retractors. The pneumatic retractors may have a construction similar to the construction disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,163,949. By utilizing the expandable cannula <b>564</b> or the expandable pneumatic retractors, force can be applied against opposite sides of the incision <b>114</b> to stretch the viscoelastic material disposed adjacent to opposite sides of the incision. This will result in the relatively small incision <b>114</b> being expanded to accommodate relatively large surgical instruments and/or implants.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">Although a single incision <b>114</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, it is contemplated that a plurality of incisions could be provided. Thus, a small incision may be spaced from the incision <b>114</b> to enable a cutting tool to be moved into the knee portion <b>76</b> along a path which is spaced from and may be transverse to a path along which a cutting tool is moved through the incision <b>114</b>. A second cannula, which is smaller than the cannula <b>564</b>, may be utilized with the second incision.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Implant with Interconnectable Portions</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">In order to enable surgery on a knee portion <b>76</b> of a patient's leg <b>70</b> to be conducted through an incision <b>114</b> of relatively small size, the implant may advantageously be formed in two or more portions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>). The portions of the implant are sequentially moved through the incision <b>114</b> into engagement with the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and/or the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. It is believed that having the implant formed as two or more portions will facilitate movement of the implant through the cannula <b>564</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">As the portions of the implant are sequentially moved through the incision <b>114</b>, they are positioned in engagement with one or more of the bones, that is, the femur <b>126</b> and/or the tibia <b>214</b> in the leg <b>70</b> of a patient. After the plurality of portions of the implant have been moved through the incision <b>114</b> and positioned in engagement with the femur <b>126</b> and/or tibia <b>214</b>, the portions of the implant are interconnected to form a unitary implant. If desired, the portions of the implant are moved through the incision <b>114</b> and interconnected while the leg of the patient is in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">It is contemplated that the portions of the implant may be interconnected, while they are disposed in the patient's body and in engagement with either the femur <b>126</b> and/or tibia <b>214</b>, in many different ways. For example, the portions of the implant may be bonded together to form a one piece implant. The portions of the implant may be bonded together by the application of energy in anyone of many different forms to a joint between portions of the implant. For example, ultrasonic energy could be applied to the implant. Alternatively, heat could be directly applied to the implant. If desired, a laser could be utilized to effect bonding of separate portions of the implant together.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">It is also contemplated that the separate portions of the implant could be mechanically interconnected. This could be done with a fastener which extends between portions of the implant. Alternatively, a retainer member such as a rod or bar could extend between portions of the implant. Regardless of how the portions of the implant are interconnected, the portions of the implant are interconnected after they have been moved into the patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, the femoral component <b>290</b> of an implant is formed as two separate portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b>. The portion <b>572</b> of the implant <b>290</b> is moved through the incision <b>114</b> into engagement with the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. Thereafter, the portion <b>574</b> of the implant <b>290</b> is moved through the incision <b>114</b> into engagement with the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. After the two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the femoral component <b>290</b> of the implant have been positioned in abutting engagement with the femur <b>126</b>, the two portions of the implant are interconnected at a joint <b>576</b> between the two portions of the implant. If desired, the portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the femoral component <b>290</b> of the implant may be moved through the cannula <b>564</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">The specific implant <b>290</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> has portions formed of a polymeric material which may be either a polymer or a co-polymer. The material of the two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant <b>290</b> are heated at the joint <b>576</b> while the two portions of the implant are disposed in the patient's body in engagement with the femur <b>126</b>. As this occurs, the material forming the two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant <b>290</b> is heated to a temperature within its transition temperature range and becomes tacky without changing its overall configuration. The two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant <b>290</b> may be heated by the direct or indirect application of heat. The indirect application of heat may include applying ultrasonic energy to the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">The heated material of the two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant <b>290</b> are then pressed together at the joint <b>576</b> to form a bond between the two portions of the implant. As this occurs, there is a fusing of the material of the portion <b>572</b> of the implant <b>290</b> with the material <b>574</b> of the implant. This fusing together of the two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> occur in the patient's body and results in the formation of a one-piece unitary implant <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">Rather than being formed of a polymeric material, it is contemplated that the two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant could be formed of metal and have a polymeric layer on a side of the metal toward the femur <b>126</b>. This would result in the layer of polymeric material being disposed in engagement with the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the metal forming the femoral component <b>290</b> facing toward the tibia <b>214</b> for engagement with the tibial bearing insert <b>294</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>). With such a construction, the application of energy to the two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant would result in a heating of the layer of polymeric material on the inside of the layer of metal. The heated polymeric materials on the two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> bond together at the joint <b>576</b> in a manner previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">When the two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the femoral implant <b>290</b> are to be interconnected by fusing together sections of polymeric material which form the portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant or sections of polymeric material which are disposed on layers of metal forming part of the portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant <b>290</b> to be interconnected, it is contemplated that they may be interconnected in many different ways. One way in which polymeric material on the portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the femoral implant <b>290</b> may be interconnected is the same as is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/737,380 filed Dec. 15, 2000 by Peter M. Bonutti, et al. This patent application contains a disclosure which corresponds to the disclosure in U.S. Pat. No. 6,059,817.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">The two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant <b>290</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>) may be formed of only metal. If this is done, the two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant may be mechanically interconnected. For example, a screw could extend from the portion <b>574</b> of the implant <b>270</b> to the portion <b>572</b> of the implant while the two implants are in engagement with the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. Alternatively, a snap type joint <b>576</b> could be provided between the portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant. Although the two portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant <b>290</b> are positioned in engagement with the femur <b>126</b> and interconnected while the leg <b>70</b> of the patient is in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>25</b>, the two portions of the implant could be positioned in engagement with the femur <b>126</b> while the leg <b>70</b> is straight (extended).</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">The implant <b>290</b> is connected with the femur <b>126</b>. However, it is contemplated that a tibial implant could be formed as a plurality of separate portions which are interconnected when they are in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>. It should be understood that the implant <b>290</b> could be formed of more than two portions. For example the implant could be formed with four separate portions which are interconnected in the patient's body. Although the implant <b>290</b> is to be used in a knee portion of a patient's body, it is contemplated that implants used at other portions of a patient's body could be interconnected in the patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, the separate portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b> of the implant <b>290</b> are positioned in engagement with the same bone, that is, femur <b>126</b> and interconnected. However, it is contemplated that one position of an implant could be positioned in engagement with a first bone and another portion of the implant positioned in engagement with a second bone. However, the two portions of the implant would be interconnected in the patient's body. The two portions of the implant may be interconnected after they have been positioned in engagement with bones in the patient's body. Alternatively, the two portions of the implant could be interconnected in the patient's body, before one or both portions of the implant have been positioned in engagement with a bone.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">For example, a first component of an implant may be connected with a femur <b>126</b> in a patient's body.

It should be understood that even though the implants have not been shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>, ligament balancing may be undertaken before and/or after the implants been positioned in engagement with the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. However, it is contemplated that ligament balancing could be undertaken during surgical procedures which do not require cutting of the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> and/or implants.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">In accordance with one of the features of the invention, during ligament balancing, tension forces in fibrous connective tissue such as collateral ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>) are compared. If the forces in one of the ligaments <b>590</b> or <b>592</b> are excessive, the ligament in which the excessive force is present may be released. Similarly, if one of the ligaments is too loose, the ligament may be tightened.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">In accordance with another one of the features of the invention, transducers are positioned between one or more bones in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient. The transducers enable tension forces in ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> to be compared. The transducers may be used to determine the magnitude of the tension forces in the ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">Thus, a first or lateral transducer <b>596</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>) is positioned between a lateral side of the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and a lateral side of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. Similarly, a second or medial transducer <b>598</b> is positioned between a medial side of the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and a medial side of the proximal end portion of the tibia <b>214</b>. The transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> are connected with a computer <b>600</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>) or other processor.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">The computer <b>600</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>) has a display area <b>601</b> at which the output from the lateral transducer <b>596</b> is displayed. Similarly, the computer <b>600</b> has a display area <b>602</b> at which the output from the medial transducer <b>598</b> is displayed. By comparing the outputs at the display areas <b>601</b> and <b>602</b>, a surgeon can determine the relationship between the tension in the ligament <b>590</b> and the tension in the ligament <b>592</b>. In addition, the surgeon can determine the magnitude of the tension in the ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">It is contemplated that the leg <b>70</b> of the patient will be moved between the flexed condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>25</b> and <b>41</b> and an extended position or straight condition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 42</figref>), while the output from the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> is viewed at the display areas <b>601</b> and <b>602</b> of the computer <b>600</b>. This will provide the surgeon with a clear indication of the manner in which tension forces in the ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> varies during bending of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of a patient. If an image generating device, similar to the C-arm fluoroscope <b>360</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, is used in association with the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b>, the surgeon can see how components of the knee joint are interacting as the tension in the ligaments varies.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">In addition to checking the tension in the ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> during movement of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient between flexed and extended conditions, it is contemplated that the tension in the ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> will be compared during the application of rotational forces to the lower portion <b>68</b> of the knee of the patient. Thus, forces tending to rotate the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg of the patient in the direction of the arrow <b>258</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> are applied to the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. As these rotational forces are applied, the outputs from the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>) are displayed for review by a surgeon to determine whether or not the ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> are rotationally balanced. The transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> may be utilized to provide outputs corresponding to forces resulting from a combination of flexion/extension movement and rotational movement of the lower portion <b>68</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>. It should be understood that the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> may be utilized throughout the entire ligament balancing process previously described herein in order to enable a surgeon to compare tension forces in the ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> throughout the ligament balancing process.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0380">Although the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> have been illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref> as being associated with the end portions of the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, it should be understood that the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> could be associated with other joints if desired. For example, the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> could be positioned between vertebrae in a patient's spine. If this was done, the patient's spine could be bent in either anterior or lateral flexion and extension. The output at the display areas <b>601</b> and <b>602</b> would indicate the manner in which forces transmitted between the vertebrae vary during bending of the spine.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">It is contemplated that the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> could have many different constructions. However, in the illustrated embodiment of the invention, the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> are pneumatic transducers. Thus, the lateral transducer <b>596</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>) includes a container or bladder having a chamber which is filled with fluid. It is contemplated that the chamber could be filled with either a gas or a liquid. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>, the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> have the same construction and are of pneumatic type. Therefore, the chamber is filled with air. However, the chamber could be filled with a liquid, for example, saline solution, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">The transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> are disposed between the femur <b>126</b> and the tibia <b>214</b>. Although it should be understood that the femoral implant <b>290</b> and tibial tray <b>286</b> and bearing <b>294</b> have not been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>, the implants may or may not be present when the transducers are positioned between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. Depending upon the location of the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> they may or may not be disposed in engagement with a portion of either the femoral or tibial implant. With a partial knee replacement, one of the transducers <b>596</b> or <b>598</b>, is disposed between femoral and tibial implants. The other transducer is disposed between surfaces on the femur <b>126</b> and the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">A conductor <b>604</b> is provided to transmit an output signal from the lateral transducer <b>596</b> to the computer display <b>601</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>). The conductor <b>604</b> could be constructed so as to conduct either fluid pressure from the transducer <b>596</b> to the computer <b>600</b> or to conduct an electrical signal from a fluid pressure transducer exposed to the fluid pressure in the transducer <b>596</b>. The medial transducer <b>598</b> is connected with the display <b>602</b> by a conductor <b>606</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">It is contemplated that the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> could have many different constructions including any one of the constructions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,667,520 or in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/483,676 filed Jan. 14, 2000 by Peter M. Bonutti and having a disclosure corresponding to the disclosure in U.S. Pat. No. 5,269,785. The transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> may be formed of a material which is biodegradable or a material which is non-biodegradable.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">Although the illustrated transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>) are of the pneumatic type, it is contemplated that a different type of transducer could be utilized if desired. For example, the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> could be solid state devices, such as piezoelectric load cells. Alternatively, the transducers could include deformable members to which strain gauges are attached.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">It should be understood that the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> could be used to measure and/or compare tension in the ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> immediately after making the incision <b>114</b>. In addition or alternatively, the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> could be used to measure and/or compare tension in the ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> during trials with provisional components. Of course, the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> can be used to measure and/or compare tension in the ligaments after the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> have been mounted in the knee portion <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">In the embodiment of this invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>, the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> are disposed between end portions of the femur <b>216</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. Therefore, the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> only indirectly respond to variations in tension in the collateral ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b>. It is contemplated that the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> could be positioned so as to directly respond to variations in the tension in the collateral ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">For example, the transducer <b>596</b> could be positioned between the ligament <b>590</b> and lateral sides of the femur <b>126</b> and/or tibia <b>214</b>. Similarly, the transducer <b>598</b> could be positioned between the ligament <b>592</b> and medial sides of the femur <b>126</b> and/or tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">It is contemplated that transducers, similar to the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b>, could be utilized to determine variations in tension in ligaments and/or tendons other than the ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b>. For example, transducers could be utilized to determine the tension in the patellar tendon <b>456</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>) and/or the patellar ligament <b>458</b>. If desired, transducers, similar to the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b>, could be positioned so as to respond to variations in tension in the posterior cruciate ligament <b>250</b> and/or the anterior cruciate ligament. It is contemplated that a plurality of transducers, similar to the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b>, may be positioned so as to respond to variations in tension in various combinations of ligaments and/or tendons.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">In addition to providing outputs which are a function of variations in tension in ligaments and/or tendons, the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> may be utilized to apply force against the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. When this is to be done, fluid under pressure is conducted to either or both of the transducers <b>596</b> and/or <b>598</b>. An increase in fluid pressure conducted to the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> is effective to expand containers or bladders in the transducers.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">The fluid pressure force applied against the transducers <b>596</b> and/or <b>598</b> is transmitted to the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. This force may be used to stretch the collateral ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> and/or other body tissue. If it is desired to stretch one of the ligaments <b>590</b> or <b>592</b> to a greater extent the other ligament, the fluid pressure transmitted to one of the transducers <b>596</b> or <b>598</b> would be greater than the fluid pressure transmitted to the other transducer. The force transmitted to the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> is indicated at the displays <b>61</b> and <b>601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">It is contemplated that the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> will be removed before the limited incision <b>114</b> is closed. However, if it is desired, the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> may be left in place and utilized after the incision <b>114</b> is closed. When this is to be done, the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> may advantageously be formed of biodegradable material. By leaving the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> in place after the incision <b>114</b> is closed, the tension in the ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> may be compared during therapy. If desired, one or both ligaments <b>596</b> and/or <b>598</b> could be conducting fluid pressure to one or both transducers <b>596</b> and/or <b>598</b> during therapy.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Inlaid Implant&#x2014;Femur</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-28</figref>, articular surfaces on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> are cut away using a saw or other cutting tool. This results in areas on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>, where articular surfaces were previously disposed, being cut to have a flat planar configuration. Thus, an anterior skim cut, a distal end cut, and chamfer cuts are made on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> while a proximal end cut is made on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. After the cuts have been made, the femoral implant extends across or encloses the cuts on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the tibial implant extends across the cut on the tibial end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">It is contemplated that rather than enclosing the end portions of the femur and tibia with implants, the implants could be inlaid into the end portion of the femur and/or tibia. When an implant is to be inlaid into the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>), a recess <b>610</b> is formed in the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. To form the recess <b>610</b>, a cutting tool, such as a milling cutter <b>614</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>), is utilized to cut away a defective portion of an articular surface on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The milling cutter <b>614</b> is rotated about its longitudinal central axis and has cutting edges disposed in a cylindrical array about the periphery of the milling cutter. The extent of the defective portion of the articular surface determines the extent to which the milling cutter <b>614</b> cuts away the articular surface.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">A guide <b>620</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>) is provided for the milling cutter or other cutting tool. The guide <b>620</b> is effective to limit the extent of axial movement of the milling cutter <b>614</b> into the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> to thereby limit the depth of the recess <b>610</b>. The guide <b>620</b> limits side wise, that is, radial movement of the milling cutter <b>614</b> to an area corresponding to the desired configuration of the recess <b>610</b>. This results in the recess <b>610</b> being formed with a uniform depth throughout the extent of the recess and with a desired configuration. The construction of the guide <b>620</b> in the manner in which it cooperates with the milling cutter <b>614</b> may be similar to that disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,344,423; 5,769,855; and/or 5,860,981.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">Once the recess <b>610</b> has been formed using the milling cutter <b>614</b> in the manner illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, an implant <b>626</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 45</figref>) is positioned in the recess. The implant <b>626</b> fills the recess <b>610</b> and has an outer surface <b>628</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>) which forms a continuation of the naturally occurring articular surface <b>616</b> formed by the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The outer surface <b>628</b> of the implant <b>626</b> replaces defective articular surface area removed by the milling cutter <b>614</b> from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">The outer surface <b>628</b> on the implant <b>626</b> cooperates with an articular surface on a tibia <b>214</b> in the same general manner as the original articular surface area removed by the milling cutter <b>614</b>. Of course, the outer surface <b>628</b> of the implant <b>626</b> is free of defects that made it necessary to replace the corresponding area on the articular surface <b>616</b> of the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The outer surface <b>628</b> of the implant <b>626</b> may engage an articular surface formed by the boney material of the tibia <b>214</b>. Alternatively, the outer surface <b>628</b> of the implant <b>626</b> may engage the surface of an implant disposed on the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">During recovery of the patient, the naturally occurring surface <b>616</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and the implant <b>626</b> may both be load bearing. By having the implant <b>626</b> surrounded by load bearing natural bone, the implant is held in place on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>26</b>. In addition, the magnitude of the load which must be transmitted through the implant <b>626</b> is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">The implant <b>626</b> could have any desired construction. Thus, the implant could be formed of a polymeric material or it could be formed of a metallic material. However, in accordance with one of the features of the invention, the implant <b>626</b> is formed of a material which promotes biological resurfacing and the growth of bone from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> into the implant to fill the recess <b>610</b> with new bone growth. The implant <b>626</b> may also be at least partially formed of material which promotes the growth of cartilage or other tissue over the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">The implant <b>626</b> may be formed with a non-living three dimensional scaffold or framework structure on which bone growth promoting materials, such as bone morphogenetic proteins, are disposed. The three dimensional framework or platform on which the bone growth promoting materials are disposed may be formed of either a biodegradable or a non-biodegradable material. When the scaffold or framework structure is formed of a non-biodegradable material, the bone from the distal end portion <b>124</b> will grow through the scaffold so that the scaffold becomes embedded in new bone growth. The scaffold may be formed of a porous metal or ceramic material. When the scaffold is formed of a bio-degradable material, the scaffold will eventually degrade and be absorbed by body tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">The scaffold may be formed of a mesh or a felt-like material, or a porous material similar to coral. The scaffold forms a growth supporting matrix to support cellular migration from the boney material of the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> into the implant <b>626</b>. If the scaffold or platform is made of a bio-degradable material, then the scaffold or platform degrades and disappears after a period of time. It is contemplated that the scaffold could be formed of a bio-degradable material such as polyglycolic acid or polylactic acid. If desired, the scaffold or framework could be formed of fibrous connective materials such as portions of ligaments, tendons and/or bones obtained from human and/or animal sources. The scaffold could be formed of collagen. The scaffold may be formed of submucosal tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">The scaffold holds bone growth inducing materials and may include bone fragments to which tri-calcium phosphate, an antibiotic, hydroxyapatiate, allografts, autografts, and/or any other polymeric has been added. It is believed that it will be particularly advantageous to provide a bone growth morphogenetics protein in the implant <b>626</b> to promote the growth of bone into the implant. The scaffold may hold cultured and/or noncultured cells which promote biological resurfacing.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">The matrix or scaffold for the implant <b>626</b> may contain tissue inductive factors and/or cells. The cells may be mesenchymal cells which are introduced into the scaffold in the operating room. Thus, the matrix or scaffold may be either biodegradable or non-biodegradable and may be constructed at a location remote from an operation. After the scaffold has been transported to the operating room the mesenchymal cells may be introduced into the scaffold.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">It is contemplated that the matrix or scaffold for the implant <b>626</b> may contain stem cells and/or fetal cells. The stem cells and/or fetal cells may be introduced into either a biodegradable or non-biodegradable matrix or scaffold in the operating room. It is contemplated that tissue inductive factors may be provided in the matrix or scaffold along with any desired type of precursor cells.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">The matrix or scaffold for the implant <b>626</b> may contain osteoinductive materials. The implant <b>626</b> may contain osteoblasts or osteoclast cells or their precursors. The implant <b>626</b> may also contain platlet matrix centrifuged from blood in a manner similar to that described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/483,676, filed Jan. 14, 2000 by Peter M. Bonutti. The matrix or scaffold for the implant <b>626</b> may be formed of allograft bone or collagen. Cartilage may be used to form the scaffold or matrix. The scaffold or matrix for the implant <b>626</b> may have a layered construction with the layers being formed of different materials. Each of the layers of the scaffold or matrix forming the implant <b>626</b> may be impregnated with a different material. For example, precursor cells may be provided in one layer and bone morphogentic protein may be provided in another layer.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">It is contemplated that submucosal tissue may be used to form the scaffold for one or more of the layers of the implant <b>626</b>. The submucosal tissue may be prepared in a manner similar to the manner disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,755,791. The various layers of the implant <b>626</b> may be assembled in the operating room.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">The implant <b>626</b> may be formed of multiple tissue fragments. Thus, a tissue press, similar to the tissue presses disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/602,743 filed Jun. 23, 2000, by Peter M. Bonutti and having a disclosure which corresponds to the disclosure in U.S. Pat. No. 5,662,710 may be utilized to shape the implant to a desired configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">The implant <b>626</b> may be formed to have any one of a plurality of different sizes and configurations. The implant may be shaped to the desired configuration at a location remote from an operating room and transported to the operating room. Alternatively, the implant <b>626</b> could be cut to the desired shape in the operating room.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">By providing a substantial number of implants of different sizes in the operating room and/or by cutting an implant to obtain a desired configuration, it is possible for a surgeon to make a recess <b>610</b> to a shape which corresponds to a defective area on a portion of the femur <b>126</b>. An implant <b>626</b> having the configuration of the particular recess can then be provided. This enables the surgeon to remove a relatively small defective area of the bone forming the articular surface on the femur <b>126</b> and to minimize the size of the implant <b>626</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">It is believed that it will be desired to provide a series of implants of different sizes ranging from a relatively small size to a relatively large size. In addition, it is believed that it will be desired to provide a plurality of guides <b>620</b>. The guides <b>620</b> will have surfaces to guide movement of the milling cutter <b>614</b> or other cutting tool to form a recess <b>610</b> of a size corresponding to any one of the sizes of the implants in the series of implants. Thus, the plurality of guides <b>620</b> would be provided with each guide having guide surfaces corresponding to the configuration of an implant of a different size.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">The scaffold or base of the implant <b>626</b> may be formed of a porous bio-degradable material. The porous bio-degradable material provides a matrix for demineralized bone, collagen, bone morphogenetic protein, growth factors, and autogenous bone marrow. In addition, progenitor cells, stem cells and/or fetal cells may be disposed on the scaffold. Some non-tissue-derived components may include coralline-based HA (ProOsteon), antibiotics, calcium sulfate, calcium and phosphorus oxide rich amorphous glass, anti-inflammatories, and bovine fibrillar collagen. The resulting material will have osteoinductive and osteoconductive qualities. Cortical cancellous bone chips which are freeze dried may be provided in the implant <b>626</b>. In addition, demineralized bone matrix may be provided in the implant <b>626</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">The implant <b>626</b> may be secured in the recess <b>610</b> with a suitable adhesive. There are many different known adhesives which may be used. Fibrin can be used as an adhesive, either in a natural state or after being compressed, to hold material together and to hold the implant <b>626</b> in the recess <b>610</b>.</p>

This is because the implant <b>640</b> is sized and has a configuration which is a function of the size and configuration of an area which was previously defective bone on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. The articular surface <b>644</b> is load bearing and functions to transmit forces between the tibia <b>214</b> and the femur <b>126</b> in the leg <b>70</b> of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">The recess <b>642</b> is formed with the milling cutter <b>614</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>).

Alternatively, the implant <b>690</b> could be utilized in association with a repair of a glenoid joint, an elbow, an ankle, a spine or any desired joint in a patient's body. Implant <b>690</b> includes a base <b>692</b> and an articular layer <b>694</b>. The base <b>692</b> has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> as being connected with the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of a tibia <b>214</b>.

However, it should be understood that an implant having a construction corresponding to the construction of the implant <b>690</b> could be utilized in association with any desired joint in a patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">The base <b>692</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>) is connected with the tibia <b>214</b> by projection <b>700</b> and a fastener <b>702</b>.

The arrow <b>707</b> is skewed at an acute angle to a longitudinal central axis of the tibia <b>214</b>. This results in the projection <b>700</b> being forced into the bone of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.

The expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be utilized at any time during a full or partial knee replacement. Thus, the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be utilized to separate body tissue from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of a femur <b>214</b> before a femoral component or implant <b>290</b> is connected with the femur and before the tibial tray <b>286</b> and tibial bearing insert <b>294</b> are connected with the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">The expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be inserted into the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> one or more days before either a partial or full knee replacement operation is to be undertaken. Before the surgery is initiated, the expandable device <b>720</b> may be expanded to stretch skin <b>342</b>, the joint capsule, and other tissue in the anterior of the knee portion <b>76</b>. The viscoelastic body tissue is resiliently stretched by the expandable device <b>720</b> in the general area where the limited incision <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442">The incision <b>114</b> is subsequently made in the body tissue which has been resiliently stretched by the expandable device <b>720</b>. After the surgery on the patient's leg <b>70</b> has been completed, for example, after a full or partial knee replacement in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-29</figref>, the incision <b>114</b> in the stretched tissue is closed. The body tissue which was previously resiliently stretched by the expandable device <b>720</b> can, after closing of the incision <b>114</b>, return to its normal or unstretched condition. As this occurs, the length of any scar resulting from the incision <b>114</b> decreases. By making the incision <b>114</b> in body tissue which has previously been resiliently stretched by the expandable device <b>720</b>, the overall effective length of the incision <b>114</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">The expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be resilient balloons which are inflated by a gas, such as air, or resilient bladders which are expanded under the influence of a liquid, such as saline solution. The resilient expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be formed of a biodegradable material or a non-biodegradable material. It is contemplated that if the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> are to be left in the patient's body, they may advantageously be formed of a biodegradable material. However, if it is contemplated that when the expandable devices are to be removed from the patient's body during or after surgery, the expandable devices may be formed of a non-biodegradable material.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">Rather than being inserted into the knee portion <b>76</b> prior to formation of the incision <b>114</b>, the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>) may be inserted into the knee portion immediately after making the incision. The expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may then be expanded to separate body tissue in the knee portion <b>76</b>. The expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> are inserted into the knee portion <b>76</b> in a collapsed condition.

<p id="p-0446" num="0445">For example, the expandable device <b>720</b> may be resiliently expanded to stretch the patellar ligament <b>458</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>) and move the patella <b>120</b> away from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. Alternatively, the expandable device <b>720</b> may be positioned between the femur <b>126</b> and the patellar tendon <b>456</b>. Expansion of the expandable device <b>720</b> would then result in movement of the patellar tendon <b>456</b> and patella <b>120</b> away from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. Of course, if expandable devices were provided between the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur and both the patellar tendon <b>456</b> and patellar ligament <b>458</b>, the patella tendon and ligament would both be moved by expansion of the expandable devices. Positioning of the expandable device <b>720</b> between the patellar ligament and/or tendon facilitates subsequent movement of the patella <b>120</b> to offset position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.

The expandable device <b>722</b> may be expanded immediately after the incision <b>114</b> is formed to effect releases of body tissue from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and/or the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0447">Expansion of the expandable device <b>722</b> is effective to move arteries, nerves and veins in the posterior of the knee portion <b>76</b> away from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> prior to making of the femoral and/or tibial cuts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-29</figref>). If desired, the expandable device <b>722</b> may be maintained in the expanded condition during making of one or more of the femoral and/or tibial cuts.

<p id="p-0449" num="0448">It should be understood that the expandable device <b>722</b> may have a configuration which is different from the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>. For example, the expandable device <b>722</b> may extend for a greater distance along the posterior of the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> if desired. Although the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> have been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, it should be understood that the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be used before and/or after installation of the implants. The expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be positioned in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> with the leg in the flexed condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> or with the leg in the extended condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0449">After the femoral component <b>290</b> and tibial tray <b>286</b> and tibial bearing insert <b>294</b> have been positioned in the knee portion <b>726</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>, the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be utilized to assist the surgeon during ligament balancing. The expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> will also assist the surgeon in obtaining a full range of motion of the knee portion <b>76</b>. Thus, the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be expanded, under the influence of fluid pressure, to effect ligament releases or to move tissue out of an interfering relationship with relative movement between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0450">The expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be resiliently expanded under the influence of fluid pressure conducted through conduits to the expandable devices. If the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> are inserted after the incision <b>114</b> is formed in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>, the conduits for conducting fluid to and from the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may extend through the incision. However, if the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> are inserted prior to making of the incision <b>114</b>, the conduits for conducting fluid to and from the expandable devices may extend through small portals or stab wounds formed in the knee portion of the patient's leg. It should be understood that the conduits for conducting fluid to and from the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may extend through small secondary incisions spaced from the main incision <b>114</b> even though the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> are positioned in the knee portion <b>76</b> after making the main incision.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0451">The small portals or stab wounds which form secondary incisions are spaced from the location where the main incision <b>114</b> is formed. Thus, the conduit for conducting fluid to and from the expandable device <b>722</b> may extend through a portal or stab wound formed in the posterior portion of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>. Before they are expanded, the contracted expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b>, are very small and flexible. The contracted expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> have an appearance similar to a collapsed balloon. The contracted expandable devices are easily moved through the small secondary incisions.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">It is contemplated that the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be left in the knee portion <b>76</b> of a patient's leg <b>70</b> after the incision <b>114</b> has been closed. If this is done, the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be utilized to obtain a full range of motion of the patient's knee <b>76</b> during therapy and/or recovery of the patient after the incision has been closed. If the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> are formed of a non-biodegradable material, it may be desirable to remove the expandable devices after the incision <b>114</b> has been closed. If the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> are formed of a biodegradable material, they do not have to be removed after the incision has been closed.

<p id="p-0454" num="0453">It is contemplated that it may be desired to form the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> (and/or the conduits for inflating expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b>) of a biodegradable material which is absorbable by the patient's body. If this is done, the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may be formed of polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, or combinations of these materials. It is contemplated that the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> could be formed of materials which include hyaluronic acid, catgut material, gelatin, cellulose, nitrocellulose, collagen or other naturally occurring biodegradable materials. Although it is believed that it would be preferred to form the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> of biodegradable materials so that they can be left in the patient's body and hydrolyzed so as to be absorbed by the patient's body, it is contemplated that the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> could be made of a non-biodegradable material if desired. The resiliently expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> may have any of the constructions disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,163,949; 5,454,365 and 5,514,153. Of course, the resiliently expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> could have a different construction if desired.</p>

<p id="p-0455" num="0454">After the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> have been positioned on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> in the manner illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, it is contemplated that the range of motion of the knee portion <b>76</b> will be checked. During the check of the range of motion of the knee portion <b>76</b>, it may be found that the range is unduly limited due to interference between body tissue in the posterior of the knee portion <b>76</b> and the implants. The range of motion of the knee portion <b>76</b> may be limited by tightness of tendons, ligaments and/or other tissue in the knee portion <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455">Although it is believed that the expandable devices <b>720</b> and <b>722</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> may be utilized to alleviate these conditions, it may be preferred to use an expandable device <b>730</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>) which is inserted between the tibial bearing insert <b>294</b> and the trochlear groove in the femur <b>126</b>. Thus, once the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> have been positioned in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>, the expandable device <b>730</b> may be moved through the incision <b>114</b>. The expandable device <b>730</b> is then moved between the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0456">The expandable device <b>730</b> may be a balloon or bladder which is made of resilient material. When fluid pressure in the expandable device <b>730</b> is increased, the expandable device is expanded from a collapsed condition to an extended condition. The resilient material of the expandable device <b>730</b> may or may not be stretched when the expandable device <b>730</b> is expanded.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0457">The expandable device <b>730</b> may be moved posteriorly of the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> so as to engage tissue in the posterior portion of the patient's knee. Alternatively, the expandable device <b>730</b> may be positioned between the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. It is contemplated that the patient's leg <b>70</b> will be in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> with the patella <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>) offset when the expandable device <b>730</b> is positioned in the knee portion <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0458">When the expandable device <b>730</b> is moved to the posterior of the patient's knee portion <b>76</b>, expansion of the expandable device <b>730</b> applies pressure against tissue in the posterior portion of the patient's knee. This results in movement of body tissue away from the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b>. Assuming that body tissue in the posterior of the patient's knee portion <b>76</b> is interfering with the range of relative movement between the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b>, applying pressure against the body tissue in the posterior of knee portion will move the body tissue away from the implants to enable the range of motion to be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0459">Expansion of the expandable device <b>730</b> is effective to move and stretch body tissue, such as the joint capsule, ligaments, tendons, skin or other tissue associated with the posterior portion of the patient's knee. Space is established between the distal end portion <b>120</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and body tissue. Space is also established between the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> and body tissue. Since the body tissue is moved and stretched by expansion of the expandable device <b>730</b>, a portion of the space tends to remain even though the viscoelastic body tissue retracts when fluid is conducted from the expandable device <b>730</b> and the size of the device decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0460">The expandable device <b>730</b> may be left in place in the posterior of the patient's knee portion <b>76</b> after the incision <b>114</b> is closed. A conduit <b>734</b> connected with the expandable device <b>730</b> would extend through the closed incision <b>114</b> to enable fluid to be conducted to and from the expandable device <b>730</b>. Therefore, after the incision <b>114</b> has been closed, the expandable device <b>730</b> can be expanded to increase the range of movement of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>. After fluid has been conducted from the expandable device through the conduit <b>734</b>, the size of the expandable device is reduced by exhausting fluid through the conduit. The reduced size of the expandable device enables the conduit <b>734</b> to be pulled outward, away from the knee portion <b>76</b>, to pull the expandable device <b>730</b> through a very small opening in the closed incision.</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0461">If desired, the expandable device <b>730</b> could be formed of a biodegradable material and left in the posterior of the knee portion <b>76</b>. The conduit <b>734</b> could be formed of a non-biodegradable material and pulled from the opening in the incision after the expandable device <b>730</b> has at least started to degrade. Of course, the conduit <b>734</b> could also be biodegradable.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0462">Rather than applying force against body tissue at the posterior of the knee portion <b>76</b>, the expandable device <b>734</b> may be utilized to apply force against the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and against the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. This force would tend to stretch or release ligaments or other fibrous connective tissue connected with the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. This force would also stretch the joint capsule, collateral ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>), and other tissues around the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0463">When this is to be done, the expandable device <b>730</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>) is moved to a position midway between posterior and anterior portions of the implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b>. The expandable device <b>730</b> is then expanded under the influence of fluid pressure conducted through the conduit <b>734</b>. As the expandable device expands, it acts as a joint jack to apply force against the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. This force will tend to stretch the collateral ligaments and other ligaments and tendons connected with the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0464">Once the expandable device <b>730</b> has been utilized to apply an upwardly directed force (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>) against the distal end portion <b>120</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and a downwardly directed force (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>) against the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>, the expandable device <b>730</b> is contracted by conducting a flow of fluid from the expandable device through the conduit <b>734</b>. The surgeon can then check ligament balancing and/or the range of motion of the knee portion <b>76</b>. If the ligament balancing check and/or range of motion check indicates that it would be beneficial, the expandable device <b>730</b> can again be utilized to apply force against the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. Fluid pressure would again connected through the conduit <b>734</b> to the expandable device <b>730</b>. Expansion and contraction of the expandable device <b>730</b> can be repeated as many times as necessary to obtain the desired ligament balancing and/or range of motion of the knee portion <b>76</b>.</p>

A relatively high fluid pressure may be conducted to the second and third expandable devices <b>730</b> disposed between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> to effect relative movement between the femur and tibia.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0468">If desired, a higher fluid pressure could be conducted to one of the expandable devices <b>730</b> disposed between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> than the other expandable device.

For example, the expandable devices may be utilized in association with surgery on a glenoid joint. Alternatively, the expandable devices may be used in association with surgery on a patient's spine. During spinal surgery, the expandable devices <b>720</b>, <b>722</b> and/or <b>730</b> may be utilized to move one vertebra relative to an adjacent vertebra during replacement of an intravertebral disc between the vertebrae. If desired, the expandable devices <b>720</b>, <b>722</b> and <b>730</b> could be positioned between articular processes on vertebrae. When the expandable devices <b>720</b>, <b>722</b> and <b>730</b> are formed of a biodegradable material, they may be positioned relative to a patient's vertebral column during surgery and left in place after the surgery.

<p id="p-0476" num="0475">In the foregoing description of a specific surgical procedure which may be utilized in association with a knee portion <b>76</b> of a patient's leg, the femoral and tibial cuts are made, the patella is repaired and implants are installed in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. However, it is contemplated that the various steps in this surgical operation may be performed in a different order if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0476">Immediately after the limited incision <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is made in the knee portion <b>76</b> in the manner previously explained, repair of the patella <b>120</b> may be undertaken. During repair of the patella <b>120</b>, the patient's leg <b>70</b> is in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The patella <b>120</b> is cut in situ with the guide assembly <b>464</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>). After a flat surface has been cut along the plane <b>484</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>) to form a flat surface on the inside of the patella, a layer on which the inner side <b>122</b> of the patella is disposed is removed. This decreases the thickness of the patella.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0477">After the patellar cut has been made, in the manner previously explained and before installation of the patellar implant, the tibial cut is undertaken. During the tibial cut, the patient's leg <b>70</b> is in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> is cut, in the manner illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0478">While the tibial cut is being made, the patella <b>120</b> is offset from its normal position with the flat cut surface, previously formed on the inner side of the patella, facing toward the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. Since the patellar cut has already been made, the patella <b>120</b> is relatively thin and provides minimal stretching of the skin <b>342</b> and other tissues in the knee portion <b>76</b> when the patella is in the offset position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> during the making of the tibial cut.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0479">After the tibial cut has been made, the femoral cuts are made. Making of the femoral cuts after making of the tibial cut and after making of the patellar cut maximizes the space which is available for the making of the femoral cuts. During the making of the femoral cuts, the patient's leg <b>70</b> is in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. After the tibial cut has been made, a layer is removed from the tibia and the cut surface <b>246</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>) on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia is spaced from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. In addition, the patellar cut has been made so that the patella <b>120</b> is relatively thin and provides minimal interference. The femoral cuts are made in the manner previously explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0480">After the femoral cuts have been made, the tibial tray <b>286</b> is positioned on the distal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> in the manner illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>.

<p id="p-0518" num="0517">Once the femoral cuts have been completed, an optical measuring device, such as an interferometer, may scan the cuts to determine if they have the desired configuration. Scanning the cuts with an optical measuring device may be used to eliminate the necessity of performing trials with provisional components. Eliminating the necessity of utilizing provisional components substantially reduces the amount of equipment required during a partial or total knee replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0519" num="0518">The cut surfaces on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>. Rather than performing trials with provisional implants, the cut surfaces on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> are measured using known optical measuring devices. A computer, connected with the optical measuring device, is utilized to compare the measurement of the cut surfaces on the femur <b>216</b> and the tibia <b>214</b> with desired measurements for the specific implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and <b>294</b> to be mounted on the femur and tibia. The computer also compares optically determined orientations of the cut surfaces on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> relative to desired orientations of the cut surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0520" num="0519">The optical measuring device may have any one of many known constructions. For example, the optical measuring device may have the construction illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 6,185,315 or 6,195,168 if desired. If an optical measuring device or other measuring device indicates that the cut surfaces are incorrect, a computer connected with the source <b>858</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>) of the image <b>850</b> will change the hologram to correspond to a next smaller size of implant. When a surgeon determines that the femur <b>126</b> should be cut for the next smaller size implant, the surgeon manually enters data into the computer. In response to this data, the computer causes the projector <b>858</b> of the image <b>850</b> to project an image corresponding to a next smaller size image. The saw <b>172</b> is then utilized to cut the femur along the lines indicated by the next smaller size image. This will allow the next smaller size implant to be mounted on the femur.</p>
<p id="p-0521" num="0520">It is contemplated that the projector <b>858</b> could have any desired construction. For example, the projector <b>858</b> could have a construction which is generally similar to the construction of apparatus disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,211,976. It is contemplated that the laser light sources <b>872</b> and <b>874</b> could have a construction similar to the construction of devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,425,355. The laser light sources <b>872</b> and <b>874</b> may have a construction which is similar to the construction of devices which are commercially available from Laserscope, Inc. of San Jose, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0522" num="0521">It is contemplated that the patient's leg <b>70</b> will be in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> when either the two dimensional or the three dimensional image is projected onto the end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The relatively small incision <b>114</b> may be resiliently expanded and/or moved relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> to allow the image <b>850</b> to be sequentially projected onto various areas on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. A three dimensional image may be generated by any one of several known methods, including the method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,379,133.</p>
<p id="p-0523" num="0522">It is contemplated that the three dimensional image <b>850</b> may be used with procedures other than cutting of one or more bones in a patient's leg <b>70</b>. For example, a three dimensional image of cuts to be made on a vertebra in a patient's back may be projected onto the vertebra. The three dimensional image may be used in surgery involving soft tissue in a patient's body. For example, the three dimensional image may be projected to a location in a patient's body where a vascular anastomosis or an intestinal anastomosis is to be undertaken. The three dimensional image may correspond to a pattern of stitches to be made between portions of soft body tissue. By projecting the three dimensional image into a patient's body at any desired location where surgery of any type is to be undertaken, a guide is provided in the patient's body to assist the surgeon.</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0523">The locating laser light beams <b>852</b> and <b>854</b> may be used with surgical instruments other than the saw <b>172</b>. For example, the locating laser light beams <b>852</b> and/or <b>854</b> could be utilized to indicate the position of a bovie, or a needle, or forceps relative to body tissue. The locating laser light beams may have an intensity which is sufficient to shine through body tissue and enable a surgeon on one side of body tissue to visually determine the position of a surgical instrument on the opposite side of the body tissue.</p>
<p id="h-0032" num="0000">Unicompartmental Knee Replacement</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0524">The drawings associated with the foregoing description have illustrated a full knee replacement rather than a partial knee replacement. However, it is contemplated that the previously described features of the present invention may be utilized with either a partial knee replacement or a full knee replacement. A femur <b>126</b> is illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> and has a distal end portion <b>124</b> with a pair of condyles <b>890</b> and <b>892</b>. When a partial knee replacement is to be made, only one of the two condyles, that is the condyle <b>892</b>, is cut. A saw <b>172</b> having a blade <b>170</b> is used to cut the condyle <b>892</b> along a line indicated at <b>896</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0526" num="0525">The saw <b>172</b> is provided with laser light sources <b>902</b> and <b>904</b>. The laser light sources <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> project visible locating laser light beams <b>906</b> and <b>908</b> which extend along opposite longitudinal edges of the saw blade <b>170</b>. The locating laser light beams <b>906</b> and <b>908</b> impinge against the condyle <b>892</b>. The locating light beams are of colored coherent light which is visible to a surgeon to indicate the orientation of the saw blade <b>170</b> relative to the condyle <b>892</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0527" num="0526">It is contemplated that the saw <b>172</b> and blade <b>170</b> may be utilized in association with a guide member which is connected with the femur <b>126</b>. Alternatively, a two or three dimensional image, corresponding to the image <b>850</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, may be projected onto the distal end portion of the femur <b>126</b>. Another alternative would be to make a line <b>896</b> on the condyle <b>892</b> with a marking instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0528" num="0527">Rather than using a saw blade <b>170</b> to make the cut in the condyle <b>892</b>, it should be understood that a different type of cutting tool could be utilized if desired. For example, a milling cutter could be used to cut along a line <b>896</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>. If a full knee replacement, rather than a partial knee replacement, is desired, both condyles <b>890</b> and <b>892</b> may be cut with the saw <b>172</b> and blade <b>170</b> using the laser light sources <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> to indicate the position of the saw blade relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. Once the femoral cuts have been made, an optical measuring device may be utilized to determine whether or not the cuts are of the proper size.</p>
<p id="h-0033" num="0000">Multiple Incisions</p>
<p id="p-0529" num="0528">A single incision <b>114</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> to provide access to the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>. As has been previously explained herein, the length of the incision <b>114</b> is minimized. However, it is contemplated that the length of the incision <b>114</b> could be further reduced by providing one or more very small incisions <b>920</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>) in the knee portion <b>76</b> of a patient's leg <b>70</b> in association with the incision <b>114</b>. The incision <b>920</b> is a small stab wound which forms a portal through the skin <b>342</b>. The blade <b>170</b> of the saw <b>172</b> or other cutting tool may be moved through the small incision <b>920</b> to make one or more femoral cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0530" num="0529">After the femoral cuts have been made through the small incision <b>920</b> and the larger or main incision <b>114</b>, femoral and/or tibial implants are moved through the main incision. By providing the small incision <b>920</b> in association with the larger main incision <b>114</b>, the overall length of the main incision may be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="0530">During making of the incisions <b>114</b> and <b>970</b>, the patient's leg <b>70</b> is in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. During making of the tibial and femoral cuts and insertion of the implants, the patient's leg <b>70</b> is also in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. If desired, one or more expandable devices, corresponding to the expandable devices of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51 and 52</figref>, may be inserted through one or more small incisions <b>920</b> and/or the main incision <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0532" num="0531">In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, laser light sources <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> are connected with the saw <b>172</b> in the manner illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>. The laser light sources provide visible locating laser light beams, corresponding to the locating laser light beams <b>906</b> and <b>908</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0533" num="0532">By using more than one incision, that is, the main incision <b>114</b> and one or more small incisions <b>920</b>, cutting tools can approach and move along the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> from different directions. Thus, the saw blade <b>170</b> moves from the right to the left as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, that is, in a lateral direction, during making of a femoral cut. A cutting tool which moves through the incision <b>114</b> may move in a superior direction along the femur <b>126</b>, that is, from the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> toward a proximal end portion of the femur. The cutting tools may be used to make cuts required for either a partial or full knee replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0534" num="0533">Although it is preferred to make the incisions <b>114</b> and <b>920</b> and to cut the femur <b>126</b> with the leg <b>70</b> of the patient in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, it should be understood that the use of a plurality of incisions during the surgery with the leg in other positions may be desired. Although the foregoing description has been in conjunction with surgery on a knee portion of a leg <b>70</b> of a patient, it is contemplated that the surgery could be performed on a different portion of the patient if desired.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">Patellar Tracking</p>
<p id="p-0535" num="0534">A pair of transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref> to compare tension and collateral ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b>. The manner in which the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> are positioned between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> is illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0536" num="0535">In accordance with another feature of the invention, a pair of patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> are disposed on an inner side of the patella <b>120</b>. The patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> are connected with a display, corresponding to the computer display areas <b>601</b> and <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. The patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> are disposed between the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the patella <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0537" num="0536">The patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> have outputs which correspond to force transmitted between the patella <b>120</b> and the femur <b>126</b>. Thus, the output from the transducer <b>930</b> corresponds to the force transmitted between the lateral side of the patella <b>120</b> and a lateral side of a trochlear groove in the femur <b>126</b>. Similarly, the output from the transducer <b>932</b> corresponds to the force transmitted between a medial side of the patella <b>120</b> and a medial side of the trochlear groove in the femur <b>126</b>. By comparing the output from the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> during relative movement between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, variations in the force transmitted between the lateral and medial portions of the patella <b>120</b> can be compared. This enables a surgeon to determine when the patella is tracking properly relative to the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0537">The patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> are resiliently expandable containers which hold fluid. As the force transmitted between the patella <b>120</b> and the femur <b>126</b> increases, the pressure of the fluid in the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> increases. It is contemplated that the containers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> may hold either a gas or a liquid. Pressure signals corresponding to the pressure in the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> are conducted through conductors <b>934</b> and <b>936</b> to a display, corresponding to the computer displays <b>601</b> and <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. The patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> may have any desired construction which enables them to measure the force transmitted between the patella <b>120</b> and the femur <b>126</b>. Thus, the transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> could be of the piezoelectric type or of a strain-gauge type.</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0538">During checking of patellar tracking with the transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b>, the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient is supported above the support surface <b>64</b> by the leg holder <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The leg <b>70</b> is moved between the flexed condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> and the extended condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. During movement of the leg <b>70</b> between the flexed and extended conditions, there is relative movement between the end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the patella <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>). During relative movement between the femur <b>126</b> and patella <b>120</b>, the output from the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> indicates the manner in which force transmitted between the patella and femur varies. This enables a surgeon to detect any defects in tracking of the patella <b>120</b> relative to the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0540" num="0539">The patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> are mounted on the patella <b>120</b> after the patellar implant has been mounted on the patella. This enables the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> to be utilized to detect any irregularities in the manner in which the patellar implant cooperates with the femoral implant <b>290</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>). However, it is contemplated that the patellar transducers may be mounted on the patella <b>120</b> before the patellar implant is mounted on the patella. When this is to be done, the transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> may be mounted in a body having a size and configuration corresponding to the intended size and configuration of the patellar implant.</p>
<p id="p-0541" num="0540">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> extend across the patella <b>120</b> between lateral and medial edges of the patella. However, it is contemplated that the transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> may extend only part way across the patella. If desired, more than the two illustrated patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> may be provided on the patella <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0542" num="0541">The transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> can be utilized in combination with the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>). This enables the surgeon to determine the manner in which tension varies in the collateral ligaments <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>) with variations in force transmitted between the patella <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>) and the femur <b>126</b>. However, the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> may be utilized without the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0543" num="0542">When it is determined that the patella <b>120</b> is not tracking properly, corrective action may be taken by increasing the fluid pressure in either or both of the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b>. If the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> are utilized, the corrective action may include increasing the fluid pressure in either or both of the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b>. The transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> and the patella transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> are formed of resilient material which can be expanded under the influence of fluid pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0544" num="0543">Although the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> are utilized to measure force transmitted between lateral and medial portions of the patella <b>120</b> and the femur <b>126</b>, the patellar transducers can be utilized to stretch or move body tissue in the same manner as the expandable devices <b>720</b>, <b>722</b> and <b>730</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51 and 52</figref>). By increasing the fluid pressure conducted to the patellar transducer <b>930</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>), the patellar transducer expands to stretch fibrous connective body tissue connected with the lateral side of the patella <b>120</b>. Similarly, increasing the fluid pressure conducted to the patellar transducer <b>932</b> expands the patellar transducer <b>932</b> to stretch fibrous connective body tissue connected with the medial side of the patella <b>120</b>. Increasing the fluid pressure conducted to both patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> is effective to expand both transducers and stretch fibrous connective body tissue with both sides of the patella <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0545" num="0544">The patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> may be formed of either a biodegradable material or a non-biodegradable material. When the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> are to be left in the knee portion <b>76</b>, the patellar transducers may be formed of a biodegradable material which is eventually absorbed by the patient's body. When the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> are to be removed from the knee portion <b>76</b>, the patella transducers may be formed of a non-biodegradable material. If the patellar transducers <b>930</b> and <b>932</b> are formed of a biodegradable material and are left in the knee portion <b>76</b> after closing of the incision <b>114</b>, the patellar transducers may be expanded during therapy to stretch body tissue connected with the patella <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0035" num="0000">Movable Implant</p>
<p id="p-0546" num="0545">The implant <b>690</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> is fixedly secured to the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of a tibia <b>214</b> by the projection <b>700</b> and fastener <b>702</b>. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>, a moveable implant <b>950</b> is provided between the distal end portion <b>124</b> of a femur <b>126</b> and a proximal end portion <b>212</b> of a tibia <b>214</b>. In accordance with a feature of this embodiment of the invention, the implant <b>950</b> is freely moveable relative to both the femur <b>126</b> and the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0547" num="0546">The moveable implant <b>950</b> has a smooth upper (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>) surface <b>952</b> which is engaged by a medial portion of the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur. Similarly, the moveable implant <b>950</b> has a smooth lower (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>) surface <b>954</b> which is engaged by a medial portion of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. This smooth upper and lower end surfaces <b>952</b> and <b>954</b> compensate for defects in the existing surfaces on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. By providing the moveable implant <b>950</b> between the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>, pain which results from engagement of a surface <b>958</b> on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> with a surface <b>960</b> on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> is eliminated or at least substantially reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0548" num="0547">During bending of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>, the implant <b>950</b> may move relative to both the femur <b>126</b> and the tibia <b>214</b>. The implant <b>950</b> can move in either a lateral or medial direction relative to the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. In addition, the implant <b>950</b> can move in either a posterior or anterior direction relative to the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0549" num="0548">By having a three hundred and sixty degree (360&#xb0;) range of movement relative to both the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, the moveable implant <b>950</b> accommodates relative movement between the femur and tibia with minimal pain. This is because relative movement will occur between the implant <b>950</b>, femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> at locations where frictional forces due to irregularities on the surfaces of the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> are minimal. In addition, the implant <b>950</b> can shift relative to the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> during bending of the knee portion <b>76</b> to accommodate irregularities in the existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia.</p>
<p id="p-0550" num="0549">The range of movement of the implant <b>950</b> relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> is limited by engagement of the moveable implant <b>950</b> with soft tissue in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>. Therefore, even though the implant <b>950</b> can move relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>, the implant is held against excessive movement relative to the femur and tibia by soft tissues associated with the femur and tibia.</p>
<p id="p-0551" num="0550">For example, engagement of the implant <b>950</b> with cartilage or other soft tissue which is located at the peripheral aspect of the knee joint between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> retains the implant <b>950</b> within a desired range of movement. The cartilage may be articular cartilage and/or fibrocartilage. The cartilage is engaged by peripheral surfaces on the moveable implant <b>952</b> and retains the implant in a desired position relative to the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. In addition, fibrous connective tissue extending between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> limits movement of the implant <b>950</b> relative to the femur and tibia.</p>
<p id="p-0552" num="0551">The joint capsule in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg may be engaged by the periphery of the implant <b>950</b> to retain the implant in a desired position. By using cartilaginous, ligamentous, or other tissues to limit the range of movement of the moveable implant <b>950</b>, the implant can freely shift relative to the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> through a limited range of movement during bending of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>. If desired, growth of the tissues used to limit the range of movement of the implant may be promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0553" num="0552">The moveable implant <b>950</b> is sized so as to fit the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the distal end portion <b>124</b> and proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>). The sizing is accomplished by imaging the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg. The moveable implant <b>950</b> may be one of a series of implants of different sizes. After the patient's knee portion <b>76</b> has been imaged, a moveable implant is selected from the series of moveable implants of different sizes. The size of the selected moveable implant closely approximates the size of the space between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the distal end portion <b>124</b> and proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0554" num="0553">Thus, for a relatively large individual, a moveable implant <b>950</b> having a relatively large size is selected from the series of moveable implants. Similarly, for an individual having a relatively small size, a moveable implant <b>950</b> having a relatively small size is selected from the series of moveable implants. The selected implant has a size which corresponds to the general size of the space between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0555" num="0554">As a result of imaging of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>, the actual configurations of the existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> can be accommodated by shaping the upper surface <b>952</b> of the moveable implant <b>958</b> to have a configuration corresponding to the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b>. Similarly, the lower surface <b>954</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> can be shaped to have a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b>. Of course, the configuration of the periphery of the moveable implant can be changed to correspond to the configuration of the periphery of the space between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> into which the moveable implant <b>950</b> is to be placed.</p>
<p id="p-0556" num="0555">It is contemplated that the imaging of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> may be done preoperatively, on an out-patient basis.

The implant <b>950</b>, which has been shaped to conform to the space between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b>, may then be moved to an operating room for insertion into a patient during the surgical procedure. Alternatively, the imaging of the knee portion <b>76</b> and shaping of the moveable implant <b>950</b> to the desired configuration may be performed in the operating room as part of the surgical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0557" num="0556">When the moveable implant <b>950</b> is to be positioned in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>, in the manner indicated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>, a limited incision is made in the knee portion of the patient's leg. The limited incision is made while the patient's leg <b>70</b> is supported in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>25</b>. The upper portion of the patient's leg is supported by the leg support <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0558" num="0557">The incision may have a limited length, corresponding to the limited length of the incision <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and be located adjacent to an edge of the patella <b>120</b>.

However, it should be understood that if the implant <b>950</b> is to be located adjacent to a lateral portion of the femur <b>126</b> and a lateral portion of the tibia <b>214</b>, the incision <b>114</b> could be formed adjacent to a lateral edge of the patella <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0559" num="0558">Once the limited incision <b>114</b> has been formed in the manner previously described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> herein, the patella <b>120</b> may be moved to the offset position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> with the inner side <b>122</b> of the patella facing inward to facilitate utilization of an incision <b>114</b> having a limited length. Once the limited incision <b>114</b> has been formed, locations in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> may be inspected utilizing an optical device similar to the endoscope <b>352</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>. It is believed that the surgeon will bend the leg <b>70</b> of the patient between the flexed condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> and the extended condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> and will rotate the lower portion of the leg about it longitudinal central axis, in the manner indicated by the arrow <b>258</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> prior to positioning of the implant <b>950</b> in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. This will enable the surgeon to detect any present or potential interference between the implant <b>950</b> and tissue in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0560" num="0559">Once this has been done, the surgeon may or may not decide to cut tissue in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b> before inserting the moveable implant <b>950</b>. If the surgeon elects to cut tissue in the knee portion <b>76</b> before insertion of the implant, this cutting will be relatively minor and will not involve the femoral and tibial cuts depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-23</figref> herein. This is because the moveable implant <b>950</b> is to be positioned between surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> which are in their existing condition. Of course, eliminating the major femoral and tibial cuts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-23</figref> herein will reduce the patient's post-operative recovery time. In addition, elimination of the major femoral and tibial cuts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-23</figref> enables the size of the incision <b>114</b> to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0561" num="0560">Once the moveable implant <b>950</b> has been positioned between the existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, the patella <b>120</b> is moved from the offset position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> back to its normal position relative to the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b> and the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. While the lower portion of the leg <b>70</b> is suspended from the upper portion of the leg and while the upper portion of the leg is held above the support surface <b>64</b> by the leg support <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the incision <b>114</b> is closed in a normal manner. Prior to closing of the incision, an imaging apparatus can be utilized to generate images of the knee portion <b>76</b> during bending of the leg <b>70</b> between the flexed and extended conditions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0562" num="0561">Any known imaging apparatus may utilized to image the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg <b>70</b>.

These images will enable the surgeon to determine the manner in which the implant <b>950</b> will move relative to the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> during bending of the patient's leg. Prior to closing of the incision <b>114</b>, any corrective action which the surgeon may believe is necessary can be taken to make certain that the moveable implant <b>950</b> is in the desired relationship with the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0563" num="0562">Rather than forming the incision <b>114</b> in the manner illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the incision may be formed with an even shorter length and a cannula, corresponding to the cannula <b>364</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, inserted into the incision.

The cannula would stretch the viscoelastic material of tissues in which the very limited incision is formed to resiliently expand the extent of the incision <b>114</b> to enable the implant <b>950</b> to be moved through the incision even though the moveable implant <b>950</b> is larger than the incision.</p>
<p id="p-0564" num="0563">The cannula <b>564</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>) through which the implant <b>950</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>) is moved into the space between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> is advantageously expandable to accommodate the implant <b>950</b>.

Fiberoptic devices, such as an endoscope or arthroscope, may be inserted through a very small incision, corresponding to the incision <b>920</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, to facilitate positioning of the implant <b>950</b>. By utilizing an expandable cannula and/or arthroscopic and endoscopic surgical procedures, the size of the incision <b>114</b> through which the implant <b>950</b> is moved can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0565" num="0564">The moveable implant <b>950</b> is flexible so that force transmitted between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> deflects the moveable implant <b>950</b>. This results in the moveable implant <b>950</b> being shaped by the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. By shaping the upper surface <b>952</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> with the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b>, smooth sliding engagement is provided between the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and the upper surface <b>952</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b>. Similarly, the lower surface <b>954</b> on the implant <b>950</b> is shaped by the surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b>. By shaping the lower surface <b>954</b> on the implant <b>950</b> with the surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b>, smooth sliding engagement is provided between the surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b> and the lower surface <b>954</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> during bending of the knee portion <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0566" num="0565">Shaping of the surfaces <b>952</b> and <b>954</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> may be accomplished in any one of many different ways. For example, the implant <b>950</b> may be formed of a material which is resiliently deflected by the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. This results in the upper surface <b>952</b> and lower surface <b>954</b> and the moveable implant <b>950</b> being resiliently deflected to have a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the portions of the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> which are engaged by the moveable implant during bending of the knee portion <b>76</b>. During bending of the knee portion <b>76</b>, the moveable implant <b>950</b> shifts or moves relative to the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. During this shifting movement, the configuration of the upper surface <b>952</b> and the lower surface <b>954</b> of the moveable implant <b>950</b> is resiliently changed by forces transmitted between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> through the moveable implant <b>950</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0567" num="0566">Rather than having the moveable implant <b>950</b> resiliently deflected by force transmitted between the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, the moveable implant <b>950</b> may be plastically deformed by the force transmitted between the femur and the tibia. Thus, the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b> may plastically deform the upper surface <b>952</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> so that it retains a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b>. Similarly, the surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b> may be plastically deform the lower surface <b>954</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> so that it maintains a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b>. By plastically deforming the material of the moveable implant <b>950</b> with the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, smooth sliding engagement is obtained between the upper and lower surfaces <b>952</b> and <b>954</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> during bending of the knee portion <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0568" num="0567">Even though the upper and lower surfaces <b>952</b> and <b>954</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> are either elastically or plastically shaped by the force transmitted between the femur <b>126</b> or tibia <b>214</b>, the moveable implant will, initially, be configured to have a shape corresponding to the existing space between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b>. It is contemplated that this will result in the surfaces <b>952</b> and <b>954</b> being spaced apart by different distances between different portions of the moveable implant <b>950</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0569" num="0568">For example, the distance between the upper surface <b>952</b> and lower surface <b>954</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> may be relatively large adjacent to a medial edge portion of the moveable implant <b>950</b>. The distance between the upper and lower surfaces <b>952</b> and <b>954</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> may be relatively small adjacent to a lateral edge portion of the moveable implant. As was previously mentioned, it is contemplated that images be generated of the knee portion <b>76</b> to enable the shape of the existing space between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> to be determined and to enable the moveable implant <b>950</b> to be configured, outside of the patient's body, to a configuration which generally conforms to the configuration of the space between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b>. Once the moveable implant <b>950</b> has been initially shaped to a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the space between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b>, the implant is positioned between the surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0570" num="0569">It is contemplated that the moveable implant <b>950</b> may be relatively thin compared to the thickness of the moveable implant illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>. This would result in the upper surface <b>952</b> of the moveable implant <b>950</b> being spaced apart from the lower surface <b>954</b> of the moveable implant by a relatively small distance. By forming the moveable implant <b>950</b> with a relatively small thickness, that is, the distance between the upper surface <b>952</b> and the lower surface <b>954</b>, the implant will be relatively flexible. This enables the implant to be deflected by force transmitted between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0571" num="0570">It is contemplated that a relatively flexible moveable implant <b>950</b> may be configured so as to readily fit into an existing space in the knee portion <b>76</b>. This would result in a tendency for the moveable implant <b>950</b> to become seated on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. The moveable implant <b>950</b> would be seated on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> by force applied against the moveable implant by the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b>. The lower surface of the moveable implant would be permanently deflected to have a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the upper surface <b>960</b> in the tibia <b>214</b>. The upper surface <b>952</b> of the moveable implant would have an overall configuration which may differ from the configuration of the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b>. However, even though the configuration of the upper surface <b>952</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> is different than the configuration on the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b>, there would be smooth sliding engagement between the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and the upper surface <b>952</b> of the moveable implant <b>950</b>. The result would be that there would be relatively little movement between the lower surface <b>954</b> of the moveable implant <b>950</b> and the surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b> during bending of the knee portion <b>76</b>. However, there would be a relatively large amount of movement between the upper surface <b>952</b> of the implant <b>950</b> and the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b>. Since the moveable implant <b>950</b> would be permanently deflected to have a configuration corresponding to the space between the existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, the existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> would cooperate with the moveable implant <b>950</b> without inducing pain in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0572" num="0571">It is contemplated that the moveable implant <b>950</b> may be formed of many different materials. For example, the moveable implant <b>950</b> may be formed of a biological material. For example, the moveable implant <b>950</b> may be formed of allograft or autograft or xenograft. Combinations of these graft materials may be utilized. These graft materials may be shaped in the manner disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,219. The moveable implant <b>950</b> may be formed of the same materials as the implant <b>626</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 45</figref> if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0573" num="0572">It is believed that it may be desired to form the moveable implant <b>950</b> of metal. For example, the moveable implant <b>950</b> could be formed of chromium, titanium, tantalum, zirconium or aluminum. The metal forming a moveable implant may or may not have a porous construction. The metal forming the moveable implant <b>950</b> would have a wettable surface which can be wetted by body fluids to provide lubricity. If the moveable implant <b>950</b> is formed of a porous metal, the metal may be impregnated with one or more polymeric materials which function as lubricants.</p>
<p id="p-0574" num="0573">The moveable implant <b>950</b> may be formed of a ceramic material. The ceramic material of the moveable implant may have either a porous or non-porous construction. When the ceramic material of the moveable implant <b>950</b> has a porous construction, it is contemplated that the openings in the ceramic material will be filled with a lubricant to facilitate relative movement between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> and the surfaces <b>952</b> and <b>954</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0575" num="0574">When the moveable implant <b>950</b> is formed of a porous material, for example a porous metal or a porous ceramic, it is contemplated that the moveable implant could be impregnated with both a bone growth promoting material and a lubricant. For example, the portion of the porous moveable implant <b>950</b> adjacent to the upper surface <b>952</b> of the implant may be impregnated with a lubricant. The portion of the moveable implant <b>950</b> adjacent to the lower surface <b>954</b> may be impregnated with bone growth inductive materials.</p>
<p id="p-0576" num="0575">With such a construction, the lower surface <b>954</b> of the moveable implant is configured to correspond to the configuration of the surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b>. Therefore, the moveable implant will tend to become seated on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. Once this has occurred, the bone growth promoting materials in the porous implant <b>950</b>, adjacent to the lower surface <b>954</b> of the implant, will promote growth of bone into the moveable implant <b>950</b> to connect the moveable implant with the tibia <b>214</b>. The lubricant in the porous material adjacent to the upper surface <b>952</b> of the moveable implant <b>950</b> will minimize friction with the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b> so that there will be minimal tendencies for the moveable implant <b>950</b> to move relative to the tibia <b>214</b> once the moveable implant has become seated on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia. Of course, this will facilitate the growth of bone between the surface <b>960</b> on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> and the moveable implant <b>950</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0577" num="0576">The moveable implant <b>950</b> may be formed of graft materials which have been shaped in the manner disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,219. If desired, the moveable implant <b>950</b> may have a three dimensional scaffold or framework structure on which graft materials are disposed. The framework on which the graft materials are disposed may have sufficient flexibility to enable the moveable implant <b>950</b> to be flexed to correspond to the configuration of the surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b> by force applied against the upper surface <b>952</b> of the moveable implant by the femur <b>126</b>. The graft materials on the scaffold will be shaped by the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b> to form the upper surface <b>952</b> of the implant with the configuration which corresponds to the configuration of the surface <b>958</b> on the femur.</p>
<p id="p-0578" num="0577">It is contemplated that the moveable implant <b>950</b> may be formed of materials which degrade with the passage of time. Thus, after the implant <b>950</b> has been disposed in the knee portion <b>76</b> of a patient's leg <b>70</b> for a predetermined period of time, for example two years, it may be necessary to replace the moveable implant <b>950</b>. Due to the limited incision required to enable the implant <b>950</b> to be positioned in the knee portion <b>76</b>, it is a relatively simple operation to replace the moveable implant <b>950</b>. The size of the incision and the trauma induced in the patient by replacing the moveable implant <b>950</b> may be minimized by the use of a cannula corresponding to the cannula <b>564</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. The cannula through which the implant <b>950</b> is moved into the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient's leg may have a construction similar to the construction illustrated in U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0579" num="0578">Seating of the moveable implant on the tibia <b>214</b> may be promoted by forming the moveable implant of a hydrophilic material which absorbs body fluids and expands. When the implant <b>950</b> of hydrophilic material is positioned in the space between the surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, the hydrophilic material of the implant will absorb body fluids and expand to fully occupy the space. This will result in the lower surface <b>954</b> of the moveable implant <b>950</b> being pressed firmly against the surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b>. Similarly, the upper surface <b>952</b> on the moveable implant <b>950</b> will be pressed against the surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b> as the moveable implant absorbs body fluids and expands.

Depending upon the condition of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>, the bone may or may not be cut away to form the recess <b>972</b>. Thus, the recess may be formed in tissues, such as fibrous tissues, associated with the end portion of the bone at the proximal end portion of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0583" num="0582">The moveable implant <b>970</b> may be held in position relative to the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> by engagement with the recess <b>972</b>. If this is done, tissue growth promoting materials and/or materials which promote biological resurfacing may be provided in the moveable implant <b>970</b>. These materials would promote the growth of tissue adjacent to the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> into the moveable implant <b>970</b>. The biological resurfacing materials would promote the growth of naturally occurring tissues, which were not removed to form the recess <b>972</b>, into the moveable implant <b>970</b>. Thus, cartilage tissues located adjacent to the peripheral aspect of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b> would grow into the moveable implant <b>970</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0584" num="0583">It should be understood that the recess <b>972</b> may have a lower surface formed by the existing surface <b>960</b> of the tibia and side surfaces formed by fibrocartilage which extends around the periphery of the moveable implant <b>970</b>. It is believed that it will be desired to position the moveable implant <b>970</b> in the recess <b>972</b> without anchoring the moveable implant to the tibia <b>214</b>. However, if desired, an adhesive such as fibrin could be utilized to connect the moveable implant with the existing surface <b>960</b> on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia. The moveable implant <b>970</b> may have any one of the constructions previously described in conjunction with the implant <b>640</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46 and 48</figref> or the multi layered implant <b>670</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0585" num="0584">The moveable implant <b>950</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref> is formed as one piece. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>, the moveable implant <b>980</b> is formed with a plurality of pieces. The moveable implant <b>980</b> is disposed between a medial portion of the distal end portion <b>124</b> of a femur <b>126</b> and a medial portion of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of a tibia <b>214</b>. The moveable implant <b>960</b> is positioned between an existing surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and an existing surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b>. The moveable implant <b>980</b> includes an upper section <b>982</b> and a lower section <b>984</b>. The upper section <b>982</b> has an upper surface <b>988</b> which engages the existing surface <b>958</b> on the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. The upper section <b>982</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b> has a lower surface <b>990</b> which engages the lower section <b>984</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0586" num="0585">The lower section <b>984</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b> has a lower surface <b>994</b> which engages the existing surface <b>960</b> on the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>. In addition, the lower section <b>984</b> of the implant <b>980</b> has an upper surface <b>986</b> which engages a lower surface <b>990</b> on the upper section <b>982</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0587" num="0586">The surfaces on the moveable implant <b>980</b> which engage existing surfaces on the femur <b>126</b> or tibia <b>214</b> are shaped to conform to the configuration of the existing surfaces on the femur and the tibia. To enable the surfaces on the moveable implant to be shaped to conform to the configuration of existing surfaces on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, images of the femur and tibia are generated utilizing known imaging apparatus, such as an MRI, X-ray, or fluoroscope. These images are utilized to determine the configuration of the existing surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and the existing surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b>. The upper surface <b>988</b> on the upper section <b>982</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b> is then shaped to a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the existing surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>156</b>. The lower surface <b>994</b> on the lower section <b>984</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b> is shaped to a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the existing surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b>. By shaping the upper and lower surfaces <b>988</b> and <b>994</b> on the implant <b>990</b> to conform to the shape of the existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, the upper and lower sections <b>982</b> and <b>984</b> tend to seat themselves on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. Thus, the upper surface <b>988</b> on the upper section <b>982</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b> becomes seated against the existing surface <b>958</b> on the femur <b>126</b> under the influence of force transmitted between the existing surface <b>958</b> on the femur and the upper surface <b>988</b> on the upper section <b>982</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b>. Similarly, the lower surface <b>994</b> on the lower section <b>984</b> of the implant <b>980</b> becomes seated against the existing surface <b>960</b> on the tibia <b>214</b> under the influence of force applied to the upper surface <b>996</b> on the lower section <b>984</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b> by the upper section <b>982</b> of the moveable implant.</p>
<p id="p-0588" num="0587">The lower surface <b>990</b> on the upper section <b>982</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b> and the upper surface <b>996</b> on the lower section <b>984</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b> are shaped to promote the desired articulation in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b>. Once the two sections <b>982</b> and <b>984</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b> have been positioned between the existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>, relative movement occurs where the lower surface <b>990</b> on the upper section <b>982</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b> engages the upper surface <b>996</b> on the lower section <b>984</b> of the moveable implant. This tends to minimize any pain or discomfort resulting from defects in the existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> during bending of the knee portion <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0589" num="0588">The upper section <b>982</b> and lower section <b>984</b> may be formed of the same materials or any combination of the same materials as previously described in conjunction with the moveable implant <b>950</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>. Although the upper section <b>982</b> and lower section <b>984</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b> are formed of the same material, it is contemplated that the upper section <b>982</b> could be formed of a material which is different than the material forming the lower section <b>984</b> of the moveable implant <b>980</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0590" num="0589">The moveable implant <b>980</b> will be positioned in the space between the existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b> in the manner previously discussed in conjunction with the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>.

The patella <b>120</b> may then be offset to one side. Alternatively, the patella may remain in its initial position or be offset just slightly to provide sufficient space to insert the moveable implant <b>980</b>. It is contemplated that the knee portion <b>76</b> will be inspected utilizing fiberoptic devices similar to the endoscope <b>352</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>. An expandable cannula corresponding to the cannula <b>364</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, may be inserted into the incision and the endoscope and/or the moveable implant <b>980</b> inserted into the knee portion <b>76</b> through the expandable cannula.</p>

<p id="p-0591" num="0590">In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>, the moveable implant <b>980</b> has upper and lower sections <b>982</b> and <b>984</b> which are moveable relative to each other and relative to the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>, a moveable implant <b>1002</b> has a section which is fixedly connected with a bone in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>, the moveable implant <b>1002</b> includes an upper section <b>1006</b> and a lower section <b>1008</b>. The upper section <b>1006</b> of the implant <b>1002</b> is freely moveable relative to the femur <b>126</b>. The lower section <b>1008</b> of the moveable implant <b>1002</b> is anchored to the tibia <b>214</b>.

<p id="p-0592" num="0591">The upper section <b>1006</b> and lower section <b>1008</b> of the moveable implant <b>1002</b> are formed of the same material as previously discussed in conjunction with the moveable implant <b>950</b>. The upper and lower sections <b>1006</b> and <b>1008</b> of the moveable implant <b>1002</b> are positioned in the space between the existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> through a cannula which corresponds to the cannula <b>564</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>.

<p id="p-0594" num="0593">In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>, the moveable implant <b>950</b> is freely moveable relative to the existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>, a moveable implant <b>1020</b> is connected with the medial collateral ligament <b>1022</b>. Although the moveable implant <b>1020</b> is disposed between and is freely moveable relative to existing surfaces <b>958</b> and <b>960</b> on the femur <b>126</b> an the tibia <b>214</b>, the connection between the moveable implant <b>1020</b> and the medial collateral ligament <b>1022</b> limits the range of movement of the moveable implant <b>1020</b> relative to the existing surface <b>958</b> on a medial portion of the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. Similarly, the connection between the moveable implant <b>1020</b> and the medial collateral ligament <b>1022</b> limits the range of movement of the implant <b>1020</b> relative to the existing surface <b>960</b> on a medial portion of the proximal end portion <b>212</b> of the tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0595" num="0594">The moveable implant <b>1020</b> has the same construction as the moveable implant <b>950</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>. However, the moveable implant <b>1020</b> is provided with a small passage or opening which enables a suture <b>1026</b> to be used to interconnect the moveable implant <b>1020</b> and the ligament <b>1022</b>. The suture <b>1026</b> extends through the opening in the moveable implant <b>1020</b> and extends around the ligament <b>1022</b>. The suture <b>1026</b> holds the moveable implant <b>1020</b> in engagement with the ligament <b>1022</b>. This results in a side surface <b>1030</b> on the moveable implant <b>1020</b> being held in intimate apposition with the ligament <b>1022</b>. Due to engagement of the side surface <b>1030</b> on the moveable implant <b>1020</b> with the ligament <b>1022</b>, tissue can grow from the ligament into the moveable implant <b>1020</b> to further interconnect the ligament and the movable implant.</p>
<p id="p-0596" num="0595">It is contemplated that the moveable implant <b>1020</b> will have a construction which promotes the in growth of tissue from the ligament <b>1022</b> into the implant.

The saw cut and resulting slot extend only part way through the tibia <b>214</b>. The wedge member <b>1080</b> is then moved into the slot. As the wedge member is forced into the slot, the wedge member pivots an upper portion of the tibia <b>214</b> in a counter-clockwise direction (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>) relative to a lower portion of the tibia to correct a deformity in the tibia or to compensate for a deformity in the femur <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0612" num="0611">Although the wedge member <b>1080</b> has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref> as being installed in the tibia <b>214</b>, it is contemplated that the wedge member could be installed in the femur <b>126</b> if desired. Although the wedge member <b>1080</b> has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref> as being installed in a medial portion of the tibia <b>214</b>, the wedge member <b>1080</b> could be installed in a posterior, anterior or lateral portion of the tibia if desired. The wedge member <b>1080</b> has the same construction and cooperates with the femur in the same manner as is disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,593.</p>
<p id="p-0613" num="0612">It is contemplated that the patient's leg <b>70</b> will be in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> during installation of any one of the implants illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59-66</figref>. However, the implants could be positioned in the patient's leg with the patient's leg in a different orientation if desired. Thus, any one of the implants of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59-66</figref> could be placed in the patient's leg with the patient's leg in either the flexed or extended orientation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0614" num="0613">The foregoing description of the moveable implants of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59-66</figref> has been in conjunction with the knee portion <b>76</b> of a patient's leg <b>70</b>.

For example, any one of the implants of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59-66</figref> could be utilized in association with a glenoid joint. Alternatively, any one of the implants could be used in association with an ankle, wrist or elbow joint. It is contemplated that any one of the many different features of the present invention may be utilized separately or in association with the implants illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59-66</figref> and that the implants may be used in association with any desired joint in a patient's body.</p>

<p id="p-0615" num="0614">As previously detailed, one aspect of the present invention is the performance of all or a portion of a surgical procedure through a cannula. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 68-74</figref> show one embodiment of this aspect as applied to the hip joint. Access to acetabulum <b>1100</b> and proximal portion of femur <b>1102</b> may be obtained through a cannula <b>1104</b>. Cannula <b>1104</b> is inserted into incision <b>1106</b>, which is formed with a relatively short length (generally less than 10 cm in length) in the manner previously described herein. Cannula <b>1104</b> has an initial size, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, which stretches the viscoelastic tissue around the hip joint. Therefore, initial insertion of cannula <b>1104</b> into incision <b>1106</b> is effective to expand the incision.</p>
<p id="p-0616" num="0615"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref> shows one manner in which guidance of the cannula (and any subsequent surgical implement going therethrough) to the desired location can be facilitated. A guide wire <b>1108</b> having a sharp tip is driven through femur <b>1102</b> and pinned to bone. Although guide wire <b>1108</b> is shown pinned to acetabulum <b>1100</b>, guide wire <b>1108</b> can be pinned to femur <b>1102</b>, as discussed below. Pinning guide wire <b>1108</b> to bone helps to ensure that the location of cannula <b>1104</b> remains relatively constant during the surgical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0617" num="0616">A pilot hole can be created through femur <b>1102</b> to help insert guide wire <b>1108</b>. Additionally, the creation of this pilot hole and/or the insertion of guide wire <b>1108</b> can be done under imaging guidance, such as fluoroscopy. Additionally, the proximal end of guide wire <b>1108</b> or cannula <b>1104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref>) can include an IR reflector <b>1109</b> for use with a computer surgical navigation system to monitor the location of guide wire <b>1108</b>. As is well known, IR reflector <b>1109</b> can alternatively be an electromagnetic radiation transmitter or receiver depending on the specific computer surgical navigation system.</p>
<p id="p-0618" num="0617">Cannula <b>1104</b> is advantageously expandable to further stretch the viscoelastic tissue. Of course, expanding cannula <b>1104</b> increases the size of a passage <b>1110</b> formed by an inner side <b>1112</b> of cannula <b>1104</b>, thereby enabling a relatively large object to pass through the passage. Thus, cannula <b>1104</b> may be expanded to facilitate movement of surgical implements, such as implants and instruments through the cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0619" num="0618">It is contemplated that expandable cannula <b>1104</b> may have many different known constructions. The illustrated cannula <b>1104</b> is formed of elastomeric material and has the same construction as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,338,730. It should be understood that cannula <b>1104</b> could have a different construction, for example, a construction similar to the constructions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,811,449 or 5,183,464.</p>
<p id="p-0620" num="0619">Cannula <b>1104</b> can be expanded in many different ways other than under the influence of force transmitted directly to the cannula from an object moving through the cannula. Cannula <b>1104</b> may be expanded by inserting tubular members into the cannula. Alternatively, fluid pressure could be used to expand cannula <b>1104</b> in the manner disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,338,730.</p>
<p id="p-0621" num="0620">By utilizing expandable cannula <b>1104</b> or the expandable pneumatic retractors previously disclosed, force can be applied against opposite sides of incision <b>1106</b> to stretch the viscoelastic material disposed adjacent to opposite sides of the incision. This will result in the relatively small incision <b>1106</b> being expanded to accommodate relatively large surgical instruments and/or implants.</p>
<p id="p-0622" num="0621">Once cannula <b>1104</b> is inserted, guide wire <b>1108</b> can be removed if desired. Alternatively, guide wire <b>1108</b> can be used to direct insertion of other surgical implements. Regardless of whether guide wire <b>1108</b> is removed, cannula <b>1104</b> can be moved or pivoted about incision <b>1106</b> so that its location can be varied. This is particularly useful, for example, if the area surrounding the surgical site needs to be accessed.</p>
<p id="p-0623" num="0622">Although a single incision <b>1106</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, it is contemplated that a plurality of incisions could be provided. Thus, a small incision may be spaced from the incision <b>1106</b> to enable a suctioning tool to be moved into the hip joint along a path which is spaced from and may be transverse to a path along which a cutting tool is moved through the incision <b>1106</b>. A second cannula, which is smaller than the cannula <b>1106</b>, may be utilized with the second incision.</p>
<p id="p-0624" num="0623">If desired, tissue retractors and/or dissectors can be used to create space between the soft tissue and the bones of the hip joint. Prior art mechanical dissectors and retractors can be used. It is also contemplated that fluid operated retractors, expanders, and/or dissectors may be used to retract, expand or dissect body tissue. For example, retractors having a construction similar to any one of the constructions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,197,971 may be utilized to release tissue at locations spaced from incision <b>1106</b>. When tissue is to be released at locations where there is limited accessibility from incision <b>1106</b>, a device similar to any one of the devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,295,994 may be utilized. It is believed that devices similar to those disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/526,949 filed Mar. 16, 2000 may be used in ways similar to those disclosed therein to move and/or release body tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0625" num="0624">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref>, a fluid operated device <b>1114</b> is inserted through cannula <b>1104</b> so that a bladder <b>1116</b> is placed between soft tissue <b>1117</b> and acetabulum <b>1100</b> and femur <b>1102</b>. Bladder <b>1116</b> is inflated by fluid introduced via tubing <b>1118</b> to move soft tissue <b>1117</b> relative to acetabulum <b>1100</b> and femur <b>1102</b>. Fluid operated device <b>1114</b> may be formed of biodegradable or non-biodegradable material. If bladder <b>1116</b> and tubing <b>1118</b> are formed of a biodegradable material, they need not be removed prior to closing of incision <b>1106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0626" num="0625">In the case of a hip replacement surgery (total or partial), a reamer is typically used to create a uniform cavity for the acetabular component and/or an oscillating blade is typically used to remove a portion of the femoral head so that the femoral component can be received in the medullary canal of the femur. In this regard, compact cutting tools, similar to those utilized for arthroscopic, endoscopic, or fiber optic assisted surgery may be at least partially moved through passage <b>1110</b> to affect in situ removal of bone. The cutting tools may have a construction similar to the construction illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,695 or 5,609,603. Alternatively, the cutting tools may have a construction similar to the construction disclosed in published U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0055755 A1.</p>
<p id="p-0627" num="0626">U.S. Pat. No. 5,269,785 also discloses a tissue removal system and method that can be used with the limited incision system according to the present invention. This patent discloses a device with a flexible shaft and a controllable tip. Furthermore, the device can be single lumen or multi-lumen, with a cannula if desired. The cutting tip can be controlled via valves, pneumatics, radio control, fiberoptic control, electric wire control, cable control, or pneumatic control. Multiple movable segments or a single movable segment can provide the flexibility. Joints can be provided between rigid sections. The flexibility and controllability are particularly useful in limited incision procedures. For example, the device can be bent over a 60-90&#xb0; angle, and then selectively remove osteophytes at the edge of the tissue without damaging the associated tissue. Furthermore, the option of suction provides for tissue removal and the option of irrigation minimizes heat necrosis in the limited operative space.</p>
<p id="p-0628" num="0627">The reaming of the acetabulum can be done in a single pass with a single reamer, or a plurality of progressively larger reamers can be used. Guide wire <b>1108</b> is particularly helpful with multiple reamers since the locking of guide wire <b>1108</b> with respect to acetabulum <b>1100</b> helps ensure that each reamer is reaming about the same central axis.</p>
<p id="p-0629" num="0628"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 70A-70B</figref> show another embodiment of a tissue removing surgical instrument particularly useful for minimally invasive hip replacement surgeries. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70A</figref> shows tissue removing surgical instrument <b>1120</b> in a retracted position so that instrument <b>1120</b> can move freely within lumen <b>1110</b> of cannula <b>1104</b>. Instrument <b>1120</b> is provided with a cannulation <b>1122</b> along a shaft <b>1123</b> so that instrument <b>1120</b> can be moved along guide wire <b>1108</b>. Upon activation, distal end <b>1124</b> of instrument <b>1120</b> assumes the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70B</figref>. Concave underside <b>1126</b> of the cup-shaped distal end <b>1124</b> has at least one cutting surface <b>1128</b> so that rotation of instrument <b>1120</b> in conjunction with retrograde movement of instrument <b>1120</b>, i.e. movement in the direction of arrow <b>1130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>), causes removal of the bone forming the head of femur <b>1102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0630" num="0629">Convex top side <b>1132</b> of the cup-shaped distal end <b>1124</b> has at least one cutting surface <b>1134</b> (shown in the form of gratings typical of prior art acetabular reamers) so that rotation of instrument <b>1120</b> in conjunction with antegrade movement of instrument <b>1120</b>, i.e. movement in the direction of arrow <b>1136</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>), causes reaming of acetabulum <b>1100</b>. Instrument <b>1120</b> can be provided with irrigation and suctioning capacities, as taught in published U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0055755 A1 to minimize heat necrosis and aid in the evacuation of the removed bone. Alternatively, a separate suctioning, and if desired, irrigation device, can be used. The separate device(s) can extend through cannula <b>1104</b> or an additional cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0631" num="0630">Activation of instrument <b>1120</b> can occur in a number of different ways. For example, rotational movement of instrument <b>1120</b> alone can cause instrument <b>1120</b> to go from the retracted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70A</figref>) to the extended position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70B</figref>). U.S. Pat. No. 5,445,639 teaches one such rotational mechanism. Alternatively, fluid pressure, cable means, or other similar mechanisms can be used for activation.</p>
<p id="p-0632" num="0631">After removal of the head of femur <b>1102</b> and reaming of acetabulum <b>1100</b>, the cutting tool or tools can be withdrawn from the hip joint. In the case of instrument <b>1120</b>, instrument <b>1120</b> can be pulled back through passage <b>1110</b>, with distal end <b>1124</b> in the retracted position, or in the expanded position if the diameter of passage <b>1110</b> permits and the surgeon so desires. Alternatively, distal end <b>1124</b> can be separated from the rest of instrument <b>1120</b>, for example by cutting off and removal through a separate incision.</p>
<p id="p-0633" num="0632">It should be noted that the reaming of acetabulum <b>1100</b> and removal of the head of femur <b>1102</b> can be done with minimal, i.e. subluxation, or no dislocation of the hip joint. As previously noted, access to the joint space can be increased by movement of cannula <b>1104</b>. Additionally, the joint space can be manipulated remotely. For example and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, an elongate member <b>1138</b>, such as a Schanz screw, can be inserted through a stab wound and attached to femur <b>1102</b>. Elongate member <b>1138</b> can be used as a lever arm to increase the access to the hip joint. As a result of the reduction or elimination of dislocation, the interoperative strain on the soft tissue surrounding the hip joint is minimized. Any damage or cutting of soft tissue is also minimized. These features limit post-operative pain and lead to quicker surgical recovery.</p>
<p id="p-0634" num="0633">The present invention also envisions insertion of some or all of the implant components through cannula <b>1104</b>. This concept will be illustrated with a description of the procedure for an acetabular component. An analogous procedure for the femoral component can be used and a procedure for use with the knee has been described above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref> shows the backing <b>1140</b> (typically made of a metal) of an acetabular component being inserted. Cannula <b>1104</b> is in an expanded state to accommodate the backing <b>1140</b>. Alternatively, a larger non-expandable cannula could be used. Preferably, guide wire <b>1108</b> is the same guide wire that was used for cannula <b>1104</b> and tissue removing instrument <b>1120</b>. This helps to ensure that backing <b>1140</b> is implanted at the same location that the reaming occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0635" num="0634">Guide wire <b>1108</b> can be removed so that a standard liner or insert (typically made of polyethylene) can be used in conjunction with backing <b>1140</b>. Alternatively and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74A</figref>, an insert <b>1142</b> having a bore <b>1144</b> can be used so that insert <b>1142</b> can slide over guide wire <b>1108</b> in a manner similar to backing <b>1140</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74B</figref> shows another design for an insert <b>1146</b> that has a bore <b>1148</b> so that insert <b>1146</b> can slide over guide wire <b>1108</b>. One different between insert <b>1142</b> and insert <b>1146</b> is the location of bore <b>1144</b> compared to bore <b>1148</b>. Bore <b>1148</b> is placed in an area where no articulation with the ball of the femoral component occurs. As a result, the tolerances for the edges surrounding bore <b>1148</b> are not a significant concern for the generation of wear debris. Regardless of the location, the bore can be sealed, for example with an adhesive, to help contain any wear debris and minimize migration.</p>
<p id="p-0636" num="0635">Other acetabular designs can be used. For example, the backing and liner acetabular components can be bonded together, either inside or outside of the patient. The portions may be bonded together by the application of energy in any one of many different forms, such as ultrasonic energy and heat. The present invention also envisions the application of the principles described and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 68-74</figref> to other locations in the body. Examples include the knee, the shoulder (both the glenoid and humeral components), the joints of the hand and wrist, the joints of the foot and ankle, and the spine. With respect to the spine, suitable procedures include any procedure involving the disc space and/or the vertebra, such as fusions, pedicle screw insertions, cages, or other implants.</p>
<p id="p-0637" num="0636">In knee replacement procedures, in situ reaming of the patella as well as the condyles of the femur and tibia can be performed. Specifically, a guide wire is placed over the condyles and reaming occurs over this guide wire using a mill or a cutting saw. The patella could be removed in a similar fashion with a retrograde reamer directed by a guide wire. As previously described, the milling/cutting tools could be used in conjunction with jigs that allow a plurality of intersecting straight cuts or a smooth arc cut. The jig can be mounted on the medial or lateral side. If desired, the cutting of the femur and tibia can be done using a limited incision approach and the implantation of the femur, tibia, and/or patella components can be done through a larger incision.</p>
<p id="h-0044" num="0000">Lateral/Medial Approach to Knee Replacement</p>
<p id="p-0638" num="0637">As previously discussed (see, e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> and associated text), one aspect of the present invention includes a medial or lateral approach to joint replacement and other surgeries near a joint. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 75-77</figref> show one embodiment of this aspect. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref> shows that femoral medial epicondyle <b>1150</b> is osteotomized or cut from distal end <b>1152</b> of femur <b>1102</b>. This osteotomy removes the superior attachment point of medial collateral ligament <b>1154</b> so that the joint space between femur <b>1102</b> and tibia <b>1156</b> can be pivoted open and accessed from the medial side. As an alternative, the tibial medial epicondyle <b>1158</b> could be osteotomized to separate the inferior attachment point of medial collateral ligament <b>1154</b> so that the joint space could be accessed from the medial side. Additionally, either the femoral or tibial lateral epicondyle <b>1160</b>, <b>1162</b> could be osteotomized to separate one of the attachment points of lateral collateral ligament <b>1164</b>. Furthermore, medial collateral ligament <b>1154</b> or lateral collateral ligament <b>1164</b> can be cut without the need for removal of bone, if desired. However, as healing a bone/bone interface can be easier than healing a ligament/ligament interface, separate of the ligament through an osteotomy may be preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0639" num="0638">In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> shows that femoral medial epicondyle <b>1150</b> can be reattached to distal end <b>1152</b> of femur <b>1102</b> with a screw <b>1166</b> or staple. As an alternative to screw <b>1166</b>, any method suitable for reattaching one piece of bone to another piece of bone can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0640" num="0639">By accessing the joint space from a side medial or lateral to the centerline of the joint, the incision can be made shorter, as previously discussed. Additionally, and as previously discussed, a medial or lateral incision stretches less than a direct anterior incision. With respect to the knee joint in particular, when an incision is directly over the patella, the incision length increases 30% from 0&#xb0; extension to 120&#xb0; flexion. If the incision is shifted more laterally or medially, such as over the medial collateral ligament, the incision only lengthens approximately 12% from 0&#xb0; extension to 120&#xb0; flexion. There is less stress on the soft tissue and therefore less scarring and less postoperative pain. Also by going more medial or lateral with the incision there is less damage and less disruption of the quadriceps mechanism. Furthermore, patella <b>1168</b> tends to naturally move toward the pivot location when the joint space is hinged open from either a medial or lateral approach. The natural movement of patella <b>1168</b> allows anterior access to the joint space without the need to evert patella <b>1168</b>. However, patella <b>1168</b> can be minimally subluxed and/or everted to increase the exposure of the joint space, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0641" num="0640">Returning to the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 75-77</figref>, any desired procedure can be performed within any joint space. Thus, the medial or lateral approach can be applied, for example, to the hip, shoulder, the joints of the hand and wrist, the joints of the foot and ankle, and the spine. However, this embodiment is particularly useful for knee joint replacement surgeries. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 78 and 79</figref> show one implant that can be used in this regard. In general, prior art knee prostheses for partially or totally replacing a knee joint include a femoral component for attachment to the distal end of the femur and a tibial component for attachment to the proximal end of the tibia. The tibial component typically includes a base or tray that is implanted in the tibia and an insert or meniscal plate placed on the face of the tray for articulating with the condyles of the femoral component. The tray often includes a keel or stem that inserts in the tibia to provide stability.</p>
<p id="p-0642" num="0641">In contrast, tibial tray <b>1170</b> is a modular unit comprising a base <b>1172</b> and a keel <b>1174</b>. An inferior surface <b>1176</b> of tibial tray <b>1170</b> is substantially flat so that tibial tray <b>1170</b> can be slid into position from the lateral or medial side onto previously cut or milled tibia <b>1156</b>. A side cutting jig analogous to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> or other side cutting or milling techniques can advantageously be used to prepare tibia <b>1156</b> for receiving tibial tray <b>1170</b>. Tibial tray <b>1170</b> is provided with openings <b>1178</b> that extend from a superior surface <b>1180</b> through inferior surface <b>1176</b>. Openings <b>1178</b> are sized to receive keel <b>1174</b>. As shown, keel <b>1174</b> is implanted prior to implantation of tibial tray <b>1170</b>. In another embodiment, tibial tray <b>1170</b> is implanted prior to implantation of keel <b>1174</b>. In this embodiment, openings <b>1178</b> are sized so that once tibial tray <b>1170</b> is sitting on the tibial surface, keel <b>1174</b> can be pushed or pounded through opening <b>1178</b> to secure tibial tray <b>1170</b> to tibia <b>1156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0643" num="0642">Base <b>1172</b> and keel <b>1174</b> can be provided with a locking mechanism to secure keel <b>1174</b> to base <b>1172</b>. One example of such a mechanism is a locking screw <b>1181</b> that inserts through base <b>1172</b> and keel <b>1174</b>. If keel <b>1174</b> is implanted after tibial tray <b>1170</b>, keel <b>1174</b> can also be provided with a head <b>1182</b> or other stop mechanism that prevents further insertion of keel <b>1174</b> through openings <b>1178</b> once keel <b>1174</b> has been inserted through openings <b>1178</b> a given distance. In one embodiment, head <b>1182</b> can be made to be flush with superior surface <b>1180</b> of base <b>1172</b>. In this regard, openings <b>1178</b> have a countersink <b>1184</b> for accommodating keel head <b>1182</b>. In another embodiment, head <b>1182</b> extends above superior surface <b>1180</b> even after full insertion through openings <b>1178</b> (i.e. stands proud with respect to superior surface <b>1180</b>). In this embodiment, keel head <b>1182</b> can cooperate with a bore or slit provided on the inferior surface of a tibial insert to serve as a centering mechanism for insertion (locking the tibial insert to base <b>1172</b> in a fixed bearing design) and/or articulation of the femoral and tibial components (in a mobile bearing design).</p>
<p id="p-0644" num="0643">If tibial tray <b>1170</b> were an integral single-piece unit, it would be difficult to insert tibial tray <b>1170</b> through a minimal incision, regardless of the location of the incision. However, since tibial tray <b>1170</b> is modular, base <b>1172</b> can be readily slid in through either a lateral or medial side incision (which can be smaller than typical mid-line incisions) and, keel <b>1174</b> can be interoperatively coupled to base <b>1172</b> after base <b>1172</b> is in the desired position. Keel <b>1174</b> can be inserted through the same incision as base <b>1172</b> or through a separate incision. This separate incision can be a substantially anterior incision or an incision located on the same or opposite side as the incision for base <b>1172</b>. As is well known, tibial tray <b>1170</b> can be inserted either with or without bone cement. If bone cement is used, the cement can be placed under base <b>1172</b> after it is positioned on tibia <b>1156</b> and then keel <b>1174</b> is inserted into openings <b>1178</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0645" num="0644"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref> shows another embodiment of a tibial tray <b>1186</b> that can be used with or without a keel. An inferior surface <b>1188</b> of tibial tray <b>1186</b> includes a slot <b>1190</b> extending substantially across the entire width of inferior surface <b>1188</b>. Slot <b>1190</b> provides stability for tray <b>1186</b>. Like tray <b>1170</b>, tray <b>1186</b> can be inserted from either the medial or lateral side. Slot <b>1190</b> and/or tibial tray <b>1186</b> can be provided with a bore <b>1192</b> (or a plurality of bores) for receiving a screw <b>1194</b> or other fastener to further secure tray <b>1186</b> to the tibia.</p>
<p id="p-0646" num="0645">Tibial tray <b>1186</b> also includes another feature to assist implantation. Specifically, like prior art tibial trays, tibial tray <b>1186</b> includes a rim <b>1191</b> for retaining the tibial insert or bearing surface. However, as shown, rim <b>1191</b> does not extend around the entire perimeter of tibial tray <b>1186</b>. Specifically, lateral and medial posterior regions <b>1193</b> have no rim. A centrally located section <b>1195</b> can be provided with a rim for retention of the tibial insert. The elimination of rim <b>1191</b> from posterior regions <b>1193</b>, facilitates implantation of the femoral component as there is no posterior rim in lateral an medial regions <b>1193</b> to impede impaction of the femoral component. Section <b>1195</b> will not interfere with impaction of the femoral component as the femoral component has a geometry matching the natural condyles of the femur. The novel feature of eliminating the posterior rim can be applied to different tibial tray designs and is not limited to tibial tray <b>1186</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0647" num="0646">In order to facilitate implantation of tray <b>1186</b>, a side cutting or milling jig <b>1196</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref>) can be provided with a groove <b>1198</b> having a shape that mates with slot <b>1190</b>. Thus, when tibia <b>1156</b> is cut or milled, the tibia has a recess corresponding to the shape of slot <b>1190</b>, thereby allowing tray <b>1186</b> to be readily moved into position. It should be noted that use of a jig having a groove is not necessary for implantation of tray <b>1186</b>. For example, tray <b>1186</b> can be press fit into position, either by tapping in tray <b>1186</b> in a direction along the longitudinal axis of slot <b>1190</b> or by tapping tray <b>1186</b> from the superior direction. It should also be noted that although slot <b>1190</b> is shown having a substantially dove-tail shape, slot <b>1190</b> can be made to have any suitable shape that provides stability for tray <b>1186</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0648" num="0647"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref> shows another embodiment of a tibial tray <b>1200</b> that has a novel keel design. A keel <b>1202</b> extends from an inferior surface <b>1204</b> of tibial base <b>1206</b>. A superior surface <b>1208</b> is generically shown, and, as is well known, is configured and dimensioned for receiving an insert (not shown) that articulates against a femoral component (also not shown). Tibial base <b>1206</b> has lateral and medial regions <b>1210</b>, <b>1212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0649" num="0648">When viewed from the anterior (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>) or posterior direction, keel <b>1202</b> extends downward from inferior surface <b>1204</b> at an acute angle &#x3b1;. Thus, keel <b>1202</b> extends downward toward lateral region <b>1210</b> and away from medial region <b>1212</b>. This is in contrast to prior art keels, which generally extend substantially perpendicularly and symmetrically from the tibial base. Like prior art keels, keel <b>1202</b> can be tapered and can be inclined either posteriorly or anteriorly when viewed from the medial/lateral direction. Although keel <b>1202</b> is shown as connected to inferior surface <b>1204</b> centrally located with respect to both lateral and medial regions <b>1210</b>, <b>1212</b>, keel <b>1202</b> can be offset with respect to either lateral or medial regions <b>1210</b>, <b>1212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0650" num="0649"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 83 and 84</figref> show examples of surgical approaches for which tibial tray <b>1200</b> is particularly useful. Specifically, knee joint space <b>1214</b> is accessed using a lateral approach such as the procedure previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 75-77</figref>. Since joint space <b>1214</b> is hinged or pivoted open from a lateral aspect <b>1216</b> about a medial aspect <b>1218</b>, the area of joint space <b>1214</b> that is accessible decreases from lateral aspect <b>1216</b> to medial aspect <b>1218</b>. As a result, it would be difficult to insert a typical tibial tray since the length of the keel (compared to the working space of medial aspect <b>1216</b>) would not permit proper implantation.</p>
<p id="p-0651" num="0650"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83</figref> shows one method of implanting tibial tray <b>1200</b>. Because of the size and geometry of keel <b>1202</b>, tibial tray <b>1200</b> can be inserted into joint space <b>1214</b> at an angle &#x3b2; (defined by the cut surface of tibia <b>1156</b> and superior surface <b>1208</b> of tibial tray <b>1200</b>). At angle &#x3b2;, lateral region <b>1210</b> is at the same height as medial region <b>1212</b> so that when tibial tray <b>1200</b> is initially inserted, inferior surface <b>1204</b> of medial region <b>1212</b> is in contact (or close to contact) with tibia <b>1156</b>. Thus, in order to implant tibial tray <b>1200</b> in tibia <b>1156</b>, lateral region <b>1210</b> is driven in tibia <b>1156</b>, with essentially rotation about medial region <b>1212</b> occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0652" num="0651"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84</figref> shows another method of implanting tibial tray <b>1200</b>. Here, superior surface <b>1208</b> of tibial tray <b>1200</b> is substantially parallel to the cut surface of tibia <b>1156</b>. As a result, the distal end of keel <b>1202</b> is substantially perpendicular to the cut surface of tibia <b>1156</b>. This initial substantially perpendicular relationship facilitates insertion of keel <b>1202</b> into tibia <b>1156</b>. Regardless of the method of implantation, keel <b>1202</b> can have a length so that keel <b>1202</b> does not penetrate the lateral cortex of tibia <b>1156</b> when fully inserted into tibia <b>1156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0653" num="0652">Although tibial trays <b>1170</b>, <b>1186</b>, and <b>1200</b> are, as the name implies, intended for use in the tibia, the concepts can be applied to the other components in partial or total knee replacement surgeries. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref> shows a patellar implant <b>1220</b> having a slot <b>1222</b> that engages bone. Thus, patellar implant <b>1220</b> is analogous to tibial tray <b>1186</b>. Typically, patellar implants have one or more pegs that must be driven into bone. This requires substantial working space, so that the patella needs to be everted or dislocated. In contrast, patellar implant <b>1220</b> can be slid into position without evertion and with little or no dislocation. If desired, patellar implant <b>1220</b> can be fixed into position with bone cement.</p>
<p id="p-0654" num="0653"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref> shows a femoral component <b>1224</b> that is also analogous to tibial tray <b>1186</b>. In particular, femoral component <b>1224</b> has a pair of spaced condyle sections <b>1226</b> defining curved condyle surfaces <b>1228</b>. Joining region <b>1230</b> is anterior located and connects the two condyle sections <b>1226</b>. Instead of having pins for insertion into the femur, femoral component <b>1224</b> is provided with a slot <b>1232</b> for securing femoral component <b>1224</b> to the femur. Since the pins are absent, femoral component <b>1224</b> can be slid into position from the lateral or medial side. As an alternative to slot <b>1232</b> (or in addition to slot <b>1232</b>), each of condyle sections <b>1226</b> can be provided with an aperture for receiving a fastener to secure femoral component <b>1224</b> to the femur. This design could be analogous to tibial tray <b>1170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0655" num="0654">In order to facilitate insertion of femoral component <b>1224</b> through a minimally invasive lateral or medial incision, femoral component <b>1224</b> can be made modular. This allows femoral component <b>1224</b> to be implanted in sections through an incision that would otherwise be much longer which are then coupled in vivo. As shown, femoral component <b>1224</b> comprises an anterior femoral section <b>1234</b>, and a posterior femoral section <b>1236</b>. However, any desired number of sections could be used. Anterior femoral section <b>1234</b> is coupled to posterior femoral section <b>1236</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0656" num="0655"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</figref> shows one manner of coupling the sections. A tongue <b>1238</b> located on one section (shown as anterior femoral section <b>1234</b>) mates with a groove <b>1240</b> on an adjacent section (shown as posterior femoral section <b>1236</b>). The mating results in substantially smooth condyle surfaces <b>1228</b> so as to minimize the potential for generation of wear debris.</p>
<p id="h-0045" num="0000">Self-Centering Mobile Bearing Implant</p>
<p id="p-0657" num="0656"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 88 and 89</figref> show one embodiment of a self-centering mobile bearing implant according to the present invention. An implant <b>1250</b>, in the form of a prosthetic knee, comprises a femoral component <b>1252</b> secured to femur <b>1102</b> and a tibial component <b>1254</b> secured to tibia <b>1156</b>. Femoral component <b>1252</b> includes a pair of spaced apart condyle sections <b>1256</b> defining curved condyle surfaces <b>1258</b>. A joining region <b>1260</b> is anterior located and connects the two condyle sections <b>1256</b> so that a recess <b>1262</b> is defined by condyle sections <b>1256</b> and joining region <b>1260</b>. The side of femoral component <b>1252</b> facing femur <b>1102</b> can include fixation pins <b>1264</b>. As femoral component <b>1252</b> has a structure and function analogous to prior art femoral components, further description is not believed necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0658" num="0657">Tibial component <b>1254</b> includes a tray <b>1266</b> and a bearing insert <b>1268</b>. Tray <b>1266</b> is defined by a tapered keel or spike <b>1270</b> and a plate member <b>1272</b>. As previously discussed with respect to other embodiments, other mechanisms for fixing tibial component <b>1254</b> can be used as an alternative to spike <b>1270</b>. Plate member <b>1272</b> has a superior surface <b>1274</b> defined by a concave, spherically shaped plateau surface.</p>
<p id="p-0659" num="0658">As is more fully described below, bearing insert <b>1268</b> also has a spherically shaped surface so that the interface between tibial tray <b>1266</b> and bearing insert <b>1268</b> is defined by cooperating spherically shaped, concave and convex surfaces that enable sliding motions along these surfaces. In this regard, superior surface <b>1274</b> has a mirror polish to minimize friction during relative slidable movements of bearing insert <b>1268</b>. Additionally, superior surface <b>1274</b> is provided with a track <b>1276</b> that cooperates with a groove located on bearing insert <b>1268</b> so that the sliding motion occurs substantially in the anterior-posterior direction. Although a single track <b>1276</b> is shown centrally located, track <b>1276</b> can be located elsewhere along superior surface <b>1274</b> and/or more than one track can be used (e.g. two lateral symmetrically placed tracks). Also, the arrangement of the track and groove can be switched so that bearing insert <b>1268</b> is provided with the track and superior surface <b>1274</b> is provided with the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0660" num="0659">Bearing insert <b>1268</b> has a superior surface <b>1278</b> that includes a pair of spaced apart curved depressions <b>1280</b> that form bearing surfaces for condyle surfaces <b>1258</b> of femoral component <b>1252</b>. Condyle surfaces <b>1258</b> and depressions <b>1280</b> are shaped so that pivoting motion between femoral component <b>1252</b> and bearing insert <b>1268</b> can occur over a wide range of motion. A protrusion <b>1282</b> can be located between depressions <b>1280</b> so that extension of protrusion <b>1282</b> into recess <b>1262</b> of femoral component <b>1252</b> substantially prevents hyperextension (counterclockwise rotation beyond a certain point) of femoral component <b>1252</b>. Interference between protrusion <b>1282</b> and recess <b>1262</b> also prevents relative motion in the lateral-medial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0661" num="0660">Bearing insert <b>1268</b> has an inferior surface <b>1284</b> that is convex and spherically shaped and mates with concave superior surface <b>1274</b> of tibial tray <b>1266</b>. A groove <b>1286</b> is located on inferior surface <b>1284</b> and is configured and dimensioned to receive track <b>1276</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0662" num="0661">As is evident from the foregoing, implant <b>1250</b> operates like prior art mobile bearing knee implants in the occurrence of sliding motion between bearing insert <b>1268</b> and both femoral and tibial tray <b>1266</b> components <b>1252</b>. However, unlike prior art mobile bearing knee implants that rely on tracks and grooves to substantially limit the movement to the anterior-posterior direction, the articulating surfaces are not flat. Rather, superior surface <b>1274</b> of tibial tray <b>1266</b> and inferior surface <b>1284</b> of bearing insert <b>1268</b> are mating curved surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0663" num="0662">With the prior art flat surfaces, there is increased risk for dislocation and variable degrees of laxity. Additionally, ligament balancing and self-centering of the joint may be more difficult, allowing for some feelings of instability and/or ligamentous laxity. Because superior surface <b>1274</b> of tibial tray <b>1266</b> and inferior surface <b>1284</b> of bearing insert <b>1268</b> are mating curved surfaces, the curvature toward the center of the tibia encourages bearing insert <b>1268</b> to want to fall back into the center of the curvature of superior surface <b>1274</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0664" num="0663">In order to enhance ligament stability, tray <b>1266</b> and/or bearing insert <b>1268</b> can be made to have a thickness that increases from the center toward the edge. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 88 and 89</figref>, this increase in thickness can occur in both the anterior-posterior direction and the medial-lateral direction. Thus, as bearing insert <b>1268</b> slides, both the curvature and decrease in thickness cooperate as a self-centering mechanism that draws bearing insert <b>1268</b> back to the center of the tibia (also resisting posterior rollback), the lowest point in tibial tray <b>1266</b> when they are at rest. This enhances stability, yet allows free motion and a mobile bearing construct.</p>
<p id="p-0665" num="0664">The curvature of inferior surface <b>1284</b> of bearing insert <b>1268</b> can be made to match the curvature of superior surface <b>1274</b> of tibial tray <b>1266</b>. Alternatively, the curvatures can be different. For example, the curvature of inferior surface <b>1284</b> can be smaller than the curvature of superior surface <b>1274</b>. Regardless of whether of curvatures match, the curvature of inferior surface <b>1284</b> and/or superior surface <b>1274</b> can be constant or have a radius which progressively varies.</p>
<p id="p-0666" num="0665">Each of femoral component <b>1252</b>, tibial tray <b>1266</b>, and bearing insert <b>1268</b> can be made of any suitable biocompatible material. For example, femoral component <b>1252</b> and tibial tray <b>1266</b> can both be made of a metallic material such as a cobalt-chromium alloy or titanium alloy, and bearing insert <b>1268</b> can be made of a polymer such as UHMW polyethylene. This provides metal articulating against a polymer. Additionally and as previously discussed with respect to other embodiments, this can be reversed so that femoral component <b>1252</b> and tibial tray <b>1266</b> are made of a polymer and bearing insert <b>1268</b> is made of a metallic material.</p>
<p id="p-0667" num="0666"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</figref> shows another embodiment of the self-centering mechanism according to the present invention. An implant <b>1290</b> in the form of a rotating platform knee implant includes a tibial component <b>1292</b> secured to the tibia and a femoral component secured to the femur. As the femoral component used with implant <b>1290</b> is analogous to femoral component <b>1252</b>, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 88 and 89</figref> and accompanying text and further description is not believed necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0668" num="0667">Tibial component <b>1292</b> includes a tray <b>1294</b> and a bearing insert <b>1296</b>. Tray <b>1294</b> includes a tapered spike <b>1298</b> and a plate member <b>1300</b>. As was the case for tibial component <b>1254</b>, other mechanisms for fixing tibial component <b>1292</b> can be used as an alternative to spike <b>1298</b>. Plate member <b>1300</b> has a superior surface <b>1302</b> defined by a concave, spherically shaped plateau surface.</p>
<p id="p-0669" num="0668">Analogous to bearing insert <b>1268</b>, bearing insert <b>1296</b> also has a spherically shaped inferior surface <b>1304</b> so that the interface between tibial tray <b>1294</b> and bearing insert <b>1296</b> is defined by cooperating spherically shaped, concave and convex surfaces that enable sliding motions along these surfaces. In this regard, superior surface <b>1302</b> has a mirror polish to minimize friction during relative slidable movements of bearing insert <b>1296</b>. Additionally, superior surface <b>1302</b> is provided with a post <b>1306</b> that cooperates with a recess <b>1308</b> located on bearing insert <b>1296</b> to permit rotation of bearing insert <b>1296</b> with respect to tibial tray <b>1294</b>. The arrangement of the post and recess can be switched so that bearing insert <b>1296</b> is provided with the post and superior surface <b>1302</b> is provided with the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0670" num="0669">As is evident from the foregoing, implant <b>1290</b> operates like prior art mobile bearing knee implants in the occurrence of rotation motion between bearing insert <b>1296</b> and both femoral and tibial tray components <b>1292</b>. However, unlike prior art mobile bearing knee implants that rely on a post mechanism to control the rotational movement, the articulating surfaces are not flat. Rather, superior surface <b>1302</b> of tibial tray <b>1294</b> and inferior surface <b>1304</b> of bearing insert <b>1296</b> are mating curved surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0671" num="0670">Compared to the prior art, implant <b>1290</b>, like implant <b>1250</b>, provides improved dislocation risk, ligament balancing, and ligament stability. In order to enhance ligament stability, tray <b>1294</b> and/or bearing insert <b>1296</b> can be made to have a thickness that increases from the center toward the edge. Thus, as bearing insert <b>1296</b> slides, both the curvature and decrease in thickness cooperate as a self-centering mechanism that draws bearing insert <b>1296</b> back to the center of post <b>1306</b> (also resisting posterior rollback), the lowest point in tibial tray <b>1294</b> when they are at rest. This enhances stability, yet allows free motion and a mobile bearing construct.</p>
<p id="p-0672" num="0671">As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</figref>, post <b>1306</b> is not located directly over spike <b>1298</b>, i.e. the center of the tibia. Rather, post <b>1306</b> is offset medially toward the medial compartment of the knee. In prior art rotating platform designs, the post is substantially in line with the central keel. This design does not account for the anatomical motion of the knee, which has more motion and a greater range of motion laterally with greater anteroposterior translation laterally and less anteroposterior translation medially. Offsetting post <b>1306</b> more toward the medial compartment of the knee recreates the natural pivoting motion on the knee, with less translation medially, a more stable joint medially, and more rotational arc or more movement laterally.</p>
<p id="p-0673" num="0672">Any of the above-described embodiments of self-centering mechanism can be applied to total or partial knee replacement. These embodiments could be used in any joint, such as the shoulder, ankle, wrist, as well as others.</p>
<p id="h-0046" num="0000">Bicompartment Implants</p>
<p id="p-0674" num="0673">As previously discussed (see, e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> and associated text), the present invention includes implants that have interconnectable portions. Another embodiment of this concept is the combination of limited incision unicompartmental knee replacement with limited incision patellofemoral replacement. This combination can be done percutaneously with limited incisions, possibly one or two smaller incisions to approach the medial aspect of the knee in the patellofemoral joint.</p>
<p id="p-0675" num="0674">Arthritis typically does not involve the entire joint space. Most arthritis of the knee is medial joint, lateral joint, patellofemoral joint, or some combination of two of these three joint compartments. Usually advanced arthritis involves both the medial or lateral compartment and the patellofemoral joint. Replacement of the medial or lateral compartment through limited incision surgery and then patellofemoral replacement through the same incision or another incision will lead to faster patient rehabilitation. Additionally, limited incision replacement of these compartments that avoided everting the patellofemoral joint and reduced damage of the quadriceps mechanism would further accelerate rehabilitation.</p>
<p id="p-0676" num="0675"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</figref> shows a bicompartment arrangement that includes trochlear implant <b>1310</b> and medial implant <b>1312</b>. Implants <b>1310</b> and <b>1312</b> are dimensioned and configured so that bone <b>1314</b> is located between the implants. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92</figref> shows an embodiment of a bicompartment implant <b>1316</b> that includes trochlear section <b>1320</b> and medial section <b>1322</b>. In implant <b>1316</b>, there is no bone between the sections. Implant <b>1316</b> can be made so that sections <b>1320</b> and <b>1322</b> are integral. Alternatively, implant <b>1316</b> could be modular, being assembled inside the body or outside of the body prior to implantation.</p>
<p id="p-0677" num="0676">In the interest of brevity, the reader is referred to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> and associated text for different methods for coupling sections <b>1320</b> and <b>1322</b>. As previously discussed, the patella and the other portions of the joint can be resurfaced to receive the implant. In this regard, the resurfacing can be with a mill, saw or robotic arm and computer navigation system. The computer navigation system could also be used to assist in aligning the unicompartmental replacement with the patellofemoral joint replacement. The patellofemoral replacement could be performed from a mid-vastus or sub-vastus approach without disrupting the quadriceps mechanism. As also previously discussed, the patella could be elevated using fluid retractors or simple mechanical retractors to minimize soft tissue damage associated with dislocating or everting the patella.</p>
<p id="p-0678" num="0677"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92</figref> shows the tibial component <b>1324</b>, which articulates against medial section <b>1322</b>. Each of the components can be made of any suitable biocompatible material. For example, all of the components can be made of a metallic material such as a cobalt-chromium alloy or titanium alloy. This provides metal articulating against metal. Alternative articulating surface pairs include metal/polymer, metal/ceramic, metal/composite, polymer/ceramic, polymer/polymer, polymer/composite, ceramic/ceramic, and ceramic/composite.</p>
<p id="p-0679" num="0678">In order to reduce the generation of wear debris, the articulating surfaces can be magnetically charged to have the same polarity so that the surfaces are repelled from each other. Thus, the surfaces glide smoothly over each other, essentially floating with respect to one another. This would also potentially allow a replacement surface that is a strip or point contact, rather than being a full surface that matches the surface of the joint. This embodiment, which is described in more detail below, would include strips that glide along each other, as opposed to a full resurfacing of the joint so one would have strips in contact with each other rather than a full surface. The surface magnetic charges can diminish with time. Additionally, certain environments could also diminish the magnetic charges. For example, exposure to an MRI apparatus could severely alter the magnetic fields. In order to account for these possibilities, the magnetic charges of the articulating surfaces can be re-magnetized.</p>
<p id="p-0680" num="0679">The present invention also envisions the application of magnetically charged articulating surfaces to other implant designs and to other locations in the body. Examples include the knee, the shoulder (both the glenoid and humeral components), the joints of the hand and wrist, the joints of the foot and ankle, and the spine. With respect to the spine, suitable procedures include any procedure involving the disc space and/or the vertebra.</p>
<p id="h-0047" num="0000">Adjustable Cutting Jig</p>
<p id="p-0681" num="0680">As previously discussed, various embodiments of the present invention involve a lateral or medial approach to accessing a joint space. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref> shows an adjustable cutting jig <b>1330</b> that is particularly useful in such an approach. With the cutting jig <b>1330</b>, the femoral cuts can be made by moving a saw blade or other cutting device, such as a miller, between opposite sides of the femur in a direction extending generally perpendicular to a longitudinal central axis of the femur. Thus, the cutting device is moved along a path which extends between lateral and medial surfaces on the distal end portion <b>1332</b> of the femur <b>1334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0682" num="0681">The cutting jig <b>1330</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref> as being used on a lateral surface <b>1336</b> of the femur <b>1334</b>. However, the cutting jig <b>1330</b> could be used on the medial surface of the femur <b>1334</b> if desired. When the cutting jig <b>1330</b> is mounted on the lateral surface <b>1336</b> of the femur <b>1334</b>, the incision <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is laterally offset. Similarly, when the cutting jig <b>1330</b> is mounted on a medial surface of the femur <b>1334</b>, the incision <b>114</b> is medially offset.</p>
<p id="p-0683" num="0682">Although either intramedullary or extramedullary instrumentation can be used to attach the cutting jig <b>1330</b> to the femur <b>1334</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref> shows intramedullary instrumentation. Accordingly, the cutting jig <b>1330</b> includes a shaft <b>1338</b> that can be inserted into the medullary canal of femur <b>1334</b> in any known manner, for example using a technique analogous to that previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>. In this regard, a separate stab wound incision can be made for shaft <b>1338</b>, rather than attempting to stretch the incision <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0684" num="0683">A length adjustment member <b>1340</b> slides along shaft <b>1338</b> so that the location of length adjustment member <b>1340</b> on shaft <b>1338</b> can be changed to accommodate different anatomies. Tightening knob <b>1342</b> can be used to lock length adjustment member <b>1340</b> at the desired location. Length adjustment member <b>1340</b> can also freely rotate about shaft axis <b>1344</b>. This is useful, for example, if a medial approach is to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0685" num="0684">An arm <b>1346</b> extends from length adjustment member <b>1340</b>. Arm <b>1346</b> includes a head <b>1348</b> that is received in ring <b>1350</b> on length adjustment member <b>1340</b>. The arm <b>1346</b> can be made as two telescoping rods or a similar configuration so that the length of the arm <b>1346</b> can be adjusted. The head <b>1348</b> can rotate within the ring <b>1350</b> to allow rotation of the arm <b>1346</b>. A tightening knob <b>1352</b> locks the arm <b>1346</b> at the desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0686" num="0685">An extension <b>1354</b> extends from the lateral end of arm <b>1346</b>. Like the arm <b>1346</b>, extension <b>1354</b> can be made as two telescoping rods or a similar configuration so that the length of the extension <b>1354</b> can be adjusted. A link <b>1356</b> is generically shown to indicate that different types of joints can be used to couple the arm <b>1346</b> and the extension <b>1354</b>. For example, it may be desirable to have the extension <b>1354</b> rotate and/or pivot with respect to the arm <b>1346</b>. Regardless of the specific design of the link <b>1356</b>, a tightening knob <b>1358</b> is provided to lock the extension <b>1354</b> at the desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0687" num="0686">A cutting guide <b>1360</b> is located on an end of the extension <b>1354</b>. As was the case for link <b>1356</b>, different types of joints can be used to couple the cutting guide <b>1360</b> to the extension <b>1354</b>. The cutting guide <b>1360</b> includes a distal guide surface <b>1362</b>, an anterior chamfer guide surface <b>1364</b>, a posterior chamfer guide surface <b>1366</b>, an anterior guide surface <b>1368</b>, and a posterior guide surface <b>1370</b>. As is readily apparent, the cutting guide <b>1360</b> has a structure substantially similar to the cutting guide <b>800</b>. Furthermore, the operation and use of the cutting guide <b>1360</b> is substantially similar to that of the cutting guide <b>800</b>. Accordingly, reference is made thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0688" num="0687">Each of the guide surfaces <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b>, <b>1366</b>, <b>1368</b>, and <b>1370</b> can be made to have a length less than the extent of the cut to be formed on the distal end portion <b>1332</b> of the femur <b>1334</b>. Therefore, after an initial portion of the cut has been made utilizing the appropriate guide surface to guide movement of the cutting tool, the cut surfaces are utilized to guide movement of the cutting tool during completion of the cut. The cutting guide <b>1360</b> is not of the capture type. Therefore, the cutting tool is free to move past the guide surfaces <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b>, <b>1366</b>, <b>1368</b>, and <b>1370</b> during completion of the femoral cuts. If the guide surfaces <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b>, <b>1366</b>, <b>1368</b>, and <b>1370</b> were formed by slots, the cutting guide <b>1360</b> could be disconnected from the femur <b>1334</b> to complete the femoral cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0689" num="0688">The cutting guide <b>1360</b> can be made so that one or more of the guide surfaces <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b>, <b>1366</b>, <b>1368</b>, and <b>1370</b> have an adjustable length so that the size of the guided portion of the cuts can be adjusted depending upon the size of the bone and the implant that is to be used. Furthermore, the cutting guide <b>1360</b> is shown having a plurality of guide surfaces <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b>, <b>1366</b>, <b>1368</b>, and <b>1370</b>, with each guide surface being used to make a different cut. Other embodiments of cutting guides <b>1360</b> can be used with the cutting jig <b>1330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0690" num="0689">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref> shows a cutting guide <b>1372</b> that has a single guide surface <b>1374</b>. As will be discussed, the guide surface <b>1374</b> is movable to make multiple guided cuts of different orientations. As the cutting guide <b>1372</b> only has one guide surface <b>1374</b>, the cutting guide <b>1372</b> can be used through a smaller incision than prior art cutting blocks. The cutting guide <b>1372</b> includes a base <b>1376</b> that can be positioned on the femur using the adjustable cutting jig <b>1330</b>. In other words, the cutting guide <b>1372</b> would be a substitute for the cutting guide <b>1360</b>. Other intramedullary instrument could be used with the cutting guide <b>1372</b>. Additionally, extramedullary instrument could be employed. If desired, the base <b>1376</b> could be pinned directly to the femur in a manner analogous to the cutting guide <b>800</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>). Alternatively, the base <b>1376</b> could be positioned on the femur using a computer navigation system.</p>
<p id="p-0691" num="0690">The base <b>1376</b> has a plurality of tracks <b>1378</b>, <b>1380</b>, <b>1382</b>, <b>1384</b>, and <b>1386</b>. The guide surface <b>1374</b> is attached to a pin member <b>1388</b>. The pin member <b>1388</b> is sized to be received in the tracks <b>1378</b>, <b>1380</b>, <b>1382</b>, <b>1384</b>, and <b>1386</b>. When pin member <b>1388</b> is located in the track <b>1378</b>, the guide surface <b>1374</b> is positioned on the femur for making an anterior cut, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref>. When pin member <b>1388</b> is located in the track <b>1380</b>, the guide surface <b>1374</b> is positioned on the femur for making an anterior chamfer cut, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</figref>. When pin member <b>1388</b> is located in the track <b>1382</b>, the guide surface <b>1374</b> is positioned on the femur for making a distal cut. When pin member <b>1388</b> is located in the track <b>1384</b>, the guide surface <b>1374</b> is positioned on the femur for making a posterior chamfer cut. When pin member <b>1388</b> is located in the track <b>1386</b>, the guide surface <b>1374</b> is positioned on the femur for making a posterior cut.</p>
<p id="p-0692" num="0691">The pin member <b>1388</b> can be locked in the tracks <b>1378</b>, <b>1380</b>, <b>1382</b>, <b>1384</b>, and <b>1386</b> to stabilize the guide surface <b>1374</b> during making of the cuts. This can be done in any number of ways. For example, the pin member <b>1388</b> can have a threaded portion that receives a nut to secure the pin member <b>1388</b> within the track. The specific configuration of the tracks <b>1378</b>, <b>1380</b>, <b>1382</b>, <b>1384</b>, and <b>1386</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 94 and 95</figref> are exemplary only, as any configuration that allows movement of the guide surface <b>1374</b> with respect to the base <b>1376</b> could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0693" num="0692">As was the case with the cutting guide <b>1360</b>, the guide surface <b>1374</b> can be made so that the size of the guided portion of the cuts can be adjusted depending upon the size of the bone and the implant that is to be used. Furthermore, the guide surface <b>1374</b> can be made to have a length less than the extent of the cut to be formed on the distal end portion of the femur. Therefore, after initial portions of the cuts have been made utilizing the guide surface <b>1374</b> to guide movement of the cutting tool, the cut surfaces are utilized to guide movement of the cutting tool during completion of the cut. The cutting guide <b>1372</b> is not of the capture type. Therefore, the cutting tool is free to move past the guide surface <b>1374</b> during completion of the femoral cuts. If the guide surface <b>1374</b> were of the capture type (having a slot), the cutting guide <b>1372</b> could be disconnected from the femur to complete the femoral cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0694" num="0693">The cutting guide <b>1372</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 94 and 95</figref> for use on a lateral surface of the femur. However, the cutting guide <b>1372</b> could be used on the medial surface of the femur by either flipping or rotating the base <b>1376</b>. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96</figref> shows a cutting guide <b>1390</b> that could be used on either the lateral or medial side of the femur. In addition to containing the tracks <b>1378</b>, <b>1380</b>, <b>1382</b>, <b>1384</b>, and <b>1386</b>, a base <b>1392</b> includes tracks <b>1394</b>, <b>1396</b>, and <b>1398</b>. As shown, the track <b>1396</b> would be used to make a distal femoral cut on the medial side of the femur.</p>
<p id="h-0048" num="0000">Implants with Reduced Articulating Surfaces</p>
<p id="p-0695" num="0694">As previously detailed, the present invention relates to methods, implants, and instrumentation for performing surgery through minimally invasive procedures. One aspect is the insertion of a partial or total joint replacement implant through a minimally invasive incision. For example, modular implants that are assembled after insertion in the body can typically be more easily inserted through a smaller incision than a unitary implant of the same size or a modular implant that is assembled prior to implantation. Thus, it is advantageous to have smaller implants, modular or not, in order to reduce the size of the incision that is needed for implantation.</p>
<p id="p-0696" num="0695">Smaller implants will generally have a smaller articulating surface area. While prior art prosthetic components provide a low-friction articulating surface for the surface of accompanying member, interaction between the articulating component and the member can produce wear debris. Such debris may cause adverse local and systemic reactions in the body. Thus, it is advantageous to minimize the articulating surface area of one or both of a joint component.</p>
<p id="p-0697" num="0696"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref> shows one embodiment of a joint component implant <b>1400</b> that is both small in size to facilitate implantation through a minimal incision and has a reduced articulating surface area. Specifically, implant <b>1400</b> comprises a head <b>1402</b> connected to a body <b>1404</b>. In use, head <b>1402</b> articulates against the other joint component. In this regard, the other component could be an artificial component or a natural component. For example, if implant <b>1400</b> were implanted in the acetabulum <b>1102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</figref>, the other joint component <b>1403</b> could be the natural femoral head or the head of a prosthetic femoral component. Although head <b>1402</b> is shown as substantially spherical, any shape that provides a smooth bearing surface could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0698" num="0697">Body <b>1404</b> includes a threaded region <b>1406</b> for fixing implant <b>1400</b> to tissue. A joining region <b>1408</b> is located between head <b>1402</b> and threaded region <b>1406</b>. Joining region <b>1408</b> is provided with multiple surfaces so that an inserter or other tool can be used to thread implant <b>1400</b> into tissue. By providing an area separate from head <b>1402</b> that is used for insertion, the risk of scratching or otherwise damaging the bearing surface is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0699" num="0698">Threaded region <b>1406</b> can be eliminated and other mechanisms for attaching implant <b>1400</b> can be used. For example, implant <b>1400</b> could simply be driven into the tissue. Bone cement or an adhesive could be used to attach implant <b>1400</b>. Alternatively, body <b>1404</b> could have a rivet type means, an expandable portion, or some other known fixation means.</p>
<p id="p-0700" num="0699">Implant <b>1400</b> can be made from any biocompatible material that will undergo articulating movement with a corresponding natural or prosthetic member. For example, the bearing component could be formed from a variety of metals, polymers, ceramics, or composite materials. In the event that polymers are chosen, a high density polyethylene may be used, although numerous types of polymers may be suitable so long as the material provides both strength and a low-friction articulation surface for the corresponding joint face. If desired, head <b>1402</b> and body <b>1404</b> can be made of different materials. It may also be advantageous to include some type of known tissue in-growth promoting features on at least a portion of body <b>1404</b>. Such features include a porous or textured surface, a porous body (for example so-called &#x201c;foam metals&#x201d;), and osteoinductive or osteoconductive materials or factors.</p>
<p id="p-0701" num="0700"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</figref> shows a number of implants <b>1400</b> located in the acetabulum <b>1102</b> for articulation against femoral head <b>1403</b>. As shown, implants <b>1400</b> can be implanted through cannula <b>1104</b> and can be cannulated so that they can be inserted over guide wire <b>1108</b>, without the need to dislocate the joint or with only slight dislocation. Implants <b>1400</b> also present a small surface area against which femoral component <b>1403</b> articulates. The bearing surface minimizes available surface area of articulation for the component and the production of wear debris. If desired, implants <b>1400</b> can be used without the need to ream acetabulum <b>1102</b>, thereby saving bone stock. Alternatively, acetabulum could be partially reamed to ensure a surface free of asperities. Because of the overall reduction in size and bearing surface of implants <b>1400</b>, a larger femoral component <b>1403</b> can be used without the risk of significant increase of wear debris. The larger femoral component <b>1403</b> may enhance joint stability.</p>
<p id="p-0702" num="0701">Although any number of implants <b>1400</b> can be used for a given application, the use of three implants <b>1400</b> for acetabulum <b>1102</b> may be preferable as three implants serve as a centering mechanism for femoral component <b>1403</b>. In this regard, the number and location of implants <b>1400</b> can be selected to suit a particular application. The size of implants <b>1400</b>, and in particular head <b>1402</b>, can also be varied. In acetabulum <b>1102</b>, smaller heads 3-6 mm in diameter or larger heads 10-15 mm in diameter may be desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0703" num="0702">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</figref> shows implants <b>1400</b> used in acetabulum <b>1102</b>, implants <b>1400</b> could be used in any joint component including, a glenoid, patellar, femoral, humoral, tibial, ulnar, radial, wrist, and/or ankle component for a prosthetic joint assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0704" num="0703"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</figref> shows another embodiment of a reduced articulating surface area implant <b>1410</b>. Implant <b>1410</b> has a substantially annular shape with a curved surface <b>1412</b>. When implanted, surface <b>1412</b> serves as the bearing surface against which the other joint component articulates. Surface <b>1412</b> can be provided with a beveled bearing surface, if desired. The annular shape of implant <b>1410</b> defines an interior region <b>1414</b>. If implant <b>1410</b> were to be used on the femur, implant <b>1410</b> would be placed around the femoral head with interior region <b>1414</b> in contact with bone. If implant <b>1410</b> were to be used on the acetabulum, implant <b>1410</b> could be fixed to the bone or freely float within the acetabulum with no fixation. As was the case for implant <b>1400</b>, implant <b>1410</b> can be used in other joints.</p>
<p id="p-0705" num="0704"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 100</figref> shows another embodiment of a reduced articulating surface area implant <b>1416</b>. Like implant <b>1410</b>, implant <b>1416</b> is a unitary implant that can be implanted through a minimal incision, has a reduced articulating surface area, and does not require extensive removal of bone. Rather than having a ring shape, implant <b>1410</b> has a U-shaped body with curved surface <b>1418</b> that serves as the bearing surface.</p>
<p id="h-0049" num="0000">Disposable Trial Implants, Instruments, and Other Surgical Implements</p>
<p id="p-0706" num="0705">As previously discussed throughout this specification, the present invention includes disposable surgical implants and instruments. Currently for hip, knee, shoulder, and other joint replacement surgeries (partial or total), there can be six or more trays of instruments and trial implants. Each tray has to be re-sterilized for each procedure. In the case of knee replacement surgeries, one tray may contain femoral trials, one may contain tibial trials, one may contain polyethylene spacer blocks, one may contain tibial cutting instruments, and one tray may contain femoral cutting instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0707" num="0706">This is cumbersome and unnecessary as only a few of these instruments and trial implants need to be made of surgical grade metal and alloys that are rigid and reusable. There is a significant expense in the multiple tray setups. One company, for example, spends over $150 million just to have instruments in the field. Additionally, shipping charges and re-sterilization costs can be significant. The delay due to the shipping and re-sterilization also adds hidden costs and time. Obviously, money and time can be saved if the number of trays for each procedure were reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0708" num="0707">Also, as a company modifies implant systems or instruments, representatives of the company need to update their inventories accordingly. Frequently, companies are unable to charge for the new instruments as an incentive to promote a new system. Although these costs cannot be recovered, they ultimately add to the cost of joint replacement surgeries.</p>
<p id="p-0709" num="0708">These issues can be addressed by a disposable trialing system. For example, the tibial trial base plate <b>270</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) and other trial components can be made of a light-weight low cost material such as aluminum, injection molded plastic, composite material, and the like. There would be a series of these disposable trial implants in various sizes for the implant system the surgeon intended to use. Each would come pre-packaged in a sterile state. Alternatively, each sterile package could include different components of the same size. In the case of a knee replacement procedure, each sterile package could include a femoral trial, a tibial trial, a patellar trial, and a spacer trial. Preoperatively, the surgeon could obtain an estimate of the needed size from x-rays and other clinical information. Based upon this estimate, one or more sizes of the trial implants would be brought to the operating room or surgical suite.</p>
<p id="p-0710" num="0709">The use of disposable trial implants would reduce the number of trays needed for a given procedure. The use of disposable cutting blocks would further reduce the number of trays. In this regard, the disposable cutting blocks could be made of a material that has color or some other chemical or physical property that would allow the detection of trace amounts of the cutting blocks. This is particularly useful if the cutting blocks are inadvertently scratched so that any debris could be detected and removed. The instruments and trials could have changeable lugs, changeable stems, or similar modularity to allow modification of the position and the rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0711" num="0710">If desired, some or all of the instruments and other disposables could be packaged in a single sterile unit. Some items that could be included in the unit include the instruments, draping, cement, cement mixer, pulsatile lavage, retractors, drill bits, pins, and guide wires. This would save significant time for the operating personnel as they open this unit and it has all the cutting blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0712" num="0711">One advantage of the disposable system is that the disposable cutting blocks could easily be modified for new or updated instrumentation or for customized instrumentation. The disposable system saves the cost and time of cleaning and re-sterilization. Also, the disposable system would improve the sterile technique in the operating room and since these are single use and sterilized there is no risk of cross-contamination going from one patient to another patient.</p>
<p id="p-0713" num="0712">If desired, only a portion of the trial implants or instrumentation could be disposable. For example, the intramedullary rod for distal femoral cutting blocks could be reusable, however, the actual cutting surface, such as the captured guide <b>4</b> in 1 block, the mill cut, etc., could be disposable.</p>
<p id="h-0050" num="0000">Program for Learning Minimally Invasive Surgical Techniques</p>
<p id="p-0714" num="0713">As the minimally invasive surgical instruments, implants, systems, and methods disclosed herein represent a significant deviation from those used in open surgical procedures, the present invention includes a program for training surgeons and other health care professionals. The program is a sequential approach in which the trainee starts the training process using an incision of standard length and progressively decreases the incision size as milestones are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0715" num="0714">The program is sequential learning, analogous to returning to residency or a mini-fellowship. The program can involve a series of visits to a dedicated training sites and/or remote linking, for example via videoconferences or the Internet, to certain training programs. The goal of the program is to allow the trainee to progress from: working with a standard incision, traditionally to learn anatomy; working through a smaller incision, with a combination of prior art instruments and implants and the downsized instruments and implants according to the present invention; and working through a minimally invasive incision to use the instruments, implants, systems, and techniques according to the present invention. As previously discussed, these techniques include minimizing or avoiding joint dislocation, video and fluoroscopic or other radiographic guidance, computer assisted surgical procedures, cannulated instruments and implants, and downsized instruments and implants.</p>
<p id="p-0716" num="0715">The program can include the following training tools, in any combination: lectures and video demonstrations to understand the instruments, both intra and extramedullary, implants, systems, and methods; observation and discussion of live broadcast surgeries; practice using saw bones; practice with cadavers, animal models, or plastic models that have artificial skin, muscle, tissue, ligaments, and bones; virtual reality evaluations; and practice with minimal incisions.</p>
<p id="p-0717" num="0716">Once proficiency with some or all of the training tools have be achieved, which can be determined by grading based on examination, the trainee can be assigned a mentor, a previously certified health care professional. The trainee can be required to visit and observe the mentor during surgery. Additionally, the mentor could visit the trainee at the trainee's practice and supervise or otherwise monitor the trainee's techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0718" num="0717">Even after the initial visits between the mentor and trainee, the mentor could be available for consultation by the trainee. The trainee could start probationary work at his practice by initially using an incision that is only slightly smaller than standard incisions. The x-rays, inter-operative pictures or videos, and other case data could be reviewed and graded by the mentor or other certified instructor. Advancement to the next level would only be allowed if the review were satisfactory. The next level could involve a return to some or all of the training tools to practice working through a smaller incision, with a combination of prior art instruments and implants and the downsized instruments and implants according to the present invention. After the training tools are mastered, probationary work by the trainee at this level would be followed by review and grading by the mentor or other certified instructor. Once again, advancement to the next level would only be allowed if the review were satisfactory. The process is repeated for the final level.</p>
<p id="p-0719" num="0718">The program could be implemented so that the trainee must meet given standards in order to receive instrumentation and implants to allow the trainee to perform the procedures independently without supervision. Furthermore, achieving these standards could be required prior to being allowed to promote or advertise proficiency in the techniques. The standards could be coordinated with hospital Institutional Review Boards.</p>
<p id="p-0720" num="0719">The program could be offered through a professional society, such as the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the Hip and Knee Society, a commercial entity, or some combination thereof. Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits and grades could be provided. The instructors and preceptors could be certified, with the certification process through a professional society.</p>
<p id="p-0721" num="0720">The trainees could pay a portion of the costs of the program. Trainees would offset the costs of the program from the added revenue from the procedures and possible lower insurance premiums. The costs of the program may be subsidized by governmental agencies and commercial entities, which would benefit from sales and leasing of instruments and implants. Costs could be subsidized by insurers, which would benefit from the lower costs of the procedures compared to traditional open procedures. Finally, costs could also be subsidized by surgical centers, which would benefit from having trained personnel and added revenue from the procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0722" num="0721">In additional to the educational benefits of the program, the program also provides some legal protection to the trainees. Perhaps more importantly, the program affords protection to the patient by ensuring adequately trained medical personnel.</p>
<heading id="h-0051" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading>
<p id="p-0723" num="0722">In view of the foregoing description, it is apparent that the present invention relates to a new and improved method and apparatus for use in performing any desired type of surgery on a joint in a patient's body. The joint may advantageously be a joint in a knee portion <b>76</b> of a patient's leg <b>70</b>. However, the method and apparatus may be used in association with surgery on other joints in a patient's body. There are many different features of the present invention which may used either together or separately in association with many different types of surgery. Although features of the present invention may be used with many different surgical procedures, the invention is described herein in conjunction with surgery on a joint in a patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0724" num="0723">One of the features of the present invention relates to the making of a limited incision <b>114</b>. The limited incision <b>114</b> may be in any desired portion of a patient's body. For example, the limited incision <b>114</b> may be in a knee portion <b>76</b> of a leg <b>70</b> of a patient. The limited incision <b>114</b> may be made while a lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient is extending downward from the upper portion <b>72</b> of the leg of the patient. At this time, a foot <b>74</b> connected with the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg of the patient may be below a surface <b>64</b> on which the patient is supported. The limited incision <b>114</b> may be made while the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient is suspended from the upper portion of the leg or while the lower portion of the leg and/or the foot <b>74</b> of the patient are held by a support device. After the incision <b>114</b> has been made, any one of many surgical procedures may be undertaken.</p>
<p id="p-0725" num="0724">It is believed that in certain circumstances, it may be desired to have a main incision <b>114</b> of limited length and a secondary incision <b>920</b> of even smaller length. The secondary incision <b>920</b> may be a portal or stab wound. A cutting tool <b>170</b> may be moved through the secondary incision <b>920</b>. An implant <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and/or <b>294</b> may be moved through the main incision <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0726" num="0725">Once the incision <b>114</b> has been made, a patella <b>120</b> in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient may be offset to one side of its normal position. When the patella <b>120</b> is offset, an inner side <b>122</b> of the patella faces inward toward the end portions <b>124</b> and <b>212</b> of a femur <b>126</b> and tibia <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0727" num="0726">Although any one of many known surgical procedures may be undertaken through the limited incision <b>114</b>, down sized instrumentation <b>134</b>, <b>138</b>, <b>186</b>, <b>210</b> and/or <b>218</b> for use in the making of cuts in a femur <b>126</b> and/or tibia <b>214</b> may be moved through or part way through the incision. The down sized instrumentation may be smaller than implants <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and/or <b>294</b> to be positioned in the knee portion <b>76</b> of the patient. The down sized instrumentation <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and/or <b>294</b> may have opposite ends which are spaced apart by a distance which is less than the distance between lateral and medial epicondyles on a femur or tibia in the leg of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0728" num="0727">It is contemplated that the down sized instrumentation <b>134</b>, <b>138</b>, <b>186</b>, <b>210</b> and/or <b>218</b> may have cutting tool guide surfaces of reduced length. The length of the cutting tool guide surfaces may be less than the length of a cut to be made on a bone. A cut on a bone in the patient may be completed using previously cut surfaces as a guide for the cutting tool.</p>
<p id="p-0729" num="0728">It is contemplated that at least some, if not all, cuts on a bone may be made using light directed onto the bone as a guide. The light directed onto the bone may be in the form of a three dimensional image <b>850</b>. The light directed onto the bone may be a beam <b>866</b> or <b>868</b> along which a cutting tool <b>170</b> is moved into engagement with the bone.</p>
<p id="p-0730" num="0729">There are several different orders in which cuts may be made on bones in the knee portion of the leg of the patient. It is believed that it may be advantageous to make the patellar and tibial cuts before making the femoral cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0731" num="0730">There are many different reasons to check ligament balancing in a knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg of a patient. Ligament balancing may be checked while the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient is flexed and the foot <b>74</b> of the patient is below the support surface <b>64</b> on which the patient is disposed. Flexion and extension balancing of ligaments may be checked by varying the extent of flexion of the knee portion <b>76</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient. In addition, rotational stability of the ligaments may be checked by rotating the lower portion of the leg of the patient about its central axis. Balancing of ligaments may also be checked by moving the foot <b>74</b> of the patient sideways, rotating the lower portion <b>68</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of the patient, and/or moving the foot anteriorly or posteriorly.</p>
<p id="p-0732" num="0731">It is believed that it may be advantageous to utilize an endoscope <b>352</b> or a similar apparatus to examine portions of the patient's body which are spaced from the incision <b>114</b>. It is also contemplated that images of the knee portion of the patient's leg may be obtained by using any one of many known image generating devices other than an endoscope <b>352</b>. The images may be obtained while the patient's leg <b>70</b> is stationary or in motion. The images may be obtained to assist a surgeon in conducting any desired type of surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0733" num="0732">Balancing of the ligaments in the knee portion <b>76</b> of a patient's leg <b>70</b> may be facilitated by the positioning of one or more transducers <b>596</b> and/or <b>598</b> between tendons, ligaments, and/or bones in the knee portion. One transducer <b>598</b> may be positioned relative to a medial side of a knee joint. Another transducer <b>596</b> may be positioned relative to a lateral side of the knee joint. During bending of the knee joint, the output from the transducers <b>596</b> and <b>598</b> will vary as a function of variations in tension forces in the ligaments. This enables the tension forces in ligaments in opposite sides of the knee portion to be compared to facilitate balancing of the ligaments.</p>
<p id="p-0734" num="0733">Patellar tracking may be checked by the positioning of one or more transducers <b>930</b> and/or <b>932</b> between the patella <b>120</b> and the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. If desired, one transducer <b>932</b> may be placed between a medial portion of the patella <b>120</b> and the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. A second transducer <b>930</b> may be placed between a lateral portion of the patella <b>120</b> and the distal end portion <b>124</b> of the femur <b>126</b>. Output signals from a transducer <b>930</b> will vary as a function of variations in force transmitted between the patella <b>120</b> and femur <b>126</b> during bending of the leg.</p>
<p id="p-0735" num="0734">The articular surface <b>122</b> on the patella <b>120</b> may be repaired. The defective original articular surface <b>122</b> on the patella <b>120</b> may be removed by cutting the patella while an inner side of the patella faces toward a distal end portion <b>124</b> of a femur <b>126</b>. The step of cutting the patella may be performed while the patella is disposed in situ and is urged toward the distal end portion of the femur by connective tissue. An implant may then be positioned on the patella <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0736" num="0735">It is contemplated that the size of the incision <b>114</b> in the knee or other portion of the patient may be minimized by conducting surgery through a cannula <b>564</b>. The cannula <b>564</b> may be expandable. To facilitate moving of an implant <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and/or <b>294</b> through the cannula <b>564</b>, the implant may be formed in two or more portions <b>572</b> and <b>574</b>. The portions of the implant <b>286</b>, <b>290</b> and/or <b>294</b> may be interconnected when the portions of the implant have been positioned in the patient's body. Although the implants disclosed herein are associated with a patient's knee, it should be understood that the implants may be positioned at any desired location in a patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0737" num="0736">An implant <b>626</b>, <b>640</b> or <b>670</b> may be positioned in a recess <b>610</b>, <b>642</b> or <b>672</b> formed in a bone <b>126</b> or <b>214</b> in a patient. The implant <b>626</b>, <b>640</b> or <b>670</b> may contain biological resurfacing and/or bone growth promoting materials. The implant <b>626</b>, <b>640</b> and/or <b>670</b> may contain mesenchymal cells and/or tissue inductive factors. Alternatively, the implant <b>626</b> or <b>640</b> may be formed of one or more materials which do not enable bone to grow into the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0738" num="0737">In accordance with one of the features of the present invention, body tissue may be moved or stretched by a device <b>720</b>, <b>722</b> and/or <b>730</b> which is expandable. The expandable device <b>720</b>, <b>722</b> and/or <b>730</b> may be biodegradable so that it can be left in a patient's body. The expandable device <b>720</b>, <b>722</b> and/or <b>730</b> may be expanded to move and/or stretch body tissue and increase a range of motion of a joint. The expandable device may be used to stretch body tissue in which an incision is to be made.</p>
<p id="p-0739" num="0738">An improved drape system <b>100</b> is provided to maintain a sterile field between a surgeon <b>106</b> and a patient during movement of the surgeon relative to the patient. The improved drape system <b>100</b> includes a drape <b>102</b> which extends between the surgeon and a drape <b>90</b> for the patient. During surgery on a knee portion <b>76</b> of a leg <b>70</b> of a patient, the drape system <b>100</b> extends beneath the foot portion <b>74</b> of the leg <b>70</b> of a patient. It is contemplated that the drape system <b>100</b> will be utilized during many different types of operations other than surgery on a leg of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0740" num="0739">An implant <b>950</b>, <b>970</b>, <b>980</b>, <b>1002</b>, <b>1020</b>, <b>1040</b> or <b>1060</b> may be movable relative to both a femur <b>126</b> and a tibia <b>214</b> in a leg of a patient during bending of the leg. The implant may include a single member (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59</figref>, <b>60</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>65</b>) which is disposed between and engage by end portions of the femur and tibia. Alternatively, the implant may include a plurality of members (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 61 and 62</figref>) which are disposed in engagement with each other. If desired one of the members of the plurality of members may be secured to a bone and engaged by a member which is not secured to a bone. The implant may be secured to soft tissue in the knee portion of the patient's leg (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 63 and 64</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0741" num="0740">There are many different features to the present invention. It is contemplated that these features may be used together or separately. It is also contemplated that the features may be utilized in association with joints in a patient's body other than a knee joint. For example, features of the present invention may be used in association with surgery on vertebral joints or glenoid joints.
