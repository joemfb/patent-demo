<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Network providers (NPs) and enterprise IT departments may employ various authentication and authorization procedures to manage access to a network. Some endpoints, although known by the network providers and IT departments, may not include an agent that provides information to a policy node that manages access in the network. In these instances, while authentication and authorization of an endpoint may be performed, dynamically provisioning access for the endpoint in the network at layer three requires the policy server to learn the endpoint's IP address.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">According to one aspect, a method may include obtaining a layer two identification of an endpoint that is seeking access to a network, the endpoint may be omitting an agent to communicate a layer three address of the endpoint to a policy node, applying one or more authentication rules based on the layer two identification of the endpoint, assigning the layer three address to the endpoint, learning, by the policy node, the layer three address of the endpoint, and provisioning layer three access for the endpoint to the network based on the learned layer three address.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to another aspect, a system to which an endpoint communicates may include logic to authenticate the endpoint for access in a network at a layer two, the endpoint may omit logic to communicate a layer three address to layer three policy logic, logic to assign the layer three address to the endpoint, logic to provide the layer three policy logic with the layer three address of the endpoint, and logic to enforce layer three access of the endpoint in the network based on the layer three address of the endpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to yet another aspect, a device may include a memory containing instructions and network policies, and a processor. The processor may execute the instructions to obtain a layer two identification of an endpoint, and authenticate the endpoint based on the layer two identification of the endpoint and one or more network policies. The processor may execute the instructions to learn a layer three address of the endpoint from an external device other than the endpoint, where the endpoint may not include logic to communicate the layer three address to the device, and control a layer three enforcement point by providing one or more of the network policies corresponding to the endpoint and the layer three address of the endpoint to the layer three enforcement point.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to still another aspect, a device may include a memory containing instructions and layer three policies of a network, and a processor that executes the instructions to learn an assigned layer three address of an endpoint from an external device, where the endpoint is unable to transmit the assigned layer three address to the device, directly or indirectly. The processor may execute the instructions to provide the assigned layer three address of the endpoint to a layer three enforcement point.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to yet another aspect, a device may include means for authenticating an endpoint based on a layer two identifier of the endpoint, means for learning a layer three address of the endpoint based on an external device, where the external device acquires the layer three address based on at least one of a scanning of the endpoint, an assigning of the layer three address to the endpoint, or an intercepting of a transmission from the endpoint, means for determining layer three policies corresponding to the endpoint based on an association of the layer three address of the endpoint and the layer two identifier of the endpoint, and means for enforcing layer three access of the endpoint by providing a layer three enforcement point with the determined layer three policies and the layer three address of the endpoint.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. In addition, while some of the following description may be provided in network elements at layer two and/or layer three of, for example, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model, the principles and teachings may be applied to different network elements and/or at different layers of a protocol stack that operate with analogous functionality. The term device, network element, and component as used herein, are to be broadly interpreted to include any logic, such as hardware, software, and/or a combination of hardware and software to provide for the functionality as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating a concept described herein. As illustrated in concept <b>100</b>, an endpoint (e.g., an Internet Protocol (IP) phone) may communicate with a network element, such as a network access node, residing in the access network. Employing any number of techniques, authentication and authorization may be granted to the endpoint via a network element, such as a policy server, residing in the access network.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The endpoint may be issued an IP address by a network element, such as a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server, residing in the access network. However, the endpoint may be unable to provide a network element, such as the policy server, with the IP address because the endpoint does not include, for example, an agent. Nevertheless, the endpoint may wish to gain access to a protected resource, such as a protected network, via a layer three enforcement point, such as a firewall. However, since the policy server is unaware of the IP address of the endpoint because the endpoint does not include the agent, the policy server may not be able to appropriately provision the endpoint's access to the protected network via the firewall.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In such an instance, the ability to provision access through the firewall based on the characteristics of the endpoint may be beneficial. Employing any number of techniques, the policy server may learn the IP address issued to the endpoint from other network elements. Based on this information, the policy server may provision layer three access via the firewall for the endpoint. That is, the firewall may grant access to the endpoint to all or a portion of the protected network. For example, the firewall may grant the endpoint layer three access to various voice-over IP (VOIP) servers in the protected network but prohibit network access to all other nodes in the protected network.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As a result of the foregoing, network providers and administrators are provided with a platform that provides enhanced layer three access control for endpoints that may not include an agent that can communicate IP address information to the policy server.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Exemplary Environment</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary environment in which concepts described herein may be implemented. As illustrated, environment <b>200</b> may include an endpoint <b>210</b>, an access network <b>220</b>, an administrator <b>250</b>, a firewall <b>255</b>, and a protected network <b>260</b>. Access network <b>220</b> may include a network access node <b>225</b>, a policy node <b>230</b>, a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) node <b>225</b>, and a network sensor <b>240</b>. The connections of environment <b>200</b> may be, for example, wired or wireless. Further, the connections between and/or among the exemplary components depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be direct or indirect.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Endpoint <b>210</b> may include, for example, a device that does not support an agent that can communicate its IP address to policy node <b>230</b>, but is recognized by access network <b>220</b> and/or administrator <b>250</b>. For example, devices, such as printers, fax machines, photocopiers, heating and cooling systems, card readers, specialized appliances, IP cameras, IP phones, etc., may not be capable of running the agent software that communicates with policy node <b>230</b>, but are capable of communicating with network access node <b>225</b> and other nodes in environment <b>200</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flow chart of an exemplary process for authentication and authorization for the endpoint depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Exemplary process <b>1200</b> is described below in relation to exemplary environment <b>200</b>. Environment <b>200</b> may support an endpoint with an 802.1X supplicant or an endpoint that does not include an 802.1X supplicant. For purposes of discussion, descriptions of 802.1X challenges and timeouts have been omitted. In addition, descriptions of virus scanning, remediation, and other related processes that may be employed have been omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Process <b>1200</b> may begin with endpoint <b>210</b> transmitting packets to access network <b>220</b> (Block <b>1202</b>). For example, endpoint <b>210</b> may attempt to transmit packets to DHCP node <b>235</b> via network access node <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Access network <b>220</b> may acquire an identifier of endpoint <b>210</b> (Block <b>1204</b>). In one implementation, endpoint <b>210</b> may include, for example, an 802.1X supplicant. Based on the 802.1X framework, information contained in condition field <b>502</b> and/or ID field <b>504</b> may be compared and/or updated.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In another implementation, endpoint <b>210</b> may not include an 802.1X supplicant. In this instance, network access node <b>225</b> may acquire an identifier of endpoint <b>210</b> based on the transmitted packets from endpoint <b>210</b>. For example, network access application <b>342</b> of network access node <b>225</b> may read packets for MAC address information when a new endpoint attempts to gain access to access network <b>220</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, network sensor <b>240</b> may acquire the MAC address of endpoint <b>210</b> based on the transmitted packets from endpoint <b>210</b> and/or scanning of endpoint <b>210</b>. For example, scanning/detection application <b>942</b> may read packets for MAC address information when a new endpoint attempts to gain access to access network <b>220</b> and/or may scan endpoint <b>210</b> to acquire the MAC address of endpoint <b>210</b> and/or other types of information that characterizes endpoint <b>210</b>. In one implementation, network sensor <b>240</b> may communicate the MAC address of endpoint <b>210</b>, the type of device, or other characteristics of endpoint <b>2001</b> to network access node <b>225</b>. In other instances, an identifier of endpoint <b>210</b> may be a character string that identifies endpoint <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Access network <b>220</b> may submit an authentication request (Block <b>1206</b>). In one implementation, network access node <b>225</b> may use, for example, the RADIUS protocol to communicate with policy node <b>230</b>. For example, network access node <b>225</b> may transmit a RADIUS-request message with the MAC address (or a portion of the MAC address) of endpoint <b>210</b> as a username to policy node <b>230</b>. In other instances, network access node <b>225</b> may transmit a RADIUS-request message with a character string identifying endpoint <b>210</b> to policy node <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Access network <b>220</b> may determine whether to authenticate and authorize endpoint <b>210</b> (Block <b>1208</b>). In one implementation, policy node <b>230</b> may refer to layer two mapping table <b>444</b>. For example, policy application <b>442</b> may reference layer two mapping table <b>444</b>, such as ID field <b>504</b>, to determine whether a received MAC address, portion of a MAC, and/or a character string associated with RADIUS-request message from network access node <b>225</b> matches the information in condition field <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">If the information of the RADIUS-request message does not match the information in condition field <b>502</b>, then access is denied (Block <b>1210</b>). For example, policy node <b>230</b> may send a RADIUS-reject message to network access node <b>225</b> indicating that access is denied. However, if the information of the RADIUS-request message matches the information in condition field <b>502</b>, policy application <b>442</b> may accord the corresponding role, as indicated in role field <b>506</b>, to endpoint <b>210</b>. Based on the role defined in role field <b>506</b>, policy node <b>230</b> may determine the type and/or extent of access endpoint <b>210</b> has with access network <b>220</b>. For example, when endpoint <b>210</b> is accorded a role of IP PHONE (record <b>522</b> of layer two mapping table <b>444</b>), policy node <b>230</b> may authorize access to IP PHONE VLAN in accordance with VLAN field <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Policy node <b>230</b> may create a record in current session table <b>448</b> (e.g., record <b>622</b>). During the creation of the record <b>622</b>, a session ID contained in session ID field <b>602</b> may be generated. Additionally, role field <b>606</b> of current session table <b>448</b> may be updated.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Policy node <b>230</b> may permit access (Block <b>1212</b>). For example, policy node <b>230</b> may respond to network access node <b>225</b> with a RADIUS-accept message. For example, policy node <b>230</b> may provide information to network access node <b>225</b> regarding the type and/or extent of access endpoint <b>210</b> may have with access network <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates exemplary processes, in other implementations, different, fewer, or additional processes may be employed. For example, if the information of the RADIUS-request message does not match the information in condition field <b>502</b>, then access may be still granted (e.g., a quarantine VLAN).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a flow chart of an exemplary process for provisioning access through the firewall for the endpoint depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Exemplary process <b>1300</b> is described below in relation to environment <b>200</b>. For purposes of discussion, assume endpoint <b>210</b> has been authenticated and authorized for access to access network <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Process <b>1300</b> may begin with assigning a layer three address to an endpoint (Block <b>1302</b>). For example, endpoint <b>210</b> may request an IP address from DHCP node <b>235</b> using the DHCP protocol. DHCP node <b>235</b> may assign an IP address to endpoint <b>210</b>. For example, IP address assignment application <b>742</b> of DHCP node <b>235</b> may retrieve an IP address from IP address pool <b>850</b> of IP address database <b>744</b>, and assign the retrieved IP address to endpoint <b>210</b>. The assigned IP address may be stored in IP address field <b>802</b> of IP address table <b>800</b>, along with a corresponding lease time in lease time field <b>804</b>. DHCP node <b>235</b> may also attain an identifier of endpoint <b>210</b>, and store the identifier in ID field <b>806</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The layer three address of the endpoint may be learned (Block <b>1304</b>). In one implementation, DHCP node <b>235</b> may transmit to policy node <b>230</b> the IP address assigned to endpoint <b>210</b>, along with the identifier of endpoint <b>210</b> (e.g., a MAC address or character string). Additionally or alternatively, network sensor <b>240</b> may scan packets transmitted by endpoint <b>210</b> that contain, for example, the MAC address and IP address relating to endpoint <b>210</b>. Network sensor <b>240</b> may communicate the MAC address/IP address pair to policy node <b>230</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, network access node <b>225</b> may monitor packets from endpoint <b>210</b> and communicate the identifier (e.g., MAC address/IP address pair) to policy node <b>230</b>. Policy node <b>230</b> may store the IP address of endpoint <b>210</b> in network address field <b>546</b> of layer three mapping table <b>446</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Layer three access may be provisioned (Block <b>1306</b>). For example, policy node <b>230</b> may provision layer three access for endpoint <b>210</b> through firewall <b>255</b>. Policy server may send to firewall <b>255</b> the IP address of endpoint <b>210</b>, role of endpoint <b>210</b> and/or information about which resources endpoint <b>210</b> may be allowed to access in protected network <b>260</b>, such as a range of network addresses. Firewall <b>255</b> may store the range of network addresses (e.g., IP addresses) in IP addresses field <b>1150</b> and role in role field <b>1152</b> of address/role table <b>1046</b>. Firewall <b>225</b> may store the IP address of endpoint <b>210</b> in network address field <b>1154</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, policy node <b>230</b> may send to firewall <b>225</b> the identifier of endpoint <b>210</b>. In this instance, firewall <b>255</b> may store the identifier of endpoint <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Layer three access may be enforced (Block <b>1308</b>). In one implementation, firewall <b>255</b> may enforce layer three access to protected network <b>260</b>. For example, firewall <b>255</b> may receive a packet including a source network address from endpoint <b>210</b>. Firewall application <b>1042</b> of firewall <b>255</b> may refer to address/role table <b>1046</b> to match the source network address contained in the received packet with a source network address contained in source network address field <b>1154</b>. When a match occurs, firewall application <b>1042</b> may refer to the associated role accorded to the source network address based on the role in role field <b>1152</b>. Firewall application <b>1042</b> may refer to layer three policy table <b>1044</b> based on the accorded role in role field <b>1152</b> and take the action specified in action field <b>1106</b>. For example, endpoint <b>210</b> may be accorded the role of IP PHONE, and the received packet may include a destination address to a VOIP server (record <b>1122</b>). Firewall <b>255</b> may permit the received packet to pass to the destination address of the VOIP server based on the range of IP addresses contained IP addresses field <b>1150</b>. That is, destination address 192.168.1.52 of the VOIP server falls within the range of network addresses 192.168.1.50-192.168.1.99 provided by policy node <b>230</b>. In other instances, when, for example, the destination network address contained in the received packet from endpoint <b>210</b> does not correspond to the accorded role and/or IP addresses field <b>1150</b>, firewall <b>255</b> may prevent the received packet from passing into protected network <b>260</b>.</p>
