<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of cryopreserving sperm cells which may include cooling the quantity of sperm cells to a holding temperature, maintaining the sperm cells substantially at the holding temperature for a period, and supercooling the sperm cells by cooling the sperm cells at a first cooling rate to a temperature that approaches a critical temperature zone at which ice crystal formation and changes in osmotic pressure damage sperm cells and then cooling the sperm at a second cooling rate faster than said first cooling rate through said critical temperature zone.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to apparatus and methods for animal semen collection, and more particularly to apparatus and methods using various techniques, including flow cytometry, to yield sperm populations that are enriched with sperm cells having one or more desired characteristics, such as viable populations of sperm cells sorted according to DNA characteristics for use by the animal production industry to preselect the sex of animal offspring.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The fertilization of animals by artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transplant following in vitro fertilization is an established practice. In the livestock production industry, the ability to influence the reproductive outcome toward offspring having one or more desired characteristics has obvious advantages. By way of example, there would be an economic benefit in the dairy industry to preselect offspring in favor of the female sex to ensure the production of dairy cows. Efforts have been made toward achieving this goal by using flow cytometry to sort X and Y sperm cells, as evidenced by the disclosures in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,357,307 (Buchanan, et al.), 5,985,216 (Rens, et al.), and 5,135,759 (Johnson). However, none of these efforts has resulted in the introduction of a commercially successful high-throughput system capable of producing production volumes of relatively pure sexed sperm cells having a motility sufficient for effective fertilization.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a current need in the animal production industry for a viable high-speed system for efficiently isolating sperm cells based on a specified DNA characteristic (or other characteristics) to produce quantities of such cells, which can be used on a commercial scale. Also needed is a sperm handling system that preserves the viability of such isolated sperm as it is processed by the isolating system and that allows for preservation of such isolated sperm until such time that it is ready for use. The present invention addresses these needs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention also has application to improvements in the field of flow cytometry on a more general basis. Flow cytometry may broadly be defined as measuring characteristics of individual particles as they pass generally single file in a fluid stream through a measuring device which, selectively destroy unwanted particles, for example by photo ablation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an optically-based flow cytometry system, optics are used to direct and focus a beam of light (e.g., visible light or UV light) on the stream containing the particles, and to collect emissions from the particles, including scattered light and/or fluorescence emissions from the particles. In one common optic system, for example, a beam of light (e.g., a laser beam) is focused on the stream and emissions are collected by a pair of collection units, one positioned forward of the laser for collecting scattered light emissions and another positioned orthoganally to both stream and the laser for collecting fluorescence emissions. Each collection unit includes a separate photodetector, which increases the cost of the system. Further, in traditional optic systems the photodetectors translate the collected emissions into electrical signals, which are analyzed using analog systems to classify the particles according to selected characteristics of the particles. Analog systems are relatively inexpensive, but only limited information can be derived from the signals.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Others have tried to develop technology that can be used to process sperm cells to obtain populations of sperm cells that are enriched with sperm that have a desired sex chromosome. However, the existing technology falls short of the inventive technologies described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, Johnson et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,759) describe the separation of intact X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm populations according to DNA content using a flow cytometer/cell sorter into X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm enriched populations. As described, the sperm is combined with a DNA selective dye at a temperature of 30 to 39&#xb0; C. for a period of 1 hour (39&#xb0; C.) to 1.5 hours (30&#xb0; C.). A flow cytometer is then used to measure the amount of fluorescent light emitted as the sperm passes through a laser beam that excites the dye. Because the X chromosome-bearing sperm contains more DNA than the Y chromosome-bearing sperm, with most species of mammal having about 3 to 5% difference, the X chromosome-bearing sperm emits more fluorescent light than the Y chromosome-bearing sperm. In order to account for the fact that the fluorescence measurement may vary depending on the rotational orientation of the sperm cells, two photo detectors are used. The first determines whether the sperm cells are properly oriented, while the second takes a measurement that is used to classify the sperm as having an X or Y chromosome. An oscillator is used to cause the stream containing the sperm to break into droplets downstream of the place where the sperm pass through the laser beam. Droplets containing single sperm of a predetermined fluorescent intensity are given a charge and electrostatically deflected into collection vessels. The collected, gender enriched sperm population, is then used for microinjection, in vitro fertilization, or artificial insemination.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Seidel et al. (WO 02/43574) also describe separation of sperm into gender enriched populations of X and Y chromosome-bearing cells using flow cytometry. Seidel et al. describe staining the cells at a temperature between 30&#xb0; C. and 40&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">United States Patent Application Pub. No. 2003/0157475 AI (Schenk, Aug. 21, 2003) describes a method of cryopreserving sperm cells that have been sorted according to X or Y chromosome content. As noted therein, it is desirable to add a cryoprotectant to sperm cells before they are cryopreserved to protect the sperm cells during the cryopreservation process. For example, glycerol is one cryoprotectant that is commonly added to bovine sperm cells prior to cryopreservation. However, in order to obtain better protection from the cryoprotectant, it is desirable to wait for the cryoprotectant to equilibrate with the sperm cells before subjecting the sperm cells to temperatures below 0&#xb0; C. During the equilibration period, the cryoprotectant penetrates the cell membrane to provide intra-cellular protection in addition to any extra-cellular protection provided by the cryoprotectant. Thus, the cryopreservation methods described in United States Patent Application Pub. No. 2003/0157475 AI specify that an extender containing glycerol is added to the sperm cells after they have been cooled to about 5&#xb0; C. Then the sperm cells and glycerol are allowed to equilibrate at 5&#xb0; C. for anywhere between 1 and 18 hours before the sperm cells are subjected to lower temperatures. The disclosure recommends an equilibration period of between three and six hours in order to obtain the best results.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Unfortunately, the time and expense involved in a 3 to 6 hour equilibration period will have a negative impact on profitability of a commercial sperm sorting process. Furthermore, in the context of a commercial sperm sorting process, it is believed that the health of the sperm is generally improved by reducing the time between collection of the sperm and cryopreservation (other factors being equal). From this standpoint as well, it would be desirable to have access to cryopreservation technology that does not require a long equilibration period to obtain the optimal benefits of a cryoprotectant. Moreover, the known cryopreservation technology is reported to have a detrimental impact on sperm motility, which is indicative of decreased sperm fertility. Thus, there is a need for cryopreservation techniques that preserves sperm health compared to conventional techniques.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0160" num="0760">The embodiments described below relate to collection and processing of animal semen, particularly to processing semen from a domestic animal to sort the sperm cells according to a specified DNA characteristic (e.g., X/Y chromosome content to preselect the gender of offspring). A number of inventive technologies are combined to achieve the results described below. However, it will be understood that the inventive technologies described herein may be applied to other applications without deviating from the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">General Overview</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0761"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a work flow diagram providing an overview of the steps in one exemplary process of the present invention. The process starts with collection of neat semen samples from one or more male animals (e.g., bulls) at step <b>39</b>. The semen samples are labeled for identification at step <b>41</b>, contacted with a buffer, at step <b>41</b>A and transported to a processing facility. In addition to the buffer, additives may also be added at step <b>41</b>A, including, for example, an energy source, a protein source, an antibiotic, and/or a composition which regulates oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly. An optional quality control test may be performed at step <b>43</b> to insure that the quality of each sample (e.g., sperm motility) is sufficient to indicate that the final product is likely to meet minimal quality criteria. An optional washing step may be performed at step <b>47</b>. At step <b>47</b>A the staining protocol that will be used for processing is selected by using various staining protocols to stain aliquots of the sample and then analyzing the sortability of each aliquot to identify a desired staining protocol for that particular sample. Staining according to the selected staining protocol is performed at step <b>49</b> by adding a staining fluid <b>48</b> containing a chemical dye (e.g., a DNA selective fluorescent dye) to each sample. In addition to the staining fluid, additives may also be added at step <b>48</b>, including, for example, an energy source, a protein source, an antibiotic, and/or a composition which regulates oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly. The samples are incubated at step <b>51</b> to allow for uptake of the dye by the sperm. Then a sample is loaded into the sample introduction device of a flow cytometer at step <b>53</b>. The sample fluid is introduced into the flow cytometer along with a sheath fluid at step <b>54</b>. In addition to the sheath fluid, additives may also be added at step <b>54</b>, including, for example, an energy source, a protein source, an antibiotic, and/or a composition which regulates oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly. At step <b>55</b> the flow cytometer sorts the sperm cells according to a specified DNA characteristic, as will be described below. As the sorted sperm cells are collected by the collection system of the flow cytometer at step <b>57</b>, they are added to a collection vessel that contains a collection fluid or cryoextender at step <b>58</b>A. In addition to the collection fluid, additives may also be added at step <b>58</b>A, including, for example, an energy source, a protein source, an antibiotic, and/or a composition which regulates oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly. By this time the sperm cells are in a solution that has been diluted by the various fluids added throughout the process. Accordingly, the population of sperm cells having the desired DNA characteristic are concentrated at step <b>58</b>B for use in commercial artificial insemination. A cryoextender is added to the concentrated sorted sperm cells at step <b>58</b>C. In addition to the cryoextender, additives may also be added at step <b>58</b>C, including, for example, an energy source, a protein source, an antibiotic, and/or a composition which regulates oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly. The sperm cells are then packed in tubular containers (referred to in the breeding industry as &#x201c;straws&#x201d;) at step <b>59</b> and cryopreserved at step <b>61</b>. The cryopreserved sperm are packed for storage in liquid nitrogen at step <b>63</b>. The cryopreserved sperm are then distributed through a commercial distribution system at step <b>65</b> and sold to animal breeders at step <b>67</b>. The animal breeders may store the cryopreserved sperm at step <b>69</b> until they are ready to use the sperm to artificially inseminate a female animal (e.g., cow) at step <b>71</b>. As will be discussed below, one embodiment of the present invention involves temperature control through substantially the entire process. Likewise, completion of the various steps within defined time limits is one aspect of another embodiment of the present invention. This overall process is only one example of how the present invention can be used, and it will be understood that some of the aforementioned steps can be deleted and/or others added. The sorted sperm cells can also be used for microinjection or other in vitro fertilization, followed by embryo transplant into a recipient female animal.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0762">The steps of the overall process incorporating advances of the present invention are described in detail below. While a particular process described is in the context of sorting animal sperm (e.g., bovine sperm), it will be understood that the various aspects of this invention are more generally applicable to any type of sperm (equine, porcine, and others), even more generally to any type of cells, and even more generally to any type of particles, organic and inorganic, including latex particles, magnetic particles, chromosomes, sub-cellular elements, protoplasts, and starch particles. These particles generally fall within a size range of 0.5 to 200 microns, but the technology of this invention is not limited to this range.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Sample Collection and Dilution</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Sample Collection</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0763">The sperm sample to be sorted may be a freshly collected sample from a source animal, such as bovine, equine, porcine, or other mammalian source, or a thawed, previously cryopreserved sample. Moreover, the sample may be a single ejaculate, multiple pooled ejaculates from the same mammal, or multiple pooled ejaculates from two or more animals.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0764">Various collection methods are known and include the gloved-hand method, use of an artificial vagina, and electro-ejaculation. The sperm are preferably collected or quickly transferred into an insulated container to avoid a rapid temperature change from physiological temperatures (typically about 35&#xb0; C. to about 39&#xb0; C.). The ejaculate typically contains about 0.5 to 15 billion sperm per milliliter, depending upon the species and particular animal.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0765">Regardless of the method of collection, an aliquot may be drawn from the sperm sample and evaluated for various characteristics, such as for example, sperm concentration, sperm motility, sperm progressive motility, sample pH, sperm membrane integrity, and sperm morphology. This data may be obtained by examination of the sperm using, for example, the Hamilton-Thorn Motility Analyzer (IVOS), according to standard and well known procedures (see, for example, Farrell et al. <i>Theriogenology </i>(1998) 49(4): 871-9; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,896,966 and 4,896,967).</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Dilution</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0766">The sperm sample may be combined with a buffer (in the form of a solid or solution) to form a sperm suspension. Among other things, the buffer may enhance sperm viability by buffering the suspension against significant changes in pH or osmotic pressure. Generally, a buffer is non-toxic to the cells and is compatible with the dye used to stain the cells. Exemplary buffers include phosphates, diphosphates, citrates, acetates, lactates, and combinations thereof. Presently preferred buffers include TCA, TEST, sodium citrate, HEPES, TL, TES, citric acid monohydrate, HEPEST (Gradipore, St. Louis, Mo.), PBS (Johnson et al., <i>Gamete Research, </i>17:203-212 (1987)), and Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0767">One or more buffers may be combined together or with additives as discussed below to form a buffered solution, and the buffered solution combined with the sperm sample to form a sperm suspension. A buffered solution may also contain one or more additives, as described in greater detail below. Exemplary buffered solutions are described in Table I. Preferred buffered solutions include a solution comprising 3% TRIS base, 2% citric acid monohydrate, and 1% fructose (w/v) in water at a pH of about 7.0, a solution designated as TCA #1 in Table I, and a solution designated as TCA #2 in Table I.</p>

<p id="p-0169" num="0769">Alternatively, the sperm may be combined with a metabolic inhibitor to form an inhibited sperm suspension. Metabolic inhibitors cause the sperm cells to emulate sperm cells of the epididymis of a mammal, such as for example a bull, by simulating the fluid environment of the epididymis or epididymal tract of the mammal. Such an inhibitor would reduce or inhibit the motility and metabolic activity of the sperm. Exemplary inhibitors of this class include carbonate based inhibitors, such as for example those disclosed in Salisbury &#x26; Graves, J. Reprod. Fertil., 6:351-359 (1963). A preferred inhibitor of this type comprises NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, KHCO<sub>3</sub>, and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O. A more preferred inhibitor of this type comprises 0.204 g NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.433 g KHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 0.473 g C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O per 25 mL of purified water (0.097 moles/L of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. 0.173 moles/L of KHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.090 moles/L C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O in water).</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0770">In addition to a buffer, the sperm suspension may also contain a range of additives to enhance sperm viability or motility. Exemplary additives include energy sources, protein sources, antibiotics, and compositions which regulate oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly. One or more of these additives may be introduced into the buffer or buffered solution before the formation of the sperm suspension or, alternatively, may be separately introduced into the sperm suspension.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0771">One or more energy sources may be added to minimize or inhibit the sperm cells from oxidizing intracellular phospholipids and other cellular components. Exemplary energy sources include monosaccharides, such as fructose, glucose, galactose and mannose, and disaccharides, such as sucrose, lactose, maltose, and trehalose, as well as other polysaccharides. For example, the resulting sperm suspension may include about 1% (w/v) to about 4% (w/v) of the energy source(s). If included, the energy source is preferably fructose and the sperm suspension contains about 2.5% (w/v).</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0772">To minimize dilution shock, provide support to the cells, or disperse the cells throughout the suspension, a protein source may also be included in the buffer, buffered solution, or sperm suspension. Exemplary protein sources include egg yolk, egg yolk extract, milk (including heat homogenized and skim), milk extract, soy protein, soy protein extract, serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, human serum substitute supplement, and combinations thereof. Albumin, and more particularly bovine serum albumin (BSA), is a preferred protein source. For example, if included, BSA may be present in the sperm suspension in an amount of less than about 5.0% (w/v), preferably less than about 2% (w/v), more preferably less than about 1% (w/v), and most preferably in an amount of about 0.1% (w/v).</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0773">The use of a protein source, such BSA, alone may initiate the process of capacitation in a percentage of the sperm cells in the suspension. It is preferred that this process take place in the female reproductive tract. Therefore, in order to inhibit the initiation of capacitation during dilution, as well as during the subsequent staining and sorting, an alternative protein source or a protein substitute may be included in the sperm suspension. The alternative protein source or protein substitute possess the advantageous effects of a typical protein source, such as BSA, in addition to the ability to inhibit the initiation of capacitation in a larger percentage of the cells in the sperm suspension. Examples of alternative protein sources include human serum substitute supplement (SSS) (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, Calif.) and cholesterol enhancer BSA, while an example of a protein substitute includes a polyvinyl alcohol, such as for example, a low to medium viscosity polyvinyl alcohol generally of a molecular weight of about 30,000 to about 60,000. Generally, if included, these compositions will be present in the same amounts as disclosed above with respect to BSA, with the total albumin content of the buffer or buffered solution generally not exceeding about 5.0% (w/v).</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0774">An antibiotic may be added to the sperm suspension in order to inhibit bacterial growth. Exemplary antibiotics include, for example, tylosin, gentamicin, lincomycin, spectinomycin, Linco-Spectin&#xae; (lincomycin hydrochloride-spectinomycin), penicillin, streptomycin, ticarcillin, or any combination thereof. The antibiotics may be present in a concentration of about 50 &#x25a1;g to about 800 &#x25a1;g per ml of semen, regardless of whether the semen is neat, buffered, or contains additional substances, such as for example, any of the additives mentioned herein. The Certified Semen Services (CSS) and National Association of Animal Breeders (NAAB) have promulgated guidelines regarding the use of antibiotics with respect to sperm collection and use.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0775">A composition which regulates oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly may also be included in the sperm suspension. Such a composition may provide a protective effect to the sperm cells, such as for example by maintaining sperm viability or progressive motility. Examples of such a composition include, for example, pyruvate, vitamin K, lipoic acid, glutathione, flavins, quinones, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and SOD mimics. If included in the sperm suspension, such a composition may be present in a concentration sufficient to effect the protective effect without detrimentally affecting sperm health. Exemplary concentration ranges include from about 10 &#x25a1;M to about 50 mM depending upon such factors as the particular composition being used or the concentration of sperm in the suspension. For example, pyruvate may be present in the sperm suspension in a concentration from about 1 mM to about 50 mM, preferably from about 2.5 mM to about 40 mM, more preferably from about 5 mM to 25 mM, even more preferably from about 10 mM to 15 mM, still more preferably about 15 mM, and most preferably about 10 mM. Vitamin K may be present in the sperm suspension in a concentration from about 10M to about 100 &#x25a1;M, preferably from about 10 &#x25a1;M to about 100 &#x25a1;M, and more preferably about 100 &#x25a1;M. Lipoic acid may be present in the sperm suspension in a concentration from about 0.1 mM to about 1 mM, preferably from about 0.5 mM to about 1 mM, and more preferably about 1 mM.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Staining of the Cells to be Sorted</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0776">Generally, sperm cells may be stained by forming a staining mixture comprising sperm cells, a buffer, and a dye. The sperm cells may be derived from a freshly obtained semen sample, as discussed above with respect to sample collection and dilution, or from a thawed cryopreserved semen sample.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0777">If the semen sample is a thawed, previously cryopreserved sample, the sperm are preferably thawed immediately prior to staining. Generally, a straw or other cryopreservation vessel containing the frozen sperm may be placed in a water bath, the temperature of which is preferably in excess of the glass transition temperature of the sperm cell membrane (i.e., about 17&#xb0; C.), but not so great as to adversely impact sperm health. For example, frozen sperm may be thawed by immersing the cryopreservation vessel in a water bath maintained at a temperature of about 17&#xb0; C. to about 40&#xb0; C. for a period of about 30 seconds to about 90 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0778">Once obtained, the sperm cells may be introduced into the staining mixture in the form of neat semen or in the form of a suspension derived therefrom, e.g., a sperm suspension as discussed above with respect to sample collection and dilution.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0779">The dye may be in the form of a neat solid or a liquid composition. The dye may also be dissolved or dispersed in an unbuffered liquid to form a dye solution. Alternatively, the dye may be in the form of a dye suspension comprising a dye and a buffer or buffered solution that is biologically compatible with sperm cells. A range exemplary buffers and buffered solutions are discussed above with respect to sample collection and dilution. For example, among the buffers which may be used is a TCA buffer solution comprising 3% TRIS base, 2% citric acid monohydrate, and 1% fructose in water at a pH of about 7.0, or a carbonate-based inhibitor solution comprising 0.204 g NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.433 g KHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 0.473 g C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O per 25 mL of purified water (0.097 moles/L of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.173 moles/L of KHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.090 moles/L C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O in water). Thus, for example, a staining mixture may be formed by combining neat semen with a dye. Alternatively, the staining mixture may be formed by combining neat semen with a buffer or buffered solution and a dye. Additionally, the staining mixture may be formed by combining a sperm suspension with a dye.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0780">The staining mixture may be formed by using one or more UV or visible light excitable, DNA selective dyes as previously described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,759 and WO 02/41906. Exemplary UV light excitable, selective dyes include Hoechst 33342 and Hoechst 33258, each of which is commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.). Exemplary visible light excitable dyes include SYBR-14, commercially available from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, Oreg.) and bisbenzimide-BODIPY&#xae; conjugate 6-{[3-((2Z)-2-{[1-(difluoroboryl)-3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl]methylene}-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)propanoyl]amino}-N-[3-(methyl{3-[({4-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H,3&#x2032;H-2,5&#x2032;-bibenzimidazol-2&#x2032;-yl]phenoxy}acetyl)amino]propyl}amino)propyl]hexan amide (&#x201c;BBC&#x201d;) described in WO 02/41906. Each of these dyes may be used alone or in combination; alternatively, other cell permeant UV and visible light excitable dyes may be used, alone or in combination with the aforementioned dyes, provided the dye does not detrimentally affect the viability of the sperm cells to an unacceptable degree when used in concentrations which enable sorting as described elsewhere.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0781">The preferred concentration of the DNA selective dye in the staining mixture is a function of a range of variables which include the permeability of the cells to the selected dye, the temperature of the staining mixture, the amount of time allowed for staining to occur, and the degree of enrichment desired in the subsequent sorting step. In general, the dye concentration is preferably sufficient to achieve the desired degree of staining in a reasonably short period of time without substantially detrimentally affecting sperm viability. For example, the concentration of Hoechst 33342, Hoechst 33258, SYBR-14, or BBC in the staining mixture will generally be between about 0.1 &#x3bc;M and about 1.0 M, preferably from about 0.1 &#x3bc;M to about 700 &#x3bc;M, and more preferably from about 100 &#x3bc;M to about 200 &#x3bc;M. Accordingly, under one set of staining conditions, the concentration of Hoechst 33342 is preferably about 100 &#x3bc;M. Under another set of staining conditions, the concentration of Hoechst 33342 is about 150 &#x3bc;M. Under still another set of staining conditions the concentration is preferably about 200 &#x3bc;M.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0782">In addition to buffer, other additives may be included in the staining mixture to enhance the viability or motility of the sperm; these additives may be provided as part of the sperm source, the dye source, or separately to the staining mixture. Such additives include energy sources, antibiotics, compositions which regulate oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly, and seminal plasma, the first three of which are discussed above with respect to sample collection and dilution, and the last of which is discussed below with respect to collection fluids. Such additives may be added during the staining techniques in accordance therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0783">In particular, it has been observed that the inclusion of a composition which regulates oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly in the staining mixture may help to maintain sperm viability at elevated staining temperatures, at elevated dye concentrations, at increased staining periods, or any combination thereof. Examples of these compositions and the use of the same are discussed above with respect to buffers and diluents. Such compositions may be added during the staining techniques in accordance therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0784">The staining mixture may be maintained at any of a range of temperatures; typically, this will be within a range of about 4&#xb0; C. to about 50&#xb0; C. For example, the staining mixture may be maintained at a &#x201c;relatively low&#x201d; temperature, i.e., a temperature of about 4&#xb0; C. to about 30&#xb0; C.; in this embodiment, the temperature is preferably from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 30&#xb0; C., more preferably from about 25&#xb0; C. to about 30&#xb0; C., and most preferable at about 28&#xb0; C. Alternatively, the staining mixture may be maintained within an &#x201c;intermediate&#x201d; temperature range, i.e., a temperature of about 30&#xb0; C. to about 39&#xb0; C.; in this embodiment, the temperature is preferably at about 34&#xb0; C. to about 39&#xb0; C., and more preferably about 37&#xb0; C. In addition, the staining mixture may be maintained within a &#x201c;relatively high&#x201d; temperature range, i.e., a temperature of about 40&#xb0; C. to about 50&#xb0; C.; in this embodiment, the temperature is preferably from about 40&#xb0; C. to about 45&#xb0; C., more preferably from about 40&#xb0; C. to about 43&#xb0; C., and most preferably at about 41&#xb0; C. Selection of a preferred temperature generally depends upon a range of variables, including for example, the permeability of the cells to the dye(s) being used, the concentration of the dye(s) in the staining mixture, the amount of time the cells will be maintained in the staining mixture, and the degree of enrichment desired in the sorting step.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0785">Uptake of dye by the sperm cells in the staining mixture is allowed to continue for a period of time sufficient to obtain the desired degree of DNA staining. That period is typically a period sufficient for the dye to bind to the DNA of the sperm cells such that X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm cells may be sorted based upon the differing and measurable fluorescence intensity between the two. Generally, this will be no more than about 160 minutes, preferably no more than about 90 minutes, still more preferably no more than about 60 minutes, and most preferably from about 5 minutes to about 40 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0786">Accordingly, in one embodiment, a staining mixture is formed comprising sperm cells and a dye in a concentration from about 100 &#x3bc;M to about 200 &#x3bc;M, and the staining mixture is held for a period of time at a temperature of about 41&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the staining mixture further comprises pyruvate in a concentration of about 10 mM, vitamin K in a concentration of about 100 &#x3bc;M, or lipoic acid in a concentration of about 1 mM.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0787">In still another embodiment, a staining mixture is formed comprising sperm cells and a dye in a concentration from about 100 &#x3bc;M to about 200 &#x3bc;M, and the staining mixture is held for a period of time at a temperature of about 28&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the staining mixture comprises pyruvate in a concentration of about 10 mM, vitamin K in a concentration of about 100 &#x3bc;M, or lipoic acid in a concentration of about 1 mM.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0788">In yet another example, a staining mixture is formed comprising sperm cells, a metabolic inhibitor comprising 0.204 g NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.433 g KHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 0.473 g C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O per 25 mL of purified water (0.097 moles/L of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.173 moles/L of KHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.090 moles/L C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>&#x2014;H<sub>2</sub>O in water), and a dye in a concentration from about 100 &#x3bc;M to about 200 &#x3bc;M, and the staining mixture is held for a period of time at a temperature of about 28&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the staining mixture is held for a period of time at a temperature of about 41&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Sheath Fluid</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0789">To sort the sperms cells, the stained cells are introduced as a sample fluid into the nozzle of a flow cytometer as described below. As part of the process, the sample fluid is typically surrounded by a sheath fluid. The sheath fluid permits the sperm cells in the sample fluid to be drawn out into a single file line as discussed below. The sheath fluid is collected along with the sperm cells by the collection system of the flow cytometer and therefore forms part of the post-sort environment for the sperm cells. Thus, it is desirable that the sheath fluid provides a protective effect to the cells upon contact of cells by the sheath fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0790">The sheath fluid generally comprises a buffer or buffered solution. Examples of buffers and buffered solutions and illustrative concentrations of the same that may be used in the sheath fluid are disclosed above with respect to sample collection and dilution. In a particular embodiment, the sheath fluid comprises 0.96% Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (w/v), 0.1% BSA (w/v), in water at a pH of about 7.0.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0791">Optionally, the sheath fluid may also contain a range of additives that are beneficial to sperm viability or motility. Such additives include, for example, an energy source, a protein source, an antibiotic, a composition which regulates oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly, an alternative protein source, and polyvinyl alcohol. Each of these additives, and examples of the same, is discussed above with respect to sample collection and dilution. Such additives may be added to the sheath fluid in accordance therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0792">The sheath fluid may optionally be filtered prior to the sorting step. Contaminants that may be present in the sheath fluid, such as non-soluble particulates, may interfere with sorting. Therefore, the sheath fluid may be filtered prior to its introduction into a flow cytometer. Such filters and methods of using the same are well known in the art. Generally, the filter is a membrane of about 0.1 microns to about 0.5 microns, preferably about 0.2 microns to about 0.3 microns, and more preferably about 0.2 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0793">The stained cells may be introduced into the sheath fluid at any time subsequent to staining. Typically, a stream of the stained cells in the sample fluid is injected into a stream of sheath fluid within the nozzle of the flow cytometer. Initially, there is substantially no contacting of the sample fluid and the sheath fluid due to laminar flow of the fluids as discussed in more detail below. It is desirable that the sample fluid and the sheath fluid remain as substantially discrete flowing streams until after the particles (e.g., the stained sperm cells) in the sample fluid have been analyzed. At some point, however, the sheath fluid and the cells of the sample fluid come in contact with one another. For instance in a droplet sorting flow cytometer (discussed below) the sheath fluid and sample fluid begin contacting one another as droplets are being formed downstream of the interrogation location.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0794">At the time of the introduction of the stained cells and the sheath fluid, both the stained cells and the sheath fluid may be at a temperature from about 4&#xb0; C. to about 50&#xb0; C. The sheath fluid and the stained cells may be at the same or at different temperatures, with either being at a higher temperature than the other. Accordingly, in one embodiment, at the time of the introduction of the stained cells and the sheath fluid, both the cells and the sheath fluid are at the same temperature; for example, at a &#x201c;relatively low&#x201d; temperature, such as for example at about 5&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C.; at an &#x201c;intermediate&#x201d; temperature, such as for example at about 25&#xb0; C. to about 30&#xb0; C.; or at a &#x201c;relatively high&#x201d; temperature, such as for example at about 40&#xb0; C. to about 43&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the stained cells are at a higher temperature than the sheath fluid, such as for example, the cells being at about 40&#xb0; C. to about 43&#xb0; C. and the sheath fluid being at about room temperature or at about 5&#xb0; C. In yet another embodiment, the stained cells are at a lower temperature than the sheath fluid.</p>

<p id="p-0195" num="0795">One embodiment of the present invention employs inventive technologies in flow cytometry to analyze and sort the sperm cells. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, one embodiment of a flow cytometry system of the present invention is designated in its entirety by the reference numeral <b>1</b>. As will appear, the flow cytometry system <b>1</b> is useful for classifying and sorting particles, such as sperm cells, according to selected characteristics. In general, the system <b>1</b> comprises a supply <b>3</b> of carrier fluid <b>17</b> containing particles to be sorted, a supply <b>7</b> of sheath fluid <b>19</b>, flow cytometry apparatus having sorting capabilities, generally designated <b>9</b>, and a fluid delivery system <b>15</b> for delivering the carrier <b>17</b> and sheath fluids <b>19</b> from respective supplies <b>3</b>, <b>7</b> under pressure to the flow cytometry apparatus <b>9</b>. The flow cytometry apparatus <b>9</b> is adapted for receiving the carrier <b>17</b> and sheath <b>19</b> fluids, for combining the fluids <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> to create a stream of pressurized fluid <b>21</b>, for directing the stream <b>21</b> carrying the particles through a focused beam of electromagnetic radiation <b>25</b> (e.g., UV laser light), and for analyzing the electromagnetic radiation <b>31</b> (e.g., fluorescent light) emitted by particles passing through the focused beam <b>25</b>. The apparatus <b>9</b> also functions to break the stream <b>21</b> up into droplets <b>33</b> containing particles to be evaluated, and to sort the droplets <b>33</b> based on the aforesaid measurements according to one or more characteristics of the particles contained in the droplets <b>33</b>. While this invention may be used to analyze and preferably sort any type of particle, it has particular application to sorting cells according to one or more desired characteristics of the cells (e.g., size, DNA content, shape, density, gene sequence, etc.). This invention is especially suited for sorting animal sperm cells for commercial use by the animal production industry for in vivo or in vitro artificial insemination, as discussed in more detail below.</p>

<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Flow Cytometry Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0796">The flow cytometry apparatus <b>9</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> comprises a nozzle system, generally designated <b>101</b>, for delivering a fluid stream <b>21</b> containing particles (e.g., stained sperm cells) through a nozzle orifice <b>103</b> under pressure with the cells substantially in single file and, in the case of sperm cells, with asymmetric heads of the sperm cells substantially in a desired orientation which will be described. As in conventional flow cytometry droplet sorting systems, a transducer <b>105</b> is provided opposite the nozzle orifice <b>103</b> for introducing acoustical energy into the fluid stream <b>21</b> which causes the stream <b>21</b> to break into droplets <b>33</b> containing individual cells at a &#x201c;droplet break-off&#x201d; location <b>107</b> spaced from the nozzle orifice <b>103</b>. The system <b>1</b> also includes an optics system, generally designated <b>109</b>, for focusing a beam of electromagnetic radiation <b>25</b> (e.g., 350-700 nm UV or visible laser light) on the fluid stream <b>21</b> at an &#x201c;interrogation&#x201d; location <b>115</b> which, in the described embodiment, is between the nozzle orifice <b>103</b> and the droplet break-off location <b>107</b>. Thus, the described embodiment is a jet-in-air system. In other embodiments, the interrogation location <b>107</b> could be inside the nozzle orifice <b>103</b> or upstream from the orifice <b>103</b>. In any event, the cells are adapted to pass through the beam of light <b>25</b> at the interrogation location <b>107</b>, resulting in excitation of a chemical stain (or other reporting medium) in the cells to cause fluorescence emissions <b>31</b> having a wavelength different from that of the beam <b>25</b> (e.g., if the illumination light <b>25</b> has a wavelength of about 350 to 370 nm, the fluorescent emissions <b>31</b> may have a wavelength of about 460 nm). A photodetector <b>117</b> is operable to detect these emissions <b>31</b> and to convert them into electrical signals which are processed and used to classify the cells according to selected characteristics, such as the X/Y chromosome content of sperm cells. The flow cytometry apparatus <b>9</b> further comprises a sorting system, generally designated <b>119</b>, for sorting the droplets <b>33</b> into different groups or populations (e.g., two populations <b>123</b>, <b>125</b>) according to the classification of the cells contained in the droplets <b>33</b> and a collection system, generally designated <b>2201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), for collecting the droplets <b>33</b> and maintaining the segregation of the different populations <b>123</b>, <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0797">Operation of the system <b>1</b> is controlled by a processor <b>131</b>, such as microprocessor or other digital or analog control and/or processor, or combinations thereof, which controls the various functions of the components of the system <b>1</b> in a manner to be described. Significantly, the processor <b>131</b> is also responsive to particle analysis information to control the output of the system <b>1</b> based on selected control and sorting strategies involving different parameters, including the desired purity of one of the sorted populations of particles, the acceptable quantity (or percentage) of desired particles one of the populations as compared to the quantity (or percentage) of desired particles in one or more of the other populations, and other parameters, as will be discussed later.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0798">The various components of the system <b>1</b> are described in detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Nozzle System</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0799">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the nozzle system <b>101</b> comprises, in one exemplary embodiment, a generally cylindrical flow body <b>133</b> having a central longitudinal bore <b>135</b> through it, and a nozzle <b>137</b> on the flow body <b>133</b> having a funnel-shaped nozzle body <b>139</b>. A passage <b>141</b> extends through the nozzle body <b>139</b> co-axial with the bore <b>135</b> in the flow body <b>133</b> and terminates in the aforementioned nozzle orifice <b>103</b> at the forward end of the nozzle <b>137</b>. The nozzle body <b>139</b> has an internally threaded counterbore <b>145</b> at its rearward end for threadably receiving a threaded projection or stud <b>149</b> at the forward end of the flow body <b>133</b> to removably connect the nozzle <b>137</b> to the flow body <b>133</b>, the connection being sealed by an O-ring seal <b>155</b>. It will be understood that the nozzle can be removably connected to the flow body in other ways or, alternatively, the parts could be integrally formed as one piece.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0800">Particles are delivered to the nozzle <b>137</b> by means of a conduit <b>157</b> positioned co-axially in the bore <b>135</b> of the flow body <b>133</b>. The outside diameter of the conduit <b>157</b> is less than the inside diameter of the bore <b>135</b> so that an annular space <b>167</b> is formed around the conduit <b>157</b>. In one particular embodiment, the conduit <b>157</b> is a tubular needle (e.g., a 16-ga. needle having an inside diameter of 0.01 in.) having a front end which extends into the counterbore <b>145</b> at the back of the nozzle <b>137</b>. The back end of the conduit <b>157</b> is connected to the fluid delivery system <b>15</b> for delivery of carrier fluid <b>15</b> (e.g., a staining mixture containing sperm cells) to the conduit <b>157</b>. The annular space <b>167</b> surrounding the conduit <b>157</b> is connected by means of a radial bore <b>173</b> in the flow body <b>133</b> to the fluid delivery system <b>15</b> for delivery of sheath fluid <b>19</b> into the annular space <b>167</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, an optional second radial bore <b>183</b> may be provided in the flow body <b>133</b> connecting the annular space <b>167</b> to another line (not shown) for supply of additional sheath fluid <b>19</b> to the nozzle <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0801">As in conventional flow cytometry systems, sheath fluid <b>19</b> is introduced into the annular space <b>167</b> surrounding the conduit <b>157</b>. The velocity of the sheath fluid <b>19</b> as it flows past the tip of the conduit <b>157</b> is much higher that the velocity of the carrier fluid <b>17</b> exiting the conduit <b>157</b>, so that the carrier fluid <b>17</b> and cells (e.g., sperm cells) contained therein are accelerated by the sheath fluid <b>19</b> toward the orifice <b>103</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b>. This acceleration functions to space the cells out generally in a single file arrangement for separate analysis by the optics system <b>109</b>. The sheath fluid <b>19</b> surrounds the carrier fluid <b>17</b>, resulting in the fluid stream <b>21</b> having a central core <b>189</b> of carrier fluid <b>17</b> and an outer co-axial sheath <b>191</b> of sheath fluid <b>19</b> surrounding the central core <b>189</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). As will be understood by those skilled in flow cytometry, the laminar flow and hydrodynamic focusing of the central core <b>189</b> tends to confine the particles to the core <b>189</b>, with little mixing of the sheath <b>19</b> and carrier fluids <b>17</b> in the nozzle <b>137</b>. Further, the central core <b>189</b> remains essentially intact within the sheath <b>191</b> as the stream <b>21</b> moves through the nozzle system <b>101</b>, until such time as droplets <b>33</b> are formed at the break-off location <b>107</b>. This type of co-axial flow is particularly suited for flow cytometry, because the particles to be analyzed are confined within the relatively narrow core <b>189</b> of the stream. As a result, a beam of light <b>25</b> focused on the center or core <b>189</b> of the stream <b>21</b> will illuminate the particles so that they may be analyzed substantially one at a time. By confining the core <b>189</b> within a sufficiently narrow diameter, one can obtain more uniform illumination of the particles in the core fluid <b>189</b>. For good analytical results, the diameter of the core containing the particles should desirably be within a range of 7 to 20 microns, and more desirably within a range of 7 to 14 microns. The diameter of the core stream <b>189</b> can be increased or decreased by adjusting the rate of delivery of the carrier fluid <b>17</b> relative to the rate of delivery of the sheath fluid <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Cell Orientation</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0802">For optimizing analytical results, it is desirable that particles having asymmetric shapes be in a desired orientation when they pass through the light beam from the optics system. As is known to those skilled in the art, fluorescence emissions from asymmetric particles tend to anisotropic (i.e., the intensity of the emissions are not uniform in all directions). As used herein, the term &#x201c;desired orientation&#x201d; means an orientation which allows the processing system to discriminate between cells having different characteristics with an accuracy in a range of 70% to 100%, more desirably in a range of 80% to 100%, still more desirably in a range of 90% to 100%, and most desirably 95% or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0803">To illustrate the point, a bovine sperm cell <b>201</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. Typically, the cell has a paddle-shaped head <b>205</b> with relatively flat wide opposite faces <b>207</b> and narrow edges <b>209</b>, a nucleus <b>213</b> in the head <b>205</b> containing the chromatic DNA mass of the cell, and a tail <b>215</b> extending from the head <b>205</b> providing the motility necessary for effective fertilization. The average bovine sperm cell <b>201</b> has a head length <b>219</b> of about 8 &#x3bc;m, a head width <b>221</b> of about 4 &#x3bc;m, and an overall length <b>223</b> from the front of the head to the end of the tail of about 100 &#x3bc;m. In the average bovine sperm cell <b>201</b>, the nucleus <b>213</b> occupies most of the head volume and is only slightly smaller than the sperm head <b>205</b>. Thus, the nucleus length <b>217</b> is almost equal to the head length <b>219</b>, again being about 8 &#x3bc;m in length. It has been observed that in the bovine the X/Y chromosomes of the sperm cells <b>201</b> are localized in a region of the nucleus <b>225</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) below and immediately adjacent the longitudinal midline or equator <b>211</b> or center of the head <b>205</b>. More specifically, this sub-equatorial region <b>225</b> extends no more than about 20% of the nucleus length <b>217</b> on the lower half (toward the tail <b>215</b>) of the nucleus <b>213</b>, even more specifically no more than about 10-15% of the nucleus length <b>217</b> on the lower half of the nucleus <b>213</b>, and still more specifically no more than about 1.0-1.5 &#x3bc;m below the equator <b>211</b> of the nucleus <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0804">When sperm cells pass through the excitation beam <b>25</b>, it is desirable that the cells be substantially in single file and that the head <b>205</b> of the each cell <b>201</b> be substantially similarly oriented to reduce orientation variability from cell to cell and thus provide for a more uniform measurement of the cells. It is also desired that the cells have an orientation which will enable accurate discrimination between X and Y cells. Desirably, this orientation is one where the length of the sperm cell <b>201</b> is generally aligned with the direction of stream flow <b>227</b> (either head leading (shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) or head trailing) and where the head <b>205</b> of the sperm cell <b>201</b> is rotated on its longitudinal axis so that the head <b>205</b> falls within an angular envelope <b>229</b> in which the light beam <b>25</b> from the optics system <b>109</b> will strike a wide face <b>207</b> of the cell <b>201</b> generally broadside, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, rather than a narrow edge <b>209</b> of the cell. Preferably, the envelope <b>229</b> defining the desired orientation is generated by rotation of a sperm cell <b>201</b> through an angular range of R<b>1</b> relative to a plane P which is generally perpendicular to the incoming light beam <b>25</b>, as viewed in a cross section taken transversely through the stream <b>21</b>. The range R<b>1</b> is preferably 0 to 90 degrees, more preferably 0 to 60 degrees, and even more preferably 0 to 30 degrees. The nozzle of the present invention is configured to achieve this desired orientation with an accuracy of up to 90% or more.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0805">The tolerance for sperm orientation (i.e., the size of the envelope <b>229</b> defined by angular range R<b>1</b>) is related to the numerical aperture of the lens used to collect fluorescence emissions <b>31</b> from the sperm cells. In the embodiment shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for example, the optics system <b>109</b> has a fluorescence emission <b>31</b> detection volume <b>579</b> defined by a solid angle of 55 degrees. When the rotational orientation of a sperm head <b>205</b> is outside the envelope <b>229</b> defined by R<b>1</b> as the sperm moves through the beam <b>25</b>, a relatively stronger fluorescence emission <b>31</b> from an edge <b>209</b> of the sperm head <b>205</b> will be collected by the optic system <b>109</b>, preventing the processor <b>131</b> from correlating the intensity of the fluorescence emission <b>31</b> with the X/Y chromosome content of the sperm cell <b>201</b>. However, the optics system <b>109</b> does not collect the relatively stronger fluorescence emissions <b>31</b> from the narrow edge <b>209</b> of the sperm heads <b>205</b> as long as the rotational orientation of a sperm head <b>205</b> is within the envelope <b>229</b> as it passes through the interrogation location <b>115</b>. Thus, in the embodiment shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the orientation of the sperm cell does not result in collection of the relatively stronger edge-wise fluorescence emissions as long as the narrow edges <b>209</b> of the sperm head <b>205</b> are confined within angle R<b>1</b>. The solid angle of the collection volume <b>579</b> can be decreased by using a lens with a smaller numerical aperture, thereby increasing angle R<b>1</b> and the tolerance for poorly oriented sperm. However, this also decreases the number of photons that can be collected by the optics system <b>109</b>, which can impact the measurement of fluorescence emissions <b>31</b> by reducing the intensity of the emissions <b>31</b> detected by the photodetector. Likewise, if the optics system <b>109</b> collects fluorescence emissions <b>31</b> with a high numerical aperture lens to obtain a stronger intensity of the fluorescence emissions detected by the photodetector, then the tolerance for sperm orientation decreases. Thus, in designing a system of the present invention, one needs to strike a balance between the tolerance for sperm orientation and the numerical lens aperture. The optimal balance will depend on the orienting capabilities and optical sensitivity of the system. In one desirable embodiment, for example, a lens having a numerical aperture 0.65 is used.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Nozzle Design</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0806">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the interior <b>231</b> of the nozzle body <b>139</b> downstream from the counterbore <b>145</b> has an interior surface <b>233</b> comprising first, second and third axially tapered regions <b>235</b>, <b>237</b>, <b>239</b> for progressively accelerating the speed of the fluid stream <b>21</b> in a downstream direction toward the nozzle orifice <b>103</b>. As noted previously, this acceleration functions to space the particles (e.g., cells) in the stream <b>21</b> so they assume a generally single file formation so they can be analyzed substantially one particle at a time. At least two of these regions, and preferably all three <b>235</b>, <b>237</b>, <b>239</b>, have generally elliptical (oval) shapes in cross sections taken at right angles to the longitudinal axis <b>247</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9H</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9J-9K</figref>. The interior surface <b>233</b> of the nozzle body <b>139</b> also has a fourth region <b>249</b>, not tapered, downstream from the first three regions <b>235</b>, <b>237</b>, <b>239</b> and immediately upstream of the nozzle orifice <b>103</b> which, in one embodiment, is formed in a separate orifice member <b>255</b> secured in a counterbore <b>257</b> at the front of the nozzle body <b>139</b>. In one embodiment, the generally elliptical cross sectional shapes of the first <b>235</b> and second <b>237</b> regions are oriented in substantially the same direction to define a first torsional zone <b>259</b>, and the generally elliptical cross sectional shape of the third region <b>239</b>, constituting a second torsional zone <b>261</b>, is oriented at an angle (e.g., about 90 degrees) relative to the generally elliptical cross sectional shapes of the first <b>235</b> and second <b>237</b> regions. The orientation is such that the interior surface <b>233</b> of the nozzle body <b>139</b> applies torsional forces to the fluid stream <b>21</b> and thereby tends to orient the sperm cells <b>201</b> in the aforestated desired orientation as they pass through the nozzle orifice <b>103</b>. Preferably, the first torsional zone <b>259</b> has an axial length <b>273</b> of 3.0-4.5 mm, preferably about 3.6 mm, and the first <b>235</b> and second <b>237</b> tapered regions making up the zone <b>259</b> have approximately equal axial lengths <b>275</b>, <b>277</b> (e.g., about 1.8 mm). The second torsional zone <b>261</b> has an axial length <b>279</b> of 3.5-5.0 mm, preferably about 4.45 mm. The fourth region <b>249</b> is preferably generally cylindrical in shape. Each generally cross-sectional elliptical shape A-D (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) at the boundaries of the first <b>235</b>, second <b>237</b> and third <b>239</b> regions has a major axis diameter and a minor axis diameter, exemplary dimensions of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and Table 1 below.</p>

<p id="p-0208" num="0808">It will be understood that the above dimensions are exemplary, and that other dimensions and shapes may also be suitable. Functionally, the changes in the ratios between the major and minor diameters, and the different orientations of the elliptical shapes of the regions, create side forces which act on each cell <b>201</b> and apply a torsional force <b>271</b> tending to rotate the cell <b>201</b> on its longitudinal axis so that its wide faces <b>207</b> align with the minor axis in the first torsional zone <b>259</b> and as the cell is gently twisted (e.g., 90 degrees) to align with the minor axis of the second torsional zone <b>261</b>. Each of the tapered surfaces <b>235</b>, <b>237</b>, <b>239</b> also serves to accelerate the stream <b>21</b> (and cells) flowing through the nozzle <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, the acceleration increases more gradually in the first <b>235</b> and third <b>239</b> regions and more rapidly in the second region <b>237</b>. Again by way of example, the taper of the first region <b>235</b> may range from about 11-14 degrees; the taper in the second region <b>237</b> may range from about 42-48 degrees; and the taper in the third region <b>239</b> may vary from about 8-12 degrees. The nozzle body <b>139</b> is formed from a suitable material such as molded plastic (ABS) or metal.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0809">The orifice member <b>255</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) is preferably formed from a hard, wear resistant material, such as sapphire, which is capable of being machined or otherwise formed with precise dimensions. The orifice member <b>255</b> itself has, in one embodiment, a conical upstream surface <b>309</b> of generally circular cross section which decreases in diameter from about 0.92 mm to about 0.060 mm and has an axial length <b>317</b> of about 0.54 mm and a taper angle of about 39 degrees. The orifice member <b>255</b> also has a generally cylindrical downstream surface <b>315</b> with a diameter of about 0.060 mm and an axial length <b>327</b> of about 0.36 mm. These dimensions are exemplary only, and it will be understood that the orifice member <b>255</b> may have other sizes and shapes. For example, the shape of the upstream surface <b>309</b> may be generally elliptical (oval) in cross section, and the diameter of the orifice <b>103</b> at the downstream end of the nozzle <b>137</b> may range from 40 to 100 microns or more. It is desirable that the size of the orifice <b>103</b> be such that the cells exiting the nozzle <b>101</b> are substantially in single file formation within the core <b>189</b> of the stream <b>21</b> and substantially in the desired orientation, as described previously. For example, in the case of sperm cells an orifice <b>103</b> having a diameter of about 60-62 microns at the downstream end has been found to be suitable. Preferably, the nozzle orifice <b>103</b> serves to further accelerate the stream <b>21</b> and to shape and size the stream <b>21</b> for optimum cell spacing, cell orientation and droplet <b>33</b> formation, as will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0810">The velocity of the cells as they exit the nozzle <b>137</b> will depend on various factors, including the pressure at which sheath fluid <b>19</b> is introduced into the nozzle system <b>101</b>. At a pressure of 20 psi, the cells will exit the nozzle orifice <b>103</b> of the above embodiment at a velocity of about 16.6 m/s as a generally cylindrical stream <b>21</b> containing cells which are substantially similarly oriented at the core <b>189</b> of the stream <b>21</b>. At a sheath pressure of 30 psi, the cell velocity will be about 20.3 m/s. At different sheath fluid <b>19</b> pressures, the velocity of the stream <b>21</b> will vary.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Introduction of Core Stream to Torsional Zone</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0811">Improved orientation of particles may be obtained by altering the flow of the fluid stream <b>21</b> through an orienting nozzle so that the core stream <b>189</b> containing the particles to be oriented (e.g., sperm cells) is directed along a flow path, at least a portion of which is offset from the center of the nozzle so that the particles are subjected to the hydrodynamic orienting forces generated by a nozzle while they are at a location that is offset from the center of the nozzle. Directing the core stream <b>189</b> along an offset flow path may also improve orientation of particles in a traditional nozzle (i.e., one that does not have any torsional zones). In many nozzles, one can determine that a given position is offset from the center of the nozzle because it is displaced from a longitudinal axis of the nozzle. One can also recognize that a particular position is offset from the center of a nozzle because it is displaced from the geometric center of a cross sectional area of the nozzle through which the fluid stream flows.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0812">A number of techniques may be used to direct the core stream <b>189</b> along a flow path that is offset from the center of the nozzle. For example, an orienting baffle may be positioned in the nozzle to deflect the core stream to one side of the nozzle. Similarly, the conduit <b>157</b> for introducing the core stream <b>189</b> containing the sample particles may be relocated from the traditional center of the nozzle to an offset location. Furthermore, it is contemplated that an offset sample introduction conduit <b>157</b> may be used in combination with an orienting baffle. Exemplary embodiments of use of an orienting baffle and use of an offset sample introduction conduit are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0813">The improved orientation of particles (e.g., sperm cells) achieved by use of an orienting baffle and/or offset sample introduction conduit <b>157</b> may be due to a number of factors. One factor is that the deflection of the core stream <b>189</b> and/or a change in the size and shape of the cross sectional flow area results in application of hydrodynamic forces that tend to orient asymmetric particles. (Kachel, at al., Histochemistry and Cytochemistry, 25(7): 774-80 (1977)). Another factor is that it has been found that asymmetric particles (in particular sperm cells) tend to orient as they flow in a fluid stream in close proximity to a solid surface. Thus, by directing the core stream <b>189</b> so that it is in close proximity to the interior surface of a nozzle or a baffle surface one can obtain improved orientation of the particles. Furthermore, a baffle and/or offset sample introduction conduit can be used in conjunction with an orienting nozzle which applies additional orienting forces (e.g., torsional forces) to the asymmetric particles. In that case, the baffle can operate to direct the fluid stream so that the core stream containing the particles to be oriented flows along a path that is offset from the center of the nozzle while the particles are subjected to the torsional forces generated by one or more of the torsional zones.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Orienting Baffle</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0814"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref> show one exemplary orienting baffle, generally designated <b>2001</b>, positioned in the orienting nozzle <b>137</b> described above. However, the baffle <b>2001</b> could be used in conjunction with a different nozzle, including a non-orienting nozzle, without departing from the scope of this invention. The baffle <b>2001</b> is positioned in the nozzle upstream from the orifice <b>103</b> and downstream from the sample injection needle <b>157</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the baffle comprises a baffle plate <b>2003</b> that is held in place by a baffle holder <b>2005</b>. In the embodiment shown, the baffle plate <b>2003</b> is generally L-shaped and constructed of a substantially rigid, durable and corrosion-resistant material (e.g., stainless steel). The L-shaped plate <b>2003</b> has an upstream leg <b>2007</b> and a downstream leg <b>2009</b>, which are desirably substantially perpendicular to each other (e.g., within about 5 degrees of being perpendicular). In the exemplary embodiment shown in the drawings, the two legs <b>2007</b>, <b>2009</b> of the L-shaped plate <b>2003</b> intersect at a line <b>2015</b> that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the line of intersection <b>2015</b> is also spaced a short distance <b>2033</b> (e.g., about 0.3 mm) away from the longitudinal axis <b>2057</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>. The upstream leg <b>2007</b> of the L-shaped plate <b>2003</b> extends from the line of intersection <b>2015</b> away from the longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> all the way to the edge of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Thus, the upstream leg <b>2007</b> is formed with a curved edge <b>2019</b> that closely matches the shape of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the upstream leg <b>2007</b> is inclined at an angle AA of about 15-25 degrees from perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>2057</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>. The downstream leg <b>2009</b> of the L-shaped plate <b>2007</b> extends downstream from the line of intersection <b>2015</b> of the two legs <b>2007</b>, <b>2009</b> a distance <b>2025</b> of about 2.0-2.5 mm at an angle BB that is in the range of about 60-80 degrees from perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>2057</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0815">The baffle holder <b>2005</b> is sized and shaped to fit inside the nozzle <b>137</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>. The baffle holder <b>2005</b> is preferably made of a moldable material (e.g., polypropylene) although the baffle holder <b>2005</b> may be constructed from other materials without departing from the scope of the present invention. The baffle holder <b>2005</b> used in the exemplary embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, is generally shaped as a hollow cylindrical shell about 4.0-4.5 mm in overall length <b>2027</b>. The baffle holder <b>2005</b> has an exterior diameter <b>2029</b> of about 5-6 mm and an interior diameter <b>2031</b> of about 2.5-3.5 mm. If the baffle holder <b>2005</b> is to be molded, a minor draft (not shown) can be provided on the surfaces of the holder <b>2005</b> (e.g., to allow the baffle holder to be easily removed from an injection molding machine). The upstream end <b>2035</b> of the exemplary baffle holder <b>2005</b> has an inclined surface <b>2037</b> which is inclined at the same angle AA as the upstream leg <b>2007</b> of the L-shaped plate <b>2003</b>. The upstream leg <b>2007</b> of the L-shaped plate <b>2003</b> abuts against and is supported by the inclined surface <b>2037</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>. The side edges <b>2039</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) of the downstream leg <b>2009</b> of the L-shaped plate <b>2003</b> are partially embedded (e.g., received in slots) in the baffle holder <b>2005</b> to hold the baffle plate <b>2003</b> in a position in which the downstream leg <b>2009</b> spans generally from one side of the baffle holder <b>2005</b> to the other. The downstream edge <b>2041</b> of the downstream leg <b>2009</b> in the exemplary embodiment forms a straight line which is generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>2057</b> of the baffle holder <b>2057</b>. There is a gap <b>2049</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) between the downstream edge <b>2041</b> of the downstream leg <b>2009</b> and the interior cylindrical surface <b>2051</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>. The gap <b>2049</b> provides fluid communication between a volume <b>2053</b> defined by the legs <b>2007</b>, <b>2009</b> of the L-shaped plate <b>2003</b> and the interior cylindrical surface <b>2051</b> of the baffle holder <b>2003</b> and the rest of the interior volume <b>2055</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0816">The baffle holder <b>2005</b> is desirably positioned inside the nozzle with the longitudinal axis <b>2057</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b> generally aligned with the longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> so that it holds the L-shaped plate <b>2003</b> in the position described above. Desirably, the exemplary baffle plate <b>2003</b> is rotationally oriented so that the line of intersection <b>2015</b> of the two legs <b>2007</b>, <b>2009</b> of the plate <b>2003</b> is parallel to a line <b>2059</b> running through the major axis of ellipse D, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. However, the exemplary baffle <b>2001</b> also performs well when the intersection <b>2015</b> of the two legs <b>2007</b>, <b>2009</b> of the L-shaped plate <b>2003</b> is perpendicular to the line <b>2059</b> running through the major axis of ellipse D, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Furthermore, the baffle may have any rotational orientation without departing from the scope of this invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the sample injection needle <b>157</b> in the exemplary embodiment is desirably a distance <b>2061</b> of about 0.25-1.0 mm upstream from the most upstream portion <b>2035</b> of the baffle <b>2001</b>. More desirably, the sample injection needle <b>157</b> is about 0.55-0.65 mm upstream from the most upstream portion <b>2035</b> of the baffle <b>2001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0817">The baffle holder <b>2005</b> may be held in a desired position relative to the nozzle in any number of ways. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the downstream end <b>2067</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b> is stepped so that it fits farther downstream in the nozzle <b>137</b>. The stepped downstream end <b>2067</b> of the holder <b>2005</b> is circular in shape and abuts against the elliptically shaped interior surface <b>233</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b>. Thus, the contact between the interior surface <b>233</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> and the baffle holder <b>2005</b> is generally limited to two points <b>2069</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. A pair of O-rings <b>2071</b> are positioned around the baffle holder <b>2005</b> between the nozzle <b>137</b> and the threaded projection <b>149</b> of the flow body <b>133</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>) and seal the nozzle system <b>101</b> against leakage. The O-rings <b>2071</b> may be made of Viton&#xae;, or any other similar materials. The two O-rings <b>2071</b> are compressed as the nozzle <b>137</b> is screwed onto the threaded projection <b>149</b> to provide a fluid-tight seal. Two O-rings <b>2071</b> are used in the exemplary embodiment because a single O-ring cannot be compressed within the space between the nozzle <b>137</b> and the flow body <b>133</b> due to the length <b>2027</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>. Any number of O-rings or a different type of seal could be used without departing from the scope of the present invention, provided that the number of O-rings or other type of seal is selected so that there will be a fluid-tight seal when the nozzle <b>137</b> is screwed onto the flow body <b>133</b>. This will depend on a number of factors, including the size and shape of the nozzle <b>137</b>, flow body <b>133</b>, baffle holder <b>2005</b>, and O-rings <b>2071</b> as well as the type of seal. The O-rings <b>2071</b> also help hold the baffle holder <b>2005</b> in the desired position. The O-rings <b>2071</b> occupy the space around the baffle holder <b>2005</b>, thereby restricting side-to-side movement of the baffle holder <b>2005</b> inside the nozzle <b>137</b>. Frictional forces between the O-rings <b>2071</b> and the baffle holder <b>2005</b> also resist rotational movement of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0818">When the nozzle <b>137</b> is tightened on the flow body <b>133</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the downstream end <b>2077</b> of the threaded projection <b>149</b> from the flow body <b>133</b>, in the form of a boss in this embodiment, is approximately even with the most upstream portion <b>2035</b> of the baffle <b>2001</b>. As a result, the baffle holder <b>2005</b> is held axially captive between the flow body <b>133</b> (at the upstream end <b>2035</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>) and the interior surface <b>233</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> (at the downstream end <b>2067</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>). Other retaining mechanisms may be used. In the embodiment shown in the drawings, the interior diameter of the boss <b>2079</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) at the downstream end of the threaded projection <b>149</b> is roughly equal to the internal diameter <b>2031</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0819">Those skilled in the art will recognize that the flow through the nozzle system <b>101</b> remains laminar notwithstanding the baffle <b>2001</b> because the small cross sectional area through which the fluids must flow results in a low Reynolds number for the flow. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the baffle deflects the core stream <b>189</b> and sheath stream <b>191</b> away from the central longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> and toward an interior surface <b>233</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b>. In one embodiment, the core stream <b>189</b> also flows very close to the interior surface <b>233</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> as the core stream <b>189</b> passes between the transition between the first <b>259</b> and second <b>261</b> torsional zones. However, a portion <b>2081</b> of the sheath fluid stream <b>191</b> remains between the core stream <b>189</b> and the interior surface <b>233</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> so the particles in the core stream <b>189</b> do not actually impact or contact the interior surface <b>233</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b>. Farther downstream in the nozzle <b>137</b>, the hydrodynamic forces push the core stream <b>189</b> back toward the center of the nozzle <b>137</b> (e.g., in alignment with the longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0820">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18E</figref>, the baffle <b>2001</b> changes the shape and reduces the size of the cross sectional flow area in the nozzle <b>137</b>. (For the sake of clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18E</figref> do not show any nozzle structure downstream from the baffle. The flow area in each of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18E</figref> is outlined in bold for clarity.) Upstream from the baffle <b>2001</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>), the cross sectional flow area <b>2087</b> is generally circular or elliptical. At the upstream end <b>2035</b> of the baffle <b>2001</b>, the flow area begins to change from a circular shape to a generally semi-circular shape <b>2089</b> at the intersection <b>2015</b> of the legs <b>2007</b>, <b>2009</b> of the baffle plate <b>2003</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>), although other shapes may be suitable. There the cross sectional flow area <b>2089</b> is smaller than the flow area <b>2087</b> upstream from the baffle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> illustrates the flow area <b>2091</b> as fluid flows through a part of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref> illustrates the flow area <b>2093</b> farther downstream at the downstream end <b>2041</b> of the downstream leg <b>2009</b> of the baffle plate <b>2003</b>. It will be observed that flow area <b>2093</b> is somewhat larger than flow area <b>2091</b> due to the angular orientation of the downstream leg <b>2009</b> of the baffle plate <b>2003</b>. Downstream from the baffle plate <b>2003</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref>) the flow area <b>2094</b> through the baffle corresponds the shape of the interior surface <b>2051</b> of the baffle holder <b>2005</b>, which is circular in the illustrated embodiment. (Other shapes may be suitable.) Downstream from the baffle holder <b>2005</b> the torsional zones <b>259</b>, <b>261</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> desirably provide torsional forces as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0821">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, it has been observed that one or more air bubbles <b>2095</b> may become trapped in the volume <b>2053</b> between the downstream leg <b>2009</b> of the L-shaped plate <b>2003</b> and the baffle holder <b>2005</b>. Furthermore, a portion of a bubble <b>2095</b> may extend through the gap <b>2049</b> between the edge <b>2041</b> of the downstream leg <b>2009</b> and the baffle holder <b>2005</b>. Thus, the air bubble(s) <b>2095</b> can occupy a portion of the cross sectional flow area downstream of the downstream leg <b>2009</b> of the L-shaped plate <b>2003</b>, perhaps affecting the flow of fluid through the nozzle <b>137</b>. The exemplary baffle <b>2001</b> has been found to work well both with and without the air bubble(s) <b>2095</b>. Thus, a baffle can be used to orient sperm cells without involvement of any bubbles without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0822">Another exemplary orienting baffle, generally designated <b>2097</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>. The baffle <b>2097</b> comprises a flat generally semi-circular baffle plate <b>2099</b> in the orienting nozzle <b>137</b> discussed above. The baffle plate <b>2099</b> is positioned in the nozzle <b>137</b> downstream of the sample introduction conduit <b>157</b> and generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b>. The baffle plate <b>2099</b> has a curved edge <b>2101</b> that generally matches the curvature of the interior surface <b>233</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> so that there are no large gaps between the curved edge <b>2101</b> of the baffle plate <b>2099</b> and the interior surface <b>233</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b>. The baffle plate <b>2099</b> also has a straight edge <b>2103</b> that extends a short distance past longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> so that it is approximately aligned with the outer diameter <b>2109</b> of the sample introduction conduit <b>157</b>. The baffle plate <b>2099</b> is held in position by friction resulting from compression of the baffle plate <b>2099</b> between an o-ring seal <b>2105</b>, which is similar to the o-ring seals <b>2071</b> described in connection with the L-shaped baffle <b>2001</b> above, and an annular shoulder or shelf <b>2107</b> formed on the interior of the nozzle <b>137</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> the orienting baffle <b>2099</b> operates by deflecting the fluid stream so that the core stream <b>189</b> containing the particles to be analyzed is offset from the central longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> along a portion of its flow path. For example, the core stream <b>189</b> may be directed along a flow path that is offset from the longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> as it flows through the first torsional zone <b>259</b>, as well as at least a portion of the second torsional zone <b>261</b>. Consequently, the particles (e.g., sperm cells) are subjected to the torsional forces generated by the torsional zones <b>259</b>, <b>261</b> while they are in a position that is offset from the central longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0823">Those skilled in the art will recognize that substantial changes may be made to the exemplary baffles <b>2001</b>, <b>2097</b> described above without departing from the scope of the present invention. All that is required is that the baffle be configured to deflect the core stream <b>189</b> and sheath stream <b>191</b> toward an interior surface of the nozzle or to cause the core <b>189</b> and sheath stream <b>191</b> to flow through a cross sectional area that changes in size and/or shape. Further, it is understood that the orienting baffle structure may be integrally formed with the nozzle or integrally formed with the nozzle and flow body without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Offset Sample Introduction Conduit</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0824">The core stream <b>189</b> may be directed along a flow path that is offset from the central longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b> by repositioning the sample introduction conduit <b>157</b> from its traditional position at the center of the nozzle <b>137</b> to an offset position. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows an exemplary offset sample introducing nozzle system <b>2151</b> having an offset sample introduction conduit <b>157</b>. Except as noted, the nozzle system <b>2151</b> is substantially the same as the nozzle system <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. The significant difference is that the sample introduction conduit <b>157</b> has been moved away from the center of the nozzle <b>137</b> so that it is no longer aligned with the nozzle's longitudinal axis <b>2017</b>. Thus, the core stream <b>189</b> is directed into the torsional zones <b>259</b>, <b>261</b> of the orienting nozzle <b>137</b> along a flow path that is offset from the longitudinal axis <b>2017</b>. Although the exemplary nozzle system <b>2151</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> uses the exemplary orienting nozzle <b>137</b> describe above, it is contemplated that offset sample introduction conduit <b>157</b> could be used with a different orienting nozzle or a non-orienting nozzle to orient particles in the core stream <b>189</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Nozzle Mounting and Adjustment</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0825">The flow body <b>133</b> and nozzle <b>137</b> are mounted in a selected orientation and position by means of a nozzle mount, generally designated <b>331</b>. In one embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>), the mount <b>331</b> comprises a plurality of stages, including first and second linear stages <b>333</b>, <b>337</b> providing linear adjustment of the flow body <b>133</b> and nozzle <b>137</b> along X and Y axes <b>339</b>, <b>341</b>, respectively, and a third rotational stage <b>343</b> providing rotational adjustment about a Z axis <b>345</b> corresponding to the longitudinal axis <b>2017</b> of the flow body <b>133</b> and nozzle <b>137</b>. These stages <b>333</b>, <b>337</b>, <b>343</b> may be conventional in design, suitable stages being commercially available, for example, from Newport Corporation of Irvine Calif. In particular, the first linear motion stage <b>333</b> comprises a fixed first stage member (not shown) mounted on a frame <b>349</b>, a movable first stage member <b>355</b> slidable on the fixed first stage member along the X axis <b>339</b>, and an actuator <b>357</b>, e.g., a micrometer, for precisely moving the movable first stage <b>355</b> member to a selected X-axis position. The second linear motion stage <b>337</b> comprises a fixed second stage member <b>359</b> mounted on the movable first stage member <b>355</b>, a movable second stage member <b>361</b> slidable on the fixed second stage member <b>359</b> along the Y axis <b>341</b>, and an actuator <b>363</b>, e.g., a micrometer, for precisely moving the movable second stage member <b>361</b> to a selected Y-axis position. The rotational (third) stage <b>343</b> comprises a fixed third stage member <b>365</b> mounted on the movable second stage member <b>316</b>, a movable third stage member <b>371</b> rotatably mounted on the fixed third stage member <b>365</b> for rotation about the Z-axis <b>345</b>, and an actuator <b>373</b>, e.g., a micrometer, for precisely rotating the movable third stage member <b>371</b> to a selected angular position relative to the Z-axis <b>345</b>. The three-axis adjustment provided by these stages <b>333</b>, <b>337</b> <b>343</b> allows the nozzle <b>137</b> and the fluid stream <b>21</b> exiting the nozzle orifice <b>103</b> to be precisely positioned relative to the optics system <b>109</b>. Rotation of the nozzle <b>137</b> about the Z-axis <b>345</b> is particularly helpful because it enables the stream <b>21</b> exiting the nozzle <b>137</b> to be rotated to bring the cells (e.g., sperm cells) oriented by the nozzle <b>137</b> into a position in which the light beam <b>25</b> from the optics system <b>109</b> will fall on the desired surfaces of the cells (e.g., the flat faces <b>207</b> of sperm heads <b>205</b>), as illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Other nozzle mounts may be suitable. For example, a 4-axis nozzle mounting system can also be used, providing linear adjustment along X, Y and Z axes and rotational adjustment along the Z axis. Further, it may be desirable to use one or more stages having an automated alignment feature, such as a servo or stepper motor controlled microtranslation stage (e.g., part number M-110.2DG from Polytech Pl, Inc. of Auburn, Mich.).</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0826">In one embodiment shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, for example, the nozzle <b>137</b> is oriented to direct a stream <b>21</b> containing cells to be analyzed in a generally upward direction. The angle <b>377</b> between the direction of the fluid stream <b>21</b> and horizontal is preferably in the range of 5 to 85 degrees, more preferably in the range of 15 to 75 degrees, even more preferably about 30 to 65 degrees, still more preferably about 45 to 60 degrees, and most preferably about 50 to 55 degrees. This orientation is advantageous in that any air trapped in the nozzle system <b>101</b> is readily removed. Also, the velocity of the fluid stream <b>21</b> decreases gradually under the force of gravity prior to collection of the droplets <b>33</b>. A more gradual deceleration of the droplets <b>33</b> is believed to be less stressful to the cells being analyzed which, in the case of sperm cells, can result in higher motility of the sorted sperm after collection. Of course, in other embodiments of the present invention, the nozzle <b>101</b> is positioned so that the fluid stream <b>21</b> has a substantially downward velocity when it exits the orifice <b>103</b> as is conventional for jet-in-air cytometers.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0827">Optionally, components of the nozzle system <b>101</b> such as the flow body <b>133</b> and nozzle <b>137</b> are coated with a non-reflective, non-emissive material (e.g., a dull dark paint or epoxy which does not emit light when subjected to UV laser light) to reduce any reflected and/or emitted light off these elements <b>133</b>, <b>137</b> which might otherwise cause signal noise or have other adverse effects on the optics system <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">Transducer and Droplet Formation</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0828">The transducer <b>105</b> for introducing energy into the fluid stream <b>21</b> comprises, in one embodiment, a collar <b>379</b> containing a piezoelectric element (not shown) secured around the flow body <b>133</b> of the nozzle system <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>). The transducer is of conventional design, such as is available from Beckman Coulter, Inc. as part No. 6858368. The transducer has terminals <b>383</b> for connection to a suitable source of acoustical energy so that energy can be delivered to the fluid stream <b>21</b> at a frequency which will cause it to break into droplets <b>33</b> at the droplet break-off location <b>107</b> downstream from the nozzle <b>137</b> a distance d (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>). As will understood by those skilled in flow cytometry, the characteristics of the droplet formation are governed by the following Equation 1:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(<i>V=f</i>&#x3bb;)&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where V is the velocity of the stream <b>21</b>; f is the frequency applied to the fluid stream <b>21</b> through the nozzle <b>137</b>; and &#x3bb; is the &#x201c;wave length&#x201d; or distance between the droplets <b>33</b>. It is a known principle of flow cytometry that droplets <b>33</b> will form in a regular pattern with the distance between droplets <b>33</b> being 4.54 times the diameter of the stream <b>21</b>. Since the diameter D of the stream <b>21</b> close to the nozzle <b>137</b> generally corresponds to the diameter of the nozzle orifice <b>103</b> at its downstream end, the frequency at which the stream <b>21</b> (and nozzle <b>137</b>) must be vibrated to form the droplets <b>33</b> can be easily calculated using the following Equation 2:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(<i>f=V/</i>4.54<i>D</i>)&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0829">The transducer <b>105</b> may be operated to generate in the range of 30,000-100,000 droplets <b>33</b> per second. For example, the transducer <b>105</b> may generate 50,000-55,000 droplets per second. Assuming the frequency is 55,000 cycles per second (55 kHz), and further assuming that the concentration of cells in the stream <b>21</b> is such that cells exit the nozzle <b>137</b> at a substantially matching rate of 55,000 cells per second, then there will be, on average, one cell per droplet <b>33</b>. (In reality, some droplets <b>33</b> will contain no cells, some will contain one cell, and some will contain more than one cell.) Of course, any of various factors can be changed to vary this average, including a change in frequency (f), stream <b>21</b> (orifice <b>103</b>) size (D) and stream <b>21</b> velocity (V). Ideally, these factors should be such as to reduce the amount of stress imparted to the cells during the course of the process, especially in the case of sperm cells where the preservation of motility is important.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">Break-Off Sensor</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0830">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a break-off sensor <b>389</b> may be employed to determine the location (e.g., break-off location <b>107</b>) at which the stream <b>21</b> begins to form free droplets <b>33</b>. The break-off location <b>107</b> will vary depending on several factors including stream <b>21</b> viscosity, surface tension of the fluid and the amplitude of vibration of the transducer <b>105</b>. By monitoring the break-off location <b>107</b>, the amplitude of the transducer <b>105</b> may be varied to maintain the break-off location <b>107</b> within a given range so that the time at which each droplet <b>33</b> breaks off can be more accurately predicted by the microprocessor <b>131</b>. This allows the microprocessor <b>131</b> to accurately control the electrical charge of the droplet <b>33</b> which is accomplished by selectively controlling the charge of the stream <b>21</b>. Since the charge of the droplet <b>33</b> will be the same as the charge of the stream <b>21</b> immediately before droplet <b>33</b> formation, the microprocessor <b>131</b> controls the sorting of the droplets <b>33</b> by selectively charging the stream <b>21</b>, as noted below.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0831">In general, a break-off sensor is for use with any continuous stream of fluid which is breaking into droplets at a break-off location. (In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the break-off sensor <b>389</b> is located downstream from the nozzle <b>137</b> and interrogation location <b>115</b>.) One exemplary break-off sensor <b>389</b> is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. A light source <b>393</b> is positioned on one side of the stream <b>21</b> to illuminate the stream <b>21</b> within the given range at which the break-off location <b>107</b> will be maintained. A linear photoarray <b>395</b> positioned on the other side of the stream <b>21</b> is adapted to be oriented along an axis substantially parallel to the stream <b>21</b>. As a result, the photoarray <b>395</b> detects light from the light source <b>393</b> which passes through the droplets <b>33</b> and provides output signals corresponding to the detected light.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0832">The output signals are processed to determine the position of the break-off location <b>107</b>. For example, the output signals may be digitized and provided to the processor <b>131</b> for processing. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the light source <b>393</b> may be an LED or other source which generates a near-infrared portion of the visible spectrum. The light passing between the droplets <b>33</b> is magnified by a lens <b>401</b> and directed toward an 8 by 1 linear array of photodiodes <b>395</b>. Each photodiode generates a current that is proportional to the light intensity impinging thereon. This current is fed into 8 current to voltage op-amp circuits <b>405</b>. The output voltage from the op-amps is AC coupled into 8 track/hold amplifiers <b>407</b>. The track/hold signal <b>409</b> used by the amplifiers is taken from the transducer <b>105</b>. The output from the track/hold amplifier is fed into the A/D converter <b>411</b> of a microprocessor unit (MPU) <b>391</b>. The digital values computed by the MPU <b>391</b> will be provided to the system control microprocessor <b>131</b>. A lookup table and/or algorithm may be used by the system control microprocessor <b>131</b> to convert between break-off location <b>107</b> drift and voltage adjustment to the transducer <b>105</b>. Alternatively, the output from the MPU <b>391</b> may be an analog signal such as a DC voltage having an amplitude corresponding to a change in the amplitude of vibration of the transducer <b>105</b>. The dc voltage can be applied to the high voltage amplifier input driving the droplet transducer <b>105</b> to vary the amplitude of vibration. Thus, such a processor <b>391</b> would constitute a control for receiving the output signal from the photoarray <b>395</b> and providing a location signal corresponding to a location of the break-off location <b>107</b>. Such a processor <b>391</b> would also constitute a control for receiving the output signal indicative of the position of the break-off location <b>107</b> of the droplets <b>33</b> and varying operation of the transducer <b>105</b> as a function of the position of the location <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0833">Alternatively, as is well known to those skilled in the art, a video camera and strobe light may be used to monitor and control the droplet break-off location. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-27</figref>, a video camera system <b>412</b> and strobe <b>413</b> may be provided to monitor the break-off location <b>107</b>. It is desirable to place the strobe <b>413</b> behind a mask <b>414</b>A (e.g., a cover with a small slit-shaped opening <b>414</b>B) to limit the amount of light produced by the strobe <b>413</b> that enters the optics system <b>109</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Epi-Illumination Optics System</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0834">The optics system <b>109</b> is adapted for focusing a beam of electromagnetic radiation <b>25</b> (e.g., a laser beam) on the fluid stream <b>21</b> as a beam spot, so that the cells to be analyzed pass through the spot. The beam <b>25</b> may be laser light in the visible or ultraviolet portion of the spectrum, for example, having a wavelength of about 350-700 nm, although other wavelengths may be used. The wavelength of the laser light may be selected so that it is capable of exciting a particular fluorochrome used to analyze particles. If the optics system <b>109</b> is used to analyze sperm cells stained with Hoechst 33342, for instance, the wavelength may be selected to be in the range of about 350-370 nm. The power output of the laser may vary between 50 and 300 mW. Sperm cells may be analyzed using a 200 mW laser, for example. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-34</figref>, the system <b>109</b> is an epi-illumination system <b>415</b> comprising an instrument, generally designated <b>417</b>, having a longitudinal optical axis <b>419</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;epi-illumination&#x201d; means an optics system where at least some of the fluorescence emissions from cells passing through the beam spot are directed back through the optical instrument along the same axis as the focused beam <b>25</b>, but in the opposite direction. This type of system is advantageous in that only one set of optics is required, including only one photodetector <b>117</b>, unlike conventional systems which detect forward and side fluorescence and which use two or more photodetectors. However, it will be understood that while an epi-illumination system is preferred, many of the aspects of this invention can be applied regardless of the type of optics system used.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0835">In one embodiment, the epi-illumination instrument <b>417</b> comprises a rectangular base <b>429</b> supporting a plurality of optical elements. These optical elements are described below, with specific examples of relevant dimensions, focal lengths, and part numbers. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, this information is exemplary only, and alternative optical elements can be used without departing from the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0836">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-34</figref>, the optical elements include a reflecting filter <b>431</b> which reflects a collimated beam <b>25</b> of light from a laser or arc lamp <b>435</b>, for example, through a conditioning lens assembly <b>437</b> mounted in an opening <b>439</b> in a side wall <b>441</b> of a dichroic chamber <b>443</b> extending up from the base <b>429</b>. In this particular embodiment, the conditioning lens assembly <b>437</b> comprises a retaining ring <b>445</b>, neutral density filter <b>447</b>, cylindrical lens <b>449</b>, lens holder <b>455</b> and jam nut <b>457</b>. The cylindrical lens <b>449</b> introduces a one-dimensional divergence into the beam <b>225</b> and directs it toward optical elements (described below) which shape the beam to have a desired cross sectional shape <b>459</b>, preferably generally elliptical. By way of example, the cylindrical lens <b>449</b> may be a plano-convex lens having a focal length of 16 mm. A beam expander (not shown) can optionally be installed in the instrument <b>417</b> to allow adjustments to be made to the shape of the elliptical beam spot <b>459</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0837">The reflecting filter <b>431</b> is mounted by clips <b>461</b> on the angular face <b>465</b> of a filter holder <b>463</b> which has openings <b>467</b> in it to permit the beam <b>25</b> to reflect off the filter <b>431</b> toward the optics of the instrument <b>417</b>. The holder <b>463</b> is fastened to a linear stage <b>469</b> movable along an X-axis <b>471</b> relative to an outrigger <b>473</b> secured to the base <b>429</b> and dichroic chamber <b>443</b>, the stage <b>469</b> being movable by suitable means <b>475</b> (e.g., a micrometer) to precisely locate the holder <b>463</b> and reflecting filter <b>431</b> to reflect the beam <b>25</b> into the instrument <b>417</b> at the proper location. A dichroic filter <b>477</b> is held by clips <b>479</b> on a frame <b>485</b> mounted in the dichroic chamber <b>443</b> and functions to reflect the shaped beam <b>25</b> in a forward direction <b>487</b> along an axis <b>489</b> which, in this particular embodiment, corresponds to the longitudinal optical axis <b>419</b> of the instrument. The beam <b>25</b> passes through a focusing lens assembly <b>491</b> which focuses the beam <b>25</b> on the fluid stream <b>21</b> as a beam spot having the aforementioned generally elliptical shape <b>459</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) with the major axis of the ellipse extending generally perpendicular to the direction of flow <b>227</b> of the stream <b>21</b>. As each cell passes through the beam spot <b>459</b>, the fluorescing dye (or other reporting agent) in the cell is activated to emit fluorescent light <b>31</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>). In the case of sperm cells stained with a DNA selective fluorescing dye, X cells have more DNA than Y cells, include more fluorescing dye, and emit a stronger signal than Y cells (e.g., 3.8%), which provides a basis for discriminating and sorting cells, as will be described. The focusing lens assembly <b>491</b> includes, in one embodiment, a microscope adapter <b>501</b> mounted in an opening <b>503</b> in a front wall <b>505</b> of the dichroic chamber <b>443</b>, a focusing barrel <b>507</b>, a pair of lens mount barrels <b>509</b>, and the lens <b>511</b> itself, which may be a 12.5 mm diameter, plano-convex lens with a focal length of 16 mm, available from Oriel Corporation as part number 41209, and is anti-reflective coated for light having a wavelength in the range of 340-550 nm. The lens <b>511</b> may be made of fused silica. Other focusing lenses may also be suitable, such as an infinity-corrected fluorescence microscope objective. The focusing lens assembly <b>491</b> has a conventional telescoping focus adjustment <b>515</b> to focus the elliptically-shaped beam spot <b>459</b> on the core <b>189</b> of the stream <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0838">The outgoing fluorescent light <b>31</b> emitted by the cells as they pass through the beam spot <b>459</b> is of a different (longer, due to the Stoke's shift principle) wavelength than the incoming laser light <b>25</b>. Some of the fluorescence emissions <b>31</b> are transmitted in a rearward direction <b>513</b> along the incoming beam axis back through the focusing lens <b>511</b> which collects and collimates the fluorescence emission <b>31</b>. The collimated fluorescence emissions <b>517</b> pass in a rearward direction from the lens <b>511</b> to the dichroic filter <b>477</b>, which transmits the fluorescence emission <b>517</b>. By way of example, the dichroic filter <b>477</b> may be a filter available from Omega Optical as part number XF2001, 400DCLP.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0839">The optics system <b>415</b> includes a filtering system <b>519</b> positioned rearward of the dichroic filter <b>477</b> along the optical axis <b>419</b> of the instrument <b>417</b>. In one embodiment, the filtering system <b>519</b> includes an emission filter <b>521</b> in a holder <b>523</b> mounted in an opening <b>525</b> in a back wall <b>527</b> of the dichroic chamber <b>443</b>. The emission filter <b>521</b> attenuates any laser light scatter or other undesired electromagnetic radiation that is transmitted through the dichroic filter <b>477</b>. By way of example and not limitation, the emission filter <b>521</b> can be a thin film, long-pass filter adapted to transmit more than 90% of light having a wavelength greater than 408 nm, as is available from Omega Optical as part number XF3097. An alignment pellicle assembly <b>529</b> is spaced rearwardly along the optical axis <b>419</b> from the emission filter. This assembly includes a slider <b>531</b> movable on a rail <b>533</b> extending longitudinally of the base <b>429</b> parallel to the longitudinal optical axis <b>419</b> of the instrument <b>417</b>, a filter holder <b>535</b> secured to the slider <b>531</b>, a pellicle filter element <b>539</b>, and clips <b>541</b> for securing the pellicle filter element <b>539</b> to the filter holder <b>535</b> at an angle <b>543</b> relative to the optical axis <b>419</b> of the instrument <b>417</b>. The pellicle filter element <b>539</b> has the same thickness as the dichroic filter <b>477</b> and functions to translate the collimated fluorescence emission <b>517</b> back onto the optical axis <b>419</b> of the instrument <b>417</b>. Fasteners <b>545</b> extending up through parallel slots <b>547</b> in the base <b>429</b> on opposite sides of the rail <b>533</b> secure the slider <b>531</b> to the base <b>429</b> in the desired position along the optical axis <b>419</b>. Spaced to the rear of the alignment pellicle assembly <b>529</b> is an aspheric lens <b>549</b> held by a holder <b>551</b> mounted in a frame <b>553</b> which is also slidable on the rail <b>533</b> and secured in selected position by suitable fasteners <b>557</b>. The aspheric lens <b>549</b> focuses the collimated fluorescence emission <b>517</b> onto a spatial filter, generally designated <b>559</b>, which filters out reflection or emission from sources other than the cells to be analyzed. The aspheric lens <b>549</b> may be, for example, an 12.5 mm diameter aspheric lens having a focal length of 15 mm, as is available from Oriel Corporation. The lens <b>549</b> is preferably anti-reflective coated for visible emission wavelengths but made of a material (e.g., flint glass) which further attenuates transmission of laser light scatter.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0840">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the spatial filter <b>559</b> comprises, in one embodiment, a pair of aperture plates <b>561</b> releasably held by a frame <b>563</b> mounted on the base <b>429</b> of the instrument <b>417</b>. Each of the plates <b>561</b> has a slit <b>567</b>, <b>571</b> therein, one slit <b>567</b> preferably being generally vertical and the other <b>571</b> preferably generally horizontal, the arrangement being such that the slits <b>567</b>, <b>571</b> intersect to form an aperture <b>573</b>. In one embodiment, the aperture <b>573</b> is generally rectangular in shape and has a vertical dimension <b>575</b> of 100 microns and a horizontal dimension <b>577</b> of 500 microns. The size and shape of the aperture <b>573</b> may vary (or even be adjusted by changing aperture plates), so long as it functions to remove reflections and light from any source other than the collection volume <b>579</b>. The frame <b>563</b> holding the aperture plates <b>561</b> preferably has two parts, namely, a plate holder <b>583</b> slidable on the rail <b>533</b> of the base <b>429</b> and secured in selected position by fasteners <b>587</b>, and a backing member <b>589</b> for securing the aperture plates <b>461</b> in position on the plate holder <b>583</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0841">In one embodiment, the smaller (vertical) dimension <b>575</b> of the aperture <b>573</b> in the spatial filter <b>559</b> is sized (or adjusted) to enable use of a &#x201c;slit scanning&#x201d; technique to evaluate the cell. This technique is described in more detail in the &#x201c;Focused Beam Spot&#x201d; section of this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0842">Another embodiment of an epi-illumination optics system, generally designated <b>450</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. This embodiment is substantially the same as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-34</figref>, except as noted. One significant difference is that the dichroic filter <b>477</b> has been replaced with a different dichroic filter <b>451</b> that transmits (rather than reflects) the illumination beam <b>25</b> and reflects (rather than transmits) the fluorescent emissions <b>31</b>. Also, because the fluorescence emissions <b>31</b> are reflected by the dichroic filter <b>451</b> rather than transmitted, there is no need for an alignment pellicle <b>539</b> in this embodiment of an epi-illumination optics system <b>450</b>. Thus, the epi-illumination system <b>450</b> is just one example of how the optics system can be reconfigured if desired without departing from the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0843">Further, the cylindrical lens <b>449</b> is mounted on an adjustable mounting assembly <b>449</b>A. The mounting assembly <b>449</b>A allows two-axis translational movement of the cylindrical lens <b>449</b> in a plane perpendicular to the illumination beam <b>25</b>. Releasable fasteners (e.g., screws (not shown)) extend through slot-shaped holes <b>449</b>B (only one of which is visible on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>). Release of the fasteners allows translational movement of the lens <b>449</b> in a first direction perpendicular to the beam <b>25</b>. Similar fasteners (not shown) extend through slot-shaped holes <b>449</b>C, allowing translational movement of the lens <b>449</b> in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction. This allows minor adjustment of the relative positions of the cylindrical lens <b>449</b> and beam <b>25</b> so that the intersection of the beam <b>25</b> and lens <b>449</b> can be moved across the surface of the lens <b>449</b>, thereby causing slight changes to the focusing provided by the cylindrical lens <b>449</b>. Once the lens <b>449</b> is in the desired position, the fasteners can be tightened to hold it there.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">Photodetector</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0844">The emitted fluorescence passing though the spatial filter <b>559</b> falls upon a photodetector <b>117</b> fastened to a mounting plate <b>591</b> slidable on the rail <b>533</b> of the base <b>429</b> at the rear of the epi-illumination instrument <b>417</b> and securable in fixed position by fasteners <b>595</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>). The photodetector <b>117</b> detects the fluorescent emissions <b>31</b> and converts them into electrical signals which can be processed to analyze the desired characteristics of the cells, as will be described in more detail later. The photodetector <b>117</b> may be a conventional device, such as a photodetector available from Hammamtsu. The photodetector <b>117</b> preferably includes a preamplifier and PMT gain which is optimized for emission intensity produced by the epi-illumination system for the particular stained cells being analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0845">In general, the PMT gain is optimized when between about 200 and 2000 volts are applied to the vacuum tube. In the case of detecting fluorescent emissions from Hoechst 33342, for instance, the PMT gain is optimized when between about 400-800 volts are applied to the vacuum tube. One particularly desirable photodetector includes a PMT having a spectral range of 185-830 nm (530 nm peak), a 0.01 mA maximum average anode current, a cathode radiant sensitivity of 70 mA/W typical, a cathode luminous sensitivity of 140 &#x3bc;A/lm, anode luminous sensitivity of 300 A/lm, max anode dark current of 1 nA (0.1 nA typical), and a 1.4 nanosecond risetime. The PMT is DC coupled amplifier demonstrating a flat gain to &#x3e;37 MHz, having a 1 V peak output into a 50&#x3a9; load and a recovery time of less than 400 nanoseconds. It is also desirable for the amplifier to allow high voltage adjustment for compensation of PMT efficiency variations without decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio to less than 800 dB.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">Angle of Beam Incidence</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0846"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> schematically illustrates one desirable orientation of the intersection of the light beam and the fluid stream. Several points are of note. As shown, the light beam <b>25</b> is focused on the stream <b>21</b> at a location <b>115</b> that is only a short distance <b>605</b> from the exit orifice <b>103</b> of the nozzle <b>137</b>, preferably less than 1.0 mm, or even inside the nozzle <b>137</b>, so that the cells pass through the spot <b>459</b> while they are still substantially in desired orientation, as previously described. This is particularly important for cells which are mobile in the fluid stream <b>21</b>, including sperm cells.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0847">Another point of note is that the beam <b>25</b> of this embodiment may be directed toward the fluid stream <b>21</b> along a beam axis <b>609</b> which intersects the fluid stream <b>21</b> at an angle of incidence A which is skewed (off 90 degrees) relative to a longitudinal axis of the fluid stream <b>21</b>, as viewed from a side of the stream <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>). When sorting certain particles, it has been found that better discrimination of the different types of particles may be obtained by illuminating the stream <b>21</b> at an angle of incidence other than 0&#xb0;. Sperm nuclei, for instance, are desirably illuminated at an angle of incidence A that is in the range of 5 to 45 degrees, more preferably in the range of 15 to 30 degrees, and even more preferably in the range of 18 to 24 degrees. Other particles (e.g., live sperm cells) are easier to interrogate when the light beam <b>25</b> is generally perpendicular to the fluid stream <b>21</b> (i.e., when angle A is about 0&#xb0;). Thus, it is contemplated that angle A may be any angle without departing from the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0848">The proper selection of angle A results in improved signal to noise discrimination in certain particles and thus more accurate discrimination based on different characteristics of those particles (e.g., sperm nuclei with X and Y chromosomes sperm cells). This improvement may be due to a number of factors, including reduced laser light scatter entering the focusing lens <b>511</b>. Because the focused beam spot <b>459</b> is preferably wider than the stream <b>21</b>, a diffraction pattern is created at the intersection <b>115</b> of the beam <b>25</b> and the stream <b>21</b>. When angle A is greater than about 12 degrees, the reflected diffraction pattern does not fall on the lens <b>511</b>. Another factor may be that the skewed angle A allows the beam <b>25</b> to be focused very close to the nozzle orifice <b>103</b>, so that the nozzle body <b>139</b> does not interfere with the lens <b>511</b>. Relatedly, the cells are more uniformly aligned closer to the nozzle <b>137</b>, so that focusing the beam spot <b>459</b> closer to the nozzle <b>137</b> results in an improved signal. Further, the more &#x201c;head on&#x201d; profile of the cell presented to the lens <b>511</b> (beam <b>25</b>) at the skewed angle A reduces the variation of total fluorescence intensity caused by any misalignment of the cells. In this regard, in the case of sperm cells it is preferable that the beam <b>25</b> fall on one of the wide faces <b>207</b> of each sperm cell <b>201</b>, as discussed above, and that the nozzle <b>101</b> and optics system <b>109</b> be positioned to achieve this result.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0849">While a skewed angle of incidence A is believed to be beneficial in sorting some particles, it is contemplated that the angle of intersection between the beam axis and the stream may be 90 degrees or any skewed angle without departing from the scope of this invention. It is also expected that the optimal angle of incidence may vary widely depending on the properties of the particular particles being analyzed.</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">Focused Beam Spot</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0850">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the focused beam spot of one embodiment is shown as having a generally elliptical (oval) shape <b>459</b> with a length L<b>1</b> along a major axis extending generally at right angles to the direction of fluid stream flow <b>227</b> and a width W<b>1</b> along a minor axis extending generally parallel to the direction of fluid stream flow <b>227</b>. In one embodiment, the width W<b>1</b> is less than the length of the head of the sperm cell <b>219</b>, and even more preferably less than the length of the region <b>225</b> containing the chromatic DNA mass of the cell, which in the case of a bovine sperm cell <b>201</b> has a length of less than about 1 &#x3bc;m. For a stream <b>21</b> having sheath stream <b>191</b> that is about 60 &#x3bc;m in diameter and a core stream <b>189</b> containing bovine sperm cells <b>201</b>, an exemplary length L<b>1</b> is about 80 &#x3bc;m and an exemplary width W<b>1</b> is about 1.5 &#x3bc;m. By focusing the beam spot <b>459</b> to a width W<b>1</b> which is less than the length of the head <b>205</b> of the sperm cell <b>201</b>, or any other cell or particle being analyzed, and even more preferably less than the diameter of the DNA region <b>225</b> of the head <b>205</b> of the sperm cell <b>201</b>, greater signal resolution is achieved, as will be understood by those familiar with &#x201c;slit scanning&#x201d; techniques. This is a technique by which a beam <b>25</b> is narrowed to have a width less than the length of a cell (i.e., the dimension of the cell in the direction of stream flow) so that as the cell moves through the narrow beam, photon emissions <b>31</b> from the cell are measured over the length of the cell, as will be discussed later. In this way, information can be obtained about variations in structure, including DNA material, along the length of the cell. The slit-scanning technique is also helpful in identifying &#x201c;coincident&#x201d; cells, that is, cells which are overlapping or very close together.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0851">As mentioned previously, slit scanning can also be carried out by sizing the aperture <b>573</b> of the spatial filter <b>559</b> to have a vertical dimension <b>575</b> such that only a portion of the light emitted from a cell, corresponding to a fraction of the cell length in the direction of stream flow, passes through the aperture to the photodetector <b>117</b>. Further, signal resolution can be optimized by adjusting the width of the beam and/or the size of the aperture of the spatial filter to work together to provide a beam spot that is suitably shaped for slit scanning.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0852">One way to adjust the shape of the beam spot <b>459</b> is by changing to a different cylindrical lens and/or by making an adjustment to a beam expander in the optics system <b>109</b>. Further any method of shaping the beam <b>25</b> to form an elliptically shaped beam spot <b>459</b> is contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention. Beam spots of other shapes and sizes may also be used and are contemplated as falling within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="h-0029" num="0000">Sorting System</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0853"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the sorting system <b>119</b>. The sorting system <b>119</b> comprises an electrostatic charging device <b>627</b> for charging and/or not charging the droplets <b>33</b> depending on the classification of the particles contained in the droplets <b>33</b> (e.g., the X/Y chromosome content of sperm cells), and a pair of electrostatic charged deflector plates <b>629</b> for sorting the droplets <b>33</b> into different groups <b>123</b>, <b>125</b>, according to their charge. It is desirable to coat the deflector plates <b>629</b> with a dull, low-emissive coating (e.g., epoxy or paint) to limit light reflected or emitted by the deflector plates <b>629</b>. The deflector plates <b>629</b> may be charged by any suitable power supply <b>635</b>. It is generally desirable for the electrical potential between the two fully charged deflector plates <b>629</b> to be in the range of 2000-4000 volts. However, the electrical potential between the deflector plates <b>629</b> may be anywhere between about 1000 and 6000 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0854">The charging device <b>627</b> comprises a charging element <b>631</b> having an opening <b>633</b> therein through which the stream <b>21</b> passes at a location near the droplet break-off location <b>107</b> (e.g., within five droplet lengths or closer). It is desirable to mount the charging element <b>631</b> with a mechanism that facilitates adjustment of the position of the charging element <b>631</b> with respect to the droplet break-off location <b>107</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, for example, the charging element <b>631</b> and deflector plates <b>629</b> may be attached to an adjustable mounting assembly <b>5001</b> that allows three-axis translation and tilt adjustment of the charging element <b>631</b> and deflector plates <b>629</b> with respect to the nozzle system <b>101</b>. For translation along an axis <b>5011</b> parallel to the stream <b>21</b>, the mounting assembly <b>5001</b> includes a board <b>5003</b> fastened to a backing <b>5005</b> by releasable fasteners <b>5007</b> passing through slots <b>5009</b> in the board <b>5003</b>, the slots <b>5009</b> being oriented generally parallel to axis <b>5011</b>. For translation in an axis <b>5013</b> perpendicular to the stream <b>21</b>, a second adjustment board <b>5015</b> is fastened to the first board <b>5003</b> by releasable fasteners <b>5017</b> passing through slots <b>5019</b> in the second adjustment board <b>5015</b>, the slots <b>5019</b> being oriented generally parallel to axis <b>5013</b>. The charging element <b>631</b> and deflector plates <b>629</b> are secured to the second adjustment board <b>5015</b>. Thus, by releasing the fasteners <b>5007</b> and/or <b>5017</b>, one can adjust the position of the charging element <b>631</b> and deflector plates relative to the nozzle system <b>101</b> in a plane parallel to the fluid stream <b>21</b> and then tighten the fasteners <b>5007</b> and/or <b>5017</b> to secure the mounting assembly <b>5001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0855">For translation along a third axis perpendicular to the first two axes <b>5011</b>, <b>5013</b>, the backing <b>5005</b> is fastened to a fixed support <b>5021</b> by adjustable fasteners <b>5023</b> (e.g., threaded bolts screwed into tapped holes in the fixed support <b>5021</b>). In one embodiment, each adjustable fastener <b>5023</b> passes through a spring <b>5025</b> positioned between the backing <b>5005</b> and the fixed support <b>5021</b>. The amount of compression of any spring <b>5025</b> can be adjusted by tightening or loosening the respective fastener <b>5023</b>. Adjusting the compression of all springs <b>5025</b> in the same amount results in translation along the third axis. The mounting assembly <b>5001</b> can be tilted in virtually any direction by changing the relative compression of one or more of the springs <b>5025</b> with respect to one or more other springs <b>5025</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0856">In this exemplary embodiment, the relative positions of the charging element <b>631</b> and deflector plates <b>629</b> remain fixed with respect to one another because they are all fastened to the same adjustment board <b>5015</b>. This prevents adjustment of the mounting assembly <b>5001</b> from affecting alignment of the changing element <b>631</b> with respect to the deflector plates <b>629</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0857">The charging element <b>631</b> is connected to a suitable electrical circuit (e.g., a 90 volt selectively charging circuit) under the control of the processor <b>131</b> and coupled to a power supply for applying an electrical charge to the charging element <b>631</b>. The circuit is used to charge or not charge the stream <b>21</b> immediately prior to the formation of a droplet <b>33</b> at the break-off location <b>107</b> depending on whether the droplet <b>33</b> contains a particle having the desired characteristics (e.g., at least one live X-chromosome sperm cell). The charging element <b>631</b> is positioned electrostatically near the stream <b>21</b> or near the droplets <b>33</b> formed from the stream <b>21</b> for providing an electrical reference with respect to the electrostatic polarity of the stream <b>21</b>. The droplets <b>33</b> carry the same charge as the stream <b>21</b> at the instant the droplet <b>33</b> breaks from the stream <b>21</b>. The charged or uncharged droplets <b>33</b> then pass between the deflector plates <b>629</b> and are sorted by charge into collection vessels <b>2207</b> of the collection system <b>2201</b>. While sorting produces two groups or populations of droplets <b>123</b>, <b>125</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the particles may be separated into any number of populations from 1 to N sorted by placing different charges on the droplets <b>33</b> in respective groups, any by supplying the appropriate number of collection vessels, each being positioned to collect a different population of droplets.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">Automated Drop Delay Calibration</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0858">In the sorting system <b>119</b> described above, the processor <b>131</b> must estimate the time it takes for a particle to move from the interrogation location <b>115</b> to the droplet break-off location <b>107</b> so that the charge (or lack of charge) to be applied to the droplet <b>33</b> containing that particle is applied when the particle is in the last attached droplet <b>33</b> at the break-off location <b>107</b>. If the delay setting used by the processor <b>131</b> is wrong, the droplets <b>33</b> will not be sorted according to their contents. Similarly, if the application of electrical charges to the droplets <b>33</b> is even slightly out of phase with droplet <b>33</b> formation this can degrade sorting because none of the droplets <b>33</b> will be fully charged and droplets <b>33</b> that are supposed to have neutral charge will carry a small positive or negative electrical charge. This will alter the paths of the droplets <b>33</b> through the electric field between the deflection plates <b>629</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0859">The best way to verify that the processor <b>131</b> is using the appropriate delay setting or to adjust the drop delay setting (i.e., calibrate the system's <b>9</b> drop delay setting), is to sort a number of droplets <b>33</b> and examine the results. By incrementally varying the delay setting and monitoring the results, one can select the optimal delay setting. Traditionally, this sort calibration is performed manually. Recently, automated calibration systems have been designed to sample or examine the contents of the droplets in the sorted droplet streams and automatically adjust the delay setting without human intervention. For example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,372,506 (Norton) and 5,643,796 (van den Engh), which are hereby incorporated by reference, both disclose automated sort calibration systems. The purported advantages of these systems are that they are less labor intensive and are capable of verifying the delay setting throughout the sorting process rather than just during initial set up. The drawbacks are that they are cumbersome and take up valuable space unnecessarily.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0860">(i) Epi-Illumination Sensors</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0861">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, an automated continuous calibration system <b>4201</b> of the present invention for a fluorescence activated droplet sorting cytometry system comprises one or more epi-illumination sensors <b>4203</b> positioned to sense the contents of droplets <b>33</b> to verify the delay setting for droplet charging. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, each epi-illumination sensor includes a light source (not shown), a fiber optic cable <b>4205</b>, a dichroic filter <b>4207</b>, a lens system <b>4209</b>, a photodetector <b>4213</b>, and a control system. In one exemplary embodiment, the processor <b>131</b> serves as the control system, but other processors or controls could be used instead.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0862">The light source may be a low-power solid state laser dedicated solely to the automated calibration system <b>4201</b>. Alternatively, a beamsplitter (not shown) may be used to divert a portion (e.g., about 5%) of the energy in the beam <b>25</b> used for interrogation of particles in the fluid stream <b>21</b> to one or more epi-illumination sensors <b>4203</b>. Similarly, the fiber optic cable <b>4209</b> can be positioned in a beam stop <b>4215</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) to gather light from beam <b>25</b> after it passes through the interrogation location <b>115</b>. The light from the light source must include light having a wavelength capable of exciting fluorescent molecules in the particles being sorted, thereby causing fluorescence emissions <b>4211</b> from the particles. If the particles are stained with Hoechst 33342, for instance, the light source can provide light having a wavelength of about 350 nm, about 407 nm or any other wavelength capable of exciting the Hoechst 33342 molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0863">The fiber optic cable <b>4205</b> extends from the light source to a location downstream of the interrogation location <b>115</b>. For example, in the exemplary embodiment the fiber optic cable <b>4205</b> leads to a location adjacent the trajectory of one of the droplet streams as it moves through the electric field between the deflector plates <b>629</b>. The dichroic filter <b>4207</b> is positioned in front of the end of the fiber optic cable <b>4205</b>. The dichroic filter <b>4207</b> transmits light having the spectral characteristics of the light conducted by fiber optic cable <b>4205</b>, but reflects light having the spectral characteristics of the fluorescence emissions <b>4211</b>. Thus, the dichroic filter <b>4207</b> may have the same specifications as the dichroic filter <b>477</b> describe above in connection with the epi-illumination optics instrument <b>417</b>. The focal length of the lens system <b>4209</b> is selected based on the expected distance of the sensor <b>4203</b> from the droplets <b>33</b> so that the illumination/detection volume of each sensor <b>4203</b> is about equal to the volume of the droplets <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0864">Referring to the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, an epi-illumination sensor <b>4203</b> is positioned adjacent the trajectory of each of the three sorted droplet streams <b>4225</b>, <b>4227</b>, <b>4229</b> to sense the contents of droplets <b>33</b> in a respective stream. The cytometer system <b>9</b> includes an electrically insulated support <b>4221</b> for mounting the two deflection plates <b>629</b>. The support has three holes <b>4223</b>, one adjacent the trajectory of each sorted droplet stream <b>4225</b>, <b>4227</b>, <b>4229</b>. An epi-illumination sensor <b>4203</b> is positioned at each hole <b>4223</b> to observe droplets <b>33</b> in one of the droplet streams <b>4225</b>, <b>4227</b>, <b>4229</b> through the respective hole <b>4223</b>. This compact configuration takes up relatively little space and keeps components of the calibration system <b>4201</b> out of the way, providing better access to other parts of the cytometer <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0865">If a droplet containing a fluorescent particle passes through the illumination/detection volume of the sensor <b>4203</b>, this will result in a flash of fluorescence emissions <b>4211</b>, some of which will be collected by the lens system <b>4209</b> and reflected off from the dichroic filter <b>4207</b> to the photodetector <b>4213</b>. Signals from the photodetector <b>4213</b> are provided to the processor <b>131</b>. Based on the signals received from the photodetectors <b>4213</b>, the processor <b>131</b> can determine the contents of the droplets <b>33</b> in each of the sorted droplet streams <b>4225</b>, <b>4227</b>, <b>4229</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0866">If a sensor <b>4203</b> fails to detect a flash of fluorescence emission <b>4211</b> when the processor <b>131</b> expects a droplet <b>33</b> containing a fluorescent particle to pass by that sensor <b>4203</b>, the processor <b>131</b> can use that information to adjust the delay setting or adjust the location of the droplet break-off location <b>107</b>. Likewise, the processor <b>131</b> can make an adjustment if a sensor <b>4203</b> detects a fluorescent emission <b>4211</b> when the processor <b>131</b> does not expect a droplet <b>33</b> containing a particle to be passing by the sensor <b>4203</b>. Furthermore, the processor can compare the relative frequency of fluorescent emissions <b>4211</b> from the sorted streams <b>4225</b>, <b>4227</b>, <b>4229</b> to see if the frequency of detected fluorescent emissions <b>4211</b> matches the expected frequency. The processor <b>131</b> can also adjust the amplitude of the charge applied to the charging element <b>631</b> to increase or decrease the amount by which a sorted stream <b>4225</b>, <b>4229</b> is deflected to maximize the intensity of the detected fluorescence emissions <b>4211</b>. This will maintain the alignment of the trajectory of the deflected droplet streams <b>4225</b>, <b>4229</b> so the droplets pass directly through the collection volume of the epi-illumination sensor. Because the sensors <b>4203</b> are positioned to observe the streams <b>4225</b>, <b>4227</b>, <b>4225</b> as they move through the electrical field between the deflector plates <b>629</b>, the calibration system has a shorter response time than it would if it observed the streams <b>4225</b>, <b>4227</b>, <b>4229</b> in the freefall area downstream of the deflection plates.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0867">(ii) Empty Droplet Test Stream</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0868">One sensitive indication of the quality of the calibration can be arranged by creating and monitoring a calibration test stream that contains substantially only empty droplets <b>33</b>. Referring to the sort calibration system <b>4201</b> shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, droplets <b>33</b> containing desired particles are sorted into stream <b>4225</b> and droplets <b>33</b> containing any other particles and most of the empty droplets <b>33</b> are sorted into stream <b>4229</b> (i.e., the waste stream). The test stream <b>4227</b> is created by applying a neutral charge to at least a fraction (e.g., 1 out of every 10) of the empty droplets <b>33</b>. Many droplets <b>33</b> that are considered &#x201c;empty&#x201d; for traditional sorting purposes are actually droplets <b>33</b> for which there is a low probability that the droplet <b>33</b> contains a particle, based on the arrival time of particles at the interrogation location <b>115</b> and estimated droplet formation boundaries in the fluid stream <b>21</b>. These &#x201c;empty&#x201d; droplets should not be sorted into the test stream <b>4227</b> because this would inevitably result in detection of some particles in the test stream <b>4227</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0869">Instead, for the test stream <b>4227</b> the processor <b>131</b> should select only droplets <b>33</b> that the processor <b>131</b> believes have substantially zero probability of containing a particle in order to create a substantially particle-free test stream <b>4227</b>. The probability that any randomly selected droplet <b>33</b> contains a cell is known and is approximately the average cell analysis rate divided by the droplet generation rate. This means that by monitoring the rate of mis-sorts in the test stream <b>4227</b> it is possible to estimate fractional adjustment of the phase relationship of droplet charging needed to match the phase of droplet <b>33</b> formation. For example the processor <b>131</b> may select droplets that it estimates have about 15% or lower probability of containing a particle, about 10% or lower probability of containing a particle, about 5% or lower probability of containing a particle, about 1% or lower probability of containing a particle, about 0.1% or lower probability of containing a particle, about 0.01% or lower probability of containing a particle, about 0.001% or lower probability of containing a particle, or about 0.0001% or lower probability of containing a particle. The probabilistic cutoff for substantially zero probability may be selected based on sort-speed, tolerance for impurity, or other sort parameters, with the cutoff including higher probabilities that a droplet will include a particle for high-speed sorting or when there is more tolerance for impurity.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0870">Failure of the processor <b>131</b> to create a substantially particle-free test stream <b>4227</b> (i.e., a test stream <b>4227</b> in which the ratio of droplets <b>33</b> containing particles to the total number of droplets <b>33</b> agrees with the probabilistic cutoff used to select droplets <b>33</b> for the test stream <b>4227</b>), as indicated by detection of more than a threshold number of droplets <b>33</b> containing particles in the test stream <b>4227</b>, is a definitive indication of sub-optimal sorting and prompts the processor <b>131</b> to adjust the drop delay setting. The threshold level is determined in relation to the probabilistic cutoff used to select droplets <b>33</b> for the test stream <b>4227</b> and the total number of droplets <b>33</b> selected for the test stream <b>4227</b>. Ideally, some droplets <b>33</b> can be selected for the test stream <b>4227</b> even though one or more particles in the fluid stream <b>21</b> are relatively close to an estimated drop formation boundary for the respective droplet <b>33</b> to make the system <b>4201</b> more sensitive to slightly sub-optimal drop delay settings.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0871">Of course, the sort calibration system could apply a non-neutral charge to and deflect droplets selected for the test stream, without departing from the scope of this invention. The relative order of the streams <b>4225</b>, <b>4227</b>, <b>4229</b> could also be rearranged without departing from the scope of this invention, although interposing the test stream <b>4227</b> between the waste stream <b>4225</b> and the stream of desired particles <b>4229</b> (as shown in the exemplary embodiment) reduces the risk of crossover contamination of the sorted sample by the waste stream. Further, if the particles do not emit fluorescent light, different sensors can be used to detect any scattered light caused by particles in the test stream without departing from the scope of this invention.</p>

<p id="p-0273" num="0873">In one embodiment of the invention, the automated calibration system <b>4201</b> is operable to automatically determine and set the phase relationship between droplet formation and droplet charging to within about 5% of the optimal phase (i.e., within +/&#x2212; about 18 degrees. In another embodiment the system <b>4201</b> is operable to automatically determine and set the phase relationship to within about 1% of the optimal phase (i.e., within +/&#x2212; about 3.6 degrees)). In another embodiment, the calibration system <b>4201</b> is operable to continuously monitor a high-speed droplet sorting system and automatically maintain the phase relationship within about 10% of the optimal phase (i.e., within +/&#x2212; about 36 degrees). In still another embodiment, the system <b>4201</b> is operable to continuously monitor a high-speed droplet sorting system and automatically maintain the phase relationship without about 3% of the optimal phase (i.e., within +/&#x2212;10.8 degrees).</p>

<p id="p-0274" num="0874">From time to time, a droplet <b>33</b> will stray from its normal trajectory and hit the charging element <b>631</b> or the deflector plates <b>629</b>. If one or more droplets <b>33</b> hit the charging element <b>631</b>, the charging element <b>631</b> may not be able to charge droplets <b>33</b> properly. Further, the normal droplet <b>33</b> trajectory through the charging element <b>631</b> can become obstructed causing even more droplets <b>33</b> to accumulate on the charging element <b>631</b>. Also, if stray droplets <b>33</b> strike a deflector plate <b>629</b>, they can distort or otherwise disrupt electrical field lines between the deflector plates <b>629</b>, thereby changing the trajectory of the sorted droplet steams <b>123</b>, <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0875">Thus, it is desirable to have a debris removal system to remove debris from the charging element <b>631</b> and/or the deflector plates <b>629</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, the system <b>9</b> includes a debris removal system <b>5047</b> for the charging element <b>631</b> and a debris removal system <b>5049</b> for the deflector plates <b>629</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0876">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the charging element <b>631</b> is held in position by a support <b>5051</b> secured to board <b>5015</b> of the adjustable mounting assembly <b>5001</b>. A vacuum passage <b>5053</b> (shown in phantom) extends through the support <b>5051</b> to an opening <b>5057</b> adjacent the charging element <b>631</b>. The vacuum passage <b>5053</b> is connected to a suitable vacuum source (not shown) by a vacuum line <b>5055</b> attached to a fitting <b>5058</b> on the support <b>5051</b>. Suitable controls are provided for selectively applying a vacuum in the passage <b>5053</b> to vacuum any undesired material (e.g., stray droplets <b>33</b>) off the charging element <b>631</b> and restore proper function of the charging element <b>631</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0877">Relatedly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, a manifold <b>5061</b> fastened to the mounting assembly <b>5001</b> has a network of air passages <b>5063</b> therein (shown in phantom) connected via an air line <b>5059</b> and fitting <b>5065</b> to a source of compressed air or other gas (not shown). The passages <b>5063</b> have openings <b>5064</b> positioned along a side <b>5066</b> of each deflector plate <b>629</b> and the portions <b>5067</b> of the passages <b>5063</b> leading to the openings <b>5065</b> are oriented so compressed air blown through the manifold <b>5061</b> will clear any stray droplets <b>33</b> or other debris off the deflector plates <b>629</b>. Any material blown off the deflector plates <b>629</b> will hit a cover panel (not shown) and drain into a suitable waste collection device (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0878">In one embodiment, if the processor or other sensor determines that stray droplets <b>33</b> have hit the charging element <b>631</b> or deflector plates <b>629</b>, as indicated by the sort calibration system described above for example, the processor can automatically initiate a fault correction procedure or mode, which can include applying a vacuum to passage <b>5053</b> to vacuum material from the charging element <b>631</b> and/or sending compressed gas through passages <b>5067</b> to blow material off the deflector plates <b>629</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0032" num="0000">Protection of Sorted Sample During Fault Mode</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0879">One embodiment of the system <b>9</b> also includes a contamination prevention mechanism <b>4041</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>), which can be activated by the processor <b>131</b> to limit or prevent contamination of the sorted sample any time the sorting system is in the fault correction mode. The contamination prevention mechanism includes a pneumatic actuator <b>4043</b> operable to selectively move a swing arm <b>4045</b> between a shielding position (shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) and a non-shielding position (not shown). In the shielding position, the end <b>4047</b> of the swing arm <b>4045</b> covers the opening of the collection vessel <b>4033</b>, thereby preventing collection of droplets <b>33</b> by the collection vessel <b>4033</b>. In the non-shielding position, the collection vessel <b>4033</b> is uncovered. Normally, the swing arm <b>4045</b> is in the non-shielding position, but the processor <b>131</b> causes the actuator <b>4043</b> to move the swing arm <b>4045</b> into the shielding position any time the processor <b>131</b> determines that there is a risk of contamination (e.g., the nozzle system <b>101</b> becomes clogged, the droplet break-off location <b>107</b> becomes unstable, or stray droplets <b>33</b> have hit the charging element <b>631</b> or deflector plates <b>629</b>). The end <b>4047</b> of the swing arm <b>4045</b> is trough-shaped to drain any fluid collected by the swing arm <b>4045</b> into the waste container <b>4035</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0033" num="0000">Fluid Delivery System</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0880">The system <b>1</b> described above is capable of effectively producing quantities of particles (e.g., X-sperm cells) sorted by selected characteristics. The rate of production can be increased or decreased by varying the rates at which the fluid delivery system <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) delivers carrier fluid <b>17</b> and sheath fluid <b>19</b> to the nozzle <b>137</b>. In one embodiment, the fluid delivery system includes a syringe pump <b>645</b>, one example of such a pump being MICROLAB&#xae; Model PSD/3 available from Hamilton Company. The pump <b>645</b> is operable to deliver carrier fluid <b>17</b> to the nozzle <b>137</b> at a rate of about 20 &#x3bc;l/min. In general, the pump <b>645</b> should be operable to deliver sample fluid <b>17</b> to the nozzle <b>137</b> at a rate in the range of 10-50 &#x3bc;l/min. The pump <b>645</b> is connected by a flow line <b>647</b> to the supply <b>3</b> of carrier fluid <b>17</b>, which may be a suitable vessel <b>649</b> containing a volume of material to be analyzed and sorted. Where the temperature of the particles being analyzed is a factor, as in the case of sperm cells, for example, the temperature of the vessel <b>649</b> may be controlled by a suitable temperature control system, such as heating/cooling bath (not shown). The syringe pump <b>645</b> is movable through an intake stroke to aspirate carrier fluid from the supply vessel and through a discharge stroke to dispense carrier fluid <b>17</b> through a supply line <b>651</b> to the injection needle <b>157</b> of the nozzle system <b>101</b>. The pump <b>645</b> is preferably driven by a variable speed motor (not shown) under the control of the processor <b>131</b>. By way of example, the pump <b>645</b> may be driven by a stepper motor which operates at selectively variable rates to pump carrier fluid <b>17</b> to the needle <b>159</b> at rates necessary to obtain the desired throughput. Other types of fluid delivery devices can be used instead of a syringe pump. To provide just one example, the vessel <b>649</b> can be pressurized by a pressurized gas source without departing from the scope of the invention. Furthermore, it is desirable to keep the lines <b>647</b>, <b>651</b> as short as is practically possible because the line environment is not conducive to the health of sensitive cells (e.g., sperm cells) that may be in the carrier fluid <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0881">The supply <b>7</b> of sheath fluid <b>19</b> comprises a second vessel <b>661</b>, e.g., a tank in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, holding an appropriate volume of sheath fluid <b>19</b> connected to the radial bore <b>173</b> in the flow body <b>133</b> of the nozzle system <b>101</b> by a supply line <b>667</b> having a control valve <b>669</b> therein. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sheath fluid vessel <b>661</b> is pressurized by a gas pressure system <b>671</b> comprising a source <b>675</b> of pressurized gas (e.g., air or other gas, such as nitrogen) communicating with the tank <b>661</b> via an air line <b>679</b> having a regulator <b>681</b> in it for controlling the pressure supplied to the tank <b>661</b>. A two-way valve <b>683</b> in the air line <b>679</b> is movable between a first position establishing communication between the tank <b>661</b> and the gas source <b>675</b> and a second position venting the tank <b>661</b>. The gas pressure regulator <b>681</b> is a conventional regulator preferably under the control of the processor <b>131</b>. By controlling the tank <b>661</b> pressure, the pressure at which sheath fluid <b>19</b> is delivered to the flow body <b>133</b> may also be controlled. This pressure may range from 16 to 100 psi, more preferably from 10 to 50 psi, even more preferably 15 to 40 psi, and even more preferably from about 20 to 30 psi. The pressure at which the sheath fluid <b>19</b> is supplied to the flow body <b>133</b> can be controlled in other ways without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0882">In one embodiment, shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> the fluid delivery system <b>15</b>, includes a sheath fluid tank (not shown) and a sample station <b>4051</b>. The sample station includes a two-part pressure container <b>4053</b> adapted to hold a sample tube <b>4055</b>. The bottom section <b>4057</b> of the pressure container is moveable up and down relative to the upper section <b>4059</b> of the pressure container <b>4053</b> between an open position (shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>), in which the sample tube <b>4055</b> may be loaded or unloaded, and a closed position (not shown) in which the two parts <b>4057</b>, <b>4059</b> of the pressure container <b>4053</b> come together to form a seal to contain pressurized gas used to pump carrier fluid <b>17</b> from the sample tube <b>4055</b> to the nozzle system <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0883">When the pressure container is open a spring-biased swing arm <b>4071</b> moves to a position beneath the line <b>651</b> that delivers carrier fluid <b>17</b> to the nozzle system <b>101</b> (See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 119</figref> #<b>4071</b>&#x2032;). The swing arm <b>4071</b> is trough-shaped and adapted to collect fluid backflushed through the line <b>651</b> and to drain the backflushed fluid to the waste container through port <b>4073</b>. As the pressure container <b>4053</b> moves from its open position to its closed position, a cam plate <b>4075</b> attached to the bottom section <b>4057</b> of the pressure container <b>4053</b> moves the swing arm <b>4071</b> against its spring bias to clear the area between the two sections <b>4057</b>, <b>4059</b> and allow the pressure container <b>4053</b> to close.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">Control</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0884">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the microprocessor <b>131</b> (or other digital or analog control and/or processor, or combinations thereof) controls the operation of the system <b>1</b>. As noted below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, the microprocessor may be implemented as a system control processor and four processors for handling signal processing. Alternatively, some or all functions may be integrated into one or more processors. For example, the system control microprocessor (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>) may be implemented by using one of the four signal processing processors. In addition, as noted below, the signal processing may be implemented by an analog circuit (e.g., an analog cell analyzer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>) or a combination of analog and digital circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0885">The microprocessor <b>131</b> provides output signals to control the fluid delivery system <b>15</b> (noted below) in response to input signals received from the epi-illumination system <b>415</b>, provides output signals to control the transducers <b>105</b> in response to input signals received from the break-off sensors <b>389</b>, and provides output signals to control the sorting system <b>119</b> (noted below) in response to input signals received from the epi-illumination system <b>415</b>. The microprocessor <b>131</b> may provide output signals to other parts of the cytometry system <b>9</b> as noted elsewhere herein. Further, the microprocessor <b>131</b> may be adapted to process information and provide output signals in real time. Broadly speaking, the term &#x201c;real time&#x201d; refers to operations in which the operation of the processor <b>131</b> matches the human perception of time or those in which the rate of the operation of the processor <b>131</b> matches the rate of relevant physical or external processes. In one context, the term &#x201c;real time&#x201d; can indicate that the system reacts to events before the events become obsolete.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0886">In general, electrical signals from the epi-illumination system <b>415</b> are converted to digital information by an ND converter <b>689</b> which supplies the corresponding digital information to the microprocessor <b>131</b>. In response to the information, the microprocessor <b>131</b> controls a sorting system <b>119</b> and a fluid delivery system <b>15</b>, both described above.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0887">The electrical signals output from the photodetector <b>117</b> of the epi-illumination system <b>415</b> are time-varying analog voltage signals indicative of the amplitude of the emitted fluorescence <b>31</b> at any instant in time generated by each cell as it is illuminated by the laser beam <b>25</b>. Thus, the analog signals (also referred to as analog output) are in the shape of time-varying waveform pulses <b>497</b> as illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52 and 53</figref>. In general a waveform pulse <b>497</b> is defined as a waveform or a portion of a waveform containing one or more pulses or some portion of a pulse. Thus, the amplitude of each waveform pulse <b>497</b> at any instant in time represents the relative rate of photon emission <b>31</b> of each cell at that instant in time as the cell passes through the laser beam <b>25</b>. X chromosome bovine sperm cells have a higher DNA content than Y chromosome bovine sperm cells (e.g., about 3.8%). As a result, live X cells labeled with a fluorescent stain as noted above will produce a different waveform pulse <b>497</b> than pulses from any other labeled cells. By analyzing the pulses <b>497</b> as noted below (see Signal Processing, Slit Scanning, and Critical Slope Difference), each cell can be identified as an X cell or not identified as an X cell (&#x2dc;X). In general, as used herein, X cells refers to live X cells, Y cells refers to live Y cells and &#x2dc;X cells refers to the combination of live Y cells and cells which otherwise produce a detectable fluorescence emission <b>31</b> but which cannot be identified with a reasonable probability as being live X cells.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0888">The timing of each waveform pulse <b>497</b> indicates the position of each cell in the stream <b>21</b>. Since the rate at which the sheath fluid <b>19</b> is being delivered through the nozzle <b>137</b> remains constant, and since the distance d (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>) between the nozzle <b>137</b> and the droplet break-off location <b>107</b> is known, the position of each droplet <b>33</b> is known and the cells, if any, within each droplet <b>33</b> are known. Thus, the microprocessor <b>131</b> can calculate the instant at which each forming droplet passes through the charging collar <b>631</b> and can control the polarity of the collar <b>631</b> and thus control whether a droplet <b>33</b> is charged for deflection by the charging elements <b>631</b> of the sorting system <b>119</b>. Since the microprocessor <b>131</b> knows the droplet formation rate and identifies the cells within a droplet as X or &#x2dc;X, the microprocessor <b>131</b> knows the cell content of each droplet <b>33</b> and keeps track of (or enumerates) the number of cells in each population <b>123</b>, <b>125</b>. Depending on the sort strategy, see below, the microprocessor <b>131</b> determines which droplets <b>33</b> are charged for deflection and which droplets <b>33</b> are not charged so that they are not deflected.</p>

<p id="p-0289" num="0889">A. Digital Sampling Introduction</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0890">As previously described, the interaction between the laser beam <b>25</b> and the particle produce a &#x201c;pulsed&#x201d; photon emission <b>31</b> (e.g., a fluorescence emission) that is captured by the collection lens <b>511</b> of the optics system <b>109</b> and delivered to a photodetector <b>117</b>. The photodetector <b>117</b> converts the photon energy at any instant in time to an analog voltage output of time-varying amplitude. This output is a series of waveform pulses <b>497</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 44</figref>) which contain many features that can be used to discriminate among populations of particles. Among these features are the total photon emission, the rate of photon emission as a function of the particle's spatial transit through the laser beam, the maximum rate of photon emission during the transit, the average rate of photon emission during the transit, and the time required for transit. The combination of laser beam geometry <b>459</b>, particle size, distribution of the emission source through the particle volume and particle velocity determine the frequency spectrum of waveform pulse <b>497</b>. For the system <b>1</b> used with bovine semen described previously it has been determined that each cell <b>201</b> produces a waveform pulse <b>497</b> of between 800 ns and 1200 ns in duration. It has also been determined that as a function of frequency, more than 97% of the power in the waveform pulse <b>497</b> is delivered at frequencies below 30 MHz. This frequency spectrum will be discussed later as it related to the Nyquist sampling theorem. Taken together these waveform pulses <b>497</b> form an output signal <b>701</b> from the photodetector <b>117</b> that is a continuous, time varying, signal that represents the transit of the particle stream through the apparatus. In addition to features of individual pulses that are used to discriminate among populations, the time varying signal provides a precise record as to the relative spacing (time and position) among the individual particles that pass through the apparatus and relative velocity of the particles moving through the apparatus. This precise time, position and velocity record can be synchronized with the droplet generation clock signals <b>703</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> to determine which particles are members of a particular droplet <b>33</b> formed by the droplet generation apparatus <b>105</b>. This information can be used as the basis for determining &#x201c;coincidence&#x201d; or the occurrence of a desired and undesired particle in a single droplet <b>33</b>. The ability to accurately determine the number and classification of each particle in a droplet <b>33</b> allows for accurate, efficient sorting.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0891">Digital signal processing <b>705</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref> may be employed to analyze detection of fluorescence pulses <b>31</b> as indicated by synchronously sampled output signals <b>701</b> from the photodetector <b>117</b>. This processing would be implemented in pulse analysis software employing instructions and/or algorithms, as noted herein. The time-varying analog output signal <b>701</b> of the photodetector <b>117</b> is provided to an A/D (analog/digital) converter <b>689</b> which synchronously samples it. Synchronously sampling means sampling to produce digital information corresponding to the analog output. Synchronously sampling is also referred to as continuously sampling or streaming acquisition. As noted below, the sampling rate depends on the frequency spectrum of the analog output.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0892">Converter <b>689</b> provides an output including digital information <b>707</b> which is provided to the microprocessor <b>131</b> or other digital analysis device which executes the pulse analysis software to analyze the digital information <b>707</b>. In general, the pulse analysis software would include digital pulse detection HH<b>3</b>, pulse feature extraction HH<b>4</b> and pulse discrimination HH<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0893">B. Sampling Frequency &#x26; Signal Frequency Spectrum</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0894">The signal output <b>701</b> from the PMT <b>117</b> is captured by a high speed analog to digital converter <b>689</b> (ADC) that samples the output <b>701</b> continuously at a frequency of 105 MHz. It is well understood that when sampling a time varying signal it is necessary for the sampling frequency to be at least twice the maximum frequency contained in the signal being sampled. This is known as the Nyquist sampling theorem. For this reason the output signal <b>701</b> from the PMT <b>117</b> is first sent through a 40 MHz low-pass filter <b>854</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>) to ensure that the maximum frequency contained in the signal <b>701</b> is under the 52.5 MHz limit imposed by the sampling rate. It is important to note that the optical <b>109</b>, fluidic <b>15</b> and detection systems of the apparatus <b>1</b> have been tuned to produce a pulse waveform <b>497</b> having optimum frequency characteristics for sampling at the 105 MHz rate. The sampling rate may be varied between about 25 and 200 MHz without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0895">C. Pulse Processing</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0896">Pulse processing takes place in four (4) TigerSharc DSP processors that share memory and are connected to one another by high-speed parallel ports. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, the four processors are: 1) a data management processor <b>863</b> which receives data from a high-speed ADC <b>689</b> which digitizes the output signals <b>701</b> from the photodetector <b>117</b>; 2) a pulse detection processor <b>865</b> which detects the waveform pulses <b>497</b> represented by the digital information; 3) a feature extraction and discrimination processor <b>867</b> which extracts features from the detected pulses <b>497</b> and discriminates the pulses <b>497</b> based on the extracted features; and 4) a sort processor <b>873</b> which determines a sort classification for each pulse <b>497</b> based on the extracted features and the discrimination, which determines sort decisions for the corresponding cells and droplets <b>33</b> and which is synchronized with droplet formation <b>105</b>. In general a processor <b>863</b>, <b>865</b>, <b>867</b>, <b>873</b> completes a task and sets a &#x201c;flag&#x201d; so that companion processors know there is data available to process.</p>

<p id="p-0299" num="0899">The processor I/O <b>857</b> receives the output <b>707</b> from the analog/digital converter (ADC) <b>689</b>, e.g., Bitware Corp. 105 MHz/2-channel, 14 bit capable of 105 MHz/1-channel sustained. The ADC <b>689</b> is connected to the photodetector <b>117</b> output for converting its time varying analog output signals <b>701</b> into digital information <b>707</b> and is also connected to an I/O board SDRAM <b>855</b> for storing the blocks of digital information from the ADC <b>689</b>.</p>

These memory blocks <b>855</b> are also accessible by the digital signal processing (DSP) processors <b>863</b>, <b>865</b>, <b>867</b>, <b>873</b> by direct memory access (DMA). In this manner the processors <b>863</b>, <b>865</b>, <b>867</b>, <b>873</b> can access the incoming data <b>707</b> without interrupting the ADC <b>689</b>. This facilitates efficient transfer of data <b>707</b> to these processors <b>863</b>, <b>865</b>, <b>867</b>, <b>873</b> for feature extraction, analysis and sort classification. Throughout this process, the data management processor <b>863</b> keeps the pulse samples <b>707</b> in order and time indexed (relative to the master clock <b>737</b>, which is 128 times the droplet <b>33</b> frequency) to preserve their reference to &#x201c;real time&#x201d; or the actual time that the cell passed through the laser beam <b>25</b>. The ADC <b>689</b> ping-pongs back and forth between two inputs, continuously sampling the time varying analog output signals <b>701</b> including the waveform pulses <b>497</b> and converting them into digital information <b>707</b> which is provided in blocks <b>855</b> to the I/O Board SDRAM under the control of the data management processor <b>863</b>. Processor <b>863</b> assembles the information <b>707</b> into a continuous stream.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0903">E. Initializing Detection Parameters</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0904">In order effectively distinguish over background noise, the digital pulse detection software <b>747</b> should be provided with information indicating signal background second order statistics, i.e. knowledge of the behavior of the output voltage signal <b>701</b> from the photodetector <b>117</b> when there is no fluorescence pulse <b>497</b>. These statistics can be learned by software for initializing detection parameters <b>741</b> in an unsupervised manner during the initialization period immediately following startup of the system <b>1</b>. In general, a pulse may be defined as 2 or 3 standard deviations from the background level.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0905">Due to the possibility that introduction of the carrier fluid <b>17</b> into the sheath fluid stream <b>191</b> may cause a change in background fluorescence emission, the carrier fluid <b>17</b> should be present for the initialization of the detection parameters. Simple computation of the second order statistics of a time sequence of output voltage signal values may overestimate the standard deviation of the background (due to the possible presence of fluorescence pulses <b>497</b> in the sequence). An iterative procedure is therefore preferred to gradually eliminate this effect. The pulse detection software <b>747</b> accomplishes this by computing the statistics of the total signal <b>701</b> (background+pulses), using these values to apply pulse detection logic, re-computing the signal statistics without samples detected to be within pulses, and repeating this procedure until the background statistic estimates converge (or a fixed maximum number of iterations occurs). By evaluating the background with cells present, a more accurate indication of the expected correct pulse <b>497</b> amplitude can be determined. Table II summarizes the detection initialization procedure for determining detection parameters for use by the pulse detection software.</p>

<p id="p-0313" num="0913">In general, the A/D converter <b>689</b> converts the analog output signals <b>701</b> from the photodetector <b>117</b> into corresponding digital information <b>707</b> indicative of characteristic A or characteristic B (e.g., X or &#x2dc;X). The digital signal processor <b>867</b> generates initial discrimination parameters corresponding to the digital information <b>707</b>, discriminates the digital information as a function of the initial discrimination parameters, and provides a sorting signal <b>853</b> to the sorting system <b>119</b> as a function of the discriminated digital information.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0914">G. Digital Pulse Detection</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0915">The first processing step is pulse detection performed by pulse detection processor <b>865</b> to determine whether a particular waveform is a waveform pulse <b>497</b> corresponding to a fluorescence emission <b>31</b> of a cell. The processor <b>865</b> executes a pulse detection algorithm which identifies sample sets that are likely to represent either particles targeted for sorting into a population or particles targeted to be avoided because they are potential contaminants to a population. In the case of bovine sperm sorting, a dye is added to quench the emission <b>31</b> of non-viable cells, causing their associated pulse intensities to be &#x2dc;&#x2153; the intensity of a live cell. Nonviable cells are not considered as sorting targets or potential contamination. They are not considered detected pulses <b>497</b>. Pulses <b>497</b> from live cells are detected by monitoring the intensity of samples for a successive number of samples that rise above the background levels. Once this level crosses a statistically determined threshold the processor <b>865</b> jumps to a later time that is approximately 75% of the expected pulse <b>497</b> width for a live cell. If the level is still above the threshold, the series of samples are considered to be a pulse <b>497</b>. Samples from detected pulses <b>497</b> are moved to a block of memory used by the feature extraction processor <b>867</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0916">A statistical anomaly detection approach is one embodiment which may be employed by digital pulse detection software <b>747</b> although it is contemplated that other approaches for identifying and/or isolating digitized pulses <b>497</b> may be used. Essentially, digital samples <b>707</b> of the output voltage signals <b>701</b> from the photodetector <b>117</b> detecting fluorescence which are statistically anomalous from the background are considered to part of a pulse <b>497</b>. For additional robustness (to minimize noise detections), additional temporal criteria may be included.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0917">Pulse detection proceeds as follows. When the voltage output signal <b>701</b> from the photodetector <b>117</b> is not a pulse, the Mahalanobis distance from the background of incoming samples <b>707</b> of the signal <b>701</b> is computed and compared with a preset threshold. If the distance of a given sample exceeds the threshold, it is considered to be the potential start of a pulse <b>497</b>, and the pulse detection software begins to buffer the incoming samples. If the next predetermined number of samples (e.g., 25) also exceed the threshold, a pulse <b>497</b> is considered to have started and buffering continues until the pulse end criteria are met; otherwise, the buffer is reset and checking for the start of a pulse resumes. While in a pulse <b>497</b>, if a sample is below the threshold, then it is considered to be the potential end of a pulse and the buffer location is recorded (but sample buffering continues). If the next predetermined number of samples (e.g., 25) are also below threshold, the pulse <b>497</b> is considered to have ended and the pulse <b>497</b> consists of the buffered samples up to the recorded location. Table V summarizes the pulse detection algorithm, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> provides an illustration of the results of pulse detection on a digitally acquired fluorescence pulse <b>497</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0320" num="0920">H. Feature Extraction and Discrimination</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0921">The next processing step is feature extraction performed by the feature extraction and discrimination processor <b>867</b>. This processor responds to flags set by the pulse detection processor <b>865</b>. Samples from detected pulses are placed in memory shared with the feature extraction processor <b>867</b>. Features such as area, pulse width, pulse height, Gaussian correlation coefficient and/or other features are determined for each pulse <b>497</b>. In some cases pulses <b>497</b> are determined to be &#x201c;doublets&#x201d; or invalid and features are not extracted. For the case of bovine sperm <b>201</b> features are only extracted for pulses <b>497</b> that have the general amplitude and width of a live X or Y cell. Typically, the pulse amplitude for a live sperm cell is in the range of about 700-900 mV, although this range may be as wide as 500-1000 mV. Once the features are extracted they are compared to the feature spaces defined for the population(s) selected for sorting. If the features match the feature spaces identified for sorting, then processor <b>867</b> sets a flag indicating a positive sort command to the sort processor <b>873</b>. In general, the classification of a particular cell is made by the discrimination processor <b>867</b> and the sort decision is made by the sort processor <b>873</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0922">Digital information <b>707</b> representing fluorescence emissions <b>31</b> (and thus the characteristics of corresponding cells which created them) are discriminated by software <b>757</b> based on specific features or characteristics which exhibit distinguishably different statistical behavior in feature space (the n-dimensional orthogonal space formed by n features as the axes) for the different populations of interest. Therefore, the first step in analyzing digital information <b>707</b> for the purposes of discrimination is computation of these features, a process called feature extraction performed by pulse analysis software <b>749</b> executed by the processor <b>867</b>. Table VI lists the several candidate features which software <b>749</b> may use for this application. One or more of these features will be selected to form the feature space for classification.

<p id="p-0324" num="0924">I. Slit Scanning</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0925">In general, the elliptical spot <b>459</b> provided by the illumination system <b>109</b> measures the relative DNA content differences in cells. Resolution can be improved further by analyzing the fraction of the pulse <b>497</b> of the fluorescence emission <b>31</b> detected by the photodetector <b>117</b> more likely to contain characteristics which are being evaluated. A biological phenomenon of certain cells (e.g., bovine sperm cells) is the localization of the X/Y chromosomes in a sub-equatorial region <b>225</b> which is immediately adjacent the longitudinal midline or equator or center of the nucleus <b>213</b> of the cell <b>201</b> and which has a length of about 1 &#x3bc;m. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In fact, the X/Y chromosomes are not necessarily centered in the nucleus <b>213</b>. Thus, resolution can be improved by converting the time-varying analog output <b>701</b> of the photodetector <b>117</b> into digital information <b>707</b> and analyzing a portion of the digital information corresponding to the fraction of the pulse <b>497</b> of the fluorescence emission <b>31</b>, e.g., corresponding to the light emitted from the circumequatorial region <b>225</b> such as such as 20-60% and particularly 20-30% of the waveform pulse centered around the pulse <b>497</b> peak.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0926">As noted above, slit scanning can be employed to obtain the fluorescence measurement from a portion of each cell's chromatin rather than from the chromatin as a whole. The elliptical spot <b>459</b> provided by the epi-illumination system <b>415</b> noted above measures the relative DNA content differences in cells from specific sections of the chromatin, so that the resolution of X cells and &#x2dc;X cells relative to one another is improved. As noted above, the slit scanning measurement technique is a fluorescence measurement approach that focuses the excitation beam <b>25</b> so that a dimension of the focused spot size <b>459</b> is much less than a cell diameter as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this way, the cell <b>201</b> is scanned by the laser beam <b>25</b> as the cell passes through the elliptically-shaped beam spot <b>459</b>. The resulting waveform pulse <b>497</b> produced by the photodetector <b>117</b> output <b>701</b> detecting the fluorescence emission <b>31</b> resulting from slit scan illumination contains information about the localization of fluorescence along the length of the cell <b>201</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45-48</figref>, as the cell <b>201</b> traverses the elliptically-shaped beam spot <b>459</b>, the time-varying waveform pulses <b>497</b> (red/orange line) are the convolution of the relative beam intensity (blue line) and the relative emitted pulse intensity (which corresponds to the fluorescence emissions from stain excited by the elliptical spot as the cell traverses the beam and which varies because the fluorescence distribution along the axis of the cell varies).</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0927">By illuminating only a fraction of the cell's chromatin at one time, the resulting time-varying analog output <b>701</b> from the photodetector <b>117</b> contains information specific to the localization of fluorescence within the chromatin along the longitudinal axis of the cell <b>201</b>. Although the detected fluorescence emission <b>31</b> from slit scanning is less than the detected emission <b>31</b> from scanning by a beam <b>25</b> having a spot width comparable to the cell diameter, resulting in waveform pulses <b>497</b> from slit scanning having a lower pulse amplitude, the majority of difference between the X-chromosome bearing cells and the Y-chromosome bearing cells appears in the center 20-30% to 20-60% of the waveform pulse <b>497</b>. If only the rectangular area <b>725</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> is considered for discriminating X-Y sperm cells, then a larger relative difference can be measured between the localized variation in DNA content within the section of chromatin that corresponds to the rectangular region <b>725</b> due to the presence of the X and Y chromosomes within that region as compared to the total DNA content of the cells. For example, bovine X-Y sperm cells have a difference in total DNA content of about 3.8%. The fluorescence emission <b>31</b> from the X and Y chromosomes will be contained in the rectangular region <b>725</b>. If this rectangular region <b>725</b> accounts for 20% of the total waveform pulse <b>497</b> corresponding to a fluorescence emission <b>31</b>, then a 14% difference in relative DNA content within the region will exist. By measuring the relative DNA content differences from specific sections of the chromatin, the resolution of X-Y sperm cell differentiation is improved (e.g., from 3.8% to 14%). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> illustrates the resolution attainable using slit scanning illumination and processing the areas from only the center 20% of the pulse <b>497</b> (i.e., the rectangular region <b>725</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>). The histogram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> allows a very high percentage (e.g., 98%) of the X chromosome bearing sperm and Y chromosome bearing sperm to be identified with a high degree of confidence (e.g., 95%). In comparison, the histogram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, which illustrates the resolution obtainable when using standard illumination techniques, shows that slit scanning offers a significant improvement over the results obtained using standard illumination techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0928">Two approaches which can be employed to obtain the area <b>725</b> of the center portion of the waveform pulse <b>497</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> are digital signal processing (DSP) of digitized photodetector <b>117</b> time-varying analog output <b>701</b>, as discussed in this section, or analog integration using an analog threshold trigger, as noted below. As noted herein, DSP processing involves continuously sampling the time-varying analog output <b>701</b> from the photodetector <b>117</b> to obtain digital information <b>707</b> corresponding to the output <b>701</b> and applying DSP algorithms to the digital information <b>707</b> to extract features, such as area size, from the digital information corresponding to the center portion <b>725</b> of the waveform pulse <b>497</b> which corresponds to the difference in DNA content due to the presence of an X or Y chromosome in different cells <b>201</b>. As a simple example, the center 20% of the total area of each waveform pulse <b>497</b> would be determined by analyzing the digital information <b>707</b> corresponding thereto. The analysis would be used to generate a histogram such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0929">J. Pulsed Laser Scanning</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0930">In one embodiment, it is contemplated that the system <b>1</b> include a pulsed laser to illuminate the cells. In this embodiment, slit scanning (as described above) may or may not be employed. For example, a mode-locked solid-state laser can be used to emit a train of electromagnetic pulses having a pulse width (duration) of 1-100 picoseconds at a pulse frequency of about 50-150 MHz and at an average power output of about 100-500 milliwatts. One suitable laser is a Vanguard 350 mode-locked solid-state laser (available from Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, Calif. 94039), which is operable to emit a series of pulses about 12 picoseconds in width (duration) at a frequency of about 85 million pulses per second and at an average power of about 350 milliwatts. Because the 350 mW of power is delivered over extremely short bursts of only 12 picoseconds, the peak power output of such a laser is several hundred times (e.g., about 800 times) greater than the average power.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0931">The output of such a laser can be described as quasi continuous wave (quasi-cw) because, for many applications, the pulse repetition rate is fast enough to approximate a continuous wave (cw) output. Indeed it is possible to operate the system as described above with a quasi-cw laser in much the same manner as one would operate with a cw laser. This provides certain advantages because solid-state lasers typically operate more efficiently, require less extensive cooling systems, and require less maintenance than most other lasers.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0932">A quasi-cw pulsed solid-state laser can also result in significantly improved signal-to-noise ratios using digital signal processing techniques. A timing circuit may be included and is operable to produce a timing signal indicative of the arrival of laser pulses at the interrogation location <b>115</b> (i.e., the area where the laser beam <b>25</b> illuminates the stream <b>21</b>). For example, the timing circuit may be a laser pulse sensor <b>3003</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> for detecting light corresponding to the laser pulse including scattered light generated by the interaction of each laser pulse with the fluid stream <b>21</b> and/or including light from the laser pulses. Alternatively, for lasers which may be triggered, a triggering signal may be provided to the microprocessor <b>131</b> and/or the ND converter <b>689</b> to synchronize either or both to the laser pulses, as noted below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>. In either embodiment, the laser pulse timing would provide a clock signal for the system.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0933">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, a timing diagram illustrates the timing relationship between the laser pulses LP, the fluorescence emissions FE from a cell as a result of repeated excitation by the laser pulses LP as the cell passes through the beam spot <b>459</b> and the digital samples DS of the photodetector output <b>701</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45-49</figref>, as a cell passes through the laser beam spot <b>459</b> the fluorescence emission <b>31</b> varies depending upon the amount of illumination of the portion of the cell which generates the fluorescence emission <b>31</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> illustrates twenty (20) laser pulses LP<b>1</b>-LP<b>20</b> which impinge upon a cell as the cell passes through the interrogation zone <b>115</b> of a flow cytometer <b>1</b>. Each laser pulse LP<b>1</b>-LP<b>20</b> corresponds to a fluorescence emission FE<b>1</b>-FE<b>20</b>, respectively, which exponentially decays after substantially instantaneous excitation by the laser pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0934">In one embodiment, the microprocessor <b>131</b> controls the A/D converter <b>689</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>) so that the converter <b>689</b> samples the output signal <b>701</b> of the photodetector <b>117</b> at or near peak of each fluorescence emission FE<b>1</b>-FE<b>20</b>, as indicated by digital samples DS<b>1</b>-DS<b>20</b>, respectively. In other words, the timing circuit synchronizes the sampling rate of the A/D converter <b>689</b> with the fluorescence emissions FE<b>1</b>-FE<b>20</b>. The resulting digital signal produced by transit of a particle through the interrogation zone <b>115</b> is the functional equivalent of the digital signal that would have been produced by the digitization of a pulse waveform <b>497</b> from a continuous wave laser. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, for example, by considering only the fluorescence intensity during the digital samples DS<b>1</b>-DS<b>20</b> and disregarding fluorescence intensity drop-off between laser pulses LP<b>1</b>-LP<b>20</b>, the fluorescence intensity as a function of time is a pulse waveform <b>497</b>. This permits feature extraction by the microprocessor <b>131</b> from the digital signal <b>707</b> generated by the pulsed laser in order to analyze the cell providing the fluorescence emissions FE<b>1</b>-FE<b>20</b>. In one embodiment, a more sensitive photodetector having relatively fast response time of about 2 nanoseconds or less may be used to more accurately detect the fluorescence emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0935">Thus, the pulsed laser provides advantages in a flow cytometry system <b>1</b> in that it is possible to use a lower power pulsed laser to obtain substantially the same analysis that would be obtained with a cw laser operating at an average power much higher than the average power of the pulsed laser. Further, the high peak power from a pulsed laser tends to saturate the fluorophores so that the fluorescence emissions are maximized thereby reducing the signal-to-noise ratio of the output signals of the photodetector. In other words, by using a laser pulse that contains much more energy than is required to saturate the fluorophore, variations in the output of the laser do not result in variations in the fluorescent emissions <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0936">Those skilled in the art will recognize that there are many ways to cause a laser to emit a series of pulses. It is understood that other pulsed lasers, including other mode-locked lasers, Q-switched lasers, and cavity dumping lasers, could be used in place of the mode-locked laser discussed above without departing from the scope of this invention. Similarly, many other ways to time the digital sampling and process the resulting information will be apparent from the foregoing disclosure. For example, the digital sampling could be timed so there is a different delay (or no delay) between a laser pulse and a digital sample without departing from the scope of the invention. Likewise, the number of digital samples per pulse or the number of pulses that elapse between digital sampling can also be varied without departing from the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0937">K. Estimation of Population Characteristics</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0938">As noted above, flow cytometry can be used to discriminate X-bearing bovine sperm cells from Y-bearing bovine sperm cells based on their relative 3.8% difference in DNA content. Discrimination is achieved through analysis of characteristics of the time-varying signal <b>701</b> that is produced by the photodetector <b>117</b> used to record the fluorescence emission <b>31</b> as the stained cell passes though the interrogation location <b>115</b>. This interaction is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45-48</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45-48</figref> illustrate how a pulse waveform <b>497</b> is generated by the fluorescence emissions <b>31</b> resulting from the interaction between the laser beam <b>25</b> and a stained sperm cell <b>201</b>. The emission pulse <b>497</b> is the convolution integral of the excitation spatial function <b>498</b> and the emission spatial function of the cell <b>201</b>. Characteristics of the fluorescence pulse waveform <b>497</b> are used to classify a cell as X, Y or undetermined. In one embodiment, X-Y discrimination relies on two pulse characteristics: peak pulse height and pulse area.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0939">These characteristics are illustrated on the example pulse that appears in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52 and 53</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52 and 53</figref> are examples of pulses <b>497</b> from X-bearing and Y-bearing sperm cells. The pulses <b>497</b> were generated from a computer model that assumed excitation illumination with a laser beam <b>25</b> having an elliptically-shaped beam spot <b>459</b> having a 2 &#x3bc;m Gaussian beam waist W<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and that the DNA content difference was distributed uniformly across the center 20 percent of the cell <b>201</b>. These assumptions are representative of slit scanning illumination of bovine sperm cells <b>201</b> having a localized DNA difference as discussed in more detail above. Integration of the pulses <b>497</b> results in a 3.8% average difference between the pulse <b>497</b> area for an X cell and the pulse <b>497</b> area for a Y cell.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0940">It is possible to generate histogram and scatter plots of the pulse <b>497</b> peak and area characteristics for stained cells and nuclei. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56-59</figref> contain histograms of the pulse area characteristic for stained nuclei and live cells, plus scatter plots of the pulse <b>497</b> area and peak characteristics for stained nuclei and live cells. Some of the items that may limit live cell discrimination, and ultimately the cell sorting rate are evident in these plots. Notably, the live cell histogram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, and to a lesser extent the nuclei histogram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, have a left shoulder that is typical of fluorescence intensity histograms for mammalian sperm cells. It has been determined that the left shoulder is generated by one or more populations of slightly unaligned cells (i.e., cells that generate relatively weaker fluorescence emissions due to slight deviations from the optimal alignment, but that are not so far out alignment to cause the relatively brighter fluorescence emission <b>31</b> from the narrow edge <b>209</b> of the sperm head <b>205</b> to be collected by the optics system <b>109</b>). Only about half of the X cells can be easily identified in the live cell area histogram. The rest overlap with the Y cell population and the non-aligned cell populations. Even when peak pulse height is added, as shown in the scatter plots in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56-59</figref>, X-bearing cell classification may be significantly limited.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0941"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60-61</figref> illustrate the overlap of the X and Y population distributions. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60-61</figref>, a four-component computer model has been applied to raw data <b>6000</b>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>) to estimate population statistics for two populations of non-aligned cells (<b>6001</b>, <b>6003</b>), aligned live Y cells (<b>6005</b>) and aligned live X cells (<b>6007</b>) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>). It is desirable to discriminate the X and Y populations as a function of the coefficient of variation (CV) of the X and Y populations. For example, it is desirable to minimize the coefficient of variation (CV) of the X and Y populations in order to improve discrimination. In particular, when a population of sorted X cells is desired, it is desirable for the CV of the X cell population to be less than 1.5%, more desirably about 1.3%, and even more desirably less than 1.3%. Traditionally, the CV of a distribution of fluorescence intensity of sperm cells has been considered with respect to the distribution functions for only two populations (X and Y). Quality control with respect to CV has been limited to crude subjective estimation of the CV of the X and Y populations to decide whether continued analysis or sorting is worthwhile.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0942">According to one embodiment of the present invention, one function of the microprocessor <b>131</b> is to provide an automated estimation of the CV of the X population using the four-component model illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60-61</figref>. In order to estimate the CVs of the populations present in a feature (e.g. pulse area) distribution, it is necessary to estimate the 2<sup>nd </sup>order statistics of the population distributions. This may be achieved by applying a model of a known form and finding the best fit of that model to the observed data.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0943">Given the expectation of normally-distributed data, an approach consisting of Parzen Window based non-parametric density estimation (utilizing a Gaussian kernel function) followed by application of a Gaussian mixture parametric model has been chosen. Specifically, the four-component model illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60-61</figref> consists of a sum (or mixture) of four uni-variate Gaussian distributions, with these four components being the feature distributions corresponding to aligned X cells, aligned Y cells, and a two-component unaligned cell population. The parameters characterizing the model then are the population means (averages) (4), population standard deviations/variances (4), and prior probabilities (expected % of the overall distribution) (4). These 12 parameters can then be varied to achieve a best fit of the model to the observed data histogram. With the model component parameters thus estimated, an estimate of the CV of a population of interest (in particular, X cells) may be determined from the estimated population standard deviation and mean:</p>

<p id="p-0345" num="0945">In order to reduce computational complexity, constraints have been placed on the model to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space. In particular, the standard deviations of the model components corresponding to the aligned X and aligned Y populations have been constrained to be the same. Also, the aligned X and aligned Y components have been constrained to make up the same percentage of the overall mixture&#x2014;thus the non-aligned populations are assumed 50% X cells and 50% Y cells.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0946">Non-parametric density estimation is applied prior to model fitting to obtain an improved estimate of the total density function (being the sum of the component densities) underlying the raw histogram data. The specific technique applied is known as &#x201c;Parzen Windows&#x201d; (Duda, Hart, and Stork, 2001), here utilizing a Gaussian kernel or window function due to the assumed sum-of-Gaussian nature of the underlying density. The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel is chosen to be 1% of the number of populated histogram bins; this value has been empirically observed to provide adequate but not excessive smoothing of the histogram. Each data point in the histogram then contributes a kernel function centered on the histogram bin containing the data point. The density estimate is then obtained as the sum of the kernel functions.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0947">The methodology chosen for variation of the model parameters to achieve the best fit to the data is known as Expectation Maximization (See Duda R. O., Hart, P.

The top two local maxima in the Parzen density estimate are used as the initial Y and X mean locations (the initial amplitude of the maxima for both X and Y populations being estimated as the amplitude of the right peak). The initial X and Y population variance is estimated as the variance of the data to the right of the local minimum occurring between the left and right peaks relative to the right peak location. Also, the initial X and Y population prior probabilities are set as the percentage of all points falling to the right of this local minimum. The initial X and Y population Gaussian density estimates are then computed using these parameters and subtracted from the total Parzen density estimate. The mean and variance of the remaining data points are then computed and used to initialize the two-component unaligned population model as follows. The two population means are assumed (arbitrarily) to be 5% apart (2.5% above and below the overall unaligned mean). Given an (initial) assumption of equal priors and equal variances, then, the component variances are given by:

This constraint is achieved by using the average of the X and Y variance and prior values computed via the above procedure at each iteration.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0955">Alternatively, a similar modeling approach can be applied to a three-component model (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 62-63</figref>) in which the cells comprising the two unaligned populations <b>6001</b>, <b>6003</b> in the four-component model are treated as a single Gaussian distribution <b>6011</b> rather than two distinct subpopulations. The non-aligned cells can be modeled as third Gaussian distribution (shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>) having a mean and standard deviation determined by a best fit of the left shoulder and left major peak of the raw data <b>6010</b> (shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>). The three-population model also has estimated statistics for the aligned Y Population <b>6015</b> and aligned X Population <b>6017</b>. One advantage of the three-component model is that it requires only 9-dimensional parameter space (compared to 12-dimensional parameter space required for the four-component model). However, it has been found that the four-component model typically results in an estimated density function that more closely matches the raw data.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0956">Those skilled in the art will recognize that a wide variety of statistical techniques can be used to estimate the characteristics of the aligned X and aligned Y populations.

<p id="p-0352" num="0957">L. CV-Based Selection of Staining Conditions</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0958">Several factors affect the efficiency of sorting stained cells within a population into enriched subpopulations of cells. Among these factors is the amount of differential fluorescence between the various subpopulations of cells within a stained population. Differential fluorescence is affected by dye uptake, which varies based upon staining factors, such as for example, the concentration of the stain, the length of the staining period, the temperature at which staining occurs, and the number and concentration of any additives that may be included with the stain or added to the staining mixture. Accordingly, adjustments to any or all of these factors may be made to increase the sorting efficiency (the rate at which cells may be sorted into at least one enriched subpopulation of cells with certain degree of purity and/or a minimal loss of desired cells) of the population of stained cells. Further, one can increase efficiency of a multi-sample sorting system by adjusting one or more of these factors for each sample, thereby countering any sample-to-sample variations. In the context of bovine sperm sorting, for example, sorting efficiency can be improved by adjusting one or more of the foregoing staining factors from one semen sample to the next to counter bull-to-bull variations or sample-to-sample variations within the same bull.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0959">A determination of the coefficient of variation (&#x201c;CV&#x201d;) for a given fluorescence emission characteristic of a population of cells to be sorted is one manner in which to determine if adjustments to the staining conditions could be made to achieve a desired sorting efficiency. For example, one may adjust the staining conditions as a function of the CV of any feature extracted from the pulse waveform generated by movement of a cell through the interrogation location, such as any feature indicative of total fluorescence intensity or peak fluorescence intensity (including total fluorescence intensity and peak fluorescence intensity). As previously discussed in greater detail, CV is an indicator of the homogeneity or consistency of a distribution of a measurable property or characteristic of a population, such as for example a fluorescence emission characteristic of a particular subpopulation of a given population. CV may be determined by dividing the standard deviation of the measured characteristic of a sample by the sample mean. CV can also be determined automatically by the flow cytometry system <b>9</b>, such as by implementation of the iterative CV estimation algorithm discussed in detail above. The lower the CV, the greater the homogeneity or consistency of the distribution of the measured characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0960">As applied to the staining and separation of sperm cells, the CV of a particular fluorescence emission characteristic for a sample of X and Y chromosome bearing sperm cells may be affected by the staining conditions. The concentration of the stain, the length of the staining period, the temperature of the staining mixture, and/or the number and concentration of additives affect the CV of a given fluorescence emission characteristic. Increasing the concentration of the stain, the length of the staining period, and the temperature of the staining mixture and/or decreasing the number and concentration of additives will generally lower the CV. Such conditions may be altered individually or in combination. In addition, if any one of these factors is such that it would tend to increase the CV of a fluorescence emission characteristic, such as for example, by shortening the staining time, then any one or more of the other conditions may be adjusted such that it counteracts the effect of the first, such as for example, by increasing the dye concentration, with the overall result being a decrease in the CV of the fluorescence emission characteristic to a level sufficient to achieve a desired sorting efficiency. Accordingly, by manipulating any one or any combination of these factors in this manner, the CV of a fluorescence emission characteristic of the X and Y chromosome bearing populations may be decreased to a value that enables sorting of the sperm sample into a subpopulation of gender enriched semen comprising a desired percent purity of X chromosome bearing cells.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0961">Unfortunately, changes that tend to lower the CV of the X bearing sperm may have negative consequences such as increased cost or decreased sperm motility or fertility. For example, other things being equal it is desirable to use lower stain concentrations and shorter staining periods to minimize any harmful impact of the staining process on the sperm. With this in mind, one may predetermine a CV at which an acceptable sorting efficiency will be achieved. Thereafter, a fraction of the cell sample to be sorted is stained and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescence emission characteristic of the fraction is determined, and the fraction is classified into subpopulations based upon the characteristic. The CV of the fluorescence characteristic is determined with respect to the cells of one of the subpopulations (an enriched subpopulation). If the CV of the fluorescence emission characteristic of the cells of the enriched subpopulation is equal to or less than the predetermined CV at which sorting is to occur, then the remainder of the cell sample is stained according to the conditions under which the fraction was stained. The sample is thereafter sorted, for example, according to the methods disclosed herein. If the CV of the particular fluorescence emission characteristic of the cells of the enriched subpopulation is greater than the predetermined CV at which sorting is to occur, then another fraction of the same sample is analyzed in a similar manner, but under staining conditions believed to achieve a yet lower CV. In such a situation, the CV may be lowered by, for example, increasing the length of the staining period, increasing the concentration of the dye, increasing the temperature at which the fraction is stained, or any combination thereof. This series of steps (i.e., removal of a fraction from the sample to be sorted, adjustment of the staining conditions, and a determination of the CV) is repeated until the CV of the particular fluorescence emission characteristic of the cells of the enriched subpopulation is determined to be equal to or lesser than the predetermined CV. Thereafter, the remainder of the sample is stained accordingly and may be sorted, for example, according to the methods disclosed herein. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the cell sample comprises a semen sample, and the cells of the enriched subpopulation comprise X chromosome bearing sperm cells.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0962">Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention is a process for evaluating a set of conditions for staining a population of cells for sorting, the population comprising a first type and a second type of cell. The process comprises (a) staining a fraction of the population of cells with a fluorescent dye under a set of staining conditions; (b) exposing the stained cells to electromagnetic radiation as the stained cells are passed through an interrogation location of a flow cytometer at a rate, R; (c) determining a fluorescence emission characteristic of the exposed cells; (d) using the determined fluorescence characteristic to classify the cells into two or more sub-populations, one of the subpopulations being an enriched subpopulation of the first cell type; (e) determining a coefficient of variation for the fluorescence emission characteristic of the cells of the enriched subpopulation; and (f) determining whether to modify any staining condition under which the cells are to be stained or the rate, R, at which the stained cells are passed through the interrogation location of the flow cytometer. In another embodiment, another fraction of the population of cells is stained under a different set of staining conditions and steps (b) through (e) are repeated with that fraction. This process may be performed on two, three, four or any number of additional fractions. In another embodiment, multiple fractions of cells are drawn from the sample at the same time. Each fraction may be stained simultaneously, or each may be stained subsequent to the previous fraction being passed through the flow cytometer. In the former case, each fraction may be stained with its own unique set of staining conditions and step (f) may comprise using the respective CVs to determine a set of staining conditions to be used to stain additional cells. In the later instance, the staining conditions of the subsequently stained fractions may be altered according to the determination of step (f) with respect to a previously analyzed fraction. In one embodiment the process is repeated until the CV is determined to be about equal to or less than a specified CV (e.g., 1.3%).</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0963">Alternatively, once one has predetermined a CV at which an acceptable sorting efficiency will be achieved, the entire cell sample may be stained. A fraction of the cell sample is removed and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. A fluorescence emission characteristic of the fraction is determined and used to classify the cells into two or more sub-populations. The CV of the fluorescence characteristic is determined with respect to the cells of an enriched subpopulation. If the CV of the fluorescence emission characteristic of the cells of the enriched subpopulation is equal to or less than the predetermined CV at which sorting is to occur, then the remainder of the cell sample is thereafter sorted. If the CV of the particular fluorescence emission characteristic of the cells of the enriched subpopulation is greater than the predetermined CV at which sorting is to occur, then a second fraction from the same sample is analyzed in a similar manner and the CV of the same fluorescence characteristic is determined. The CV of the second fraction may be lowered by, for example, increasing the length of the staining period, increasing the concentration of the dye, or any combination thereof. This series of steps (i.e., removal of a fraction from the sample to be sorted and a determination of the CV) is repeated until the CV of the particular fluorescence emission characteristic of the cells of the enriched subpopulation is determined to be equal to or lesser than the predetermined CV. Thereafter, the remained of the sample may be sorted, for example, according to the methods disclosed herein. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the cell sample comprises a semen sample, and the cells of the enriched subpopulation comprise X chromosome bearing cells.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0964">Accordingly, another embodiment of the invention is a process for evaluating a set of conditions for staining a population of cells for sorting, the population comprising a first type and a second type of cell. The process comprises (a) staining a fraction of the population of cells with a fluorescent dye under a set of staining conditions; (b) exposing the stained cells to electromagnetic radiation as the stained cells are passed through an interrogation location of a flow cytometer at a rate, R; (c) determining a fluorescence emission characteristic of the exposed cells; (d) using the determined fluorescence emission characteristic to classify the cells into two or more subpopulations, one of the subpopulations being an enriched subpopulation of the first cell type; (e) determining a coefficient of variation for the fluorescence emission characteristic of the cells of the enriched subpopulation; (f) determining whether to modify any staining condition under which the fraction of cells are to be stained or the rate, R, at which the stained cells are passed through the interrogation location of the flow cytometer; and (g) applying the modified staining condition to the remainder of the population of cells. In another embodiment, steps (a) through (f) are repeated at least once with at least one other fraction of the population of cells. Steps (a) through (f) may be repeated once, twice, three times, four times or a greater number of times. In another embodiment, multiple fractions of cells are drawn from the sample at the same time. Each sample may be stained simultaneously, or each may be stained subsequent to the previous fraction being passed through the flow cytometer. In the later instance, the subsequent staining of the fractions may be altered according to the determination of step (f) with respect to a previously analyzed. In still another embodiment, the process further comprises prior to step (g), selecting the modified staining condition that results in the lowest coefficient of variation for the fluorescence emission characteristic. In yet another embodiment, the process comprises the repetition steps (a) through (e) until the coefficient of variation for the fluorescence emission characteristic of at least one of the fractions is about 1.3% or less. In another embodiment of the invention, the process further comprises prior to step (g), selecting the modified staining condition that results in a coefficient of variation of about 1.3 or less.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0965">In addition to performing such an analysis before sorting the entire sample as detailed above, a similar analysis may be performed while the staining and sorting of the sample is occurring in an effort to ensure that sorting efficiency is maintained. Accordingly, in another embodiment, the CV of a fluorescence emission characteristic of the cells of an enriched subpopulation of a fraction of a sample that has been previously stained, a portion of said sample which is in the process of being sorted, is determined as described above. Adjustments to the staining conditions under which these sample was stained are made according to the methods discussed above with respect to the presort adjustments.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0966">The selection of a predetermined CV at which an acceptable sorting efficiency will be achieved is based upon several factors, including for example, the type of cell being sorted, the rate of sorting, and the degree of purity desired with respect to sorting of the population into enriched subpopulations. Generally, a CV is selected that will allow for sorting to the desired percent purity of the enriched subpopulation while minimizing the amount of time necessary to achieve the same, such as for example, by achieving an 85% degree purity of the enriched subpopulation while minimizing the length of the staining period. With these factors in mind, the CV of the fluorescence emission characteristic of the cells of an enriched subpopulation is generally between about 2.0% and about 1.0%, preferably between about 1.5% and about 1.0%, more preferably about 1.4%, and still more preferably about 1.3%.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0967">M. Critical Slope Difference Feature Extraction</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0968">The microprocessor <b>131</b>&#x2032; with digital signal processing (DSP) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> employed as part of a cell sorter makes it possible to extract features of the time resolved fluorescence emission pulse, particularly features that cannot be easily or inexpensively obtained using analog technology. In particular, a pulse feature which exhibits non-linear properties and which significantly improves the separation and thus the resolution of particles A and B (e.g., improves the discrimination of live, aligned X sperm cells) is a feature referred to as critical slope difference (CSD). CSD is a quantification of the slope of the fluorescence emission pulse at a signal amplitude where the difference between the first derivative of a pulse produced by particle A (e.g., a X-bearing cell) and the first derivative of a pulse produced by particle B (e.g., a Y-bearing cell) approaches a maximum.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0969">Functions that describe fluorescence emission pulses may be expressed in terms of signal amplitude as a function of time: y=x(t). Within the context of detecting CSD features, a function may be defined that describes the fluorescence emission pulses in terms of pulse duration time as a function of signal amplitude. This function may be referred to as an M function. The M function is obtained by transposing the fluorescence emission pulse function as shown below.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">Fluorescence Emission Pulse function: y=x(t)</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0970">M Function: t=M(y)</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0971">t=pulse duration</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0972">y=signal amplitude</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0973">Comparison of the M functions for typical X and Y bovine sperm cells illustrates the discriminating power of the CSD feature. The top panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> shows average M plots for X-bearing and Y-bearing sperm cells. The middle panel in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> shows a graph of the first derivatives of these average M plots (i.e. M&#x2032;) for signal amplitude values less than the peak height of the average Y-bearing fluorescence emission pulse. It can be seen in this plot that as signal amplitude approaches the average peak height of the Y-bearing pulse, the difference between the first derivatives (M&#x2032;<sub>Y </sub>and M&#x2032;<sub>X</sub>) increases significantly. Plotted in the bottom panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> is the difference between the first derivatives (M&#x2032;<sub>X</sub>&#x2212;M&#x2032;<sub>Y</sub>) as a function of signal amplitude. The CSD feature quantifies the slope of M (M&#x2032;) for an individual pulse near the region where the maximum difference in first derivatives occurs (or the slope at a corresponding point on the fluorescence emission pulse function). For the purpose of discriminating X and Y bearing sperm cells, CSD is determined for each pulse at the point where the leading edge of the pulse intersects the CSD threshold, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 62-63</figref>. In some embodiments, CSD may depend upon the characteristics of the illuminating beam such as beam width whether the beam is continuous or pulsed. An algorithm for determining CSD is discussed below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0974"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> illustrates that in some cases the CSD feature has a non-linear nature, such as in the case of sorting X-Y sperm cell populations. The difference between the derivatives (M&#x2032;<sub>X</sub>&#x2212;M&#x2032;<sub>Y</sub>) increases as the CSD threshold approaches the peak of the Y pulse. The nonlinear characteristic of this difference places the mean value of the nonaligned cells and the aligned Y cells 45% lower than the mean value of the aligned X cells in the CSD feature space. The standard deviation in the CSD feature space of the aligned X cells is largely unaffected (i.e. similar to that seen in the peak or area feature spaces). It is this nonlinear, high gain nature of the CSD feature that increases the number of aligned X cells that can be accurately discriminated.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0975">One computationally efficient method for determining the CSD value for a given pulse is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>. A CSD threshold may be determined as a function of a peak height of the fluorescence emission pulses. In particular, it may be determined based on the average peak height of the fluorescence emission pulses. The CSD threshold is maintained at a point where about 25% of the pulse peaks from live, aligned cells fall at or below the threshold. Therefore, the CSD threshold is adjusted dynamically during the sort based on a running peak height distribution (i.e., relative to an average peak height). For example, the threshold may be based on a weighted running average of peak height (with more recent measurements being given more weight than older measurements). The CSD value is the slope of a line that passes through two points on the pulse. These points are the CSD pulse threshold and the pulse peak. Thus, in this embodiment the CSD value is only an approximation of the slope of the pulse waveform <b>497</b> at the intersection of the leading edge of the pulse and the CSD threshold. However, other methods of computing the CSD value for a given pulse are readily apparent, some of which can provide more precise CSD values if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0976">In another embodiment, the CSD threshold is dynamically adjusted as a function of the CV of the CSD feature extraction for a subpopulation of particles. In the case of sorting sperm cells for example, by increasing the CSD threshold from a relatively low level (e.g., the pulse detection threshold) the CSD threshold will reach a level that results in a substantial increase in the CV of the CSD of the Y cells but is still low enough that the increase in the CV of the CSD for the X cells is significantly lower in comparison to the CV increase in the Y cells. This effect can be observed in the CSD distribution as a fanning out of one subpopulation in the overall CSD distribution. Good discrimination from the CSD feature can be achieved by maintaining the CSD threshold at this level.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0977">It should be noted that the discriminating power of the CSD feature is enhanced by use of slit scanning approach to flow cytometry. The shape of the beam spot <b>459</b> can influence the shape of the pulse waveform <b>497</b>. For example, by using a beam spot <b>459</b> having a relatively small width W<b>1</b>, a localized fluorescence difference in a sample particle (e.g., the localized fluorescent intensity difference resulting from localization of the X or Y chromosome in the central region <b>225</b> of a sperm nucleus <b>213</b>) has a greater influence on the first order derivative of the pulse waveform. Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention includes using the slit scanning techniques in combination with CSD feature extraction. Conversely, using a laser having a beam waist that is too large (e.g., equal to or greater than the diameter of the particles) may prevent effective use of the CSD feature to discriminate particles. The acceptable range for the width of the beam waist of the focused illumination beam will depend on a number of factors including the size and shape of the particles, the distribution of dye within the particles being analyzed, and the amount of difference between the typical waveform pulses for the particles to be discriminated. In the case of sperm cells, CSD feature extraction from waveform pulses <b>497</b> generated by excitation of bovine sperm cells <b>201</b> with a laser having a beam waist of less than 3 &#x3bc;m has worked well as indicated below. Of course, CSD feature extraction with any form of slit scanning discussed in the slit scanning section is considered to be within the scope of this aspect of invention.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0978">Use of the CSD feature substantially increases the yield of the system, particularly in the case of sorting X-Y sperm cell populations because it allows collection of many more aligned X cells. Due to the overlap in the populations defined in peak vs. area or rise-time vs. area feature spaces, no more than about 70% of the aligned X cells can be discriminated with a certainty about or greater than 85%. When the CSD feature is used, 95% or more of aligned X cells can be discriminated, which significantly increases the percentage of live X cells that can be collected without reducing the purity of the population of collected X cells below a desired level of purity.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0979">This is seen graphically in the live cell data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66-69</figref>. The non-linear nature of the CSD feature allows X cells to be isolated for sorting. The gross selection on CSD applied in the scatter plot shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref> results in a 70% pure X area population. When bi-variate sort discrimination is applied in the area and CSD feature spaces (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>), &#x3e;95% of the aligned X cells can be discriminated for sorting. The data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66-69</figref> were collected at a total cell throughput of about 22,000 live cells per second on one channel of a four-channel cytometry system (see multi-channel system discussion below). Even with coincidence detection enabled (high purity), over 6,000 X cells per second were collected at a purity level of at least 85% purity.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0980"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66-69</figref> illustrate one advantage of the CSD feature when used to discriminate X-bearing and Y-bearing sperm cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66 and 67</figref> are histograms of the area feature of the fluorescence emission pulses for the feature space defined in the scatter plots shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 68 and 69</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, the CSD feature has moved most of the non-aligned and aligned Y cells completely out of the display of the scatter plot. This leaves a 70% pure X population in the frame of the scatter plot, which is what is shown in the pulse area histogram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>. Non-CSD discrimination is shown in the pulse area/rise time scatter plot shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref>. Aligned X cells make up about 30% of the corresponding area histogram (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>). More than 95% of the aligned X cells can be collected at &#x3e;85% purity using the CSD feature for discrimination. By comparison, no more than 70% of the aligned X cells can be discriminated using the traditional feature space on the right.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0981">Several live cell sorts have been completed using the CSD vs. pulse area, bi-variate discrimination technique. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref> is an example of how a sort region set in this two dimensional feature space can be used to exclude non-aligned cells and Y cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref> illustrates a bi-variate sort region set on a scatter plot of CSD vs. pulse area scatter. Notice how the sort region drops lower on the area feature for high values of CSD (CSD increase from left to right and area increases from bottom to top) and moves higher on the area feature as CSD drops to lower values. The bi-variate sort region set on the above CSD vs. pulse area scatter plot was used to sort X cells at a sort decision rate &#x3e;6000 X cells per second with a input live cell rate of 26,000 cells per second. Purity based on flow cytometry re-analysis was 87%.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0982">The CSD feature makes possible a high yield, no-coincidence abort (i.e., coincident accept or high recovery) sorting strategy. In some embodiments, a pulse feature could provide nearly baseline separation and thus 100% accurate classification of live X and Y sperm cells. This condition would make it possible to sort cells at reasonably high rates without aborting droplets that contain both a cell classified as X and non-X (either unknown or Y). This sorting strategy is referred to as the high recovery or coincidence accept strategy. An experiment was performed to test this using the CSD feature. Coincidence accept sorts were performed with an input rate of 12,000 live X cells per second on one channel of a four-channel flow cytometer. 77% of the X cells were properly aligned, making 4,600 X cells per second potentially available for sorting. Under these conditions, 4,300 cells per second were sorted into the population of X cells. Subsequent purity analysis indicated a purity from this sort of &#x3e;87% without correction for dead cells and 89% with correction for dead cells. A high purity, coincidence reject detection sort was performed immediately after this sort under the same conditions. A collection rate of 3200-3500 cells per second was observed. Purity analysis indicated a purity of 92% without correction for dead cells and a purity of 94% with dead cell correction.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0983">The results of the above experiment indicate that at 12,000 live cells per second input, &#x3e;92% of aligned X cells can be collected at a purity &#x3e;85%. This is an indication that the CSD feature provides 95% accurate classification of all aligned X cells. Under these circumstances, yield from the cell sorter is limited primarily by correct cell alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0984"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref> illustrates one embodiment of flow cytometry re-analyses for a test in which the left panel corresponds to the high recovery/coincident accept sort strategy (no coincidence abort strategy) and the right panel corresponds to the high purity/coincident reject sort strategy (coincident abort strategy). The left panel (87% pure) was for an output of 4,400 X cells per second without coincidence aborts. The right panel was from a sort completed under the same conditions except droplets containing contaminating cells were aborted. Purity for this sort was about 92%. These sorts demonstrate that high recovery, no coincidence abort sorts are possible when the CSD feature is used for discrimination.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0985">Use of the CSD feature is not limited to sorting of sperm cells or any particular species of sperm cells. As those skilled in the art will appreciate from the foregoing disclosure, the CSD feature can be adapted to improve discrimination between any groups of particles that generate signal pulses having different first order derivative characteristics regardless of the cause of the difference.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0986">N. Discrimination</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0987">Once the features of the pulses have been extracted by pulse analysis software <b>749</b>, discrimination (e.g., classification) of pulses is accomplished by pulse discrimination software <b>757</b> executed by processor <b>867</b> employing a logic application such as Bayes Minimum Risk decision rule. This rule is a modification of a Bayes Minimum Error decision rule that allows assignment (and adjustment for) differing costs associated with making different erroneous classification (e.g., discrimination) decisions.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0988">Bayes Minimum Error computes the decision boundary <b>763</b> or decision surface as the surface of equal a posteriori probability between populations in feature space. For the case of (assumed) Gaussian probability distributions this surface is in general quadratic, although in certain conditions may be linear (or be able to be closely approximated by a hyper-plane). The classification (e.g., discrimination) decision is made by first computing the a posteriori probabilities for a given point in feature space (generally from class-conditional probability densities and known/assumed a priori population probabilities using Bayes Rule) then choosing the class label as that of the population having the highest a posteriori probability.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0989">Bayes Minimum Risk includes a factor to allow adjustment of the decision boundary <b>763</b> in the case when it is desired to assign different costs for making different classification errors (e.g. it may be costlier to classify &#x201c;Y&#x201d; cells as &#x201c;X&#x201d; cells than vice versa). In this application, this allows a trade-off between sorted sample purity and recovery. In this decision rule, the &#x201c;risk&#x201d; of assigning each possible class label to a point in feature space is computed as the sum of the a posteriori probabilities of membership in each population times the cost associated with classifying as the current population given true membership in each other population. Table 6 summarizes the procedure for Bayes Minimum Error classification. Note that for multi-variate Gaussian densities, evaluation of Bayes rule to obtain the a posteriori probabilities may be reduced to evaluation of the quadratic function seen in Table VII, given that the coefficients W, w, and w<sub>o</sub>, are as computed in the discrimination algorithm parameter initialization procedure given in Table 3. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref> shows a graphical example of classification by this procedure. The illustration on the left is a schematic illustration of the two populations <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and the decision boundary <b>763</b> separating the populations. The histogram on the right shows two concentric sets of ellipses defining the X and Y regions, with the decision boundary <b>763</b> being a line defined by the intersection of the ellipses.</p>

<p id="p-0389" num="0994">The fourth, sort processor <b>873</b> manages droplet classification, implements sorting strategy and delivers a sort trigger pulse <b>853</b> that is synchronized with the droplet selected for sorting. This processor <b>873</b> receives cell classification information from the discrimination processor <b>867</b> and relates that information to the droplet generation clock <b>703</b> (i.e. aligns the position of particles classified for sorting into a population with the formation of droplets). It determines if there is coincidence within a droplet and manages that coincidence based on pre-determined sort strategies. It maintains a FIFO of all cell classifications and droplet sort decisions that sets the correct delay between when the particle was observed in real time and when the particle arrives at the last attached droplet. It will produce a properly timed output pulse <b>853</b> of appropriate polarity and amplitude for each droplet selected for sorting.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0995">In general, the A/D converter <b>689</b> converts the analog output signals <b>701</b> from the photodetector <b>117</b> into corresponding digital information <b>707</b> indicative of characteristic A or characteristic B (e.g., X or &#x2dc;X). The digital signal processor <b>867</b> discriminates the digital information <b>707</b> as indicative of characteristic A or as indicative of characteristic B (e.g., X or &#x2dc;X) and provides a sorting signal <b>853</b> to the sorting system <b>119</b> as a function of the discriminated digital information.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0996">In general, the digital signal processors <b>863</b>, <b>865</b>, <b>867</b>, <b>873</b> include instructions for detecting waveform pulses represented by the digital information, instructions for extracting features in the detected pulses and instructions for discriminating the detected pulses as a function of their extracted features. In addition, the processors include instructions for defining a decision boundary <b>763</b> discriminating between the extracted features representing characteristics A and the extracted features representing characteristic B. Further, the processors <b>863</b>, <b>865</b>, <b>867</b>, <b>873</b> may optionally adjust the relative location of the decision boundary <b>763</b> with respect to the extracted features representing characteristic A and with respect to the extracted features representing characteristic B as a function of at least one of the following: (1) the purity of the at least one population with respect to either characteristic A particles or characteristic B particles, and (2) the quantity of characteristic A particles or characteristic B particles in the at least one population relative to the total quantity of characteristic A particles or characteristic B particles in the stream. For example, the processor may move the decision boundary <b>763</b> to include less of population <b>1</b> and more of population <b>2</b>, or visa versa, based on the output of a particular sample or based on the desired output (e.g., as noted above with respect to the Bayes Minimum Risk decision rule to adjust the decision boundary for differing costs).</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0997">P. Drift Compensation</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0998">Given that over time the waveform pulses corresponding to the fluorescence emissions may vary or exhibit drift over time (due to staining variations, temperature change, sample age and/or other factors, for example), the system may optionally employ drift analysis software <b>761</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>) defining dynamic thresholds which vary to compensate for any effects of drift. In particular, the pulse detection thresholds employed by software <b>747</b> may be adjusted for any slow variations in the signal background characteristics, and the discrimination algorithm of software <b>757</b> may adjust the decision boundary <b>763</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>) to account for any drift in the populations in feature space.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0999">In the case of the algorithm(s) employed by pulse detection software <b>747</b>, the drift compensation software <b>761</b> accomplishes drift compensation by updating the background mean and standard deviation estimates based on sample statistics estimates computed within a moving window of a given length of samples (e.g., 10-100 samples) ending with the current sample. Given the (assumed) slow drift rate relative to the data acquisition frequency, the background statistics need not be updated every sample; rather, background statistic updates may occur periodically (e.g., every 6 seconds; see reference character <b>795</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>). Additionally, the window may contain less than unity weighting to allow a &#x201c;forgetting&#x201d; rate to de-weight older samples relative to newer samples in the statistics computations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref> illustrates the concept of statistic (mean) computation within a moving window without and with a &#x201c;forgetting&#x201d; rate.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="1000">Similar to the detection algorithm drift compensation, the discrimination algorithm(s) employed by pulse discrimination software <b>757</b> achieve drift compensation by periodic updates of the 2<sup>nd </sup>order statistics of the populations in feature space. In this case, however, only those feature values from pulses assigned to a given population are used to update the statistics of that population. Again, non-unity weighting may be used to include a &#x201c;forgetting&#x201d; rate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> shows a conceptual illustration of the effects of applying this technique to populations in feature space. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> illustrates an example of drift compensation for population statistics in feature space. Yellow denotes population <b>1</b> (X), green population <b>2</b> (Y), diamonds the class mean estimates (with an exaggerated illustration of drift), and block arrows changes in the population covariance estimates reflected in deformation of the constant-sigma ellipses.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="1001">In general, the digital signal processor <b>863</b> employs a detection threshold for analyzing the digital information, which threshold is a function of a background mean estimate and a standard deviation of the sampled time-varying output signals computed within a moving window of samples ending with the current sample.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="1002">Q. Advantage of all Digital</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="1003">Techniques Over Analog Techniques</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="1004">One of the main advantages for using an all digital system for sorting is that there is no &#x201c;dead time&#x201d; associated with the detection and analysis of a pulse. With analog systems there is always a finite &#x201c;switching time&#x201d; required for electronics to reset after the occurrence and detection of a pulse. This time is usually on the order of at least one microsecond. Since the digital system captures a continuous stream it really has no dead time.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="1005">Another advantage of a digital system is the ability to look forward and backward in time around a pulse classified for sorting. In general, the digital signal processing requires about five (5) droplet periods for analysis. Preferably, the time delay between droplet illumination <b>115</b> and droplet formation <b>107</b> is about seven (7) droplet periods. This allows the system to classify a particular particle based on the probability that it will contaminate the usable population as indicated by the features of the particular particle and based on the proximity of the particular particle to another classified particle. As an example, the sort processor <b>873</b> may reject a particle viewed as having a 50% probability of being a live X cell whereas the sort processor <b>873</b> may accept a particle viewed as having a 50% probability of being a live X cell when the particle is coincident with a second particle viewed as having a 95% probability of being a live X cell.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="1006">R. Analog Cell Analysis</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="1007">It is also contemplated that the time-varying output signals from the photodetector may be processed by analog circuitry <b>819</b>, such as a field programmable gate array, which may be less expensive than a digital cell analyzer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of an analog cell analyzer which may be employed as part of the system according to the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> graphically illustrates the analog analysis. A threshold is set to produce a trigger based on pulse height. The threshold opens an integration window which gates an analog integrator to accumulate charge. The window remains open either for a fixed period or until the pulse amplitude fall below the trigger threshold. In this way, only the area of the portion of the pulse within the integration window is used for relative fluorescence measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="1008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, the output <b>701</b> of the photodetector <b>117</b> is supplied to an integrator <b>825</b> which integrates the output signal <b>701</b> in synchronization with the droplet clock <b>703</b>. The integrated signal is provided to a width/area comparator <b>827</b> for comparing the level of the integrated signal to a threshold level defining a pulse (e.g., a pulse may be defined as an integrated signal with 40% of certain a certain threshold.). A dynamic threshold calculator <b>829</b> functions similarly to the drift compensation noted above in that monitors the integrated signal level and it varies the threshold level which the width/area comparator uses as a function of variations in the average integrated signal level.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="1009">The pulse discriminated signal is provided to a window comparator <b>837</b> to confirm that the pulse area is within an acceptable range. The pulse discriminated signal is also provided to a pulse width and trigger logic circuit <b>839</b> to confirm that the pulse width is within an acceptable range. If the area and width are acceptable, the logic provides a trigger signal to an I/O controller <b>843</b> which indicates the sort decision <b>841</b>. Thus, the window comparator <b>837</b> and the pulse width and trigger logic <b>839</b> make the decision as to whether a cell should be classified as an X cell or a &#x2dc;X cell.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="1010">The I/O controller <b>843</b> provides the sort decision <b>841</b> to the sort controller board <b>847</b> in the form of a X or &#x2dc;X signal. The I/O controller <b>843</b> also includes a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface <b>849</b> for connecting to the PC <b>735</b> and may have I/O port for connecting to slave controllers <b>845</b> of the other channels. The analog cell analyzer also includes a Joint Test Access Group (JTAG) port <b>833</b> for programming the width/area, comparator, the window comparator and the pulse width and trigger logic.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="1011">It is also contemplated that the analog cell analyzer may be employed simultaneously with the digital cell analyzer <b>705</b>. For example, the analog analyzer may be used to adjust voltage thresholds used by the digital analyzer. On the other hand, the digital analyzer may be used to identify various features of the pulse and this feature information may be used to configure the analog cell analyzer, particularly if it is implemented with a gate array.</p>
<p id="h-0037" num="0000">Control Strategies</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="1012">In general, the microprocessor <b>131</b> is programmed to implement control and sorting strategies which are intended to optimize the efficiency of the system <b>1</b> in terms of throughput and/or loss of desirable particles to meet any cost requirements of the sorted product. This may involve, for example, balancing the need for high purity of at least one collected population and the need to recover at least a minimum percentage of desirable particles from the sample being sorted. Achieving such a balance is important, particularly in the context of commercial applications where cost and profitability are important considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="1013">To this end, the microprocessor <b>131</b> implements a control strategy which is a series of instructions and/or algorithms that control system variables such as fluid delivery rate and/or sort parameters. The microprocessor also implements a sorting strategy which defines the decision process for determining how each particle or group of particles is sorted. Each particular control strategy may employ one or more sort strategies. Various sorting strategies may be used depending on such factors as the selected control strategy, the particle detection system and/or information relating to the particle distribution in the fluid stream.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="1014">Regarding particle distribution, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref> illustrates a fluid stream containing an exemplary distribution of particles. In this particular example, the stream is formed by a nozzle similar to the nozzle described above and contains a mixture of particles having different characteristics A and B, e.g., X and Y sperm cells. As shown, the cells follow generally one after another in a series which can be viewed as comprising sequential sets of particles. These sets include first particle sets each comprising one or more particles having a characteristic A (e.g., indicating a live X sperm cell), second particle sets each comprising one or more particles having a characteristic B (e.g., indicating a Y sperm cell or, more generally, a sperm cell which is not a live X cell (&#x2dc;X), such as a Y cell, or a dead X or Y cell), and third particle sets each comprising two or more closely spaced particles at least one of which has characteristic A and at least one of which has characteristic B (e.g., one more X sperm cells and one or more &#x2dc;X sperm cells). Third particle sets are also hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;coincident&#x201d; particle sets.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="1015">Whether a particular particle is considered as constituting a set by itself or part of another set will depend primarily on its spatial position and/or separation relative to adjacent particles. For example, in a droplet sorting system, the various particle sets will be defined by the particles in the droplets. In a photo-damage sorting system where a laser is used to ablate (kill or otherwise damage) selected particle sets to provide a collected population having a desired content, as discussed below in the &#x201c;Photo-Damage Sorting&#x201d; section, the various particle sets will be defined by the spatial proximity of the particles, i.e., whether the spatial separation between particles is sufficient to enable accurate classification of the particles and/or the ablation of one or more undesired particles by the laser without also ablating one or more desired particles. Similarly, in a fluid-switching sorting system where portions of the stream containing selected particles are diverted to provide a collected population having a desired content, as is discussed below in the &#x201c;Fluid Switching Sorting&#x201d; system, the various particle sets will be defined by the spatial proximity of the particles, i.e., whether the spatial separation between particles is sufficient to enable accurate classification of the particles and/or diversion of selected particles.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="1016">It will be observed from the foregoing that sort decision applied to the different particle sets may be varied, depending on the desired result or throughput of the system. For example, in a droplet sorting system, the sorting strategy used may depend on the treatment of &#x201c;coincident&#x201d; droplets, i.e., droplets containing third particle sets. In the handling of bovine sperm cells in a flow cytometry droplet sorting system and method as described herein, for example, to enhance the number of X sperm cells in at least one collected population, it may be desirable to use a strategy where each coincident droplet containing an X sperm cell is accepted and sorted as if it contained only X sperm cells, even though the droplet may also contain an &#x2dc;X sperm cell (coincident accept strategy). On the other hand, to enhance the purity of X sperm cells collected in the stated population, it may be desirable to reject each coincident droplet containing a &#x2dc;X sperm cell even though the same droplet may also contain an X sperm cell (coincident reject strategy). In general, as will be pointed out below, there are many control strategies which may be employed to maximize particle throughput and there are many sorting strategies that may by employed with each particular control strategy. The strategies can be applied to various sorting techniques using flow cytometry, such as droplet sorting, photo-damage sorting, and fluid-switching sorting. Further, the above strategies can be used to sort any type of particle according to any desired characteristic or characteristics of the particle.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="1017">According to one embodiment, the microprocessor controls the rate at which the fluid delivery system delivers the fluid containing the particles as a function of other variables of the system. For example, the microprocessor can the control the fluid delivery rate as a function of a desired output result. Since the microprocessor determines the identity of each particle and determines whether such is directed to at least one collected population, the microprocessor can determine and control the output result by varying the control strategy and/or by varying the sorting strategy. A desired output result may generally be defined as at least one of the following: (1) the purity of at least one collected population with respect to characteristic A particles or characteristic B particles (&#x201c;high recovery&#x201d;), and (2) the quantity of characteristic A particles in the stated population relative to the total quantity of characteristic A particles in the stream, or the quantity of characteristic B particles in the stated population relative to the total quantity of characteristic B particles in the stream (&#x201c;high purity&#x201d;). As another example, the system may employ a substantially constant fluid delivery rate and the microprocessor can the control the sort parameters as a function of a desired output result. In this latter example, the desired output result may generally be defined as a combination of (1) the purity of the particles in at least one collected population and (2) the quantity of desired particles available in the stream but not included in the stated population (&#x201c;constant flow rate&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="1018">In general, it my be assumed that when sorting two populations an identified cell could have a 50/50 probability of being part of one population or the other. However, it is also contemplated that an unidentified cell may in fact have some other probability other than a 50/50 probability of being part of one population or the other. This other probability may be determined by empirical analysis or from other characteristics regarding the sample being sorted.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="1019">Several different control strategies are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="1020">A. High Recovery Control Strategy</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="1021">One type of control strategy may be referred to as a &#x201c;high recovery&#x201d; control strategy. The objective of this strategy is to maximize the number of desired particles sorted into the population of desired particles as long as the purity of that population is at or above an acceptable purity.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="1022">Pursuant to this strategy, the first particle sets described above are sorted into the population of desired particles because each of these sets contains one or more particles having a desired characteristic A. The third particle sets are also sorted into the population of desired particles (coincident accept) because each of these sets also contains one or more particles having a desired characteristic A, albeit accompanied by one more particles having characteristic B. On the other hand, the second particle sets are rejected (i.e., not sorted into the population of desired particles) because they do not contain a particle having the desired characteristic. To optimize throughput using this strategy, the microprocessor increases the fluid delivery rate as long as the purity of the collected population is at or above an acceptable level. Stated in the converse, the fluid delivery rate is increased as long as the probable level of contamination of the population of desired particles is at or below an acceptable level.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="1023">As an example, consider the use of a high recovery control strategy for sorting X and Y sperm cells in the fluid stream of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref>. The desired result may be to sort all of the X cells into a population of X cells so long as the population remains at or above an acceptable purity, e.g., so long as X/(X+Y) is greater than 85% or some other acceptable level. To obtain this result, the first particles sets are sorted into a population of X cells because they contain only one or more X cells. The third particle sets are also sorted into the population of X cells because they also contain one or more X cells, even though they may also contain a Y (or &#x2dc;X) cell. The second particle sets are sorted into some other population because they do not contain one or more X cells. In this example, the rate at which the fluid delivery system delivers the fluid containing the cells to the nozzle would continue to be increased as long as the purity of the population of X cells is greater than 85%. Conversely, if the purity of the population of X cells falls below 85%, the fluid delivery rate is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="1024">In the context of a droplet sorting system, it is known from Poisson's equation that for any given droplet generation rate, the number of multiple-cell droplets will increase as the cell delivery rate increases. In other words, increasing the delivery rate of fluid containing the cells will increase the number of multiple-cell droplets. Therefore, if the coincident accept sorting strategy is used and coincident droplets containing third particle sets are sorted into the population of desired particles, increasing the fluid delivery rate will result in a decrease in the purity of the collected population because at higher fluid delivery rates more coincident droplets are being generated and collected. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref> illustrates this result for a two (2) particle fluid so that 100% of the desired particles are captured. As shown, at very low fluid delivery rates (FDR along x axis), the purity (y axis) of the resulting collected population is very high because very few coincident droplets containing third particle sets are being generated and collected. As the fluid delivery rate increases (FOR increases to the right along the x axis), the percentage of coincident droplets generated increases resulting in more coincident droplets being collected and reducing purity of the usable population (along the y axis). In the specific example illustrated, the fluid delivery rate is 30K particles/second at about 80% purity.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="1025">The results of using a high recovery strategy can be dramatic, as illustrated by a simple example where X and Y sperm cells are sorted using a droplet sorting process. Assume, for example that droplets are generated at a rate of 60K/sec, and that sperm cells are delivered to the interrogation location at a rate of 30K/sec. According to Poisson's equation, if all droplets containing X cells are sorted into the population of X cells, including coincident droplets containing X and Y cells, about 15,000 X cells will be collected every second. The collected population will include about 2,600 Y cells, reducing the purity of the population with respect to X cells to about 85.2%. However, the number of collected X cells (15,000) represents a substantial increase relative to a strategy where coincident droplets are not collected, as in the high purity strategy or mode discussed below. In the high purity mode, operating at a droplet frequency of 40K/sec and cell delivery rate of 40K/sec (10K cells/sec more than in the high recovery mode example above), only about 11,800 X cells are collected every second, or about 3,800 X cells less than in the high recovery strategy. Further, when the high purity strategy is used, about 9,200 X cells are lost or wasted because coincident droplets are not sorted into the population of X cells. Therefore, if less than 100% purity is acceptable, it may be desirable to use the high recovery mode to increase the number of X cells collected or, stated conversely, to decrease the number of X cells lost.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="1026">In summary, in the high recovery control strategy using the coincident accept sorting strategy, the particle delivery rate is inversely related to the purity of the collected population of desired particles (sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;usable&#x201d; population).</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="1027">B. High Purity Control Strategy</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="1028">A second type of control strategy may be referred to as a &#x201c;high purity&#x201d; control strategy. The objective of this strategy is to maintain the purity of the collected population with respect to particles having a desired characteristic at high level, so long as the quantity of desired particles in the collected population relative to the total number of desired particles available in the stream is at or above an acceptable quantity (i.e., so long as the quantity of desired particles in the stream which are not collected remains below an acceptable quantity). Pursuant to this strategy, the first particle sets described above are sorted into the population of desired particles because each of these sets contains one or more particles having a desired characteristic A, and because these sets contain no contaminating particles. On the other hand, the second and third particle sets are sorted into one or more &#x201c;unusuable&#x201d; populations (coincident reject) because they contain contaminating particles (i.e., characteristic B particles). To optimize throughput using this &#x201c;high purity&#x201d; strategy, the microprocessor increases the fluid delivery rate as long as the quantity of desired particles that are sorted into the usable population relative to the total number of desired particles available in the stream remains at or above an acceptable quantity.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="1029">As an example, consider the use of a high purity control strategy for sorting X and Y sperm cells in the fluid stream of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref>. The desired result may be to sort all of the X cells in a into a population of X cells so long as the quantity of X cells collected from the stream remains at or above an acceptable quantity, e.g., at least 60%. To obtain this result, the first particles sets are sorted into the usable population because they contain only one or more X cells. On the other hand, the second and third particle sets are sorted into one or more unusable populations because they contain one or more contaminating (&#x2dc;X) cells. In this example, the rate at which the fluid delivery system delivers the fluid containing the cells to the nozzle would continue to be increased as long as the quantity of X cells collected in the usable population as a percentage of the total available quantity of X cells that have been sorted remains at or above 60%. Conversely, if the quantity of X cells not collected in the usable population rises above 40% of the total number of available X cells that have been sorted, the fluid delivery rate is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="1030">As noted above in the context of a droplet sorting system, it is known that increasing the fluid delivery rate will increase the number of multiple-cell droplets, and thus the number of coincident droplets containing third particle sets. Since coincident droplets are not sorted into the population of collected X cells when using a coincident reject sorting strategy, this means that increasing the fluid delivery rate will result in a increase in the quantity of live X cells lost to the unusable population.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="1031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref> illustrates this result for a two (2) particle fluid so that the usable population has 100% purity of desired particles. As shown, at very low fluid delivery rates (FDR along x axis), the percentage of desired particles in the usable population is very high because very few coincident droplets are being generated and rejected. As the fluid delivery rate increases (FDR increases to the right along the x axis), the percentage of coincident droplets containing third particle sets increases and more such sets are rejected. This reduces the quantity of desired particles that are sorted into the usable population relative to the total quantity of desired particles available in the stream (i.e., the percentage of desired particles from the stream which are collected in the usable population). In the specific example illustrated, the fluid delivery rate is about 40K particles/second and about 75% of the desired particles are sorted into the usable population.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="1032">In summary, in the high purity control strategy implementing the coincident reject sorting strategy, the particle delivery rate is inversely related to the percentage of desired particles in the collected population (i.e., high purity of desired particles in the usable population).</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="1033">C. Constant Flow Rate Control Strategy</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="1034">A third type of control strategy may be referred to as a constant flow rate control strategy. In this strategy, the microprocessor maintains the fluid delivery rate constant (or within a constant range) and varies the percentage of collected (or rejected) coincident droplets as long as the purity of at least one collected population is at or above an acceptable level and as long as the quantity of desired particles in that population is at or above an acceptable quantity relative to a total quantity of desired particles that have been processed. Stated in the converse, the fluid delivery rate is constant and the percentage of accepted (or rejected) coincident droplets varies as long as the probable level of contamination of the usable population is at or below an acceptable level of purity and as long as the probable quantity of desired particles that is lost to a population other than the stated (usable) population is at or below an acceptable quantity.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="1035">As an example, consider the use of a constant flow rate control strategy for sorting the fluid stream shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref>. The desired result may be to sort X sperm cells into a usable population having a purity of at least 85% and to collect at least 60% of the X cells in the stream so that no more than 40% of the X cells are sorted into the unusable population. In this example, the rate at which the fluid delivery system delivers the particles would be maintained constant and the percent of collected or rejected third particle sets (coincident sets) would be varied as long as the purity of the usable population with respect to X cells is equal to or greater than 85%, and as long as the percentage of X cells sorted into the unusable population is less than 40% so that the percentage of desired particles sorted into the usable population is equal to or greater than 60% (variable coincident accept sorting strategy). As the percentage of accepted third particle sets increases, the purity of the usable population decreases, but the quantity of desired particles (e.g., X cells) sorted into the unusable population decreases. Conversely, as the percentage of accepted third particle sets decreases, the purity of the usable population increases, but the quantity of desired particles (e.g., X cells) that are sorted in the unusable population increases.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="1036">As noted above, it is known from Poisson's equation that the number of multiple-cell droplets (and thus the number of coincident droplets containing third particle sets) is constant for a constant fluid (cell) delivery rate. Since the number of coincident droplets is constant in this control strategy, the percentage of coincident droplets sorted into the usable population will impact both the purity of the usable population and the quantity of X cells that are wasted by being sorted into an unusable population. This is because the percent of unwanted Y (or &#x2dc;X) cells in coincident droplets which are accepted and sorted into the collected unusable population is inversely related to the percent of X cells in coincident droplets which are rejected and thus not sorted into the collected usable population.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="1037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref> illustrates the constant fluid delivery rate control strategy in a flow cytometry droplet sorting system and method as described herein implementing a variable coincident reject sorting strategy for a two (2) particle fluid. As shown, line OL illustrates the inverse relationship between the percentage of rejected coincident droplets (x axis) compared to the percentage of accepted coincident droplets (y axis). When there is a very low percentage of accepted coincident droplets, there is a very high percentage of rejected coincident droplets. Conversely, when there is a very high percentage of accepted coincident droplets, there is a very low percentage of rejected coincident droplets. Line OL illustrates this inverse relationship and represents the operating line of the variable coincident accept sorting strategy at a given constant particle flow rate. At point P in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref> along operating line OL, the purity of the usable population is a given percentage depending on particle flow rate, e.g., 85% purity. As the percentage of accepted coincident droplets increases (to the left and upward) along operating line OL, the number of undesired particles that are sorted into the usable population increases and the purity drops below 85%, which may be unacceptable. As the percentage of accepted coincident droplets decreases (to the right and downward) along operating line OL, the purity goes above 85% and is acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="1038">At point LL along operating line OL, 75% of the coincident droplets are rejected (i.e., sorted into the unusable population) so that the percentage of desired particles that are wasted by being sorted into the unusable population is a given percentage based on the particle delivery rate, e.g., 40%. As the percentage of rejected coincident droplets increases (to the right and downward) along operating line OL, the percentage of desired particles that are sorted into in the usable population decreases (e.g., to &#x3c;60%), which may be unacceptable. As the percentage of rejected coincident droplets (to the left and upward) along operating line OL, the percentage of desired particles sorted into the usable population increases (e.g., to &#x3e;60%) and is acceptable. Thus, according to this aspect of the invention for a constant flow rate control strategy implementing a variable coincident accept sorting strategy, the microprocessor may operate the system so the percentage of accepted and rejected coincident droplets varies in an operating range between point P<b>1</b> and LL as indicated by arrow OR. Note that operating range OR may encompass more or less of the operating line, depending on the level of tolerance for impurity and loss of desired particles to the unusable population.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="1039">In summary, in the constant flow rate control strategy using the variable coincident accept sorting strategy, the percentage of third particle sets which are accepted is inversely related to the purity of the usable population and inversely related to the quantity of desired particles wasted by being sorted to a unusable population.</p>

<p id="p-0438" num="1043">Relatedly, a sorted sample obtained using one of the above control strategies can be combined with a second sample to obtain a final (e.g., commercial) sample having the desired characteristics. For example, a sample sorted according to the high purity strategy to produce a 100% pure population can be combined with a population of the same volume sorted to 80% purity to produce a final sample having a purity of 90%. Or in the case of animal sperm sorted to a high purity, an aliquot amount of the sorted sperm can be combined with an aliquot amount of unsorted sperm to produce a final sample of desired purity at lower cost than sorting the entire amount of sperm using any of the above sorting methods.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="1044">The above description of the control strategies assumes accurate identification and sorting of each droplet including each coincident droplet. In practice, 100% accuracy is not possible for any number of reasons. In order to minimize contamination, therefore, it may be desirable to reject particles which cannot be classified with certainty as belonging to the desired population. On the other hand, if certain particles can be identified and classified as being in the desired population within a certain selected probability (e.g., greater than 50% in the case of sperm cells), it may be desirable to classify the particles as belonging to the desired population so that they are not lost to the unusable population. Thus, as discussed earlier, particles such as sperm cells may be accepted or rejected for sorting into a population of desired cells based on the probability that such particles belong in the usable population.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="1045">The terms &#x201c;usable&#x201d; and &#x201c;unusable&#x201d; as used in the above table and this application are used for convenience only and are not intended to be limiting in any way. Thus, a &#x201c;usable&#x201d; population includes any &#x201c;first&#x201d; population, regardless of how or whether it is used, and an &#x201c;unusable&#x201d; population includes any &#x201c;second&#x201d; population different from the usable population, regardless of how or whether it is used. Similarly, a &#x201c;desired&#x201d; population means any population which is sorted according to selected particle characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="1046">The microprocessor and its signal processing software constitutes a system for processing the electrical signals from the photodetector to classify particles (e.g., particles in general and sperm particles in particular) according to characteristics of the particles and to obtain information relating to the distribution of the particles as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref>. Furthermore, the microprocessor constitutes a control system responsive to the signal processing software for varying the rate at which the fluid delivery system delivers particles to the nozzle system as a function of the obtained information relating to the distribution of the particles. Furthermore, the microprocessor constitutes a control system responsive to the signal processing software for varying the sorting strategy as a function of the obtained information relating to the distribution of the particles.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="1047">In general, the microprocessor constitutes a control system responsive to information received from the flow cytometry apparatus for controlling the sorting system to vary its sorting strategy or for controlling the fluid delivery system. In other words, the microprocessor is capable of operating in a first mode to vary the sorting strategy, is capable of operating in a second mode for controlling the fluid delivery system, is capable of operating in a third mode to vary the sorting strategy and for controlling the fluid delivery system, and may be capable of operating in other modes. When operating in the first or third mode, the microprocessor is capable of varying the rate at which fluid is delivered as a function of at least one of the following: (1) the purity of the at least one population with respect to either characteristic A particles or characteristic B particles, and (2) the quantity of characteristic A particles or characteristic B particles in the at least one population relative to the total quantity of characteristic A particles or characteristic B particles in the stream.</p>
<p id="h-0038" num="0000">Collection System</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="1048">A collection system is needed to collect the droplets after they pass between the deflector plates. The collection system for a conventional cytometer may be no more than collection vessels disposed to catch the droplets in the various droplet streams after they pass between the deflection plates. Similar conventional collection systems can be used in some embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="1049">However, it may be difficult to use a conventional collection system in embodiments of the present invention in which the nozzle is oriented to direct the fluid stream at an upward angle, thereby giving the droplets a horizontal velocity component. One issue is that the droplets would travel some horizontal distance along their arched trajectories before they begin downward movement that would be suitable for landing in a collection vessel. For example, if the nozzle is pointed upward at a range of 45&#xb0; to 60&#xb0; and the droplets exit at a velocity between 15 m/s and 20 m/s, the droplets will be a horizontal distance of several meters away from the nozzle before they reach the apex of their trajectories and begin downward movement. Thus, a good deal of lab space would be occupied by the droplet streams. Furthermore, at a range of several meters it could also be difficult to make sure the droplets land in the proper collection vessels. The trajectories of the droplet streams can change whenever one or more operating conditions for the cytometer change (e.g., adjustment to the fluid delivery rate resulting in a change in the fluid velocity at the nozzle orifice). Changes in the trajectories of the droplet streams will be magnified by the distance that the droplets travel. Thus, changes in the trajectories that do not result in an appreciable change in droplet location at a point relatively near the nozzle could result in a significant change in location of the droplets at a location that is farther away from the nozzle. As discussed above, some embodiments of the present invention employ feedback to the droplet formation and/or sample fluid delivery systems that could result in droplet streams that constantly alter their trajectories. One may also want to vary the pressure at which the sheath fluid is delivered to the nozzle. Air currents, temperature variations, and humidity variations could also alter the trajectories of the droplet streams. Any factor that could change the trajectory of the droplet streams could also require the collection vessels to be repositioned so the droplets land in the appropriate collection vessels. In contrast, the trajectories of droplets streams in a conventional cytometer having a downward pointing nozzle are less susceptible to variation. For example, the fact that the droplet streams have a substantially downward initial velocity means that variation in fluid velocity at the orifice does not result in any significant variation in the trajectories. Furthermore, the collection vessels are relatively close to the nozzle which makes the collection system more tolerant to trajectory variations in the droplet streams.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="1050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 83-85</figref> show one embodiment of a collection system, generally designated <b>2201</b>, that may be used to collect sorted droplets in a system of the present invention. The collection system is particularly suited for collection of droplets <b>33</b> when the cytometer nozzle system <b>101</b> is oriented to direct the fluid stream <b>21</b> at an upward angle or any other angle having a horizontal component. As the droplets pass between the deflector plates <b>629</b>, they are sorted into multiple droplet streams <b>123</b>, <b>125</b> (e.g., two) having different arched trajectories. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 84 and 85</figref>, the trajectory of each droplet stream leads to one of two droplet intercepting devices <b>2203</b>. If the droplets are being sorted into more than two droplets streams, a separate intercepting device would need to be provided for each additional droplet stream. Thus, the number of intercepting devices in a collection system of the present invention will depend on the number of streams into which the droplets are being sorted.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="1051">Each intercepting device <b>2203</b> in the exemplary collection system has an impact surface <b>2205</b> positioned to span the trajectory of one of the droplet streams to divert droplets moving along that trajectory to a collection vessel <b>2207</b> positioned beneath each intercepting device. The impact surfaces are preferably made of a pliable material. Without being bound by a particular theory, it is believed that pliable materials cushion the impact of droplets striking the surface of the intercepting device, thereby reducing damage to the particles (e.g., sperm cells) in the droplets. For example, the intercepting devices may be constructed of polypropylene, polyethylene, or other similar polymers. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 86 and 87</figref>, the intercepting devices <b>2203</b> have been constructed by cutting a droplet entryway <b>2211</b> (e.g., rectangular window) in one side of the bulb <b>2213</b> of a pipette <b>2215</b>. Thus, a portion of the inside wall <b>2217</b> of the bulb opposite the droplet entryway forms a curved impact surface <b>2205</b> which spans the trajectory of the respective droplet stream. Conveniently, the tube of the pipette serves as a guide <b>2225</b> for directing fluid from the impact surface to the collection vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="1052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84</figref>, the intercepting devices are fastened to a collection system frame <b>2227</b>, which holds them in place. In order to account for variability in the trajectories of the droplet streams, it is desirable to allow adjustment of the positions of the intercepting devices. For example, the vertical height of each intercepting device may be adjusted by sliding the guide tube up and down in a circular bore through a holder <b>2229</b>. When the intercepting device is at the desired height, a set screw <b>2231</b> may be tightened to hold it at that height. The holder may be attached to a mounting plate <b>2233</b> which is attached to the collection system frame, for example by set screws <b>2235</b> (e.g., two set screws). The set screws <b>2235</b> pass through a horizontal slot <b>2241</b> in the mounting plate to allow lateral adjustment of the intercepting device. After adjustment, the set screws may be tightened to hold the circular holder in the desired location. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of other fastening devices could be used to adjust the position of the intercepting device without departing from the scope of the present invention. The collection vessels <b>2207</b> are held beneath the intercepting devices in slots <b>2241</b> in a tray <b>2243</b> for holding the collection vessels. Thus, each collection vessel may be moved within a respective slot as necessary for it to remain in position under the respective intercepting device. Also, a water bath (not shown) may be provided around the collection vessel if desired to control the temperature of the contents of the collection vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="1053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref>, in one embodiment of the present invention an exit window <b>2245</b> (e.g., a rectangular window) has been cut in the back of one of the intercepting devices <b>2247</b> to allow one or more droplet streams to pass through the intercepting device. A second intercepting device <b>2249</b> is positioned behind the exit window to intercept the droplets that pass through this window. An exemplary entry window for the second intercepting device may be approximately the same size as the exemplary exit window for the first intercepting device. For reasons that will be apparent, it is desirable for the exit window to be significantly smaller than the entry window for the first intercepting device. For instance, an exemplary entry window for the first intercepting device is about &#x215d; of an inch high and about &#x215c; of an inch wide. In contrast, an exemplary exit window may be &#x215b; of an inch high and 5/16 of an inch wide.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="1054">During operation of the cytometer, the collection system operates to intercept the droplets in the sorted streams. The intercepted droplets then drain down through the guide tubes <b>2225</b> of the intercepting devices <b>2203</b> and into the collection vessels <b>2207</b>. In a case in which a cytometer has an upward pointing cytometer nozzle that directs droplet streams along arched trajectories, for example, the intercepting devices allow the droplets to be intercepted at a point on their trajectory that is significantly closer to the nozzle in comparison to the point at which the droplets would be collected by a conventional collection system (i.e., a collection system without intercepting devices).</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="1055">Intercepting the droplet streams relatively early along their arched trajectories (e.g., while they are still moving upward) reduces the amount of variation in the location of the droplets at the time the droplets first encounter the collection system. Accordingly, the collection system can tolerate more variation in the trajectories of the droplet streams than a convention collection system could tolerate. Similarly, the droplets are less likely to be buffeted by air currents because of their shorter paths to the collection system.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="1056">A balance must be struck between moving the intercepting devices <b>2203</b> closer to the nozzle <b>101</b> to increase tolerance for trajectory variations and moving the intercepting devices farther away from the nozzle orifice to reduce or minimize the force of impact when droplets impact the intercepting devices, as by positioning the intercepting devices so they intercept the droplet streams substantially at the apex of their trajectories. Accordingly, the best location for the intercepting devices will depend on the durability of the particles (e.g. sperm cells) being sorted, the droplet velocities, and the expected magnitude of variation in the droplet stream trajectories. In the case of droplets containing bovine sperm cells having a velocity at the nozzle orifice of about 16 to 20 m/s, for example, the intercepting devices may be positioned in the range of 4-6 inches from the nozzle orifice. In the embodiment in which a first intercepting device has a exit window and a second intercepting device is positioned behind the first intercepting device, for example, the first intercepting device may be in the range of about 4 and 5 inches from the nozzle. More desirably, the first intercepting device is about 4.5 inches from the nozzle. The second intercepting device may be in the range of about 5 to 6 inches from the nozzle. More desirably, the second intercepting device is about 5.5 inches from the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="1057">The configuration in which one intercepting device <b>2203</b> is positioned to intercept the droplets that pass through an exit window of another intercepting device is particularly advantageous when one is not concerned about the purity of one of the sorted populations (e.g., Y chromosome-bearing sperm in the case of sperm sorted for use in breeding dairy cattle). Those skilled in the art will know that a number of stray droplets <b>2265</b> (e.g., a mist of stray droplets) having unknown contents may be produced by the cytometer in addition to the droplets in the sorted streams as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref>. The first intercepting device should be positioned so that the stream of droplets that are being sorted into the population for which there is the greatest tolerance for impurities hit the impact surface <b>2205</b> of the first intercepting device and the stream for which purity is most critical passes through the exit window <b>2245</b> to hit the impact surface of the second intercepting device. This way the majority of the stray droplets are collected into the collection vessel <b>2207</b> containing the population for which there is less concern about purity, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref>, and will not contaminate the population for which purity is critical. Also by intercepting and collecting the stray droplets, one avoids the need to clean as often as if the stray droplets escape the collection system. In contrast to the first intercepting device, the second intercepting device only diverts droplets that pass through the smaller exit window. This facilitates maintenance of the purity of the population collected by the second intercepting device.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="1058">Those skilled in the art will recognize that the exemplary collection system could readily be modified in a number of ways without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, it would be possible to construct a droplet intercepting device having an integrally formed (or otherwise attached) collection vessel beneath it, without departing from the scope of this invention. Similarly, although the intercepting devices in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 83-87</figref> are modified pipettes, it is understood that the intercepting devices <b>2203</b> can be any of a variety of shapes without departing from the scope of this invention. For example, each intercepting device may comprise a flat or curved sheet, a spoon, a bowl, or other similar shape. The only requirement is that the intercepting device is operable to intercept droplets moving along a respective trajectory of a droplet stream and to divert the intercepted droplets into a collection vessel. However, one advantage to constructing the intercepting devices out of a readily available and relatively inexpensive product, such as a pipette, is that it may be more economical to replace and dispose of the used intercepting devices after each sample run rather than clean the intercepting devices between sample runs. This could help reduce costs of operating the collection system.</p>
<p id="h-0039" num="0000">Collection Fluid</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="1059">The sorted sperm are collected in a vessel that contains a collection fluid <b>2301</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56 and 57</figref>). Generally, the purpose of the collection fluid includes cushioning the impact of the sperm cells with the collection vessel or providing a fluid support for the cells. Consistent with these considerations, the collection fluid may comprise a buffer or buffered solution and a protein source.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="1060">If included, examples of buffers or buffered solutions that may be used in the collection fluid are disclosed above with respect to sample collection and dilution. Typically, these buffers or buffer solutions will be in a concentration of about 0.001 M to about 1.0M and have a pH of about 4.5 to about 8.5, preferably of about 7.0. In one embodiment, the collection fluid contains buffer comprising 0.96% Dulbecco's PBS (w/v) at a pH of about 7.0 In another embodiment, the collection fluid contains a metabolic inhibitor comprising 0.204 g NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.433 g KHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 0.473 g C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O per 25 mL of purified water (0.097 moles/L of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.173 moles/L of KHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.090 moles/L C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O in water).</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="1061">If included, the protein source may be any protein source that does not interfere with the viability of the sperm cells and is compatible with the particular buffer or buffered solution being used. Examples of common protein sources include milk (including heat homogenized and skim), milk extract, egg yolk, egg yolk extract, soy protein and soy protein extract. Such proteins may be used in a concentration from about 1% (v/v) to about 30% (v/v), preferably from about 10% (v/v) to about 20% (v/v), and more preferably about 10% (v/v). While milk may be used in combination with a buffer or buffered solution, generally milk is used in the absence of the same, as milk is a solution itself that may serve the same purpose of a buffer or buffered solution. In such instances, the collection fluid may contain about 80% (v/v) to about 90% (v/v) milk.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="1062">In addition to or in lieu of the protein source, the collection fluid may also comprise seminal plasma. Seminal plasma serves the dual benefits of improving sperm viability and motility and of stabilizing the sperm membrane (thereby preventing capacitation during the collection and storage of the sperm). Maxwell et al., <i>Reprod. Fert. Dev</i>. (1998) 10: 433-440. The seminal plasma may be from the same mammal from which the semen sample was obtained, from a different mammal of the same species, or from a mammal of a different species. If included in the collection fluid, typically the percentage of seminal plasma will be in the range of about 0.5% (v/v) to about 10% (v/v). If used in combination with a protein source, such as for example egg yolk or milk, the total percentage of seminal plasma and protein source will range from about 1% (v/v) to about 30% (v/v). In such instances, the percentage of seminal plasma will be inversely proportional to the percentage of the protein source. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the collection fluid comprises seminal plasma. In another embodiment, the collection fluid contains seminal plasma in an amount of about 0.5% (v/v) to about 10% (v/v), preferably in an amount of about 4% (v/v) to about 6% (v/v), and more preferably in an amount of about 5% (v/v). In another embodiment, the collection fluid contains a protein source and seminal plasma. In yet another embodiment, the collection fluid comprises seminal plasma and egg yolk, the percentage of both totaling between about 1% (v/v) and about 30% (v/v).</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="1063">Optionally, the collection fluid may also contain a range of additives that are beneficial to sperm viability or motility. Examples of such additives include an energy source, an antibiotic, and a composition which regulates oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly, each of which is discussed above with respect to sample collection and dilution. Such additives may be added to the collection fluid in accordance therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="1064">Accordingly, in a certain embodiment, the collection fluid comprises 0.96% Dulbecco's PBS (w/v), 1% (w/v) fructose, 10% (v/v) egg yolk in water, at a pH of about 7.0. In yet another embodiment, the collection fluid further comprises 10 mM pyruvate, 100 &#x3bc;M vitamin K, or 1 mM of lipoic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="1065">Alternatively, and in lieu of the use of a collection fluid, the sorted cells may be collected into a vessel containing or coated with a cryoextender used in the subsequent cryopreservation steps and further described below. Accordingly, in one particular embodiment, the sorted cells are collected into a cryoextender. In another embodiment, the collected cells are sorted into a cryoextender comprising water, Triladyl&#xae; (Minitube, Verona, Wis., comprising glycerol, tris, citric acid, fructose, 5 mg/100 ml tylosin, 25 mg/100 ml gentamycin, 30 mg/100 ml Spectinomycin, and 15 mg/100 ml Lincomycin), egg yolk, and pyruvic acid. In yet another embodiment, the collection fluid is the cryoextender comprising 25 g Triladyl&#xae;, 25 g egg yolk, and 10 mM pyruvic acid in 75 mL of water.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="1066">It is to be understood that the percent concentrations of protein in the collection fluid disclosed herein are those prior to the addition of the flow sorted cells. The addition of the flow sorted cells will dilute the final concentration of the collection fluid to about 1/20 that of what it was prior to the addition of the flow sorted cells. Therefore, for example, the collection fluid may initially contain about 10% (v/v) egg yolk. After the flow sorted cells are collected in the collection vessel containing the collection fluid, the final concentration of egg yolk will be reduced to about 0.5% (v/v).</p>
<p id="h-0040" num="0000">Pre-Treatment of Intercepting Devices and/or Collection Vessels</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="1067">In order to minimize possible damage to particles (e.g., sperm cells) that may be sorted according to the present invention, the intercepting devices <b>2203</b> and/or collection vessels <b>2207</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56-60</figref>) may be treated prior to use. Such pre-treatment may comprise, for example, contacting or soaking the intercepting devices and collection vessels in a bath containing a composition that will serve to minimize the impact between the particle and the intercepting device. Upon removal of the intercepting devices and collection vessels from the bath, a certain amount of the composition will remain on the intercepting devices and collection vessels and serve as a cushioning agent for the particles in the droplets. The composition, therefore, should have characteristics suitable for providing the desired cushioning effect. In addition, the composition should also be compatible with the particle or cell being sorted, the sheath fluid, and the collection fluid. Consistent with these considerations, the composition used to treat the intercepting devices and collection vessels may comprise a buffer or buffered solution, a sheath fluid, a collection fluid, a cryoextender, any components contained in the buffered solution, sheath fluid, collection fluid, or cryoextender, or any combination thereof. Buffers, buffered solutions, sheath fluids, and collection fluids used for the staining and separation of sperm cells according to the methods of the present invention are described above. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the intercepting devices and collection vessels are contacted with (e.g., soaked in or brushed with) sheath fluid. In another embodiment, the intercepting devices and collection vessels are contacted with collection fluid. In yet another embodiment, the intercepting devices and collection vessels are contacted with a cryoextender described below.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="1068">The contacting or soaking of the intercepting devices and collection vessels with the composition preferably occurs for a period of time sufficient to allow the composition to adhere to the surfaces of the intercepting devices and collection vessels. Such a period of time is generally less than about 90 minutes, preferably less than about 60 minutes, more preferably about 30 to about 60 minutes, and most preferably about 60 minutes. In still another embodiment, the intercepting devices and collection vessels are merely contacted with the composition prior to use.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="1069">In lieu of or in combination with the contacting of the intercepting devices and collection vessels with the above-described composition, the intercepting devices and collection vessels may also be contacted with specific components contained in the sheath fluid, the collection fluid, and/or the cryoextender, such as for example, BSA, SSS, egg yolk, egg yolk extract, milk (including heat homogenized and skim), milk extract, soy protein, and soy protein extract. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the intercepting devices and collection vessels are contacted with sheath fluid and subsequently contacted with 0.1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin. In another embodiment, the intercepting devices and collection vessels are contacted with sheath fluid and subsequently contacted with 10% (v/v) egg yolk. In another embodiment, the intercepting devices and collection vessels are soaked in collection fluid and subsequently contacted with 0.1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin. In another embodiment, the intercepting devices and collection vessels are soaked in collection fluid and subsequently contacted with 10% (v/v) egg yolk.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="1070">Although the intercepting devices and collection vessels receive the same pre-treatment in each embodiment described above, it is possible to use different pre-treatment protocols for the intercepting devices and the collection vessels without departing from the scope of this invention. Likewise, some of the intercepting devices or collection vessels could receive one pre-treatment and others of the intercepting devices or collection vessels could receive a different pre-treatment without departing from the scope of this invention. Certain advantages of the pre-treatment can also be obtained by pre-treating only the intercepting devices or only the collection vessels, again without departing from the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="h-0041" num="0000">Concentration</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="1071">As noted above, the sorted sperm collected by the flow cytometer have been diluted by the addition of various buffers and extenders, the staining fluid, the sheath fluid, and the collection fluid. Typically, the concentration of sperm cells after sorting by flow cytometry as described above is in the range of about 0.7-1.4&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm cells/ml. Therefore, it is important to concentrate the sorted sperm cells to minimize the dilution shock to the sperm and to attain the proper concentration of sperm for cryopreservation and artificial insemination. Standard practice in the animal breeding industry, for example, is to perform artificial insemination with sperm at a concentration of either about 20&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>or about 40&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm cells/ml. One way to concentrate the sperm cells is through centrifugation of the fluid collected by the cytometer. Another way to concentrate the sperm is to pass the fluid collected by the cytometer through a filtration system. These methods are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="1072">A. Centrifugation</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="1073">Any conventional centrifuge can be used to concentrate sperm. However in a commercial operation it is preferable to use a centrifuge having the capacity to centrifuge a large batch of sperm cells at once. During centrifugation a majority of the sperm cells will collect in a pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube due to the centrifugal force acting on the sperm cells. The magnitude of the centrifugal force is conventionally stated as the number of times the centrifugal force exceeds the gravitational force. Because the centrifugal force is the critical parameter and because the magnitude of the centrifugal force at any given speed (angular velocity) will vary depending of the length of the radius of curvature, the speed of centrifugation is typically specified by stating the magnitude of the centrifugal force. For example, a 600 g force means the angular velocity of the centrifuge is selected so the resulting centrifugal force will be 600 times the force of gravity. The majority of the fluids and any sperm cells that escape being centrifuged into the pellet will be in the supernatant. Generally, the supernatant is removed and the sperm cells in the pellet are resuspended for further processing as described below. It is important to maximize the percentage of sperm that are concentrated in the pellet, while at the same time minimizing damage to the sperm cells.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="1074">According to one method of the present invention, a centrifuge tube containing about 10&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sorted sperm cells is placed in a centrifuge. To facilitate concentration, centrifuge tubes may be used as the collection vessels in the collection system of the cytometer. This avoids the need to transfer the sorted sperm cells to a centrifuge tube before centrifugation. The tube is centrifuged at a speed and for a duration that is sufficient to cause a pellet of concentrated sperm cells to form in the bottom of the tube. The speed and duration of the centrifugation is desirably selected in consideration of several factors, including: the fact that sperm cells are fragile and can be damaged by centrifugation at an excessive speed; the size of the centrifuge tube will affect the time required for sperm cells to move to the bottom of the tube; and the sperm cells are more likely to be damaged by centrifugation at a given speed the longer the centrifugation continues. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention the centrifuge tube is centrifuged at 550-800 g for a period of about 6-10 minutes. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the centrifuge tube is centrifuged at 650-750 g for a period of about 6-10 minutes. In still another embodiment, the centrifuge tube is centrifuged at 700 g for a period of about 6-10 minutes. In yet another embodiment, the centrifuge tube is centrifuged at 700 g for a period of about 7 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="1075">As demonstrated in the following experiments, the speed of the centrifuge and the duration of centrifugation may affect the percentage of sperm cells recovered and the motility of the recovered sperm cells. The experiments were conducted without actually sorting the sperm cells. Instead, various fluids including buffers, extenders, sheath fluids and a staining fluid were added to semen samples to simulate the sorting process. The samples were then centrifuged in an attempt to concentrate the sperm cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0042" level="1">Centrifuge Example I</heading>
<p id="p-0471" num="1076">In centrifuge example I bovine semen was collected and evaluated as described above. The semen sample was diluted with a quantity of Tris-citric acid (&#x201c;TCA&#x201d;) having a pH of 7.3 to attain a concentration of 150&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm cells/ml. Spermatozoa were stained with Hoechst 33342 (100 &#x3bc;M) at 41&#xb0; C. for twenty minutes. Two 15 ml tubes were prepared with buffers for the simulation. Tube <b>1</b> was partially filled with 750 &#x3bc;l of phosphate buffered saline (&#x201c;PBS&#x201d;) with 10% egg yolk and 14.25 ml PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (&#x201c;BSA&#x201d;). Tube <b>2</b> was partially filled with 750 ul TCA with 10% egg yolk and 14.25 ml PBS with 0.1% BSA. Each of the two tubes received 100 ul of the solution containing the stained spermatozoa, which were then incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The two tubes were then divided into two aliquots of 7 ml each. One aliquot from each tube was centrifuged at 2250 rpm (about 540 g) for 7 minutes in a fixed bucket centrifuge. The other aliquot from each of the two tubes was centrifuged at 2500 rpm (about 660 g) for 7 minutes. Immediately after centrifugation, 10 ml pipettes were used to remove and save the supernatant from each aliquot. The pellets were resuspended in 200 ul of TCA with 10% egg yolk (pH 7.0). Pre- and post-centrifuge sperm motility was observed under a phase contrast microscope. Fifty ul of a fixative (0.1% glutarldehyde in 3.4% Na citrate) was added to each pellet and supernatant to immobilize the sperm for concentration determination with a hemacytometer. Total numbers of spermatozoa were calculated on the basis of volume used/recovered multiplied by the corresponding sperm concentration as determined by the hemacytometer. The recovery rate was calculated as the total number of sperm in the pellet divided by the sum of the total number of sperm in the pellet and the total number of sperm in the supernatant.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="1077">The results, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 88 and 89</figref> show there is little difference in sperm cell motility caused by varying the centrifuge speed. The results also show that motility was slightly better using TCA compared to PBS.</p>
<heading id="h-0043" level="1">Centrifuge Example II</heading>
<p id="p-0473" num="1078">In centrifuge example II semen samples from three bulls were collected and evaluated as described above. One of the samples was disqualified for failure to meet initial quality control standards. The other two semen samples were diluted with a quantity of TCA having a pH of 7.3 in order to obtain a sperm concentration of 150&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm/ml. The spermatozoa were stained with a 10 &#x3bc;M Hoechst 33342 solution at 41&#xb0; C. for twenty minutes. A simulated buffer containing 1500 &#x3bc;l PBS with 10% egg yolk and 28.3 ml PBS with 0.1% BSA was added to each of two tubes. Two hundred &#x3bc;l of the stained spermatozoa (30&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm cells) were added to each tube and incubated at room temperature for twenty minutes. Three 9 ml aliquots of semen mixture were taken from each of the two tubes for centrifugation. One aliquot from each of the two samples was centrifuged for seven minutes in a 15 ml centrifuge tube at each of the following speeds: 550 g; 650 g: and 750 g. The temperature during centrifugation was 22&#xb0; C. Immediately after centrifugation, supernatant was removed with a 10 ml pipette, leaving about 200-300 &#x3bc;l supernatant in the pellet. The pellets were resuspended with 200 &#x3bc;l of TCA having 10% (v/v) egg yolk having a pH of 7.0. Pre- and post-sort sperm motility was observed under a phase contrast microscope. Severe sperm agglutination was noted in the post-centrifuge samples from one of the two bulls. Fifty &#x3bc;l of a fixative (0.1% glutardehyde in 3.4% Na citrate) was added to each supernatant and pellet to immobilize the sperm for concentration determination. Recovery rate was determined according to the formula set forth in centrifuge experiment I.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="1079">The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</figref>. The results show improved recovery rate of sperm cells at 650 g compared to 550 g.

<heading id="h-0045" level="1">Centrifuge Example IV</heading>
<p id="p-0476" num="1081">Semen was collected from two different bulls on two different days. Semen was transported and evaluated in the manner described above. Based on sperm concentration of raw semen, spermatozoa were diluted with Tris-citric acid (TCA, pH 7.3) plus 10 mM pyruvate, to a concentration of 150&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm/ml. The spermatozoa were stained with 10 &#x3bc;M Hoechst 33342 at 41&#xb0; C. for 20 min. After staining, 267 &#x3bc;l of the solution containing the stained spermatozoa were diluted to a concentration of 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm/ml by addition of the following simulated buffers: 2 ml PBS with 10% (v/v) egg yolk; and 37.733 ml PBS with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). The stained spermatozoa and simulated buffers were incubated at room temperature for at least 20 minutes. Four 9 ml aliquots were taken from the stained spermatozoa and simulated buffer mixture obtained from each bull. The four aliquots from the first bull were centrifuged at varying combinations of centrifuge speed and duration in the following sequence:</p>

<p id="p-0485" num="1090">All centrifugation was performed in 15 ml centrifuge tubes in a swing head centrifuge (Allegra 6R, Beckman Coulter Inc. Fullerton, Calif.) at 22&#xb0; C. The time interval between semen collection at farm and centrifugation in lab was 4-5 hours. Immediately after centrifugation, supernatant was removed with 10 ml pipettes, leaving &#x2dc;250 &#x3bc;l supernatant with each pellet. The pellets were resuspended in 250 &#x3bc;A of Delbecco's PBS (pH 7.0). Sperm motility and progressive motility were observed using a Hamilton-Thorn Motility Analyzer (two slides per sample; two chambers per slide) after staining but before centrifugation and again after centrifugation. Sperm concentration was determined by hemacytometer measurement of a 100 &#x3bc;l aliquot of the pre-centrifuge stained spermatozoa and simulated buffer mixture that had been placed in the freezer and a 10 &#x3bc;l aliquot of the resuspended pellet mixed with 90 &#x3bc;l fixative (0.1% glutaraldehyde in 3.4% Na citrate). Recovery rate was determined as in Centrifuge Example I. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 92 and 93</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0486" num="1091">The data indicate that &#x3e;85% of the spermatozoa can be recovered after centrifugation at 650 g or 700 g, for 7 or 10 minutes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92</figref>). However, recovery rate was slightly better (95%) at 700 g. The decline in motility after centrifugation (compared to before centrifugation) in all treatments could be due to the presence of dead/abnormal/fragile spermatozoa which could not withstand the stress of centrifugal force. Sperm motility declined by 10-14% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref>) in all treatments. The higher decline in sperm motility (14%) at 650 g for 7 min might be due to the longer exposure of sperm to simulated buffer as centrifugation at 650 g was conducted after 700 g. Centrifugation did not show any adverse effect on progressive motility of spermatozoa, rather there was improvement by 2-3%.</p>
<heading id="h-0047" level="1">Centrifuge Example V</heading>
<p id="p-0487" num="1092">Semen was collected from one bull on two different days. Semen was evaluated, diluted and stained with Hoechst 33342, and further diluted in simulated buffers as described in Centrifuge Example IV. Four 9 ml aliquots of the stained spermatozoa and simulated buffer mixture were obtained for each of the two semen samples. The aliquots from the first sample were centrifuged at one of the following combinations of centrifuge speed and duration in the following sequence:</p>

<p id="p-0496" num="1101">Centrifugation was conducted in a 15 ml centrifuge tube in a swing head centrifuge (Allegra 6R, Beckman Coulter Inc. Fullerton, Calif.) at 22&#xb0; C. The interval between semen collection at farm and centrifugation in laboratory was about 6.5 hours for the first sample, and about 4 hours for the second sample. Post centrifugation processing, i.e. removal of supernatant, resuspension of pellet, determination of sperm concentration, and motility estimation via Hamilton-Thorn Motility Analyzer, were conducted following the same procedure as described in Example IV. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 94 and 95</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="1102">The results show that &#x3e;85% of the sperm population in highly diluted suspension can be recovered with 700 g or 750 g in 7 minutes or 10 minutes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref>). An increase in g force to 750 g did not improve the recovery rate significantly. As was the case in Centrifuge Example IV, the decline in motility after centrifugation (as compared to before centrifugation) was observed in all treatments. In the present experiment, sperm motility declined by 13-20% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</figref>) which is little higher than in Centrifuge Example IV. The variation could be due to variation in semen sample and longer time interval from semen collection to centrifugation (6 hours) in one replicate. As explained in Example IV, the decline in sperm motility (about 20%) at low speed centrifugation (700&#xd7;g, for 7 or 10 min) might be due to the longer exposure of sperm to simulated buffer as they were centrifuged after 750 g centrifugation. The decline in progressive motility was negligible (1-5%).</p>
<p id="p-0498" num="1103">B. Secondary Centrifugation</p>
<p id="p-0499" num="1104">In order to recover sperm that might otherwise be lost in the supernatant, it is possible to centrifuge the supernatant after it has been separated from the pellet. Without being bound by a particular theory, applicants believe the pellet/supernatant interphase impedes movement of spermatozoa into the pellet. Removal of the interphase by separating the pellet from the supernatant will allow further centrifugation of the supernatant to cause sperm cells that would have remained in the supernatant to form a second pellet. The second pellet can be resuspended and added to resuspended sperm from the first pellet.</p>
<p id="p-0500" num="1105">C. Filtration</p>
<p id="p-0501" num="1106">An alternative concentration method that may be used to avoid loss of sperm cells in the supernatant is filtration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96</figref>, according to one exemplary embodiment a filter <b>2415</b> is incorporated in a collection vessel <b>2403</b>. The size of the pores in the filter are desirably in the range of about 0.2-1 microns. It is also desirable that the filter is not a depth filter (e.g., a filter having tortuous passages in which sperm tails can be caught). Rather it is desirable that the filter be as thin as possible. For example, it is desirable that the filter thickness be in the range of 50 &#x3bc;m to 500 &#x3bc;m; more desirable that the filter thickness be in the range of 75 &#x3bc;m to 250 &#x3bc;m; and most desirable that the filter thickness be in the range of 100 &#x3bc;m to 150 &#x3bc;m. A low level vacuum <b>2417</b> is applied to remove the fluids through the filter as the droplets <b>33</b> are collected. It is important to use a low level vacuum (less than 20 inches of mercury, e.g., 15 inches of mercury) to avoid inflicting damage to the sperm cells. In one embodiment the vacuum is low enough that the fluid removal rate is about 1.0 ml/15 seconds. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum is applied intermittently to allow the sperm cells a chance to recover. In still another embodiment, the filter <b>2415</b> is constructed of a material that is compatible with sperm cells, yet has no binding affinity for them. At the completion of the sort, about 80-90% of the fluids will have been removed through the filter. However, enough fluid remains (about 10-20%) that the sperm cells are in a concentrated slurry <b>2405</b>, thereby preventing the sperm cells from forming a filter cake. The concentrated suspension may be transferred to another container <b>2419</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref> for example. A syringe mechanism <b>2409</b> with a cannula-tip filter <b>2411</b> can be used to remove some of the remaining liquid from this container <b>2419</b>. However, enough fluids are left in the container to prevent the sperm cells from caking on the filter <b>2411</b>. The same considerations apply to the cannula tip filter <b>2411</b> as the filter <b>2415</b> in the collection vessel. Thus, the cannula filter <b>2411</b> pore size is desirably in the range of about 0.2-1.0 microns and the cannula filter is relatively thin to avoid having sperm tails getting caught in tortuous passages in the filter. For example, a DynaGard&#xae; hollow polypropylene fiber syringe tip filter, which is commercially available from Spectrum Laboratories, Inc. of Rancho Dominguez, Calif. may be used for the cannula tip filter. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</figref>, a resuspension fluid <b>2413</b> is flushed through the cannula-tip filter to wash cells that may be sticking to the filter surface back into the slurry. The resuspension fluid may include a quantity of the filtered fluid and/or a suitable extender. After a quantity of resuspension fluid sufficient to remove sperm cells from the filter has been back flushed through the filter, additional resuspension fluid may be added if desired. The total quantity of resuspension fluid is selected to bring the concentration to a desired concentration (e.g., about 20&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm cells/ml). Thus, the filtration process of this embodiment is a three-step process involving the use of a filter in the collection vessel, filtration using a cannula filter, and resuspension to obtain the desired concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="1107">In an alternative two-step filtration process, the first and second steps of the three-step process described above are combined so that removal of all fluid is through a cannula filter. In this process the sorted sperm cells are directed to a collection vessel that does not have a filter. The fluids are removed by low vacuum and/or intermittent vacuum as described above that is applied through the cannula-tip filter <b>2411</b>. When the sperm cells are in a concentrated slurry, a resuspension fluid, such as for example, an extender, is flushed back through the cannula filter to obtain the desired concentration of sperm cells.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</figref>, a vacuum pump <b>2427</b> was used to apply negative pressure to draw a four ml aliquot of the diluted semen <b>2423</b> through a filter <b>2425</b>. The filtrate <b>2429</b> was collected in a syringe <b>2421</b>. After filtration sperm cells on the filter were flushed back with 1 ml TCA buffer in a 15 ml tube. Sperm motility was assessed visually. Pre- and post-filtration samples were mixed with a fixative (0.1% glutardehyde in 3.4 Na citrate) to immobilize the sperm cells. Sperm concentration was determined using a hemacytometer. Total number of sperm cells was calculated on the basis of volume multiplied by the concentration of sperm cells. The recovery rate was calculated as the total number of sperm cells in the flushed back portion divided by the total number of sperm cells in the aliquot prior to filtration. The process was repeated with a different filter. The experiment tested both of the following filters: (1) a 1.0 &#x3bc;m PTFE (not FTPE) membrane disc (syringe) filter (which is available from Pall Corporation, Life Science Group, Ann Arbor, Mich., Cat # PN4226T or VWR, Batavia, Ill., Cat. #28143-928); and (2) 0.8 SFCA (surfactant free cellulose acetate) membrane disc (syringe) filter (Corning, Inc., Corning, N.Y., Cat. #431221; VWR Batavia, Ill., Cat. #28200-028). The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</figref>. More spermatozoa were recovered with cellulose acetate filters as compared to PTFE filter, i.e. 67 vs 33% due to low protein binding affinity of cellulose acetate. Visual motility of spermatozoa recovered ranged from 63% (PTFE) to 68% (Cellulose acetate).</p>
<heading id="h-0050" level="1">Filtration Example II</heading>
<p id="p-0504" num="1109">Filtration example II shows the recovery rate and motility of sperm cells after concentration by at two-step filtration process of the present invention. Semen samples were collected from three bulls and evaluated as provided in the sample preparation section above. The three samples were diluted with a quantity of TCA (pH 7.3) necessary to attain a concentration of 150&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm cells/ml. One and one half ml of PBS with 10% egg yolk and 28.3 ml PBS with 0.1% BSA was added to each of 50 test tubes. Two hundred &#x3bc;l of semen sample (about 30&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm cells) was added to each test tube and incubated for twenty minutes at room temperature. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 100</figref>, a syringe <b>2431</b> was used to apply negative pressure to draw a 6 ml aliquot of the diluted semen <b>2433</b> from each test tube through a filter <b>2435</b>. The filter was placed in a filter holder <b>2437</b> (a Swinnex filter holder from Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass. Cat #SX0002500,). After filtration, the filtration holder <b>2437</b> was disconnected from the syringe and the tubing, keeping the filter holder intact. Spermatozoa on the filter were collected by turning the filter assembly upside down and back flushing <b>1</b> with ml of TCA buffer using a 3 ml syringe having a small piece of tubing at the tip in a 15 ml test tube. Sperm motility was assessed visually. Pre- and post-filtration samples were mixed with a fixative (0.1% glutardehyde in 3.4 Na citrate) to immobilize the sperm cells. Sperm concentration was determined using a hemacytometer. Total number of sperm cells and the recovery rate were calculated as specified in Filtration example 1. The process was repeated twice to test different filters. The experiment tested both of the following filters: (1) a 0.2 &#x3bc;m Teflon membrane filter (which is available from X-Partek, P.J Cobert Associates Inc. St. Louis Cat. #944106; and (2) a 0.8 cellulose acetate membrane filter (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass. Cat. #AAWP 02500). The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 102</figref>. In both filters, the recovery rate of spermatozoa was low (&#x2dc;25%). It was low in Teflon filter as in example I. However, low recovery rate and visual motility of flushed back spermatozoa in cellulose acetate filter might be due to the material used by different vendor and/or ability of spermatozoa to attach with filter holder/assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0505" num="1110">D. Dense Medium Concentration</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="1111">Another alternative method of concentrating the collected sperm relies on flotation of sperm cells in a high-density medium. According to this method, a high-density medium is added to the collected sperm cells to raise the specific gravity of the suspension above about 1.3. For example, a colloidal silica suspension such as is available under the Percoll&#xae; and Isolate&#xae; tradenames may be used to increase the specific gravity of the suspension. The sperm cells will float to the top of the suspension, where they can be skimmed or otherwise collected, because of the increased specific gravity of the suspension. A resuspension fluid is added to the cells that have been collected from the surface to bring the final concentration to about 20&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm cells/ml. Some of the suspension fluid may be removed by one of the filtration methods described above prior to addition of the high density medium to reduce the quantity of high density medium required to attain the desired specific gravity.</p>
<p id="h-0051" num="0000">Cryoextension</p>
<p id="p-0507" num="1112">A. Cryoprotection</p>
<p id="p-0508" num="1113">Once the sperm have been sorted and collected in the collection vessels, they may be used for inseminating female mammals. This can occur almost immediately, requiring little additional treatment of the sperm. Likewise, the sperm may also be cooled or frozen for use at a later date. In such instances, the sperm may benefit from additional treatment to minimize the impact upon viability or post-thaw motility as a result of cooling and freezing.</p>
<p id="p-0509" num="1114">Generally, a cryoextender comprises a buffer or buffered solution, a protein source, and a cryoprotectant. Examples of buffers and buffered solutions that may be used in the cryoextender are disclosed above with respect to sample collection and extension. Typically, these buffers will be in a concentration of about 0.001M to about 1.0M and have a pH of about 4.5 to about 8.5, preferably of about 7.0.</p>
<p id="p-0510" num="1115">If included, a protein source may be added to provide support to the cells and to cushion the contact of the cells with the collection vessel. The protein source may be any protein source that does not interfere with the viability of the sperm cells and is compatible with the particular buffer or buffered solution being used. Examples of common protein sources include milk (including heat homogenized and skim), milk extract, egg yolk, egg yolk extract, soy protein and soy protein extract. Such proteins may be found in a concentration from about 10% (v/v) to about 30% (v/v), preferably from about 10% (v/v) to about 20% (v/v), and more preferably about 20% (v/v). While milk may be used in combination with a buffer or buffered solution, generally milk is used in the absence of the same, as milk is a solution itself that may serve the same purpose of a buffer or buffered solution. In such instances, the cryoextender would contain about 80% (v/v) to about 90% (v/v) milk.</p>
<p id="p-0511" num="1116">A cryoprotectant is preferably included in the cryoextender to lessen or prevent cold shock or to maintain fertility of the sperm. Numerous cryoprotectants are known in the art. Selection of a cryoprotectant suitable for use with a given extender may vary, and depends upon the species from which the sperm to be frozen were obtained. Examples of suitable cryoprotectants include, for example, glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, trehalose, Triladyl&#xae; and combinations thereof. If included, generally, these cryoprotectants are present in the cryoextender in an amount of about 1% (v/v) to about 15% (v/v), preferably in an amount of about 5% (v/v) to about 10% (v/v), more preferably in an amount of about 7% (v/v), and most preferably in an amount of about 6% (v/v).</p>
<p id="p-0512" num="1117">In one particular embodiment, the cryoextender comprises water, Triladyl&#xae;, egg yolk, and pyruvic acid. In yet another embodiment, the cryoextender comprises 25 g Triladyl&#xae;, 25 g egg yolk, and 10 mM pyruvic acid in 75 mL of water.</p>
<p id="p-0513" num="1118">Optionally, the cryoextender may also contain a range of additives that are beneficial to sperm viability or motility and that prevent or lessen the detrimental side effects of cryopreservation. Such additives may include, for example, an energy source, an antibiotic, or a composition which regulates oxidation/reduction reactions intracellularly and/or extracellularly, each of which is discussed above with respect to sample collection and dilution. Such additives may be added to the cryoextender in accordance therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0514" num="1119">B. Cryopreservation of Sorted Sperm Cells</p>
<p id="p-0515" num="1120">In most cases, it will not be possible to use the sperm cells that have been sorted as described above for immediate artificial insemination. Particularly in the case of a commercial sperm sorting operation, the sorted sperm cells must be stored and/or transported before they can be used for artificial insemination. This will usually require cryopreservation of the sperm cells. The sorted sperm may be loaded into elongate cylinders (known as &#x201c;straws&#x201d; in the breeding industry) and cryopreserved to preserve the sperm during transportation and storage. Cryopreserved sperm cells can be stored for long periods of time in liquid nitrogen. To use the cryopreserved sperm, the straw may be immersed in a heated water bath to thaw the sperm. Then the straw is loaded into an artificial insemination gun which is used to inseminate a female animal. Several precautions must be taken to protect the sperm cells during cryopreservation. Otherwise the sperm cells will be so damaged (as indicated by a low post-thaw motility rate of 5-10%) that they are not suitable for use in artificial insemination.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="1121">Conventional cryopreservation methods involve sequentially adding a protein source (e.g., egg yolk), cooling the sperm to a temperature of about 4-5&#xb0; C., adding a cryoprotectant (e.g., glycerol), maintaining the sperm and cryoprotectant at a steady temperature in the range of about 4-5&#xb0; C. for a period of time sufficient to allow the sperm cells to equilibrate with the cryoprotectant, and then supercooling the sperm, as by immersing the sperm cells in liquid nitrogen at &#x2212;196&#xb0; C. for storage. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the purpose of the protein source is to protect sperm from damage as they cool from about 14&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C., which is the temperature at which sperm cells are most susceptible to cold shock. In contrast, the cryoprotectant protects the sperm cells from damage at temperatures below 0&#xb0; C. Even though the temperatures involved in cryopreservation are well below freezing and the term &#x201c;freezing&#x201d; is sometimes used to describe cryopreservation, those skilled in the art will also know that cryopreserved sperm are not actually frozen. To be precise, the cryopreserved sperm are in a supercooled state. The conventional period during which sperm cells and cryoprotectant are maintained at a steady temperature can last anywhere from 60 minutes to many hours. The overall time to complete cryopreservation using conventional methods generally exceeds four hours. Furthermore, it is believed that up to 50% of the sperm cells are killed in conventional cryopreservation processes. Though sperm are cryopreserved using conventional methods according to some embodiments of the present invention, other embodiments of the present invention employ improved cryopreservation methods to reduce the time required for cryopreservation and/or to improve the health of the cryopreserved sperm.</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="1122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref> shows a work flow diagram outlining the steps of one exemplary embodiment of an improved method of cryopreserving sperm according to the present invention. At step <b>2501</b>, the concentration of a solution containing sorted sperm cells is adjusted to be in the range of about 1 million-40 million sperm/ml, depending on the standard used by the targeted consumer (e.g., breeding association). For example, the sperm concentration may be adjusted to be in the range of about 20 million to 24 million sperm/ml. Adjustment of the sperm concentration may include addition of resuspension fluid, buffers and/or extenders to concentrated sperm as described above. At step <b>2503</b>, a cryoprotectant (e.g., glycerol) is added before the sperm are cooled. The sperm cells begin equilibrating with the cryoprotectant as soon as they come into contact with the cryoprotectant. At step <b>2505</b>, a protein source (e.g., egg yolk) is also added to the solution containing the sperm cells as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="1123">The sperm cell solution, protein source, and cryoprotectant are loaded into conventional 0.5 or 0.25 ml artificial insemination straws using a conventional loading machine at step <b>2507</b>. Those skilled in the art will be familiar with a number of conventional apparatus and techniques that may be used to load semen into straws. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,249,610, issued Oct. 5, 1993 to Cassou, et al. and incorporated herein by reference, provides instruction about the filling of straws with bovine semen using a disposable injector nozzle. Moreover, equipment for filling straws is commercially available from Minitube of America, located in Verona Wis. Any of these or similar conventional loading methods and apparatus can be used to load the sorted sperm cells into straws.</p>
<p id="p-0519" num="1124">After loading, the sperm cells are cooled to a holding temperature at step <b>2509</b>. In general, the holding temperature should be selected with the following considerations in mind: holding sperm cells at a temperature that is too high (e.g., 10&#xb0; C.) may cause unnecessary damage from cold shock; equilibration of sperm cells with a cryoprotectant (e.g., glycerol) is believed to be most active at temperatures in the range of 4-5&#xb0; C.; and holding sperm cells at temperatures that are too low (e.g., &#x3c;0&#xb0;) is believed to be damaging to the sperm cells. Thus, according to one embodiment, the holding temperature is in the range of 0-8&#xb0; C. More desirably, the holding temperature is in the range of 2-6&#xb0; C. Even more desirably, the holding temperature is in the range of 4-5&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the cooling rate used for this step <b>2509</b> is selected to minimize damage to the sperm cells. For example, the cooling rate may be controlled (e.g., substantially constant) to provide homogenous cooling and to prevent the sperm from suffering temperature shock. The cooling rate should also cool the sperm quickly enough to reduce their metabolism before they incur membrane damage, but slowly enough that they do not suffer from temperature shock. One can control the cooling rate by placing the straws containing the sperm cells in a programmable freezer (e.g., an IceCube 1810CD freezer which is available commercially from Minitube of America, located in Verona, Wis.) to cool them. According to one embodiment, the programmable freezer cools the sperm from about room temperature (typically in the range of about 22 and 24&#xb0; C.) at a constant cooling rate of 0.1 and 0.3&#xb0; C./minute. More desirably, the cooling rate is in a range of about 0.15 and 0.25&#xb0; C./min. Even more desirably, the cooling rate is about 0.2&#xb0; C./min. In another embodiment, the cooling rate is selected so the sperm are cooled from their initial temperature to the holding temperature in about 90 minutes. In still another embodiment, the cooling rate is selected to cool the sperm from their initial temperature to the holding temperature at a constant cooling rate in about 90 minutes. The cooling rates referred to above actually refer to the rate of the cooling of the chamber of the programmable freezer, but because of the thin walls and long, thin shape of the straw (e.g., about 5.25 inches long, less than 3 mm in diameter, and about 0.15 mm in wall thickness) and the conductive properties of the straw, the temperature difference between the sperm cells and the cooling chamber is not significant.</p>
<p id="p-0520" num="1125">After the sperm cells have been cooled to the holding temperature, at step <b>2511</b> they are kept at or near that temperature for a period to allow substantial completion of their equilibration with the cryoprotectant. For example, the programmable freezer described above can be programmed to hold the sperm cells at a steady temperature during the period. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the sperm cells are held at the holding temperature for a period that is shortened compared to conventional methods because the sperm have already been equilibrating with the cryoprotectant during the cooling process. For example, the period may be in the range of about 10 and 60 minutes. More desirably, the period is in the range of about 20 and 40 minutes. Even more desirably, the period is about 30 minutes. In another embodiment the period is less than 60 minutes. In yet another embodiment, the period is less than 40 minutes. The relatively short holding period offers a number of advantages in a commercial sperm sorting process. First, it reduces the time required to process sorted sperm which can translate to cost savings. Also, the sperm cells still perform metabolic processes at temperatures in the range of 0-8&#xb0; C. so reducing the time for which sperm need to held at this temperature can improve the health of the sperm cells, which will increase the value of the sperm cells to animal breeders who are concerned about artificial insemination success rates.</p>
<p id="p-0521" num="1126">After the sperm cells have been held at the holding temperature for a period described above, the sperm cells are cooled at step <b>2513</b> to a temperature that approaches the critical temperature zone for sperm cryopreservation. Those skilled in the art will know that the critical temperature zone is the zone at which ice crystal formation and changes in osmotic pressure damage the sperm cells. This temperature may vary depending on the solution in which the sperm cells are cryopreserved, but the critical temperature zone is generally in the range of &#x2212;18 and &#x2212;35&#xb0; C. Sometimes this critical temperature zone is reported to be in the range of about &#x2212;18 and &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. Thus, according to yet another embodiment of the present invention, the cooling rate used to cool the sperm cells from the holding temperature to a temperature that approaches &#x2212;18&#xb0; C. (e.g., &#x2212;15&#xb0; C.) is selected to protect the health of the sperm. Relevant factors to consider include that fact that the sperm cells are still equilibrating with the cryoprotectant during this period, the fact that sperm are still performing some metabolic functions, and the fact that the sperm are still somewhat sensitive to rapid temperature change. Again, it is desirable that the cooling rate be a controlled rate, such as a rate that may be programmed into the programmable freezer described above. More desirably, the cooling rate used to cool the sperm from the holding temperature to a temperature that approaches about &#x2212;18&#xb0; C. is a constant cooling rate. Thus, according to another embodiment of the present invention, the sperm cells are cooled from the holding temperature to about &#x2212;15&#xb0; C. at a cooling rate in the range of about 1.0-5.0&#xb0; C./min. More desirably, the cooling rate is in the range of about 2.0-4.0&#xb0; C./min. Even more desirably, the cooling rate is about 3.0&#xb0; C./min.</p>
<p id="p-0522" num="1127">Step <b>2515</b> involves rapidly cooling the sperm cells through the critical temperature zone to limit the time sperm cells dwell therein. Thus, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the cooling rate through the critical temperature zone about (e.g., &#x2212;18&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;30&#xb0; C.) is selected to be much faster than the cooling rate used to cool sperm cells to the holding temperature and the cooling rate used to cool sperm cells to the temperature approaching the critical temperature zone. Thus, the steeper cooling rate is desirably in the range of from about 8-40&#xb0; C. per minute. More desirably, the steeper cooling rate is in the range of from about 8-12&#xb0; C. per minute. Most desirably, the steeper cooling rate is about 10&#xb0; C. per minute. The temperature range over which the steeper cooling rate is used may extend beyond the critical temperature zone. Thus, in yet another embodiment of the present invention, the sperm cells are cooled at one of the steeper cooling rates described above from about &#x2212;15&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. In still another embodiment, the sperm cells are cooled at one of the steeper cooling rates described above from about &#x2212;15&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. The step of cooling the sperm through the critical temperature zone at a steeper rate may be accomplished in the programmable freezer described above.</p>
<p id="p-0523" num="1128">After the sperm cells have been cooled below the critical temperature zone (e.g., to &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.), the straws containing the sorted sperm are immersed in liquid nitrogen (&#x2212;196&#xb0; C.) at step <b>2517</b> to provide maximum useful life of the sorted sperm cells. The use of liquid nitrogen to store cryopreserved sperm is widespread in the animal breeding industry in the context of unsorted sperm. Thus, those skilled in the art will be familiar with technologies involving the transportation and storage of sperm in liquid nitrogen, which need not be discussed in great detail herein. It is sufficient to note that conventional containers are available to provide for long term storage of bulk quantities of artificial insemination straws in liquid nitrogen and that smaller and more portable containers are also available for providing storage of artificial insemination straws in liquid nitrogen for transport to customers and/or for transport to a farm having one or more female animals to be inseminated with cryopreserved sperm.</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="1129">One advantage of the cryopreservation methods described herein is that the cryopreservation can be completed in less time than is required according to conventional methods. Perhaps relatedly, the decline in motility due to cryopreservation according to the present invention is only about 5-11%, as indicated by the example discussed below. Thus, cryopreservation according to the present invention preserves the health of the sperm cells as indicated by tests showing that sperm cells cryopreserved according to the present invention have greater than 50% (e.g., about 60%) motility after they are thawed in a 37&#xb0; C. water bath for about 50 seconds. As discussed above, sperm motility may be analyzed by an automatic machine (e.g., the IVOS sperm analyzer from Hamilton Thorn Research) or by visual examination.</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="1130">It should be noted that the cryopreservation methods described above are contemplated as being used in a commercial scale sperm sorting process. Thus, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the steps of the inventive methods described herein are performed simultaneously on a batch of sorted sperm cells to quickly cryopreserve the entire batch of sperm cells in a manner that preserves their health. For example, by using the multi-channel flow cytometry apparatus described below, it is possible to obtain about 840&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sorted X chromosome-bearing sperm cells in the collection system of the apparatus in about 20 minutes. This is enough sperm cells to fill several dozen straws. Moreover, a batch can include the combined sperm cells by two or more different sorting cytometers. After being concentrated as described above, the sperm cells can be loaded into any number of straws and cryopreserved as a batch. For example, according to one embodiment of the invention, it takes about 5 minutes to add an extender (including both a protein source and a cryoprotectant) to a batch of sperm cells, and about 15 minutes to load the sperm cells into artificial insemination straws using an automatic loading machine. All the straws in the batch are cooled simultaneously in a programmable freezer. Furthermore, the capacity of some programmable freezers allows simultaneous cryopreservation of thousands of artificial insemination straws. For example, the IceCube 1810CD freezer referred to above has the capacity to cryopreserve simultaneously over 2.500 0.5 ml straws or over 3.800 0.25 ml straws. Thus, one could wait to start the cooling step until multiple batches have been obtained. Alternatively, multiple batches could be obtained substantially at the same time by running multiple multi-channel flow cytometry machines (see below) in parallel and simultaneously cooling multiple batches obtained therefrom together in a programmable freezer. In one embodiment of the present invention, it takes a period of less than 220 minutes to cool the sperm cells from room temperature to a supercooled state and immerse them in liquid nitrogen (&#x2212;196&#xb0; C.). In another embodiment, the supercooling period is less than 190 minutes. In still another embodiment, the supercooling period is less than 150 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0526" num="1131">Those skilled in the art will recognize that substantial modifications may be made to the foregoing exemplary methods without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the sperm cells may be cryopreserved in a container other than an artificial insemination straw. Likewise, the steps in the method that involve changing or maintaining temperature may be performed by any suitable means, including water baths, liquid nitrogen vapors, and conventional programmable or non-programmable freezers, for example. Furthermore, a wide variety of substances or combinations of substances could be used as the protein source and/or the cryoprotectant without departing from the scope of the present invention. These substances include substances and concentrations of substances listed above in connection with the discussions regarding buffers, extenders, cryoprotectants, sheath fluids, and collection fluids. Moreover, the order of some steps in the method may be varied without departing from the scope of this invention. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</figref> indicates that the cryoprotectant is added after the concentration of the sorted sperm is adjusted, it is also contemplated that a cryoprotectant can be added before the concentration is adjusted without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the cryoprotectant may be provided in the collection fluid or in the sheath fluid used in connection with a flow cytometer. Some of the benefits of the present invention may also be obtained by partially cooling the sperm cells and then adding the cryoprotectant. Likewise, the order in which the protein source is added may be varied as long as the protein source is effective to protect the sperm cells from cold shock as they pass through the temperature range of about 14 to 8&#xb0; C.</p>
<heading id="h-0052" level="1">Cryopreservation Example I</heading>
<p id="p-0527" num="1132">Bovine semen was collected, transported, and evaluated as described above. Two test tubes containing 5 ml each of TCA buffer (pH 7.3) were placed in one of two water baths for at least five minutes. One water bath was at a temperature of 35&#xb0; C. and the other water bath was at 41&#xb0; C. Spermatozoa at 24&#xb0; C. were added to each tube so that the final concentration in each tube was 150&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm/ml. The two tubes were each divided into two aliquots which were kept in respective water baths. After the sperm had equilibrated with the TCA buffer for five minutes, 80 &#x3bc;M Hoechst 33342 was added to one of 35&#xb0; C. aliquots and one of the 41&#xb0; C. aliquots. After addition of the Hoechst 33342, all four aliquots were incubated for 20 minutes in their respective water bath. After incubation, the test tubes were removed from the water baths and left at room temperature (about 25&#xb0; C.) for five minutes. Then the contents of each test tube were diluted with a TCA extender containing 20% egg yolk and 6% glycerol (v/v) (pH 7.0) to a final concentration of 20&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm/ml. The contents of each test tube were then used to fill a 0.5 ml artificial insemination straw. Each of the four straws was placed in a programmable freezer (an IceCube 1810CD freezer from Minitube of America, Wis.). The following cooling sequence was programmed into the programmable freezer: (1) 22&#xb0; C. to 4&#xb0; C. @-0.2&#xb0; C./min; (2) hold at 4&#xb0; C. for 30 min; (3) 4&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;15&#xb0; C. @-3.0&#xb0; C./min; and (4)-15&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. @-10.0&#xb0; C./min. After reaching &#x2212;80&#xb0; C., the straws were immersed in liquid nitrogen (&#x2212;196&#xb0; C.) for 45 minutes. Then the straws were immersed in a 37&#xb0; C. water bath for 50 seconds to thaw. Sperm motility was checked under a phase contrast microscope both before and after cryopreservation. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>. The post-thaw motility was generally on the order of 60%. This represents a decline in motility of only about 5-11% compared to before cryopreservation. Analysis of variance revealed no significant effect of either Hoechst 33342 or incubation at 41&#xb0; C. on post-thaw sperm motility.</p>

If the system check is positive, the microprocessor directs the system to flush <b>777</b> the nozzle system with a suitable fluid, and then a quality control material <b>779</b>, such as beads or bovine nuclei, are run through the system to initialize the detection parameters (see <b>739</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>) and confirm that the system is operating within an acceptable quality control. This involves an evaluation of the control material to test the sensitivity and precision of the system to confirm that the system can adequately discriminate a sample. If the quality control is not confirmed after three attempts <b>775</b>, user intervention <b>773</b> is requested.</p>
<p id="p-0530" num="1135">If the quality control material indicates an acceptable level of quality control, a sample <b>781</b> is aspirated and a portion or aliquot of the sample to be sorted is checked for quality <b>783</b>. Sample quality may be determined by a calculation of a quality factor (Q-factor) of the sample. For example, the type of cells may be detected in a first aliquot of the sample. During this detection, the initialized detection parameters (<b>741</b>) are rechecked and the initial discrimination parameters (<b>745</b>) are generated. If the type of cells detected in the aliquot indicates that the sample meets or exceeds a preset standard (e.g., that the sample can be discriminated to yield a certain purity or motility and, in particular, that there are sufficient live X cells available for processing), then the system continues operation. If sample quality fails three times <b>775</b>, user interaction is requested.</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="1136">Continued operation involves sorting <b>785</b> of the remainder of the sample employing a six second repeated loop. At the beginning of the loop, the microprocessor confirms that sorting of the sample is not complete <b>789</b>. If the sorting of the sample is complete <b>789</b>, the microprocessor proceeds to aspirate the next sample <b>781</b> if it is available or to turn off the sorting operation <b>793</b> if additional sample is not available. If the sample is not complete <b>789</b>, the microprocessor initially checks the X/Y discrimination <b>795</b> of the sample to confirm that it is within an optimum range. In other words, drift analysis as noted above (<b>761</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>) is conducted. If any changes should be made, such changes are implemented and the discrimination <b>795</b> is again checked. If the discrimination is still unacceptable at this point, the sort is turned off <b>793</b> and user interaction is requested.</p>
<p id="p-0532" num="1137">Otherwise, the system proceeds to determine whether the fluid delivery system is delivering fluid and cells at a rate which is within an optimum range <b>801</b>. This determination depends on the type of control strategy used. For the high recovery control strategy, the optimum rate would be determined by evaluating purity or looking at x/x+&#x2dc;X of the collected population. If the determined purity is higher than a required purity level, the feed input rate of the cells is increased by increasing a rate control signal provided to the syringe pump <b>803</b>. This would tend to increase coincident cells and decrease purity because more coincident cells including &#x2dc;X cells would be collected with the X cells. If the determined purity is lower than the required purity, the feed input rate of the cells is decreased by decreasing a rate control signal provided to the syringe pump to reduce the frequency of coincident cells <b>803</b>. Thus, the cell input rate is a function of the determined purity of the collected population as compared to a desired purity level, e.g., a function of the identified &#x2dc;X sperm cells collected.</p>
<p id="p-0533" num="1138">For the high purity control strategy, the optimum rate would be determined by calculating lost X cells, e.g., discarded X/discarded X+collected X. If the quantity or percentage of lost X cells are less than an acceptable level, the input rate of the cells is increased by increasing a rate control signal provided to the syringe pump <b>803</b>. This would tend to increase coincident cells and increase the number of discarded X cells because more cells including X cells would be discarded with the Y cells. If the quantity or percentage of lost X cells is higher than the acceptable level, the input rate of the cells is decreased by decreasing a rate control signal provided to the syringe pump <b>803</b> to decrease coincident cells. Thus, the cell input rate is a function of the determined lost X cells of the discarded population as compared to number of X cells in the collected population, e.g., a function of the number of X sperm cells not collected.</p>
<p id="p-0534" num="1139">If this modified rate is acceptable <b>805</b>, the system proceeds to another system check <b>807</b>. If the system check is acceptable <b>807</b>, the sort continues in the six second loop. If not, the system is reset <b>809</b>. If after reset the system is not acceptable or if the revised feed rate is not acceptable <b>811</b>, the sort is turned off <b>793</b> and user intervention is requested <b>773</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0535" num="1140">The sorted droplet streams are collected by the collection system <b>2201</b>. Droplets that are sorted into the population of X cells pass through the exit window <b>2245</b> in the first intercepting device <b>2247</b> to be intercepted by the second intercepting device <b>2249</b>. From there, the droplets containing the X cells flow into a collection vessel <b>2207</b>. Other droplets are intercepted by the first intercepting device <b>2247</b> and directed to the waste trough <b>2805</b>. Of course droplets intercepted by the first intercepting device could also be saved, as noted above. When a suitable amount of X-bearing sperm cells have been collected in the collection vessel, sorting may be interrupted to allow concentration of sperm cells in the collection vessel <b>2207</b>. A new collection vessel may be placed under the first intercepting device <b>2247</b> or the collected fluid may be poured into a different container and the collection vessel replaced. Then sorting may resume. The sperm cells in the collected fluid are concentrated, loaded in straws, and frozen as described above.</p>
<p id="h-0054" num="0000">Temperature Control During Operation</p>
<p id="p-0536" num="1141">Temperature control throughout the process may be used to improve the results of the process. As has already been discussed above, the temperature of the sperm may be controlled during various steps in the process (e.g., staining and cryopreservation). In several embodiments of this invention, the temperatures of the sperm cells throughout the various steps of the method are controlled to achieve improved results.</p>
<p id="p-0537" num="1142">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105</figref> is a work flow diagram of one embodiment of a method of temperature control according to the present invention. The temperature of semen samples at the time they are collected will be determined by the body temperature of the animal from which they are collected. For example, at step <b>2601</b> bovine semen samples are collected at about 37&#xb0; C. An insulated container is used for transportation of the semen samples to the lab from the collection site at step <b>2603</b>. The insulated container retards cooling of the sperm.</p>
<p id="p-0538" num="1143">During sample evaluation at step <b>2605</b>, the temperature is maintained below the collection temperature, but in excess of a temperature corresponding to a glass transition temperature below which the sperm cells suffer membrane damage. For example the temperature may be maintained in the range of about 18-37&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the temperature may be maintained in the range of about 24-37&#xb0; C. during sample evaluation. In a particular embodiment, the sperm cells are placed in an environment having a temperature in the range of about 22-25&#xb0; C. during sample evaluation. Depending on the temperature of the sperm upon arrival at the lab, the effect of placing them in an environment having a temperature in the range of about 22-25&#xb0; C. may be to continue slow cooling of the sperm, to maintain the temperature of the sperm, or to slightly raise the temperature of the sperm. In one embodiment, the temperature may be elevated (e.g., to 40&#xb0; C. or higher) for staining at step <b>2607</b> as discussed in the staining section. In another embodiment, the temperature of the sperm cells during the staining step may be in the range of about 20-40&#xb0; C., as is also discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="1144">At step <b>2609</b>, the stained semen mixture is held in a water bath until such time that the mixture is introduced into a flow cytometer. The temperature of the water bath may be similar to the temperature used for the staining step. In one embodiment the temperature of the water bath is in the range of about 40-47&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the temperature of the water bath is in the range of about 20-37&#xb0; C. In still another embodiment, the temperature of the water bath is in the range of about 20-25&#xb0; C. After being held in the water bath for any time between one minute and two hours, the stained sperms cells are sorted by flow cytometry as discussed above at step <b>2611</b>. At step <b>2613</b>, the collected sperm cells are concentrated. Concentration may be performed in an environment that has a temperature that will not significantly change the temperature of the sperm cells. For example, in one embodiment, concentration may be performed in an environment having a temperature in the range of about 20 and 25&#xb0; C. An extender, protein source, and cryoprotectant are added to the concentrated sperm at step <b>2615</b>. Then, at step <b>2617</b> the sperm cells are loaded into artificial insemination straws. In one embodiment, the loading step is performed in an environment having a temperature that will not significantly change the temperature of the sperm cells. Finally, at step <b>2619</b> the temperature of the sperm is controlled during cryopreservation as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0540" num="1145">In another embodiment, sperm cells may be stained at still lower temperatures without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, it may be desired to sort the sperm cells in a flow cytometer at a relatively low temperature (e.g., about 0&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C.). This may require modification of the overall temperature control. First, when cooling the sperm cells prior to introduction into a flow cytometer, egg yolk and other common protein sources that protect the sperm cells from cold shock at temperatures below the glass transition temperature generally may not be used as such protein-containing substances tend to foul and/or clog the fluidics of the flow cytometer. Thus, it is desirable to cool the sperm cells before performing the staining step in order to take advantage of natural cold shock protectants found in neat semen, such as for example, the seminal fluid. Any attempt to stain the sperm cells prior to cooling would require addition of buffers to protect the sperm which would dilute the neat semen and reduce the natural protection against cold shock.</p>
<p id="p-0541" num="1146">Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention for sorting the sperm cells at a temperature in the range of about 0&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. includes placing the sperm cells in an environment having a temperature less than about 8&#xb0; C. to cool the sperm cells to a temperature in the range of about 0&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. prior to staining. Any method may be used to cool the sperm cells, but it is desirable to use a method that protects against rapid temperature fluctuations of the sperm cells during the cooling process. For example, in one embodiment, a container holding the sperm cells is placed in a room temperature water bath, which in turn is placed in an environment having a temperature less than about 8&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the temperature of the sperm cells is monitored and ice is added to the water bath to further cool the sperm cells. The staining step may be performed as described above except that the staining mixture is subjected to a temperature in the range of about 0&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. Due to the lower temperature, the incubation period required to stain the cells is considerably longer. Once the sperm cells have been cooled to 8&#xb0; C. or below, it is desirable to avoid warming them. Thus, another embodiment of the present invention is to operate the flow cytometer in an environment having a temperature in the range of about 0&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. Similarly, another embodiment of the present invention is to collect the sorted sperm cells in a collection vessel that is surrounded by an environment having a temperature in the range of about 0&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. Still another embodiment of the present invention is to add any extenders, cryoprotectants, buffers, protein sources, antibiotics, antioxidants, or other additives at a temperature in the range of about 0&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. With respect to addition of the cryoprotectant, it may be desirable to add slightly more of the cryoprotectant than would be added absent sorting the sperm cells at a temperature in the range of about 0&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. Thus, in one particular embodiment, a cryoprotectant containing 7% glycerol (v/v) is added to sperm cells after the sperm cells have been sorted at a temperature in the range of about 0&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0542" num="1147">Supercooling of the sperm cells from the temperature in the range of about 0&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. proceeds generally as described in the cryopreservation section above. However, the sperm cells will need to be held at a temperature in the range of about 0&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. for a period of time after addition of the cryoprotectant before supercooling to allow time for the sperm cells to equilibrate with the cryoprotectant. Thus, according to one embodiment, the sperm cells are allowed to equilibrate with the cryoprotectant for a period in the range of about 30 minutes to about 3 hours. In another embodiment, the sperm cells are allowed to equilibrate with the cryoprotectant for a period in the range of 1-2 hours. In another particular embodiment, the sperm cells are allowed to equilibrate with the cryoprotectant for a period of about 90 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0543" num="1148">Conventional temperature control apparatus and methods (e.g., water baths, incubators, coolers, and freezers) may be used to heat or cool the sample to attain or maintain the specified temperatures in the foregoing embodiments of the invention. It is understood that placing a sample in an environment having a different temperature than the sample, will cause the temperature of the sample to change over time. There may even be temperature variations within the sample. As has been mentioned, it is desirable to change the temperature of the sample gradually to help maintain the health of the sperm. Gradual temperature change also serves to reduce the temperature variation within the sample. As is well known by those skilled in the art, the rate of temperature change of the sample will be influenced by many factors, including the volume of the sample, the size and shape of the sample container, and the magnitude of the temperature difference between the sample and the environment. However, those skilled in the art will readily be able to select an appropriate method and apparatus to achieve the desired temperature control after considering all the relevant factors.</p>
<p id="p-0544" num="1149">Those skilled in the art will recognize that there is room for substantial variation in the exemplary temperature control without departing from the scope of the invention. In general, once the sperm cells have been chilled, it is desirable to avoid warming them. Furthermore, temperature variations discussed above in connection with sample collection, staining, sorting, droplet collection, concentration, and cryopreservation can be incorporated into the overall temperature control without departing from the scope of the present invention. Moreover, the time at which sperm cells remain at any temperature can also impact the health of the sperm. Thus, processing according to the embodiment in which temperature is controlled throughout the process is desirably completed within a timeline as discussed below.</p>
<p id="h-0055" num="0000">Timeline for Operation</p>
<p id="p-0545" num="1150">Generally, it is desirable to complete the sperm sorting process in the least amount of time possible to reduce the damage to the sperm. As discussed above, the present invention may include staining at an elevated temperature to reduce the time needed to stain the sperm cells. For example, certain embodiments of the improved staining method described reduce the time require for staining to about 10 minutes. Likewise, the novel cytometer described above may be used to sort sperm cells in less time than would be required by a conventional cytometer. For example, a flow cytometer using the technology discussed above can collect between 2,000 and 10,000 sperm cells having a desired DNA characteristic per second. Furthermore, the cryopreservation process may be used to reduce the time needed to complete cryopreservation of the processed sperm cells compared to conventional cryopreservation methods. Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention involves processing sperm pursuant to an overall method to take advantage of one or more of the timesaving innovations to reduce the time required to complete the entire process. For example, according to one embodiment of the present invention, a batch of sperm cells (e.g., an ejaculate) is collected from a male mammal (e.g., bull), evaluated for quality control, stained, sorted according to a specified DNA characteristic, loaded into one or more containers (e.g., straws), and cryopreserved within a period of about 12 hours from the time of collection. In another embodiment, the period is less than about 8 hours. In another embodiment, the period is less than about 6 hours. In still another embodiment, the period is less than about 3 hours. In yet another embodiment, the period of time is less than about 2 hours. In another embodiment, the period of time is less than about 1 hour.</p>
<p id="h-0056" num="0000">Multi-Channel Sorting Apparatus and Method</p>
<p id="p-0546" num="1151">In order to sort more sperm in less time, it is possible to use more than one cytometry unit in parallel to sort that same sperm sample. One way to do this is to simply divide the stained sperm cells into multiple aliquots and run each aliquot through a different cytometer. However, as will be discussed below, certain advantages may be obtained by designing an apparatus that comprises multiple cytometry units in a single integrated multi-channel cytometry unit.</p>
<p id="h-0057" num="0000">Multi-Channel System Sharing Integrated Platform</p>
<p id="p-0547" num="1152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 106-116</figref> show one embodiment of the invention comprising a multi-channel cytometry system, generally designated <b>1001</b>, where multiple single-channel flow cytometry units, designated <b>1003</b>, are ganged together as an integrated system to produce sorted product. Four such units are illustrated in this particular embodiment, but this number can vary. The units may be integrated in various ways, as by sharing an integrated platform comprising one or more of the following elements (1) a common supply of particles <b>1005</b>; (2) a common source of electromagnetic radiation <b>1007</b>; (3) a common housing <b>1009</b>; (4) a common input for controlling operation of the units <b>1011</b>; (5) a common output <b>1019</b> allowing evaluation of the operation of one unit relative to another unit; (6) a common fluid delivery system <b>1021</b>; (7) a common temperature control system <b>1023</b>; (7) a common power source <b>1025</b>; (8) a common waste recovery system <b>1027</b>; (9) a common deflector plate system <b>1029</b>; and (9) a common cleaning system <b>1031</b>. In one embodiment, the system includes all of these elements, but it will be understood that a multi-channel system of this invention can include any combination of elements. The use of common elements is beneficial because it allows the system to be run more efficiently and profitably, achieves more consistent results among channels by reducing the number of variables, facilitates any trouble-shooting that may be needed, and is economical. The multi-channel approach also makes the sorting system more amenable to scale up or scale-down.</p>
<p id="p-0548" num="1153">Each of the cytometry units <b>1003</b> has components similar to certain components of the flow cytometry apparatus <b>9</b> of the previous embodiment and, for convenience, corresponding parts are designated by the same reference numbers with the addition of a prime (&#x2032;). In general, each unit comprises a nozzle system <b>101</b>&#x2032;, a mount for mounting the nozzle system <b>331</b>&#x2032;, a transducer <b>105</b>&#x2032;, and an epi-illumination optics instrument <b>417</b>&#x2032; for focusing a beam of light <b>25</b>&#x2032; on the fluid stream <b>21</b>&#x2032; exiting the nozzle orifice <b>103</b>&#x2032;, all as previously described. Each unit further comprises a photodetector <b>117</b>&#x2032; operable as in the first embodiment to detect fluorescence emissions <b>31</b>&#x2032; from the particles in the stream <b>21</b>&#x2032; and to convert the emissions <b>31</b>&#x2032; to electrical signals <b>701</b>&#x2032; which are processed to classify the particles by a specified DNA characteristic. Each unit <b>1003</b> is also equipped for sorting the droplets <b>33</b>&#x2032; into different groups or populations <b>123</b>&#x2032;, <b>125</b>&#x2032; according to the classification of particles contained in the droplets <b>35</b>&#x2032;. The populations of droplets sorted by the units are collected by the collection system <b>2201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0549" num="1154">A. Common Housing and Modularity</p>
<p id="p-0550" num="1155">The flow cytometry units are mounted in a modular arrangement in a common housing <b>1009</b>. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. <b>106</b> and <b>109</b>-<b>113</b>, the housing has a base <b>1069</b> and two side walls <b>1071</b> extending up from the base. The side walls have a lower pair of shoulders <b>1073</b> for supporting a lower cover panel <b>1075</b> at the front of the housing <b>1077</b>, and an upper pair of shoulders <b>1081</b>. A lower cover panel <b>1075</b> at the front of the housing <b>1077</b> is mounted between the lower shoulders <b>1073</b>. The upper shoulders <b>1081</b> support an upper cover panel <b>1083</b> at the rear of the housing <b>1085</b>. The front and rear of the housing <b>1077</b>, <b>1085</b> are substantially open to provide access to the equipment inside. It will be understood that the housing <b>1009</b> may have other configurations without departing from the scope of the invention. Further, it will be understood that the various units could be installed in separate housings.</p>
<p id="p-0551" num="1156">The flow cytometry units <b>1003</b> are mounted side-by-side as modules on an appropriate framework <b>1087</b> in the housing <b>1009</b>. Specifically, the nozzle mounts <b>331</b>&#x2032; for positioning the nozzles <b>101</b>&#x2032; are releasably attached to a cross bar <b>1089</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref>) affixed to the side walls <b>1071</b> of the housing, and the bases <b>429</b>&#x2032; of the epi-illumination instruments <b>417</b>&#x2032; are releasably fastened to an angled mounting plate <b>1093</b> extending between the side walls <b>1071</b> of the housing toward the rear of the housing <b>1085</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109</figref>), the arrangement being such that a particular unit can be installed or removed as a module. This modularity facilitates installation, removal for maintenance and/or replacement, and enables any number of flow cytometry units <b>1003</b> to be readily added as needed or desired to increase the throughput capacity of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0552" num="1157">B. Common Fluid Supply and Delivery Systems</p>
<p id="p-0553" num="1158">The fluid delivery system <b>1021</b> of this embodiment is equipped to provide appropriate fluids to each of the cytometry units <b>1003</b>. As illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 108</figref>, the system generally comprises a pump <b>1105</b> for conveying carrier fluid IT from a common supply of carrier fluid <b>1107</b> under pressure, a gas pressure system <b>1115</b> for conveying fluid from a common supply <b>1117</b> of sheath fluid <b>19</b>&#x2032; under pressure, and a manifold system <b>1121</b> for receiving the fluids from respective supplies and delivering the fluids under pressure to the various cytometry units <b>1003</b>, as needed. In the specific embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 116</figref>, the supply of carrier fluid comprises a vessel <b>1123</b> containing a suitable volume of such fluid (e.g., 5 ml.). The vessel is held by a holder <b>1125</b>, which may be a block <b>1133</b> having a cavity <b>1135</b> sized to receive the vessel <b>1123</b>. The block also has a second cavity <b>1137</b> for holding a vessel <b>1139</b> containing a suitable buffer material for conditioning the system during use, as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0554" num="1159">The pump <b>1105</b> for delivering carrier fluid from the vessel is desirably (but not necessarily) a syringe pump <b>1141</b> as previously described. The plunger of the pump is movable through an intake stroke to aspirate a selected volume of carrier fluid <b>17</b>&#x2032; from the vessel <b>1139</b> and through a discharge stroke to dispense carrier fluid through a supply line <b>1147</b> to the manifold <b>1177</b> and from there to the various nozzles <b>101</b>&#x2032; of the system. The syringe pump is also operable to aspirate fluid from the vessel <b>1139</b> containing buffer and to pump the buffer through the system in a manner to be described. A three-way valve <b>1149</b> controls the flow of carrier and buffer fluids to and from the pump <b>1141</b>. The pump is driven by a variable speed motor under the control of the processor <b>131</b>&#x2032;. By way of example, the pump may be driven by a stepper motor which operates at selectively variable speeds to pump carrier fluid to the manifold system <b>1121</b> at rates necessary to obtain the desired throughput from the units <b>1003</b>. Multiple syringe pumps or other types of fluid delivery devices can be used instead of a single syringe pump.</p>
<p id="p-0555" num="1160">In one embodiment the supply <b>1117</b> of sheath fluid comprises a vessel <b>1155</b>, e.g., a tank connected to the manifold <b>1177</b> by means of a supply line <b>1157</b>. The gas pressure system <b>1115</b> is operable to pressurize the tank and comprises a source of pressurized gas <b>1161</b> (e.g., air or nitrogen) communicating with the tank via a gas line <b>1163</b> having a regulator <b>1165</b> in it for controlling the pressure supplied to the tank, and a two-way valve <b>1167</b> which, in a first position, establishes communication between the tank and the gas source, and in a second position, is operable to vent the tank. The gas pressure regulator <b>1165</b> is a conventional regulator adjustable to control the pressure supplied from the air source. The gas pressure system <b>1115</b> also includes a gas line <b>1169</b> for pressurizing a supply <b>1173</b> of cleaning solution (e.g., de-ionized water in a tank) which can be used to flush the fluid circuitry in a manner to be described hereinafter. Flow through the gas line is controlled by a two-way valve <b>1167</b> operable in the same manner as valve <b>1167</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0556" num="1161">In one embodiment, the manifold <b>1177</b> comprises a laminated block <b>1179</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 112</figref>) of material having passages <b>1181</b> formed in it to define a fluid flow circuit <b>1185</b> such as that shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 116</figref>. (The passages may be formed by machining grooves in faces of the laminations prior to assembly of the laminations to form the block.) The fluid circuit includes inlets <b>1189</b>, <b>1191</b> connected to the syringe pump <b>1141</b> and to the supply <b>1117</b> of sheath fluid, and sets of outlets <b>1193</b>, for providing such fluids to the flow cytometry units <b>1003</b>, each such set including a carrier fluid outlet and a sheath fluid outlet. Flow through the various flow passages <b>1181</b> is controlled by valves V<b>1</b>-V<b>6</b> which, in one embodiment, are solenoid-operated valves in housings attached to the manifold block <b>1179</b>. The block is desirably of substantially transparent material (e.g., acrylic plastic) to facilitate monitoring of the system <b>1121</b> and trouble-shooting. In the embodiment shown, the manifold <b>1177</b> is attached to a frame member <b>1203</b> extending between the side walls <b>1071</b> of the housing <b>1009</b> adjacent the bottom of the housing below the nozzle systems <b>101</b>&#x2032;. The inlets and outlets <b>1193</b>, of the manifold <b>1177</b> may comprise fittings <b>1205</b> threaded into the block, such as flangeless nut and ferrule fittings available from Upchurch Scientific, a division of Scivex. It will be understood that the design and construction of the fluid circuit <b>1185</b> in general and the manifold <b>1177</b> in particular may vary without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0557" num="1162">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 116</figref>, the manifold fluid circuit <b>1185</b> for the carrier fluid <b>17</b>&#x2032; includes a sample reservoir <b>1207</b> for holding a limited supply of carrier fluid (e.g., 1.0 ml). If the carrier fluid contains sperm cells, for example, providing such a reservoir close to the nozzles <b>101</b>&#x2032; is beneficial to the viability and motility of the sperm cells, since the storage of such cells, even for short periods of time, in small spaces may be detrimental to motility. Flow of carrier fluid from the sample reservoir <b>1207</b> to the nozzles <b>101</b>&#x2032; is controlled by a series of two-way valves V<b>1</b>A-V<b>1</b>D, one for each nozzle. Each valve V<b>1</b>A-V<b>1</b>D has a first position establishing fluid communication between the needle <b>1217</b> of the sample reservoir and the needle <b>157</b>&#x2032; of a respective nozzle for delivery of carrier fluid <b>17</b>&#x2032; to the needle under pressure generated by the syringe pump <b>1141</b>, and a second position establishing fluid communication between the needle <b>1217</b> and a waste system, generally designated <b>1221</b>, which is common to all of the flow cytometry units <b>1003</b>. In the embodiment shown, the waste system <b>1221</b> comprises a waste tank <b>1223</b> for holding waste material, a mechanism <b>1225</b> such as a vacuum pump for generating a vacuum in the waste tank, and waste lines <b>1227</b> connecting the valves V<b>1</b>A-V<b>1</b>D and the waste tank. A valve V<b>3</b> is provided in the waste line upstream from the waste tank for opening and closing the waste line, as needed. A suitable hydrophobic filter <b>1233</b> is provided in the line connecting the waste tank <b>1223</b> and the vacuum pump <b>1225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0558" num="1163">The manifold fluid circuit <b>1185</b> for the sheath fluid <b>19</b>&#x2032; includes a plurality of valves V<b>2</b>A-V<b>2</b>D. Each valve has a first position establishing fluid communication with the supply <b>1117</b> of sheath fluid in the tank for delivery of sheath fluid <b>19</b>&#x2032; to a respective flow body <b>133</b>&#x2032; via a sheath supply line <b>1241</b>, and a second position establishing fluid communication between the flow body and the waste tank via a waste line <b>1247</b>. The pressure at which the sheath fluid is delivered to the flow bodies <b>133</b>&#x2032; will depend on the sheath tank pressure (as controlled by the regulator <b>1165</b>) which may range from 1 to 100 psi, more desirably from 10 to 50 psi, even more desirably 15 to 40 psi, and even more desirably from about 20 to 30 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0559" num="1164">While the use of a common supply for all of the units has various advantages, it is contemplated that at least some of the flow cytometry units could be supplied with sample material from separate sources.</p>
<p id="p-0560" num="1165">C. Common Power Supply and Input and Output Controls</p>
<p id="p-0561" num="1166">The flow cytometry units <b>1003</b> also share a common power supply <b>1025</b>, common power delivery systems, a common input (GUI) <b>715</b>&#x2032; for controlling operation of the channels by the microprocessor <b>131</b>&#x2032;, and a common output provided to the microprocessor allowing evaluation of the operation of one channel relative to another channel. For example, the common output includes providing the digitized signals from each epi-illumination system to the microprocessor for an indication of the fluorescence intensity measured by each channel, for an indication of the rate at which each channel is separating particles, for an indication of the staining variations (which may be indicated by the intensity difference of fluorescence pulses from X and Y cells) and for an indication of the decision boundaries <b>763</b> used by each channel for discriminating between particles. As another example, the common output includes providing the output signals from the break-off sensors <b>389</b>&#x2032; to the microprocessor for an indication of the droplet break-off location <b>107</b>&#x2032; of each channel.</p>
<p id="p-0562" num="1167">D. Common Temperature Control</p>
<p id="p-0563" num="1168">Optionally, a temperature control system, generally designated <b>1257</b>, is provided to regulate the temperature of the contents of the vessels <b>1123</b> in the holding block <b>1133</b> and the temperature of the manifold <b>1177</b>. Such temperature control reduces the variability of the system, thus providing more consistent measurements between channels and, for certain types of cells (e.g., sperm cells), helping to maintain the viability of the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0564" num="1169">In one embodiment, the temperature control system <b>1257</b> comprises a fluid flow circuit <b>1259</b> comprising fluid passages <b>1263</b> in the holding block <b>1133</b> and fluid passages <b>1269</b> in the manifold block <b>1179</b>, and a control unit <b>1265</b> for circulating a thermal fluid (e.g., water) through the circuit at a selected temperature. The temperature is desirably such as to maintain the fluid, especially the carrier fluid, at an optimal temperature to maximize cell viability and, if sperm cells are involved, sperm motility. A valve shut-off V<b>6</b> is positioned in the circuit for controlling flow through the circuit. The temperature control unit may be used to maintain the sperm cells at the desired temperature prior to sorting as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0565" num="1170">All of the valves in the fluid delivery system <b>1021</b> are operated by conventional means, such as solenoids, under control of an operator or suitable programming. The various fluid flow lines connecting the components of the system outside the manifold block <b>1179</b> are desirably of substantially transparent plastic tubing for observing any blockages. For example, the tubing may be 0.0625 in. OD tubing of FEP polymer. The flow lines of the temperature control system <b>1257</b> are desirably somewhat larger (e.g., 0.125 in. OD) to provide greater flow capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0566" num="1171">E. Common Light Beam and Beam Splitting System</p>
<p id="p-0567" num="1172">As previously noted, the multi-channel system shares a common source of electromagnetic radiation or beam light <b>1007</b>. By way of example (and not limitation), the source may be a laser beam from a UV multiline laser primarily having wavelengths of 351.1 nm and 363.8 nm. Alternatively, it may be desirable to use a pulsed laser (e.g., a mode-locked laser), particularly to synchronize digital sampling with a pulsed laser (as discussed in the pulsed laser section) in order to increase the effective power delivered to each cytometry unit, thereby increasing the number of cytometry units that can be operated with a single laser.</p>
<p id="p-0568" num="1173">The power required to generate the laser beam will vary depending on the requirements of each flow cytometry unit and the number of units. For example, if there are N units and each unit requires a light beam having an effective power of W watts, then it will be necessary to generate a laser beam having a power of (W&#xd7;N)+L, where L equals the system power loss among the optical elements of the system. Using a single laser to supply all of the flow cytometry units is economical compared to a system using multiple lasers. It is also efficient and provides for more consistent measurements from one channel to the next, because there is no variability on account of different beam characteristics (e.g., beam intensity, light polarity, beam divergence) or electrical noise resulting from the use of multiple lasers.</p>
<p id="p-0569" num="1174">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a beam splitting and guidance system is used to split a single laser beam into three or more separate beams. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117</figref>, for example, a 50/50 beamsplitter <b>1270</b> (i.e., a beamsplitter that is operable to divide a single beam into two separate beams having approximately equal intensity) can be used to split a single beam <b>25</b>&#x2032; into two beams <b>1270</b>A, <b>1270</b>B. By using a second 50/50 beamsplitter <b>1271</b> to split one of the two beams <b>1270</b>B into two additional beams <b>1271</b>A, <b>1271</b>B, one can generate a total of three beams <b>1270</b>A, <b>1271</b>A, <b>1271</b>B from a single beam <b>25</b>&#x2032;. Each beam can be directed into the optics system of a flow cytometer, for example an epi-illumination optics system <b>415</b>&#x2032; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117</figref>. One could also use additional 50/50 beamsplitters to split the single laser beam into any number of additional separate beams. As shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 118</figref>, for example, a third beamsplitter <b>1272</b> can be added to the 3-way beamsplitting system (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117</figref>) so that the three 50/50 beamsplitters <b>1270</b>, <b>1271</b>, <b>1272</b> can be used to split a single 25&#x2032; beam into four separate beams <b>1271</b>A, <b>1271</b>B, <b>1272</b>A, <b>1272</b>B. From this one can readily appreciate that the single beam can be split into any number of separate beams. Other beam splitting arrangements may be used to split the incoming source beam into multiple light beams for the various units.</p>
<p id="p-0570" num="1175">One desirable embodiment of a beamsplitting system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 106 and 109</figref>. A beam guidance system <b>1273</b> is provided for guiding the common beam <b>1007</b> to the optics instruments <b>417</b>&#x2032; of the various flow cytometry units <b>1003</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 106 and 111</figref>, the guidance system <b>1273</b> includes a lower mirror assembly <b>1279</b> mounted on one side wall <b>1071</b> of the housing <b>1009</b>, an upper mirror assembly <b>1281</b> mounted on the side wall <b>1071</b> above the lower mirror assembly, and a series of reflecting filters <b>1283</b>, one associated with each optics instrument <b>417</b>&#x2032;. The lower mirror assembly is operable to reflect a beam <b>1007</b> from a suitable source upwardly to the upper mirror assembly, and the upper mirror assembly is operable to reflect the beam through an opening in the side wall <b>1071</b> to the reflecting filters <b>431</b>&#x2032; of the various instruments <b>417</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0571" num="1176">In one embodiment, the lower mirror assembly includes a base <b>1285</b> fastened to the side wall <b>1071</b> of the housing <b>1009</b>, a stage <b>1289</b> movable vertically on the base by a suitable mechanism <b>1291</b>, such as a micrometer, a bitable platform <b>1293</b> on the stage (e.g., a kinematic optical mount Model P100-P available from Newport), and a mirror <b>1295</b> on the platform, the position of the mirror being adjustable by moving the stage and the mirror platform to the appropriate locations. The upper mirror assembly is similar to the lower assembly, comprising a base <b>1297</b>, a vertically movable stage <b>1299</b>, a tiltable platform on the stage <b>1301</b>, and a mirror <b>1303</b> on the platform. A pair of target plates <b>1309</b> are affixed to the side wall of the housing <b>1009</b> between the upper and lower mirror assemblies. The target plates <b>1309</b> have vertically aligned holes <b>1311</b> therein to facilitate adjustment of the upper and lower mirrors so that an incoming beam <b>1007</b> is precisely reflected toward the reflecting filters <b>431</b>&#x2032; of the instruments <b>417</b>&#x2032;, all of which filters are aligned with the incoming beam.</p>
<p id="p-0572" num="1177">Each of the first three reflecting filters <b>1315</b>, <b>1317</b>, <b>1319</b> functions as a beam splitter, i.e., it functions to reflect a specified percentage of the beam and to pass the remaining percentage of the beam. For example, in the case of four epi-illumination instruments, the reflecting filters <b>431</b>&#x2032; of the first three instruments each reflect a percentage of the laser light <b>1007</b>, so that each of the first three units of the series receives 25% of the electromagnetic radiation of the original beam <b>1007</b>. For example, the reflecting filters of the first, second and third units may reflect 25%, 33% and 50% of the incident light, respectively. The last reflecting filter <b>1321</b> of the series desirably reflects all of the remaining light (about 25% of the original beam) to the last instrument of the series. As a result, each of the four instruments should receive the same intensity of radiation (light) to interrogate the cells in respective streams.</p>
<p id="p-0573" num="1178">Depending on the beam splitting devices used in the above system <b>1273</b>, it may be desirable that the laser beam have a particular polarization. The transmittence-to-reflectance ratio of dielectric filters can vary depending on the polarization of the light. Further, when dealing with linearly polarized light, dielectric filters (which are manufactured for use at a specified angle of incidence) can be too sensitive to variations in the angle of incidence. Circularly or elliptically polarized light alleviates this problem to some extent because the polarization vector of the light is in a variety of different orientations with respect to the optical axis of a dielectric filter as the light interacts with the filter. Thus, elliptically or circularly polarized light simulates randomly polarized light, which provides more tolerance for variations in the angle of incidence on a dielectric filter. Accordingly, if the laser described above generates a beam of light having a vertical polarization, for example, it may be advantageous to convert the light to circularly polarized light before it is split. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, this can be accomplished by passing the beam through a &#xbc;-wave retardation plate (filter) of polarizing material having its optical axis rotated 45 degrees relative to the plane of the laser polarization. The beam thus transmitted by the waveplate will have approximately circular polarization, and it can be more easily split to provide multiple beams to the optics systems of respective flow cytometer units.</p>
<p id="p-0574" num="1179">Moreover, by rotating the wave retardation plate to alter the angle between the laser polarization and the optical axis of the material used to make the waveplate, eccentricity can be introduced into the approximately circular polarization of the beam (i.e., the polarization can be made more elliptical). Changing the eccentricity of the elliptical polarization of the beam can change the transmittance-to-reflectance ratio of the dielectric filters by causing the polarization vector for a greater percentage of the light to have a particular angle with respect to the optical axis of the dielectric filter. Accordingly, if the balance of light among the multiple cytometry units is outside the desired range, one can rotate the waveplate to increase or decrease the eccentricity of the elliptically polarized light, thereby altering the reflectance-to-reflectance ratios of the various filters until a better balance is achieved. Similarly, if the waveplate is transmitting elliptically polarized light, one can influence the reflectance-to-reflectance ratio of one of the filters by rotating that filter.</p>
<p id="p-0575" num="1180">Regardless of the method used to split the single beam into multiple separate beams. Balance of the power delivered to each cytometry unit can be achieved by selectively blocking a percentage of the light to bring all the cytometry units down to the same level of power. For example, the neutral density filter <b>447</b>&#x2032; of each epi-illumination system <b>415</b>&#x2032; can be selected to block more or less of the light to balance the illuminating power delivered by the beam splitting and guidance system to each individual cytometry unit. If one channel of a multi-channel unit receives significantly more illumination from the beam splitting and guidance system, a neutral density filter <b>467</b>&#x2032; that transmits less light can be used in the epi-illumination system <b>415</b>&#x2032; of that channel to bring the illumination power for that channel more in line with the other channels. It is desirable, though not essential, that channel-to-channel variations in the illuminating power be less than about 10%. It is even more desirable that the channel-to-channel variations be less than about 5%.</p>
<p id="p-0576" num="1181">It will also be appreciated that pulsed laser scanning, as described above, may be desirable for multi-channel flow cytometry. For example, the UV multiline laser can be replaced with a mode-locked pulsed laser operating at about 85 MHz to allow more flow cytometry channels to be powered by a single laser. For example, the peak power provided in each pulse of a mode-locked laser emitting pulses having a width (duration) of about 12 picoseconds at a frequency of about 85 MHz is approximately 800 times the average power output of the laser. Thus, a mode-locked laser (e.g., a Vanguard 350 from Spectra-Physics) can provide enough illumination energy to operate a few dozen cytometry units (e.g., 32 cytometry units) while operating at only about 350 milliwatts.</p>
<p id="p-0577" num="1182">The use of fiber optics for supplying light to the units is also contemplated. In this embodiment, fibers are used to direct light from the laser to respective units, thus eliminating the need for the guidance system described above.</p>
<p id="p-0578" num="1183">F. Common Deflector Plates</p>
<p id="p-0579" num="1184">In the embodiment shown in FIGS. <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>-<b>116</b>, the sorting system <b>119</b>&#x2032; of each flow cytometry unit <b>1003</b> is substantially identical to the sorting system <b>119</b> described in the first embodiment, except that the units desirably share two common deflector plates <b>1331</b> extending across the width of the housing <b>1009</b> at the front of the housing. There are advantages to using a common set of deflector plates, including a consistent charge from one channel to the next, the use of a common power supply, a larger plate area providing a more stable electric field and more uniform droplet deflection, and a consistent angle of deflection for collection of sorted samples. The deflector plates <b>1331</b> are mounted on a frame <b>1333</b> fastened to the housing <b>1009</b>. Alternatively, separate plates could be provided for each unit.</p>
<p id="p-0580" num="1185">G. Common Collection System</p>
<p id="p-0581" num="1186">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 107 and 116</figref>, a common collection system <b>2801</b> includes two intercepting devices for each cytometry unit as described above in connection with the collection system <b>2201</b> for the single unit. However, a common frame <b>2803</b> is provided to hold all eight of the intercepting devices. Also, one of the two intercepting devices for each cytometry unit directs fluid into a common waste trough <b>2805</b> rather than a collection vessel. The waste trough makes it easier to discard sorted droplets that contain particles of little value (e.g., Y-chromosome bearing sperm cells for breeding dairy cows). If it is desirable to retain all the sorted droplets, the waste trough can be removed and collection vessels can be placed under each intercepting device. The four collection vessels in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 107 and 116</figref> rest in openings in the surface of a collection tray <b>2807</b>. A common water bath (not shown) may be provided under the surface of the collection tray to control the temperature of the contents of the collection vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0582" num="1187">H. Multi-Channel Control</p>
<p id="p-0583" num="1188">The various flow cytometry units are controlled by the microprocessor <b>131</b>&#x2032;, (or other suitable processing system) which desirably has a common input and a common output as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0584" num="1189">Desirably, the operational parameters of each flow cytometry unit <b>1003</b> can be set independently of the other units so that such parameters can be varied as between units. These parameters may include, for example, the frequency of droplet formation, the control and sorting strategies utilized by a particular unit, the criteria used by each unit to classify and sort particles in the fluid supplied to the unit, and other parameters. For example, in certain situations it may be desirable to supply one or more units with carrier fluid <b>17</b>&#x2032; at a first flow rate and other units a second (different) flow rate. Similarly, it may be desirable to use one control sorting strategy (e.g., a &#x201c;high efficiency&#x201d; strategy) for one or more units while using a different strategy (e.g., a &#x201c;low loss&#x201d; strategy) for other units. By controlled variation of these parameters among the units, based on historical data and data collected on a real-time basis, the throughput of the units can be managed and the results of the system optimized. The capability of independent operation also allows selected units to be operated in the event fewer than all of the units are needed or available.</p>
<p id="p-0585" num="1190">I. Operation of Multi-Channel System</p>
<p id="p-0586" num="1191">The operation of the multi-channel system of this embodiment is similar to that described previously, except that the multiple flow cytometry units are adapted to conduct flow cytometry operations in parallel (i.e., during the same time period or overlapping time periods) for higher throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0587" num="1192">Prior to the start of a run, the fluid delivery system <b>1021</b> is flushed, if necessary, with cleaning solution from the tank <b>1173</b> by moving the valve V<b>5</b> to its cleaning position. The system is then conditioned by with buffer fluid using the syringe pump <b>1141</b>. During this procedure, the valves V<b>1</b>A-V<b>1</b>D and V<b>2</b>A-V<b>2</b>D are moved to establish communication with the waste receptacle <b>1223</b> which is under vacuum. As a result, the cleaning solution and/or buffer fluid flows through the system to waste. This process cleans the system <b>1021</b>, primes the syringe pump <b>1141</b> and removes air bubbles from the system.</p>
<p id="p-0588" num="1193">With the three-way valve <b>1149</b> suitably positioned, the syringe pump <b>1141</b> is operated through an intake stroke to aspirate a quantity of carrier fluid <b>17</b>&#x2032; containing particles, e.g., sperm cells, following which the valve <b>1149</b> is moved to establish communication with the manifold <b>1177</b> and the syringe pump moves through a discharge stroke to pump a volume of carrier fluid into the sample reservoir <b>1207</b> to fill it. The temperature of the carrier fluid <b>17</b>&#x2032; is controlled by the temperature control system <b>1257</b> to maintain the cells in the carrier fluid at the desired temperature. With the valves V<b>1</b>A-V<b>1</b>D positioned to establish communication with the sample reservoir <b>1207</b>, further operation of the syringe pump <b>1141</b> forces carrier fluid through the lines to the needles of respective nozzle assemblies for flow through the nozzles <b>101</b>&#x2032;, as previously described. At the same time, and with the valves V<b>2</b>A-V<b>2</b>D positioned to establish communication with the sheath fluid tank <b>1155</b>, sheath fluid <b>19</b>&#x2032; is forced through the supply lines to respective flow bodies and through the nozzles, also as previously described. This process continues for an appropriate length of time sufficient to pump a suitable volume of fluid through the system <b>1001</b>. The duration of a particular run will vary depending on the quantity of carrier fluid in the supply vessel, the rate at which the carrier fluid is pumped through the system, and the number of channels in the system. For example, a run may continue for only a limited period of time (e.g., 15 minutes during which about one ml. of carrier fluid is delivered to each nozzle) or it may continue indefinitely, with the supply of fluid being replenished as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0589" num="1194">In the event a needle <b>157</b>&#x2032; becomes clogged, the appropriate valve V<b>1</b> is moved to establish communication with the waste receptacle <b>1223</b>. Sheath fluid <b>19</b>&#x2032; entering the flow body <b>133</b>&#x2032; will then flow under the force of the vacuum <b>1225</b> back through the needle <b>157</b>&#x2032; to waste, thus flushing and clearing the needle. If there is a need to shut off the flow to a particular nozzle, the valves V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b> are simply switched to their waste positions.</p>
<p id="p-0590" num="1195">Although the system described herein with respect to both the single channel and multi-channel configurations has been described with regard to particle separation, such as the separation of X and Y cells, it is contemplated that such particles include any particles having different characteristics which may be arbitrarily noted as characteristic A and characteristic B. Further, it will be understood that in some embodiments, the sorting function can be eliminated entirely, so that the flow cytometry apparatus (single-channel or multi-channel) operates only to classify the particles and not to sort them.</p>
<p id="p-0591" num="1196">While the multi-channel system is described above in the context of operating the flow cytometry units in parallel, it will be understood that the units could also be operated in series. For example, it is contemplated that particles in one stream could be sorted by one unit into multiple populations, and that one or more of such sorted populations could then be passed through one or more other units in series to perform additional sorting operations to sort different particles using the same or different sorting strategies.</p>

<p id="p-0593" num="1198"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 119 and 120</figref> show another exemplary multi-channel flow cytometry system. This system, generally designated <b>4001</b> comprises four cytometry units <b>4009</b> ganged together. The nozzle system <b>101</b>&#x2032;, epi-illumination optics system <b>450</b>&#x2032;, deflector plates <b>629</b>&#x2032;, sample station <b>4051</b>, contamination prevention mechanism <b>4031</b> and other components of each unit <b>4009</b> are mounted on a shared vertical mounting board <b>4011</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 120</figref>, a single laser <b>4013</b> and a beam splitting and guidance system <b>4015</b>, which is substantially similar to the beam splitting and guidance system <b>1273</b> described above, provide illumination for each epi-illumination system <b>450</b>&#x2032;. The laser <b>4013</b> passes through a hole <b>4019</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 119</figref>) in a common housing <b>4021</b> containing the beam splitting and guidance system <b>4115</b>. The beam splitting and guidance system <b>4115</b> and epi-illumination systems <b>450</b>&#x2032; are on one side of the board <b>4011</b>. The focusing lens assembly <b>491</b>&#x2032; of each epi-illumination system <b>450</b>&#x2032; extends through the board <b>4011</b> to the other side (similarly to the configuration show in the single channel system shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 &#x26; 27</figref>), on which the remainder of the components for the units <b>4009</b> are mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0594" num="1199">The units <b>4009</b> are all oriented so that their nozzle systems <b>101</b>&#x2032; direct the fluid streams <b>21</b>&#x2032; downward. Each unit <b>4009</b> also has a collection system <b>4031</b>, which includes a collection vessel <b>4033</b> for collecting droplets <b>33</b> containing a desired population of particles and a waste container <b>4035</b> for collecting other droplets <b>33</b>. A water bath (not shown) or other temperature control may be used to control the temperature of the collection vessel <b>4033</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0595" num="1200">The multiple flow cytometry units <b>4009</b> can also share a common power supply (not shown), a common input for controlling operation of the units (not shown), and a common output (not shown) allowing comparative evaluation of the operation of the units <b>4009</b> relative to one another. As demonstrated by comparison of the two exemplary multi-channel embodiments <b>1001</b>, <b>4001</b>, the nature of the integrated platform and the sharing of features between or among multiple flow cytometry units in a multi-channel system can be varied extensively without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0596" num="1201">The overall process described above can be performed with multi-channel sperm sorting to decrease the time required to sort the sperm cells. With few exceptions, the method does not change. One minor change is that sorted sperm cells will be collected in multiple collection vessels. The contents of the multiple collection vessels can be combined for concentration if desired. Alternatively, the contents of each collection vessel can be concentrated separately. It will be appreciated that the time required to sort a batch of sperm cells (e.g., an ejaculate) from collection to completion of the cryopreservation step can be significantly reduced by using multiple cytometry units to process the batch. For example, if four cytometry units operate in parallel to process the batch of sperm cells, the time required to complete sorting is reduced to approximately one quarter of the time required to sort the batch using a single cytometry unit. Thus, by substituting the step of sorting sperm with four cytometry units operating in parallel with the step of sorting sperm with a single cytometry unit, the exemplary timeline for completion of the method from collection to completion of the freezing step can be reduced. The time can be reduced even further by increasing the number of cytometers operating in parallel to sort the sperm cells in the sample, subject to the practical limitations involved in operating a parallel system having more than four such units. Thus, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the sorting step in the overall process described above is performed by sorting the sperm cells according to a specified DNA characteristic in a multi-channel flow cytometry apparatus. In yet another embodiment, a sperm processing method comprises the step of sorting sperm cells according to a specified DNA characteristic in a multi-channel flow cytometry apparatus in which each channel collects in the range of about 2,000-10,000 sperm cells having a desired DNA characteristic per second.</p>

<p id="p-0597" num="1202">Bull semen was collected from a sexually mature bull using an artificial vagina and the sample transported to a nearby staining facility in a temperature-controlled container at 37&#xb0; C. Upon receipt, the semen was analyzed for concentration, visual motility, motility and progressive motility by the Hamilton-Thorn Motility Analyzer (IVOS), according to standard and well known procedures (Farrell et al. <i>Theriogenology, </i>49(4): 871-9 (March 1998)).</p>
<p id="p-0598" num="1203">Six tubes of 1 mL of 150&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm/mL sperm suspension were prepared by suspending an aliquot of semen in 41&#xb0; C. TCA #2 buffer containing 10 mM pyruvate bringing the overall pH to 7.35. Then varying amounts of 10 mM Hoechst 33342 solution in water were added to the sperm samples to yield final dye concentrations of 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, &#x26; 700 &#x3bc;M Hoechst 33342. Each of the six samples was incubated at 41&#xb0; C. for approximately 30 minutes. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry and the % CV of the X cell population was estimated by iterative computer algorithm for the 200, 300, and 400 &#x3bc;M Hoechst 33342 samples. The % CV for the 300 and 200 &#x3bc;M Hoechst 33342 were both ascertained to be within the acceptable range near 1.3% CV. Accordingly, it was determined that a concentration of 250 &#x3bc;M Hoechst 33342 would be used to stain a batch of sperm cells for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0599" num="1204">Two tubes containing 2 mL each of 150&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>sperm/mL sperm suspension were prepared by suspending an aliquot of semen in 41&#xb0; C. TCA #2 buffer containing 10 mM pyruvate (again bringing the overall pH to 7.35). Then 10 mM Hoechst 33342 solution in water was added to each of the two sperm suspensions to yield a final dye concentration of 250 &#x3bc;M Hoechst 33342. The sperm suspensions were maintained in a 41&#xb0; C. water bath for 30 min. After 30 minutes, the sperm suspensions were removed from the 41&#xb0; C. water bath and 4 &#x3bc;L of 25 mg/mL FD&#x26;C #40 was added to one of the suspensions. The other was stored at ambient temperature to provide comparison samples for the assessment assays.</p>
<p id="p-0600" num="1205">The stained and quenched sperm suspension was loaded onto the sample port of one channel of a four channel droplet sorting flow cytometer. Delbecco's PBS was used as the sheath fluid. The cytometer was equipped with a orienting nozzle as described above and having a 60 micron orifice. An semicircular baffle plate was installed perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the nozzle as described above. The transducer was operated at 54 KHz and the droplet break-off location was controlled manually. An epi-illumination optics system as described above was used to direct approximately 25% of the beam of a continuous, wave laser to intersect the fluid stream at a perpendicular angle. The focusing and collection lens had a 0.65 numerical aperture. The beam was focused to a spot having a width less than 3 &#x3bc;m for slit scanning the sperm cells. Digital signal processing was used to extract the critical slope difference and pulse area for each detected pulse waveform. Classification parameters for classification of X cells, Y cells, and undetermined cells in the two-dimensional CSD and pulse area feature space were manually entered into the processing system for classifying sperm cells according to chromosome content.</p>
<p id="p-0601" num="1206">Sperm were sorting according to X and Y chromosome content using a coincidence accept sort strategy for collection of X cells, assigning a 50/50 probability that each unclassified sperm was an X cell or Y cell. The sample fluid rate was manually adjusted to maintain purity of collected X cell population (as indicated by the GUI) at 85% or better and to maintain the rate of X cell collection above a minimum rate. After approximately fifteen million X sperm had been collected in a tube that had been soaked in sheath fluid for at least one hour and then coated with 0.5 mL of 10% egg yolk in TCA #2 buffer at pH 7.0, the tube was removed and replaced with an additional tube that has been similarly prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0602" num="1207">Immediately after removing a collection tube from the flow cytometer, a comparison sample from the stained, but not sorted, sperm suspension was prepared. The sorted and comparison samples were centrifuged for 7 min @ 750 g in a 15 mL tube. The supernatants were removed using a transfer pipette to yield a concentration of approximately 40 million sperm/mL. TCA #2 buffer pH 7.0 was added to the sperm suspensions to yield a final concentration of approximately 20 million sperm/mL. This process continued until the flow cytometer had produced four collection tubes (A<b>2</b>-A<b>5</b>). The sorted samples and &#x2018;non-sorted&#x2019; comparison samples were assessed by IVOS. Sorted sample A<b>3</b> and its non-sorted comparison sample were tested for % intact acrosomes by differential interference contrast microscopy. All the sorted samples were counted by hemacytometer to determine the output rate of sorted sperm per hour. The % X chromosome bearing sperm was confirmed by flow cytometer reanalysis. Results of the IVOS assessment for the sorted and &#x2018;non-sorted&#x2019; comparison samples are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 121</figref> (motility) and <b>122</b> (progressive motility). The total number of sperm sorted into each collection tube is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 123</figref>. The rate of sperm sorted per hour for each collection period is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref>. Percentage of X chromosome bearing sperm for each sorted sample is listed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 125</figref>. Results of the assessment of the acrosome integrity were 72% intact acrosomes for the sorted sample and 78% for the non-sorted comparison sample.</p>
<p id="p-0603" num="1208">The results demonstrate the technical ability to yield more than 5,000 sorted X cells per second at greater than 85% purity per channel of multi-channel flow cytometry system for sustained periods. The results also show the technical ability to yield more than 7,000 X cells per second at greater than 85% purity for sustained periods under ideal conditions. Further, the results indicate that samples of sorted sperm cells obtained by such high-speed flow cytometric sorting will suffer only slight declines in motility, indicating that the sorted sperm will have good fertility.</p>

<p id="p-0624" num="1229">After the particles have been interrogated and classified, they may be sorted using any conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art, as by use of a fluid switching device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 137</figref> or other suitable devices such as photo-damage systems or droplet sorting systems.</p>

<p id="h-0065" num="0000">Photo-Damage Sorting</p>
<p id="p-0625" num="1230">The flow cytometry improvements of this invention are applicable not only to droplet cell sorting as described above, but also to other sorting techniques, such as sorting by photo-damage (laser ablation). Photodamage sorting is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,395,397, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 136</figref> schematically illustrates one embodiment of a single-channel flow cytometry photo-damage system, generally designated by the reference number</p>
<p id="p-0626" num="1231">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 136</figref>, the photo-damage sorting system <b>1351</b> is similar to the droplet sorting system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and corresponding parts are designated by corresponding reference numbers with the addition of a double prime (&#x2033;). In general, the system comprises the same components as the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, except that the droplet sorting components are eliminated (e.g., the transducer <b>105</b>, the charging device <b>627</b>, the deflector plates <b>629</b>, and associated power sources <b>635</b>). Instead these components are replaced by a laser <b>1353</b> or similar device which is responsive to instructions received from the microprocessor <b>131</b>&#x2033; to ablate undesired particles in the fluid stream <b>21</b>&#x2033;. As a result, the stream collected in a collection receptacle <b>1355</b> contains a desired population of particles. For example, if the particles being analyzed are sperm cells and the intended result is to collect sperm cells having a characteristic A (e.g., a desired chromosome content), then the microprocessor receives signals from the epi-illumination system <b>415</b>&#x2033; which identifies cells not having characteristic A and selectively activates the laser to ablate such cells or otherwise render them ineffective.</p>
<p id="p-0627" num="1232">Different control sorting strategies can be employed in a photo-damage system, including the &#x201c;high recovery&#x201d; and &#x201c;high purity&#x201d; sorting strategies discussed above in the context of a droplet sorter. In a photo-damage system, particles contained in the fluid stream are spaced at various intervals along the stream and generally follow one after another in single file. The particles have different characteristics, some having a characteristic A, for example, and others having a characteristic B. The sequence of particles is random, so viewed as a continuous procession, the particles can be divided into different particle series, one following another, including a first particle series consisting only of one or more particles having characteristic A, a second particle series consisting only of one or more particles having characteristic B and a third particle series consisting of two or more closely spaced particles at least one of which has characteristic A and at least one of which has characteristic B. The latter (third) group generally corresponds to the closely spaced particles in a &#x201c;coincident&#x201d; droplet discussed previously, at least for sorting strategy purposes. Thus, the two or more particles in the third group may be closely spaced in the sense that the spatial separation between the particles is insufficient to allow accurate discrimination/classification of the particles, or because such separation is insufficient to permit one particle in the series to be ablated by the laser without damaging the other particle(s) in the same series. In any event, the closely spaced particles in each (or at least some) of the third series of particles can be ablated or not ablated, depending on the sorting strategy employed. It should be noted that multiple particles in a first series or multiple particles in a second series could be &#x201c;closely spaced&#x201d;, but since the particles in any such series have the same characteristic (A or B), they are treated as a single-particle series, at least for sorting strategy purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0628" num="1233">The photo-damage system can be a single-channel system or a multi-channel system, as described above.</p>
<p id="h-0066" num="0000">Fluid Switching Sorting</p>
<p id="p-0629" num="1234">It is contemplated that the principles of this invention can also be applied to flow cytometry systems using fluid switching techniques, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,432,246 (Adair), 4,756,427 (G&#xf6;hde, et al.), and 3,791, 517 (Friedman), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 137</figref> is a partial view showing such a system, generally designated <b>1357</b>. It is substantially identical to the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> except that the nozzle system <b>101</b>&#x2033; includes a capillary tube <b>1369</b> (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 135</figref>), and the sorting system comprises a fluid-switching device <b>1359</b> coupled to the capillary tube <b>1369</b> downstream from the interrogation location <b>115</b>&#x2032;. The construction and operation of the fluid-switching device can incorporate any conventional fluid switching technology such as disclosed in the above-referenced patents. In general, the device functions to sort desired particles from undesired particles in response to instructions received from the processor by intermittently diverting portions of the fluid stream containing the desired/undesired particles along separate flow paths <b>1361</b>, <b>1365</b> for collection in vessels or the like. The switching is commonly achieved by selectively actuating a transducer <b>1367</b> in one of the flow paths.</p>
<p id="p-0630" num="1235">The various sorting strategies described above in regard to droplet sorting and photo-damage sorting can also be employed in a fluid-switching system. In the fluid-switching system, particles contained in the fluid stream are also spaced at various intervals along the stream and generally follow one after another in single file. The particles have different characteristics, some having a characteristic A, for example, and others having a characteristic B, and the sequence of particles is random. Therefore, as discussed above in regard to the photo-damage system, the procession of particles can be divided into different particle series, one following another, including a first particle series comprising one or more particles having characteristic A, a second particle series comprising one or more particles having characteristic B and a third particle series comprising two or more closely spaced particles at least one of which has characteristic A and at least one of which has characteristic B. The latter (third) group generally corresponds to the closely spaced particles in a &#x201c;coincident&#x201d; droplet discussed previously, at least for sorting strategy purposes. Thus, the two or more particles in the third group may be closely spaced in the sense that the spatial separation between the particles is insufficient to allow accurate discrimination/classification of the particles, or because such separation is insufficient to permit one particle in the series to be diverted by the fluid-switching device separate from the another particle in the same series. In any event, the closely spaced particles in each (or at least some) of the third series of particles can be diverted to one collection location or another, depending on the sorting strategy employed. As explained above in connection with photo-damage sorting, multiple particles in a first series or multiple particles in a second series could be &#x201c;closely spaced&#x201d;, but since the particles in any such series have the same characteristic (A or B), they are treated as a single-particle series for the purpose of sorting strategy.</p>
<p id="p-0631" num="1236">The fluid switching system can be a single-channel system or a multi-channel system, as described above.</p>
<p id="h-0067" num="0000">Droplet Interference Sorting</p>
<p id="p-0632" num="1237">It is also contemplated that the technology of this invention can be used in conjunction with a droplet interference fluidic switching technique. For example, a high-speed droplet interference sorting system <b>1371</b>, shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 138</figref>, may be used to sort particles by diverting selected segments of the coaxial carrier and sheath fluid stream.</p>
<p id="p-0633" num="1238">In contrast to some other sorting techniques, the droplet interference sorting technique does not require the coaxial carrier and sheath stream to be formed into droplets. Thus, there is no need to couple the nozzle system <b>101</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; used for delivery of the carrier and sheath fluids with a droplet generation system. By way of example only, passing the carrier and sheath fluids through a nozzle system at 60 psi to create a 50 micron diameter stream is one suitable arrangement for formation of a laminar coaxial fluid stream for delivery of particles to the droplet interference sorting system. Particles in the coaxial fluid stream are analyzed and classified by the optics system <b>109</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; and processor <b>131</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; as they move through the interrogation location <b>115</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;, as has been described above for the other sorting systems. Sorting occurs downstream from the interrogation location, at a location where the coaxial fluid stream intersects a high-speed droplet interference stream <b>1373</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0634" num="1239">The droplet interference stream <b>1373</b> is generated by a droplet generation system <b>1375</b> similar to the droplet generation system used for droplet sorting. A high-speed fluid stream <b>1379</b> passes through a high-speed nozzle system <b>1377</b> that is coupled to a piezoelectric transducer <b>1381</b> or other source of acoustical energy for causing the high-speed fluid stream to break into droplets <b>1383</b> downstream from the high-speed nozzle. For example, a particle-free fluid at 1500 psi may be passed through the high-speed nozzle to form a 70 micron diameter high-speed fluid jet. The high-speed nozzle may be oscillated at 400 KHz to form high-speed droplets. The high-speed droplets <b>1383</b> pass through an electric field generated by one or more electric deflection plates <b>1387</b> so that the path of the high-speed droplets may be controlled by selectively applying an electric charge to the droplets, as was done to control the path of droplets in the droplet sorting system. The high-speed droplet interference stream is directed so some high-speed droplets intersect the coaxial fluid stream at a point <b>1399</b> downstream from the interrogation location. For example, uncharged droplets <b>1389</b> may be directed to collide with the fluid stream while charged droplets <b>1391</b> are deflected away from the coaxial fluid stream. When a high-speed droplet collides with the coaxial fluid stream, a segment <b>1397</b> of the fluid stream and any particles contained therein are diverted from the path they would have otherwise taken. The application of a charge or no charge to a high-speed droplet may be timed so the arrival of that droplet at the intersection <b>1399</b> with the coaxial fluid stream coincides with the arrival of a particular segment of the coaxial fluid stream. Thus, by selectively charging high-speed droplets depending on the classification of particles contained within the coaxial stream segments, one can sort particles by diverting all coaxial fluid stream segments that contain one or more selected particles and not diverting other coaxial stream segments or vice-versa. Collection capillaries <b>1403</b> having a slight vacuum may be used to collect both the diverted <b>1397</b> and undiverted coaxial stream segments. The droplet interference sorting system may be set up so the high-speed droplets merge with diverted coaxial stream segments or so the high-speed droplets remain separate from the diverted stream segments after collision with the coaxial stream segments.</p>
<p id="p-0635" num="1240">Because there are no particles or cells in the high-speed droplet interference stream <b>1373</b>, it is possible to use very high pressures and very high droplet frequencies without damaging the particles or cells to be sorted. This allows sorting of stream segments each having less volume (e.g., four times less volume) than the volume of a droplet in the droplet sorting system. This greatly increases the maximum throughput of the system while also reducing the dilution factor of the sorted particles. Moreover, because finely filtered liquid with no cells or particles is used to form the droplet interference stream, more consistent droplet formation is possible because the droplet formation nozzle is less likely to become clogged or suffer from protein buildup than the nozzle system used in the droplet sorting system. Another advantage is that the distance between particle analysis at the interrogation location and the sorting point <b>1399</b> can be reduced (e.g., by a factor of four), allowing more accurate prediction of the time of arrival of a particular particle at the sorting point. Furthermore, the droplet interference system allows more flexibility in adjustment of nozzle size or pressure for the coaxial fluid stream. If desired, the droplet interference sorting system can be combined with the capillary tube nozzle system. A multi-channel droplet interference sorting system may use a high-pressure fluidic pump to supply multiple droplet interference stream generating nozzles with fluid from a common fluid supply.</p>
