<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The field of the invention is data processing, or, more specifically, methods, systems, and products for relevant alert delivery and dynamic administration of component event reporting in a distributed processing system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The development of the EDVAC computer system of 1948 is often cited as the beginning of the computer era. Since that time, computer systems have evolved into extremely complicated devices. Today's computers are much more sophisticated than early systems such as the EDVAC. Computer systems typically include a combination of hardware and software components, application programs, operating systems, processors, buses, memory, input/output devices, and so on. As advances in semiconductor processing and computer architecture push the performance of the computer higher and higher, more sophisticated computer software has evolved to take advantage of the higher performance of the hardware, resulting in computer systems today that are much more powerful than just a few years ago.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Modern distributed processing systems for intensive computing may have millions of devices with many processes running on each device all of which are capable of error and status reporting for automated error recovery, reporting to a systems administrator, and for other reasons. In many cases, in the case of an error for example, the sheer number of such error reports and status reports are so overwhelming that they cannot be handled in a meaningful manner. For example, a systems administrator receiving a hundred thousand error reports may be overwhelmed by the sheer number of such reports and therefore in the aggregate those reports become more and more unhelpful and irrelevant.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Exemplary methods, systems, and computer program products for relevant alert delivery and dynamic administration of component event reporting in a distributed processing system according to embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the accompanying drawings, beginning with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary system for relevant alert delivery and dynamic administration of component event reporting in a distributed processing system according to embodiments of the present invention. A distributed processing system is typically implemented as multiple autonomous or semi-autonomous computers that communicate through a computer network. In such example distributed processing systems, the computers often interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. A computer program that runs in such an example distributed system is typically called a distributed program, and distributed programming is often used to describe the process of writing such programs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the distributed processing system (<b>101</b>) is implemented as a parallel computer (<b>100</b>), non-volatile memory for the computer in the form of data storage device (<b>118</b>), an output device for the computer in the form of printer (<b>120</b>), and an input/output device for the computer in the form of computer terminal (<b>122</b>). The parallel computer (<b>100</b>) in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also includes a plurality of compute nodes (<b>102</b>). Each compute node is an automated computing device composed of one or more computer processors, its own computer memory, and its own input/output functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The compute nodes (<b>102</b>) are coupled for data communications by several independent data communications networks including a high speed Ethernet network (<b>174</b>), a Joint Test Action Group (&#x2018;JTAG&#x2019;) network (<b>104</b>), a tree network (<b>106</b>) which is optimized for collective operations, and a torus network (<b>108</b>) which is optimized for point to point operations. Tree network (<b>106</b>) is a data communications network that includes data communications links connected to the compute nodes so as to organize the compute nodes as a tree. Each data communications network is implemented with data communications links among the compute nodes (<b>102</b>). The data communications links provide data communications for parallel operations among the compute nodes of the parallel computer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition to compute nodes, computer (<b>100</b>) includes input/output (&#x2018;I/O&#x2019;) nodes (<b>110</b>, <b>114</b>) coupled to compute nodes (<b>102</b>) through one of the data communications networks (<b>174</b>). The I/O nodes (<b>110</b>, <b>114</b>) provide I/O services between compute nodes (<b>102</b>) and I/O devices (<b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>). I/O nodes (<b>110</b>, <b>114</b>) are connected for data communications I/O devices (<b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>) through local area network (&#x2018;LAN&#x2019;) (<b>130</b>). Computer (<b>100</b>) also includes a service node (<b>116</b>) coupled to the compute nodes through one of the networks (<b>104</b>). Service node (<b>116</b>) provides service common to pluralities of compute nodes, loading programs into the compute nodes, starting program execution on the compute nodes, retrieving results of program operations on the computer nodes, and so on. Service node (<b>116</b>) runs a service application (<b>124</b>) and communicates with users (<b>128</b>) through a service application interface (<b>126</b>) that runs on computer terminal (<b>122</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Many of the components of the distributed processing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, that is the devices of the distributed processing system or processes running on the devices of the distributed processing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are capable of some form of error or status reporting through events and many of such components are also capable of receiving alerts in response to one or more of such events. Often in distributed processing systems useful according to embodiments of the present invention hundreds of thousands or millions of components may provide events or receive alerts.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each of the compute nodes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, have installed upon them an event reporting module (<b>800</b>). The event reporting module (<b>800</b>) is implemented as a module of automated computing machinery capable of reporting events to the event and alert analysis module (<b>124</b>). Each event reporting module has installed upon it local event reporting rules dictating particular events to be reported for particular conditions on the component. Such conditions may include errors occurring on the component, status of aspects of the component and others as will occur to those of skill in the art. Each such condition may have a particular event associated with and event reporting rules dictate which events are to be reported for which conditions occurring on the component. While only one event reporting module (<b>800</b>) is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, those of skill in the art will recognize that many of the components of the distributed processing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may support an event reporting module capable of reporting events to the event and alert analysis module.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The service node (<b>116</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has installed upon it an event and alert analysis module (<b>124</b>) capable of relevant alert delivery with event and alert suppression in a distributed processing system according to embodiments of the present invention. The event and alert analysis module (<b>124</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is implemented as automated computing machinery capable of receiving in an event queue a plurality of events from one or more components of a distributed processing system; assigning by an event analyzer each received event to an events pool; wherein the event analyzer includes event analysis rules including, event arrival rules, events pool operation rules, event suppression rules, and events pool closure rules; identifying by the event analyzer in dependence upon the event arrival rules and the events assigned to the events pool one or more alerts; closing, by the event analyzer in dependence upon the events pool operation rules, the events pool; determining, by the events analyzer in dependence upon the event suppression rules, whether to suppress one or more events in the closed events pool; and identifying by the event analyzer in dependence upon the events pool closure rules and any unsuppressed events assigned to the events pool, one or more additional alerts; sending by the event analyzer to an alert analyzer all the alerts identified by the event analyzer; assigning by the alert analyzer the identified alerts to an alerts pool; determining by the alert analyzer in dependence upon alert analysis rules and the alerts in the alert pool whether to suppress any alerts; and transmitting the unsuppressed alerts to one or more components of the distributed processing system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments the unsuppressed alerts are transmitted to one or more components of the distributed processing system. One such component may be a terminal (<b>122</b>) for display to a systems administrator. Other components may include a component that generated an event, a component for error reporting, a component for automated error recovery or any other component that will occur to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The event and alert module (<b>124</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> allows the number of events received and alerts produced at any given time to be less overwhelming to a systems administrator (<b>128</b>) attempting to identify a problem or occurrence in the distributed processing system. Relevant alert delivery with event and alert suppression according to embodiments of the present invention provides alerts that are more meaningful to a user in determining how to administer the functions and errors associated with a distributed processing system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As mentioned above, each component of the distributed processing system may report events based upon event reporting rules. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the event and alert analysis module (<b>124</b>) is capable of dynamic administration of component event reporting in a distributed processing system by receiving, by an events analyzer from an events queue, a plurality of events from one or more components of the distributed processing system; determining, by the events analyzer in dependence upon the received events and one or more event analysis rules, to change the event reporting rules of one or more components; and instructing, by the events analyzer, the one or more components to change the event reporting rules. The components receiving the instruction are then capable of receiving the instruction to change the event reporting rules and changing the event reporting rules in accordance with the instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The arrangement of nodes, networks, and I/O devices making up the exemplary distributed processing system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are for explanation only, not for limitation of the present invention. Distributed data processing systems capable of relevant alert delivery and dynamic administration of component event reporting according to embodiments of the present invention may include additional nodes, networks, devices, and architectures, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as will occur to those of skill in the art. The parallel computer (<b>100</b>) in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes sixteen compute nodes (<b>102</b>); parallel computers capable of relevant alert delivery according to embodiments of the present invention sometimes include thousands of compute nodes. In addition to Ethernet and JTAG, networks in such data processing systems may support many data communications protocols including for example TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), IP (Internet Protocol), and others as will occur to those of skill in the art. Various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented on a variety of hardware platforms in addition to those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Relevant alert delivery with event and alert suppression and dynamic administration of component event reporting in a distributed processing system in accordance with the present invention is generally implemented with computers, that is, with automated computing machinery. In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, all the service nodes, I/O nodes, compute nodes, of the parallel computer are implemented to some extent at least as computers. For further explanation, therefore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery comprising an exemplary computer (<b>152</b>) useful in relevant alert delivery according to embodiments of the present invention. The computer (<b>152</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes at least one computer processor (<b>156</b>) or &#x2018;CPU&#x2019; as well as random access memory (<b>168</b>) (&#x2018;RAM&#x2019;) which is connected through a high speed memory bus (<b>166</b>) and bus adapter (<b>158</b>) to processor (<b>156</b>) and to other components of the computer (<b>152</b>) and through an expansion bus to adapters for communications with other components of a distributed processing system (<b>101</b>).</p>

The event and alert analysis module (<b>124</b>) includes an event analyzer (<b>208</b>) and an alert analyzer (<b>218</b>). The event analyzer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a module of automated computing machinery capable of identifying alerts in dependence upon received events. That is, event analyzers typically receive events and produce alerts. In many embodiments, a plurality of event analyzers are implemented in parallel. Often such event analyzers are assigned to a particular pool of events and may be focused on events from a particular component or caused by a particular occurrence to produce a more concise set of alerts.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The alert analyzer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a module of automated computing machinery capable of identifying alerts for transmission from events and other alerts, identifying additional alerts for transmission, and suppressing unnecessary, irrelevant, or otherwise unwanted alerts identified by the event analyzer. That is, alert analyzers typically receive alerts and events and produce or forward alerts in dependence upon those alerts and events. In many embodiments, a plurality of alert analyzers are implemented in parallel.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For further explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> sets forth a block diagram of an exemplary system for relevant alert delivery and dynamic administration of component event reporting in a distributed processing system (<b>102</b>) according to embodiments of the present invention. The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an event and alert analysis module (<b>124</b>). The event and alert analysis module (<b>124</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> receives in an event queue (<b>206</b>) a plurality of events (<b>202</b>) from one or more components of a distributed processing system (<b>102</b>). A component of a distributed processing system according to embodiments of the present invention may be a device of the distributed processing system or a process running on a device of the distributed processing. Many of such components are often capable of some form event transmission, often for error or status reporting. Such components often have installed upon them event reporting modules for reporting events in dependence upon event reporting rules for the individual component. Many of such event reporting rules may be, and often are, changeable and may be changed locally by the component in response to an instruction from an event and alert analysis module.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An event according to embodiments of the present invention is a notification of a particular occurrence in or on a component of the distributed processing system. Such events are sent from the component upon which the occurrence occurred or another reporting component to an event and alert analysis module according to the present invention. Often events are notifications of errors occurring in a component of the data processing system. Events are often implemented as messages either sent through a data communications network or shared memory. Typical events for event and alert analysis according to embodiments of the present invention an occurred time, a logged time, an event type, an event ID, a reporting component, and a source component, and other attributes. An occurred time is the time at which the event occurred on the component. A logged time is the time the event was included in the event queue (<b>206</b>) and is typically inserted into the event by the monitor (<b>204</b>) in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. An event type is a generic type of event such as for example, power error, link failure error, errors related to not receiving messages or dropping packets and so on as will occur to those of skill in the art. An event ID is a unique identification of the event. A reporting component is an identification of the component that reported the event. A source component is an identification of the component upon which the event occurred. In many cases, but not all, the reporting component and source component are the same component of the distributed processing system.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the event and alert analysis module (<b>124</b>) includes a monitor (<b>204</b>) that receives events from components of the distributed processing system and puts the received events (<b>202</b>) in the event queue (<b>206</b>). The monitor (<b>204</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may receive events from components of the distributed processing system on their motion, may periodically poll one or more of the components of the distributed processing system, or receive events from components in other ways as will occur to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">They system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an event analyzer (<b>208</b>). The event analyzer (<b>208</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a module of automated computing machinery capable of identifying alerts in dependence upon received events. That is, event analyzers typically receive events and produce alerts. In many embodiments, a plurality of event analyzers are implemented in parallel. Often event analyzers are assigned to a particular pool of events and may be focused on events from a particular component or caused by a particular occurrence to produce a more concise set of alerts.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The event analyzer (<b>208</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> assigns each received event (<b>202</b>) to an events pool (<b>212</b>). An events pool (<b>212</b>) is a collection of events organized by the time of either their occurrence, by the time they are logged in the event queue, included in the events pool, or other time as will occur to those of skill in the art. That is, event pools are a collection of events organized by time. Such events pools often provide the ability to analyze a group of time related events identify alerts in dependence upon them. Often such event pools are useful in identifying fewer and more relevant alerts in dependence upon multiple related events.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An events pool according to the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has a predetermined initial period of time and in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> assigning by the event analyzer each received event to an events pool includes extending for each event assigned to the events pool the predetermined initial period of time by a particular period of time assigned to the event. In this manner, the pool is extended with each received event until a collection of events that may be usefully used to identify alerts is assigned to the events pool.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As mentioned above, in some embodiments of the present invention, more than one event analyzer may operate in parallel. As such, each event analyzer may maintain one or more event pools for relevant alert delivery according to embodiments of the present invention. Assigning by the event analyzer the events to an events pool may therefore include selecting only events from one or more particular components. In such embodiments, particular components may be selected for a particular events pool to provide events associated with a particular period of time from a particular set of one or more components.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Assigning by the event analyzer the events to an events pool may also be carried out by selecting only events of a particular event type. In such embodiments, particular events may be selected for a particular events pool to provide events associated with a particular period of time from a particular set of event types.</p>

Event analyses rules (<b>210</b>) are a collection of predetermined rules for meaningfully parsing received events to identify relevant alerts in dependence upon the events.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The event analysis rules (<b>210</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> include event arrival rules (<b>230</b>), events pool operation rules (<b>232</b>), event suppression rules (<b>234</b>), and events pool closure rules (<b>236</b>). Event arrival rules (<b>230</b>) are configurable predetermined rules for identifying alerts in dependence upon events in real time as those events are assigned to the events pool. That is, event arrival rules (<b>230</b>) identify alerts in dependence upon events before closing the events pool. Such rules are typically predetermined to identify particular alerts in dependence upon attributes of those events. Event arrival rules may for example dictate identifying a particular predetermined alert for transmission to a systems administrator in dependence upon a particular event type or component type for the event or other attribute of that event. Such rules are flexible and may be tailored to a particular distributed computing system and its functions.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An alert according to embodiments of the present invention is refined identification of an occurrence&#x2014;such and an error&#x2014;based upon more than one event and therefore provides an identification of the occurrence in the context of its operation in the distributed processing system. Often an alert may be a notification of a particular error type of occurrence that is identified in dependence upon the plurality of events received from one or more components of the data processing system, such as, for example, a link failure among a plurality of devices each of which are producing many events based upon the single link failure, or a power failure provoking thousands of events, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Alerts are often implemented as messages to be sent through a data communications network or shared memory.

Such rules are flexible and may be tailored to a particular distributed computing system and its functions.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Event suppression rules (<b>234</b>) are configurable predetermined rules for suppressing one or more events in a pool of events used in identifying alerts.

Such suppression rules are typically predetermined to delete, drop, or otherwise ignore those suppressed events.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Event suppression rules may for example dictate that more than a threshold number of events of a particular event type or component type are to be suppressed. Such rules are also flexible and may be tailored to a particular distributed computing system and its functions.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Events pool closure rules (<b>236</b>) are configurable predetermined rules for identifying alerts in dependence upon unsuppressed events in the closed events pool and alerts identified by the event arrival rules. That is, events pool closure rules identify new alerts in dependence upon one or more or even all of the unsuppressed events in the closed events pool. The events pool closure rules also identify alerts in dependence upon the alerts identified by the event arrival rules (<b>230</b>) or a combination of the alerts identified by the event arrival rules (<b>230</b>) and one or more of the unsuppressed events in the closed events pool.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Event analyzer (<b>208</b>) in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also may dynamically administer component event reporting by determining, in dependence upon the received events and one or more event analysis rules (<b>210</b>), to change the event reporting rules of one or more components and instructing, by the events analyzer, the one or more components to change the event reporting rules. The event analysis rules (<b>210</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> include component reporting change rules including rules dictating the conditions under which an event analyzer will instruct one or more components of the distributed processing system to locally change its event reporting rules. Examples of such rules may include rules that instruct a component to locally suppress locally events of a particular type when too many redundant events of that type are being received or when the arrival rate of events are greater than a threshold rate, rules that instruct a component to report events of a particular type under particular conditions, rules that instruct a component to stop locally suppressing events of a particular type under particular conditions, rules that change the type of event being sent by the component under certain conditions and many others as will occur to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Event analyzer (<b>208</b>) in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> sends all the alerts (<b>214</b>) identified by the event analyzer (<b>208</b>) to an alert analyzer (<b>218</b>). The alert analyzer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a module of automated computing machinery capable of identifying alerts for transmission from events and other alerts, identifying additional alerts for transmission, and suppressing unnecessary, irrelevant, or otherwise unwanted or unhelpful alerts identified by the event analyzer.

In many embodiments, a plurality of alert analyzers are implemented in parallel. The alerts (<b>216</b>) in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are sent from event analyzer (<b>208</b>) to an alert analyzer (<b>218</b>) through an alerts queue (<b>216</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Alert analyses rules (<b>222</b>) are a collection of rules for suppressing one or more alerts to provide a more relevant set of alerts for transmission to a component of the distributed processing system, such as for example, for display to a systems administrator and to identify additional alerts for transmission to one or more components of the distributed processing system. Alert analysis rules for example may dictate that duplicate alerts are to be suppressed, alerts of a particular type for transmission to a particular component are to be suppressed, alerts of a particular type be transmitted to a particular component are to be suppressed and so on as will occur to those of skill in the art. Such alerts may be more meaningful to a component of the distributed processing system for automated error recovery or for a systems administrator who may otherwise be less informed by a number of raw unanalyzed alerts.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The alert analyzer (<b>218</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also has access to the events queue (<b>206</b>).

Similarly, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> upon assigning &#x2018;Alert <b>2</b>&#x2019; (<b>504</b>) to the alerts pool having a time of e<b>2</b>, the now extended period of time from t<sub>0</sub>-t<sub>f+e1 </sub>is extended again by &#x2018;Extension <b>2</b>&#x2019; (<b>406</b>) thereby establishing a new time for closing the pool at time t<sub>f+e1+e2 </sub>if no other alerts are assigned to the pool before t<sub>f+e1+e2 </sub>or before some maximum time for the alerts pool has expired.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In typical embodiments of the present invention, alerts pools may have a maximum duration that can no longer be extended. In such cases, a requirement may exist that an alert that has not resided in the alert pool for a threshold period of time be moved to a next alerts pool. In some embodiments, the attributes of such an alert that is moved to the next alerts pool are used for relevant alert delivery according to embodiments of the present invention with the initial alerts pool and in other embodiments, the attributes of such an alert are used for relevant alert delivery with the next alerts pool to which that alert is moved.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In many embodiments, a plurality of alerts pools may be used in parallel and one or more of such alerts pools are assigned to a particular alerts analyzer. In such embodiments, alerts analyzers may be directed to alerts in alerts pools having particular attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">For further explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> sets forth a flow chart illustrating an example method of relevant alert delivery with event and alert suppression in a distributed processing system according to embodiments of the present invention. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes receiving (<b>402</b>) in an event queue a plurality of events (<b>202</b>) from one or more components of a distributed processing system. Events useful in relevant alert delivery with event and alert suppression according to embodiments of the present invention may include an occurred time, a logged time, an event type, an event ID, a reporting component, and a source component.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Receiving (<b>402</b>) in an event queue a plurality of events (<b>202</b>) from one or more components of a distributed processing system may be carried out by receiving an event initiated by one or more components of the data processing system and storing the event in the event queue according to the time in which the event occurred or according to the time the event was received. Receiving (<b>402</b>) in an event queue a plurality of events (<b>202</b>) from one or more components of a distributed processing system also may be carried out by polling a component for status and receiving in response an event and storing the event in the event queue according to the time in which the event occurred or according to the time the event was received.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also includes assigning (<b>404</b>) by an event analyzer each received event to an events pool (<b>212</b>). In some embodiments of the present invention, assigning (<b>404</b>) by an event analyzer each received event (<b>202</b>) to an events pool (<b>212</b>) may be carried out by assigning events to the event pool according to the logged time. Assigning (<b>404</b>) by an event analyzer each received event (<b>202</b>) to an events pool (<b>212</b>) may also be carried out in dependence upon attributes of the event. Such attributes may include an identification or type of the component upon which an occurrence occurred to create the event, the reporting component of the event, the event ID, the event type, and so on as will occur to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">An events pool according to the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes events occurring during a predetermined initial period of time and in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> assigning (<b>404</b>) by the event analyzer each received event to an events pool includes extending (<b>426</b>) for each event assigned to the events pool the predetermined initial period of time by a particular period of time assigned to the event.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The event analyzer includes event analysis rules (<b>210</b>) including, event arrival rules, events pool operation rules, event suppression rules, and events pool closure rules. Event arrival rules are configurable predetermined rules for identifying alerts in dependence upon events in real time as those events are assigned to the events pool. That is, event arrival rules identify alerts in dependence upon events before closing the events pool. Such rules are flexible and may be tailored to a particular distributed computing system and its functions.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">An alert according to embodiments of the present invention is refined identification of an occurrence&#x2014;such and an error&#x2014;based upon more than one event and therefore provides an identification of the occurrence in the context of its operation in the distributed processing system. Often an alert may be a notification of a particular error type of occurrence that is identified in dependence upon the plurality of events received from one or more components of the data processing system, such as, for example, a link failure among a plurality of devices each of which are producing many events based upon the single link failure, or a power failure provoking thousands of events, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Alerts are often implemented as messages to be sent through a data communications network or shared memory. Typical alerts according to embodiments of the present invention have attributes attached to them based upon the attributes of the events received from which they are identified.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Events pool operation rules are configurable predetermined rules for controlling the operations of the events pool. Such rules includes rules identifying the initial predetermined period of time for each events pool, rules dictating the length of time extended to the pool upon the assignment of each new event to the pool, rules dictating the minimum time an event must be in a pool before that event is included in a collection of events when the pool is closed, rules governing the closing of an events pool, and others as will occur to those of skill in the art. Such rules are flexible and may be tailored to a particular distributed computing system and its functions.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Event suppression rules are configurable predetermined rules for suppressing one or more events in a closed pool of events used in identifying alerts. That is, often events in the closed events pool may be duplicate events, redundant events, or otherwise unnecessary or unhelpful events in identifying alerts. Such suppression rules are typically predetermined to delete, drop, or otherwise ignore those suppressed events. Event suppression rules may for example dictate that more than a threshold number of events of a particular event type or component type are to be suppressed. Such rules are also flexible and may be tailored to a particular distributed computing system and its functions.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Events pool closure rules are configurable predetermined rules for identifying alerts in dependence upon unsuppressed events in the closed events pool and alerts identified by the event arrival rules. That is, events pool closure rules identify new alerts in dependence upon one or more or even all of the unsuppressed events in the closed events pool. The events pool closure rules also identify alerts in dependence upon the alerts identified by the event arrival rules or a combination of the alerts identified by the event arrival rules and one or more of the unsuppressed events in the closed events pool.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also includes identifying (<b>410</b>) by the event analyzer in dependence upon the event arrival rules and the events assigned to the events pool one or more alerts (<b>214</b>). Identifying (<b>410</b>) by the event analyzer in dependence upon the event arrival rules and the events assigned to the events pool one or more alerts (<b>214</b>) may be carried out by identifying alerts in dependence upon one or more attributes of the events as that event is assigned to the events pool. Identifying (<b>410</b>) by the event analyzer in dependence upon the event arrival rules and the events assigned to the events pool one or more alerts (<b>214</b>) may be carried by comparing the attributes of the events to the event arrival rules and identifying as a result of the comparison one or more alerts. Such attributes may include the type of component from which the event was received, the type of component creating the event, the identification of the component creating the event, the time the event was created or received, an error reported in the event, and many others as will occur to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also includes closing (<b>412</b>), by the event analyzer in dependence upon the events pool operation rules, the events pool (<b>212</b>). Closing (<b>412</b>), by the event analyzer in dependence upon the events pool operation rules, the events pool (<b>212</b>) may be carried out by determining that conditions dictated by the events pool operation rules have been met to stop assigning new events to the events pool and identifying in dependence upon those events pool operation rules the particular events that are included in the closed pool of events.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Closing the events pool may be carried out by determining that the initial period of time for the events pool and any particular periods of time for events received in the events pool extended to the initial period of time have expired. In such cases, if no new events are received prior to the expiration of the initial period of time for the events pool and any particular periods of time for events received in the events pool extended to the initial period of time the pool is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Closing the events pool may also be carried out by determining that a maximum duration for the events pool has expired. In such cases, regardless of the number of new events being received after a maximum duration for the events pool has expired the pool is closed. In such embodiments, a maximum duration for the events pool prevents the events pool from including more events than are useful for relevant alert delivery according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>

Identifying (<b>416</b>) by the event analyzer in dependence upon the events pool closure rules and any unsuppressed events assigned to the events pool, one or more additional alerts (<b>417</b>) may be carried out by selecting the unsuppressed events for the events pool, comparing the attributes of the unsuppressed events of the events pool to the pool closure rules, and identifying as a result of the comparison one or more additional alerts. Such attributes may include the type of component from which one or more of the unsuppressed events are received, the type of components creating the unsuppressed events, the identification of the component creating the unsuppressed events, the time the events were created or received, one or more errors reported by the events event, the number of events in the pool, and many others as will occur to those of skill in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Aspects of the present invention are described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable medium that can direct a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">It will be understood from the foregoing description that modifications and changes may be made in various embodiments of the present invention without departing from its true spirit. The descriptions in this specification are for purposes of illustration only and are not to be construed in a limiting sense. The scope of the present invention is limited only by the language of the following claims.</p>
