<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to call setup in packet-based communication networks. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method of operating a call switching entity and a call request entity in a packet-based communication network and to respective call switching entities and call request entities for use in packet-based communication networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Cellular networks for mobile communications are nowadays ubiquitous, and most densely populated parts of the world are already covered by at least one cellular network service. Since both user equipment&#x2014;such as mobile phones or terminals&#x2014;and infrastructure equipment of cellular type networks is highly standardized, respective components and devices are already available at reasonable cost. This allows for widespread use of such networks in developed as well as in developing countries.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition to these &#x201c;consumer&#x201d;-type cellular networks, there exists a large number of mobile communication systems that are exclusively for use by local or regional authorities or for government use only. Such mobile communication systems include radio communication services for use by the police, military, civil protection and emergency response services, such as fire brigades and medical first response services and the like. As such systems usually enjoy a somewhat higher priority as compared to consumer mobile communication, these systems have hitherto been implemented as discrete and independent communication networks and services, for example in form of analogue frequency modulation (FM-) based radio communication networks.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, such systems often do not comply with modern requirements, since such conventional radio communication systems may be prone to eavesdropping with the result that virtually anybody can listen to police and/or emergency service conversations, and, as a consequence, access to confidential and/or private information is not securely restricted. Furthermore, conventional radio communication systems may also suffer from coverage problems in that local weather or also geographical conditions bar some regions from access to these networks and services. In this way, it may occur that a police car&#x2014;although inside an area of administrative responsibility&#x2014;is unable to use the communication service and to communicate with, for example, the respective headquarters.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to the above, conventional radio communication systems used by authorities are often outdated since they rely on old equipment, which may also be specialized equipment being relatively expensive and cost-intense for maintenance and expansion. However, at the same time, modern cellular communication networks have evolved and provide widespread service of high-quality mobile communication. Moreover, cellular communication networks may offer far better service coverage, independence from weather conditions, and also the possibility to encrypt communication in order to render eavesdropping difficult or even impossible. As a consequence, there is the tendency to migrate communication systems for authorities and public services to existing cellular networks for mobile communication.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since, however, respective communication of public services should be somewhat prioritized with respect to consumer communication applications, the concept of so-called National Security and Emergency Preparedness calls, in short: NS/EP-calls, has evolved in order to provide higher priority at the time of call setup to such calls and ensuring an maximum quality of service with respect to standard consumer calls. More specifically, the concept of NS/EP-calls allows users to obtain priority access to respective radio and/or infrastructure resources of the communication networks, such as radio traffic channels, media gateway resources, and trunk access.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">NS/EP-calls can further be distinguished into two groups, namely into so-called Wireless Priority Service (WPS) calls and so-called Government Emergency Telecommunication Service (GETS) calls. In the former case of WPS calls, there is usually a respective WPS prefix dialed in front of the B-number in order to gain priority access to network resources, and the GETS calls can be invoked in the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) or Visitor Location Register (VLR) of the respective communication network even without any subscription data. GETS calls are usually invoked by dialing a respective GETS destination number for an originating call or by forwarding to a GETS number.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other words, with an increasing number of NS/EP personnel and public services relying on cell phones while performing their emergency and/or authority duties, priority is granted for emergency calls made from cellular telephones and/or other related mobile communication equipment. Usually, in situations in which a cellular network operates under normal conditions, priority access may not provide any improved quality of service since resource availability allows for establishing a further call communication without any problems.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, once network load increases, the situation may occur that parts of the radio and/or infrastructure resources, or a communication network as a whole, is in a so-called congested state, in which establishing a further call communication has become impossible. Similar problems occur, when parts of the network resources suffer from a breakdown caused by emergency situations such as natural disasters. In this way, the cause of diminished availability of network resources may also disadvantageously coincide with an increased need for network resources, in case, for example, natural events have destroyed parts of the network infrastructure, said natural events, however, requiring at the same time an increased, or at least a minimum, capacity of communication for event handling and disaster management.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As far as the implementation of cellular communication networks is concerned, modern standards, such as the specification as standardized by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP, release 8), support so-called AoIP, in which the user plane of the GSM A-interface is carried over IP transport (Internet Protocol) instead of TDM (Time Division Multiplexing). Data communication over IP, however, requires that both ends of the communication are provided with each network address of the respective communication partner. Another difference between AoIP and AoTDM lies in that AoIP involves a two-step process for handling media gateway resources, namely, so-called reserve RTP (Real Time Protocol) connection point procedures and configure RTP connection point procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows schematically a possible conventional way of call setup in a packet-based communication network that employs for user plane data communication, for example, IP. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a mobile terminal <b>1</b>, such as a cellular phone of NS/EP personnel, may send a call request <b>100</b> to a call request entity <b>10</b>. In response to this, the call request entity <b>10</b> sends a call setup request message <b>101</b> to a call switching entity <b>20</b> that is responsible for call switching and preparing call communication in the packet-based communication network (the call switching entity <b>20</b> may acknowledge this by sending a call proceeding message <b>102</b> back to the call request entity <b>10</b>). For this purpose, the call switching entity <b>20</b> sends a request message <b>111</b> (e.g. an ADD.Req-message) to a first network entity <b>31</b>, for example a media gateway (MGW), that is selected to handle data flow from the call request entity <b>10</b> to a remote end (not shown). By means of a respective response message <b>112</b> (e.g. ADD.Rep) the first network entity <b>31</b> provides its own transport layer address as a first network address to the call switching entity <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first network address of the first network entity <b>31</b> is then forwarded to the call request entity <b>10</b> with an assignment request message <b>121</b> (e.g. the respective BSSMAP message). In this way, the call request entity <b>10</b> now is in possession of the network address of the first network entity <b>31</b>. Subsequently, the call request entity <b>10</b> provides its own transport layer address as a second network address with an assignment complete message <b>122</b> to the call switching entity <b>20</b>. Once the call switching entity <b>20</b> has forwarded the second network address of the call request entity <b>10</b> to the first network entity <b>31</b> by a second request message <b>131</b> (e.g. MOD.Req), the first network entity <b>31</b> acknowledges reception thereof by a second response message <b>132</b> (e.g. MOD.Rep). Now both involved entities, the call request entity <b>10</b> and the first network entity <b>31</b> are in possession of the network address of the respective communication partner, and call communication and/or transport layer data transfer may commence.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, as already mentioned above, cellular networks may suffer from congestion due to the increased call volume and/or damage to respective network infrastructure. This, however, may severely affect the ability of NS/EP personnel to make emergency calls and handle their communication via the cellular network. Therefore, WPS and GETS provide a priority treatment for call setup in AoIP, by means of so-called Media Gateway Polling (MGW-Polling). Such polling may include queuing calls in a call request entity, such as a Base Station Controller (BSC).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, there may be the possibility that an attempt to establish a call communication between the call request entity <b>10</b> and the first network entity <b>31</b> fails, and the call switching entity <b>20</b> selects a second network entity <b>32</b> as part of said media gateway polling for establishing a connection between this second network entity <b>32</b> and the call request entity <b>10</b>. As shown, the first network entity <b>31</b>, in response to receiving the request message <b>111</b> (e.g. ADD.Req), may respond to the call switching entity <b>20</b> by a failure-state response message <b>112</b>&#x2032; (e.g. an ADD.Rep-message with an error code) that it is not available for communication.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this case, the call switching entity <b>20</b> subsequently selects a second network entity <b>32</b> and sends a respective request message <b>111</b>&#x2032; (e.g. ADD.Req) to the second network entity <b>32</b>. This entity <b>32</b> replies then with a response message <b>112</b>&#x2033; (ADD.Rep) forwarding its own transport layer address as a further network address to the call switching entity <b>20</b>. The call switching entity <b>20</b> then forwards the further network address to the call request entity <b>10</b> (message <b>121</b>), and the transport layer address of the call request entity <b>10</b> (second network address) is forwarded to the second network entity <b>32</b> (messages <b>122</b>, <b>131</b>), such that a call communication between the call request entity <b>10</b> and the second network entity <b>32</b> can be established. In general, call communication between the call request entity <b>10</b> and one of the network entities <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, implies that both involved entities are in possession of the network address of the communication partner. In this way, it is the duty of the call switching entity <b>20</b> to facilitate network address exchange between the involved entities.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this way, a call communication for a priority call originating from a prioritized mobile terminal <b>1</b> can be established although the first network entity <b>31</b> was not available for call communication. By means of immediately selecting another network entity, such as the shown second network entity <b>32</b>, the call switching entity <b>20</b> provides prioritized call establishment for the mobile terminal <b>1</b>. It is noted that in the situation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a conventional non-prioritized mobile terminal (consumer mobile phone), would have received a call reject message after the failure message <b>112</b>&#x2032; from the first network entity <b>31</b>. In other words, media gateway polling is usually not conducted for non-prioritized mobile devices, for which it is accepted that the respective user receives a respective error message and needs to initiate another call attempt from the start. In this way, however, media gateway polling provides prioritized access to respective mobile devices for establishing NS/EP-calls.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Media gateway selection is, in general, the process to determine a media gateway, such as the first or the second network entity <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, which is most suitable for a given traffic case. This enables flexible routing of the payload within the core network. It is a complete procedure from selection of a media gateway out of a so-called media gateway group (MGG) until the seizure and capturing of an access termination in the media gateway. It is noted that if the seizure of bearers in the media gateway group fails, i.e. all media gateways out of the media gateway groups were tried, then the media gateway group selection is initiated from the start and may be repeated several times (i.e. media gateway polling).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">From the above description it becomes clear that media gateway polling works in case an error occurs early in the sequence of exchanging network addresses, for example in conjunction with sending the request message <b>111</b> or receiving the response message <b>112</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, it may also be possible that a communication failure occurs at another stage in the sequence, for example in conjunction with the second response message <b>132</b>&#x2032; (e.g. MOD.Rep). In such a situation, the call switching entity <b>20</b> would again send its request message <b>111</b> to the first network entity <b>31</b>. For the first, this first network entity <b>31</b> provides its own transport layer address as the first network address with its response message <b>112</b> as shown and described in conjunction with previous Figures. The call switching entity <b>20</b> also continues to forward this first network address to the call request entity <b>10</b> (assignment request message <b>121</b>) and the call request entity <b>10</b> forwards its own network address as the second network address with its assignment complete message <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">At this point, however, the call switching entity <b>20</b> may either be unable to contact the first network entity <b>31</b>, or may, albeit being able to send the respective second request message <b>131</b> (MOD.Req) to the first network entity <b>31</b>, receive an error code with the second response message <b>132</b>&#x2032;. For example, the response message <b>132</b>&#x2032; could comprise an error code which indicates that the first network entity <b>31</b> is no longer able to handle a call communication to the call request entity <b>10</b> due to, for example, network congestion or codec incompatibility. In such a case, the only choice left could be to repeat the second request message (e.g. MOD-command) towards the same network entity&#x2014;even if several network entities, such a media gateways, may have been included in a respective group (media gateway group&#x2014;MGG) that is associated with the call request entity. This is because the network address of the first network entity (or a respective port number) has already been provided to the call request entity in the respective assignment request message.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">This situation could, however, trigger a sequence of error messages <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> via the call request entity <b>10</b> to the mobile terminal <b>1</b> indicating that no call communication can be established, which would be equivalent to a call rejection. Such a rejection would, in any way, also imply that the user of the mobile terminal <b>1</b> needs to initiate a further attempt to establish a call. The requirement of a further manual call initiation is, however, unacceptable in case of prioritized call setup for NS/EP-calls.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved method of operating a call switching entity, of operating a call request entity, and for call setup in a packet-based communication network. It is also an object of the present invention to provide improved computer programs, improved computer program products, an improved call switching entity, and an improved call request entity for use in a packet-based communication network. In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide more reliable call setup for prioritized calls in packet-based communication networks in case of media gateway polling.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">These objects are achieved by the subject-matter of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are described in the dependent claims thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to an embodiment of the invention, a method of operating a call switching entity in a packet-based communication network comprises receiving a call setup request from a call request entity; in response to receiving the call setup request, obtaining a first network address of a first network entity and forwarding the first network address to the call request entity; obtaining a second network address of the call request entity and forwarding the second network address to the first network entity; handling a result code indicating whether a call communication between the call request entity and the first network entity can be established; and in case no communication can be established, obtaining a further network address of a further network entity, forwarding the further network address to the call request entity, and forwarding the second network address to the further network entity.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, in case no communication between the call request entity and the first network entity can be established, although parts of the network addresses have already been exchanged, further signaling can be avoided and, albeit the first network entity no longer being available for call communication, reliable call communication can be established between the call request entity and a second network entity.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other words, the call switching entity retains all necessary information of the call request entity, such as the respective network address, until a target network entity, in this case the first network entity, indicates actual availability for call communication handling. In case the first network entity fails to handle the call communication, already buffered data, such as the first network address of the call request entity, are immediately forwarded to a second network entity and the respective transport layer address of the second network entity as a second network address is forwarded to the call request entity, which updates the respective address information for establishing a call communication to the second network entity.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to another aspect of the present invention, a method of operating a call request entity in a packet based communication is provided, wherein the method comprises sending a call setup request to a call switching entity; receiving from the call switching entity a first network address of a first network entity for establishing a call communication to the first network entity; sending an own network address of the call request entity as a second network address to the call switching entity; receiving an address update from the call switching entity comprising a further network address of a further network entity; and establishing a call communication to the further network entity.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a call setup method in a packet-based communication network is provided, wherein the method comprises receiving a call setup request from a call request entity; in response to receiving the call setup request, obtaining a first network address of a first network entity and forwarding the first network address to the call request entity; obtaining a second network address of the call request entity and forwarding the second network address to the first network entity; handling a result code indicating whether a call communication between the call request entity and the first network entity can be established; and in case no communication can be established, obtaining a further network address of a further network entity, forwarding the further network address to the call request entity, and forwarding the second network address to the further network entity.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to further embodiments of the present invention a computer program is provided being loadable into a processing unit, wherein the computer program comprises code adapted to perform any of the steps of a method of an aspect of the present invention. Further, another embodiment of the present invention provides a respective computer program product that comprises such a computer program.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, a call switching entity for use in a packet-based communication network is provided, the call switching entity comprising a process unit that is adapted to receive a call setup request from a call request entity; in response to receiving the call setup request, to obtain a first network address of a first network entity and to forward the first network address to the call request entity; to obtain a second network address of the call request entity and to forward the second network address to the first network entity; to handle a result code indicating whether a call communication between the call request entity and the first network entity can be established; and in case no communication can be established, to obtain a further network address of a further network entity, to forward the further network address to the call request entity, and to forward the second network address to the further network entity.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As understood by the present invention, a call switching entity can be any entity that handles&#x2014;or is involved with&#x2014;establishing a call communication between two entities in a packet-based communication network. In this way, the call switching entity can be a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) of a digital GSM, PCS, or UMTS mobile phone network being an interface between the radio network of the Base Station Subsystem (BSS) and the Core Network (CN). In the example of AoIP in 3GPP GSM Networks, it is the MSC that is involved with establishing a communication between a call request entity and respective network entities such as media gateways, and, in particular, with exchanging the involved transport layer addresses.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The call request entity should be understood as any entity that may bring forward a call request to the call switching entity. In this way, the call request entity can be a Base Station Controller (BSC) that controls a plurality of Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) which, in turn, handle radio communication to the mobile terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, the first and the second network entity may be any entities of a packet-based communication network that are involved with communication to a remote end, such as another mobile phone/terminal or a gateway to a fixed-line communication network. In this way, the first and second network entities can be the so-called media gateways of one or several media gateway groups (MGW). Said media gateways handle the user plane communication of the call communication, i.e. handle the payload data comprising digitally encoded sound data, original digital data, or digitally encoded video data. Said gateways may also comprise functionality for changing the used codecs for encoding and/or decoding respective digital audio or video data into other digital data or also analogue signals. Thus, as a further example, a media gateway may also comprise a digital to analogue converter (DAC) that generates an analogue speech signal (AF, audio frequency) from digital PCM voice data for feeding into an analogue communication network, such as an AF telephone network.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first, the second, and the further network addresses are transport layer addresses, such as target addresses in packet-based communication networks that indicate the originator and the target of respective transferred data. Examples for a packet-based communication network and the respective network addresses are the internet, internet-based communication networks, and Internet Protocol (IP) network addresses.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In general, the present invention is further to be understood that obtaining any network address may comprise the initial sending of a respective request message in order to request the network address to be sent from a respective network entity, or, simply by receiving a message that comprises the respective network address. Obtaining of network addresses may also be facilitated by searching a local network address database, in particular also by looking up in a respective network address table.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, the handling of a result code that indicates whether a call communication between the call request entity and the first network entity can be established may include receiving of an actual error code or a related error message, but can as well include the generation of the error code inside the call switching entity itself without any further communication involved. In the former case, the first network entity may send a dedicated message, such as the response message (ADD.Rep) or second/modification response message (MOD. Rep) which includes a specific message part of an error code indicating that the first network entity is no longer available for call communication to the call request entity.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first network entity, or any other network entity, may trigger the sending of a respective error code in case, for example, the network entity is congested and is no longer able to handle additional network traffic. Further, the network entity can also indicate a certain codec incompatibility with the error code, wherein such an incompatibility would render impossible call communication from the call request entity beyond the first network entity. In other words, the first network entity may be unable to handle or process digital encoded data from the call request entity and may be, therefore, obliged to indicate the incompatibility to the call request entity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the call switching entity may by itself generate the result code, for example, by means of considering a timeout period until it expects a reply from the first network entity, such as the second response message. As an example, the call switching entity may send a request message (ADD. Req; MOD.Req) to the first network entity and may, subsequently, await respective response messages (ADD.Rep; MOD.Rep) within a given time period. In case no such response message is received within the time period, the call switching entity may determine that the first network entity is no longer available for call communication and, therefore, generates a respective result code.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, the present invention is to be understood that the result code indicates whether a call communication between the call request entity and the first network entity can be established. Such a result code may include situations in which the first network entity is&#x2014;in principle&#x2014;able to carry out a call communication to the call request entity, but is only temporarily unable to handle a respective call communication. Further, the result code may as well indicate a general impossibility, in that the first network entity is no longer available, for example due to damage to network equipment, or the network entity is unable to process data of a respective call communication due to codec and/or processing-software incompatibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a schematic representation of a call setup method according to a first embodiment of the present invention. As already described earlier, a mobile terminal <b>1</b> of a priority user sends a call request <b>100</b> to the call request entity <b>10</b>. The call request entity <b>10</b> sends a setup message <b>101</b> to the call switching entity <b>20</b>, initiating a sequence for exchanging involved network addresses and, ultimately, establishing a call communication. The call switching entity <b>20</b> acknowledges the reception of the call setup request message <b>101</b> by the call proceeding message <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In response to receiving the call setup request message <b>101</b>, the call switching entity <b>20</b> sends a request message <b>111</b> (ADD.Req) to the first network entity <b>31</b> of a group of network entities or a plurality thereof. The first network entity <b>31</b> responds to the request message <b>111</b> by sending a response message <b>112</b> (ADD.Rep) comprising the transport layer address of the first network entity as the first network address toward the call switching entity <b>20</b>. The call switching entity <b>20</b> then forwards the first network address with an assignment request message <b>121</b> to the call request entity <b>10</b> that replies with an assignment complete message <b>122</b> comprising the own transport layer address of the call request entity <b>10</b> as a second network address.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The call switching entity <b>20</b> may now buffer the received second network address and sends a second request message <b>131</b> (MOD.Req) to the first network entity <b>31</b> such that both scheduled communication partners are provided with the addresses of their respective communication partners. However, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first network entity <b>31</b> is unable to establish a call communication to the call request entity <b>10</b> and returns a second response message <b>132</b>&#x2032; (MOD.Rep) which contains a respective error code. The call switching entity <b>20</b> handles this error code as a result code that indicates whether a call communication can be established between the call request entity <b>10</b> and the first network entity <b>31</b>. As already mentioned earlier, the result or error code can well be generated by the call switching entity <b>20</b> itself, if, for example, already the sending of the second request message <b>131</b> fails, or no response message thereto is received within a given time period (timeout).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Instead of indicating the error to the call request entity <b>10</b>, which would, eventually, cause a call rejection to the mobile terminal <b>1</b>, the call switching entity <b>20</b> makes use of the buffered second network address of the call request entity <b>10</b>, and forwards this address with a further request message <b>151</b> (ADD.Req) to a second network entity <b>32</b>. In case the second network entity <b>32</b> replies a successful response message <b>152</b> (ADD.Rep), the second network entity <b>32</b> may immediately forward its own transport layer address as a further network address to the call switching entity <b>20</b> with the a respective response message <b>152</b> (ADD.Rep).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is then that the call switching entity <b>20</b> sends a transport layer address update <b>161</b> to the call request entity <b>10</b> which indicates that the call communication is to be established between the call request entity <b>10</b> and the second network entity <b>32</b> instead of the first network entity <b>31</b>. In this way, the call request entity <b>10</b> may disregard the first network address as already received in conjunction with the assignment request message <b>121</b> and may further send a transport layer address acknowledgement message <b>162</b> to the call switching entity <b>20</b>, in order to indicate that all necessary network addresses have now been exchanged and actual call communication may commence.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic representation of a call setup method in a packet-based communication network according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Similarly as shown and described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the call switching entity <b>20</b> exchanges network addresses between the call request entity <b>10</b> and the second network entity <b>32</b> in response to a call request from the priority mobile terminal <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the call switching entity <b>20</b> sends an Initial Address Message (IAM) <b>171</b> to a remote end <b>40</b> in response to receiving the call setup request message <b>101</b> and prior to sending any request messages <b>111</b>, <b>131</b>, and <b>151</b>, in particular, also prior to sending the request message <b>111</b> to the first network entity <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The remote end <b>40</b> may represent a node of the core network, a destination terminal, a destination mobile terminal, or a fixed line connection of an analogue telephone network. With the IAM message <b>171</b>, the call switching entity <b>20</b> may indicate to the remote end <b>40</b> that it will receive a call shortly. The remote end <b>40</b> then may send an Acknowledgement Message (APM) <b>172</b> in response to receiving the IAM message <b>171</b> to the call switching entity <b>20</b>. The call switching entity <b>20</b> may await the reception of this APM message <b>172</b> until it continues with media gateway polling or, specifically, with sending the first request message <b>111</b> to the first network entity <b>31</b>. The method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may further comprise sending of a Continuity Message (COT) <b>191</b> from the call switching entity <b>20</b> to the remote end <b>40</b> in response to receiving the final transport layer address acknowledgement message <b>162</b> from the call request entity <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to further embodiments of the present invention, the request message <b>111</b> and the response message <b>112</b> may represent a procedure for reserving a Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) connection point, whereas the second or modification request message <b>131</b> and the respective second or modification response message <b>132</b>&#x2032; may represent a procedure for configuring the RTP connection point. However, in contrast to this, the request message <b>151</b> already contains the second network address of the call request entity <b>10</b>, as compared to the request message <b>111</b> that does not comprise any network address. This request message <b>151</b> and the response message <b>152</b> may thus represent a combined procedure of reserving and configuring the RTP connection point.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The procedure for reserving the RTP connection point may result in a seizure (reservation) of the first network entity, such as a first media gateway and the reserve procedure for reserving the RTP connection point is initially successful. However, since the respective response message <b>132</b>&#x2032; indicates an error code, the procedure for configuring the RTP connection point is unsuccessful. However, the polling of several media gateways, in this case the polling of at least the second network entity <b>32</b>, results in the selection of the second network entity <b>32</b> and the seizure thereof. In this way, media gateway polling is successful even in case an error code occurs between the pair of the request (ADD.Req) and response (ADD.Rep) messages and the pair of the second or modification request (MOD.Req) and the second (MOD.Rep) message.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a flowchart of a method of operating a call switching entity according to a third embodiment of the present invention. This method may be executed in a processing unit <b>21</b> of the call switching entity <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the call switching entity <b>20</b> receives a call setup request (S<b>100</b>) and obtains, in response to receiving the call setup request, the first network address of the first network entity (S<b>101</b>) and forwards this first network address to a call request entity (S<b>102</b>). In response to this, the call switching entity <b>20</b> obtains the network address of the call request entity as a second network address (S<b>103</b>) and forwards this second network address to the first network entity (S<b>104</b>). The call switching entity then handles a result code (S<b>105</b>), and decides whether the result code indicates that a communication between the call request entity <b>10</b> and the first entity <b>31</b> can be established. In case such a call communication can be established (case S<b>110</b>), the call communication is established between the call request entity <b>10</b> and the first network entity <b>31</b> (S<b>111</b>), and no further network addresses have to be exchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">If, however, the result code indicates that no communication can be established between the call request entity <b>10</b> and the first network entity <b>31</b> (case S<b>120</b>), the call switching entity continues with obtaining a further network address of a second network entity (S<b>121</b>). The call switching entity then forwards the second network address, being the network address of the call request entity <b>10</b>, to the second network entity <b>32</b> (S<b>122</b>), and also forwards the further network address to the call request entity <b>10</b> (S<b>123</b>). This now enables a call communication between the call request entity <b>10</b> and the further network entity <b>32</b> (S<b>124</b>). In general, however, it is to be noted that the order of forwarding the second network address and forwarding the further network address (steps S<b>122</b> and S<b>123</b>) may also be other way round, in such that the further network address is forwarded first.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a flowchart of a method of operating a call request entity according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. The call request entity, for example in response to receiving a call request from a mobile terminal <b>1</b>, sends a call setup request to a call switching entity (S<b>200</b>) for indicating the request to setup a call communication. The call request entity then receives a first network address (S<b>201</b>) of a first network entity and, in response thereto, sends its own network address as a second network address in step S<b>202</b>. However, prior to establishing a call communication to the first network entity, the call request entity receives an update with a further network address (S<b>203</b>), discards the first network address as received during step S<b>201</b>, and is now ready to establish a call communication via the further network address to the second network entity (S<b>204</b>).</p>
