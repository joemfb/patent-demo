<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An in-vehicle power transmission apparatus is equipped with a plurality of power split rotors and a power transmission control mechanism. The power split rotors work to split power among a rotary electric machine such as a motor-generator, an internal combustion engine, and a driven wheel of the vehicle. If rotational energy, as outputted from the power split rotors, is defined as being positive in sign, the power split rotors are so assembled that when the power transmission control mechanism establishes transmission of the rotational energy that is positive in sign as the power from a first rotor that is one of the power split rotors to the internal combustion engine, the other power split rotors are so linked as to provide output rotational energies which are opposite in sign to each other. This enables the speed of the first rotor to be placed at substantially zero.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to an in-vehicle power transmission device equipped with a plurality of power split rotors which work to split output power or torque among a rotary electric machine (e.g., a dynamo-electric machine), an internal combustion engine, and driven-wheels of a vehicle and are designed to rotate in conjunction with each other and a driving system for vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, in terms of reducing the amount of energy consumed by automotive vehicles, so-called hybrid vehicles have been put into practical use which are equipped with a rotary electric machine such as an in-vehicle power source made up of an electric motor and a generator in addition to an internal combustion engine. The hybrid vehicles are typically controlled to stop the internal combustion engine in a low speed running range in view of the fact that the internal combustion engine is usually inefficient in energy use in the low speed running range. The hybrid vehicles are facing a difficulty in how to restart the internal combustion engine during running of the vehicles. For example, it is difficult to bring a rotor which is coupled with driven wheels of the vehicle and now rotating into mechanical connection with the crankshaft of the internal combustion engine which is at a stop.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to avoid the above problem, there have been in practice use hybrid vehicles equipped with the electric motor whose output shaft is connected directly to the crankshaft of the internal combustion engine to transmit the torque, as outputted from the electric motor, to the crankshaft of the engine to start it. After start-up of the engine, the torque, as produced by the engine, is transmitted to the driven wheels of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, there have been in practical use hybrid vehicles equipped with a typical planetary gear speed reducer (also called an epicycle reduction gear train) made up of three rotors: a sun gear, a carrier (also called a planetary carrier), and a ring gear to which the generator, the internal combustion engine, and the electric motor are coupled, respectively. The driven wheels of the vehicle are coupled mechanically to the electric motor. In operation, the torque is applied to the sun gear or the ring gear to rotate the carrier, thereby rotating the rotating shaft (i.e., the crankshaft) of the internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine is started by using the torque of the carrier. After the start-up of the internal combustion engine, the engine torque is transmitted to the driven wheels of the vehicle through the carrier.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0016">The direct coupling of the rotating shaft of the electric motor to that of the internal combustion engine, as described above, will cause the torque load, as produced by the internal combustion engine, to be exerted on the electric motor, thus resulting in an increase in consumed amount of energy. A problem is also encountered that when the internal combustion engine is started, the pulsation of torque occurring at the rotating shaft of the internal combustion engine may result in a decrease in driveability of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0017">Further, the use of the planetary gear speed reducer leads to the problem that starting of the internal combustion engine when the rotational speed of the carrier is low will cause the internal combustion engine to be kept run at low speeds for a while. This is against the intended purpose of the hybrid vehicles to run the internal combustion engine in a speed range in which the efficiency in energy use is high.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0018">It is, therefore, a principal object of the invention to avoid the disadvantages of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0019">It is another object of the invention to provide a power transmission apparatus for a vehicle designed to start an internal combustion engine effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0020">According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a power transmission apparatus for a vehicle equipped with a rotary electric machine, an internal combustion engine, and at least one driven wheel. The power transmission apparatus comprises: (a) a plurality of power split rotors which work to rotate in conjunction with each other to split power among a rotary electric machine, an internal combustion engine, and a driven wheel of a vehicle; and (b) a power transmission control mechanism working to selectively establish and block transmission of the power between a first rotor that is one of the power split rotors and the internal combustion engine. If rotational energy, as outputted from the power split rotors, is defined as being positive in sign, the power split rotors are so disposed that when the power transmission control mechanism establishes transmission of the rotational energy that is positive in sign as the power from the first rotor to the internal combustion engine, ones of the power split rotors other than the first rotor are so linked as to provide output rotational energies which are different in sign from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0021">Specifically, when the power transmission control mechanism establishes the transmission of the rotational energy from the first rotor to the internal combustion engine, ones of the power split rotors other than the first rotor are to produce output rotational energies which are opposite in sign to each other. This enables the first rotor to be placed at an extremely low speed or a speed of zero (0) or the rotational energy outputted from the first rotor to be decreased to an extremely low level. Therefore, when the internal combustion engine is at a stop, but the vehicle is being run by the power of the rotary electric machine such as a motor-generator, the power transmission apparatus is capable of bringing the rotational speed of the first rotor substantially into agreement with a zero (0) speed of the internal combustion engine and then applying initial torque, as provided by the rotational energy outputted from the first rotor, to the internal combustion engine for starting it. This minimizes the vibration of the power transmission control mechanism which will arise from the application of the initial torque. After the application of initial torque from the first rotor to the internal combustion engine, in other words, the internal combustion engine has been started up, the power transmission apparatus may work to input torque, as produced by the internal combustion engine, into one or some of the power split rotors (e.g., the first rotor or other power split rotors) to drive the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0022">In the preferred mode of the invention, the ones of the power split rotors which produce the rotational energies different in sign from each other are coupled mechanically with each other through a path bypassing an assembly of the power split rotors. Specifically, this realizes the ones of the power split rotors which produce the rotational energies different in sign from each other without need for two rotary electric machines (e.g., motor-generators) one of which supplies the output rotational energy and other of which receives it.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0023">Rotors that are ones of the power split rotors and the first rotor are so linked as to have rotational speeds arrayed on a straight line in a monographic chart. The power transmission apparatus further includes a coupling mechanism which couples two of the rotors together mechanically outside the assembly of the power split rotors. The coupling mechanism works as a speed variator having a variable gear ratio (also called an input-to-output speed ratio). Specifically, an inclination of the straight line in the monographic chart is changed by controlling the gear ratio of the speed variator. Therefore, the speed of the first rotor may be controlled by changing the gear ratio regardless of the speed of the driven wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0024">The power transmission control mechanism works as a first power transmission control mechanism to selectively establish and block transmission of the power between the first rotor and a rotating shaft of the internal combustion engine. The power transmission apparatus further includes a second power transmission control mechanism working to selectively establish and block transmission of the power between a second rotor that is one of the power split rotors and the internal combustion engine. This structure enables the initial torque to be applied to the rotating shaft of the internal combustion engine from the first rotor and also the torque, as produced by the internal combustion engine, to be applied to the second rotor. Specifically, the engine may be started by the torque outputted from the power split rotor, thus eliminating the need for a separate engine starter. Further, the transmission of power between the first and second rotors and the engine may be blocked and established selectively, thus minimizing the amount of energy consumed by the application of torque to the engine when being at a stop and enabling the transmission of torque between the first and second rotors and the engine as a function of differences in speed between the rotating shaft of the engine and the first and second rotors.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0025">The first power transmission control mechanism is equipped with a one-way power transmission mechanism which establishes the transmission of the power when rotational speed of an input side of the one-way power transmission mechanism which connects with the first rotor relative to that of an output side thereof which connects with the rotating shaft of the internal combustion engine is not a negative value. When the fuel has started to be burned in the engine after being started, the torque on the rotating shaft will arise, so that the speed thereof increases quickly. The transmission of such a variation in torque to the first rotor may result in pulsation of torque in the power transmission apparatus. However, when the speed of the engine is increased above the input side of the one-way clutch connecting with the first rotor, the transmission of the variation in torque is blocked to the first rotor, thus avoiding the pulsation of torque in the power transmission apparatus (i.e., a body of the vehicle).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0026">The first power transmission control mechanism may also be equipped with an electronically controlled breaker which is separate from the one-way power transmission mechanism. The electronically controlled breaker works to block the transmission of power between the first rotor and the rotating shaft of the internal combustion engine. This enables avoids the transmission of power from the first rotor to the internal combustion engine before it required to start the internal combustion engine, thus minimizing the amount of energy to be consumed by application of power to the rotating shaft of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0027">The second power transmission control mechanism may be equipped with a one-way power transmission mechanism which establishes the transmission of the power when rotational speed of an input side of the one-way power transmission mechanism which connects with the rotating shaft of the internal combustion engine relative to that of an output side thereof which connects with the second rotor is not a negative value. When the rotating shaft of the engine is required to be joined mechanically to the second rotor to add the torque of the engine to the second rotor, it is preferable to bring the speed of the rotating shaft of the engine and that of the second rotor into agreement with each other. This, however, requires fine control of such speeds. The one-way power transmission mechanism works to apply the torque of the engine to the second rotor when the speed of the rotating shaft of the engine becomes equal to that of the second rotor, thus eliminating the need for the fine control of the speeds of the rotating shaft of the engine and the second rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0028">One of the power split rotors is coupled mechanically to the rotary electric machine. The power split rotors are so linked that rotational speed of the first rotor depends directly upon rotational speed of the one of the power split rotors coupled to the rotary electric machine. This enables the speed of the first rotor to be controlled by the speed of the rotary electric machine.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0029">One of the power split rotors is coupled mechanically to the rotary electric machine. The power split rotors are so linked that rotational speeds of ones of the power split rotors other than the one coupled to the rotary electric machine depend directly upon rotational speed of the one coupled to the rotary electric machine and rotational speed of the second rotor. This enables the speeds of the ones of the power split rotors to be controlled by the that of the rotary electric machine or the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0030">The first rotor and the second rotor may be implemented by one of the power split rotors. The first power transmission control mechanism is separate from the second power transmission control mechanism. Further, the first power transmission control mechanism and the second power transmission control mechanism may be implemented by an electronically controlled breaker working to break the transmission of power between the first rotor and the rotating shaft of the internal combustion engine. Additionally, the first rotor is preferable so that the speed of the first rotor may be controlled to zero (0) when the one of the power split rotors connected mechanically to the driven wheel is not zero in speed. When it is required to apply the initial torque from the first rotor to the internal combustion engine, the electronically controlled breaker desirably work to connect the first rotor to the rotating shaft of the engine mechanically, block the connection of the first rotor and the engine after the initial torque is applied and before the burning of fuel in the engine is controlled, and connect the first rotor and the engine mechanically when a difference between the first rotor and the engine is below a given value after start of the burning control of fuel in the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0031">The first rotor is separate from the second rotor. This enables the torque to be applied from the first rotor to the rotating shaft of the engine and also the torque to be applied from the engine to the second rotor. The transmission of torque between the first and second rotors and the engine may be established or blocked selectively, thus enabling the engine to be started when the speed of the first rotor is the speed suitable for starting the engine. After the engine is started up, the torque, as produced by the engine, may be transmitted to the driven wheel through the second rotor. This enables the engine torque to be used while the engine is running at a speed different from that of the first rotor. It is, therefore, possible to start the engine at the time when the engine may be brought into an effective speed range early.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0032">The power split rotors are so linked that rotational speed of the first rotor is lower than that of the second rotor. This enables the first rotor to be used to start the engine and the second rotor to be used to apply the engine torque to the driven wheel, thereby allowing the engine to continue to be run at a speed higher than that at which the engine has been started to transmit the engine torque to the driven wheel. It is, therefore, possible to start the engine so as to bring the speed thereof to an effective speed range early.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0033">The power split rotors may be implemented by three or more rotors which are so linked that rotational speeds thereof are arrayed on a straight line in a monographic chart. The first rotor is one of the three or more rotors which lies at middle in rotational speed in the monographic chart. This facilitates ease of bringing the first rotor to a relatively low speed, thus enabling a difference in speed between the first rotor and the rotating shaft of the engine to be decreased when the engine is started.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034">The power split rotors may be implemented by three or more rotors which are so linked that rotational speeds thereof are arrayed on a straight line in a monographic chart. Two of the three or more rotors which are different in rotational speed in the monographic chart are coupled mechanically to the rotary electric machine.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0035">At least one of the two of the three or more rotors is coupled to the rotary electric machine through a speed variator having a variable gear ratio. This structure enables the two of the rotors which are different in rotational speed in the monographic chart to be controlled in speed independently from each other, like in the case where two rotary electric machines are coupled mechanically to the two of the rotors. Additionally, in the case of use of such two rotary electric machines, this structure may also eliminate the loss of electric energy, as produced by one of the rotary electric machines which is operating as a generator, when the electric energy is supplied to the other rotary electric machine operating as an electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0036">One of the power split rotors coupled mechanically to the driven wheel may have rotational speed in the monographic chart which lies intermediate between rotational speeds of the two of the three or more rotors which are coupled mechanically to the rotary electric machine. Additionally, the power split rotors may be implemented by four rotors (e.g., a Ravineaux planetary gear set) which are so linked that rotational speeds thereof are arrayed on a straight line in a monographic chart. One of the four rotors which lies at middle in rotational speed in the monographic chart and is separate from the first rotor may be coupled mechanically to the driven wheel. Specifically, the driven wheel is connected to the rotor which has to have the middle speed in the monographic chart, thereby facilitating ease of rotating the driven wheel in a normal or a reverse direction or stopping it. The rotor coupled to the driven wheel is separate from the first rotor, thereby permitting the speed of the first rotor to be determined independently from the speed of the driven wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0037">The power transmission apparatus may further comprise a first planetary gear set and a second planetary gear set each of which is equipped with a sun gear, a carrier, and a ring gear that are three of the power split rotors. Two of the power split rotors of the first planetary gear set are coupled mechanically to two of the power split rotors of the second planetary gear set. Of four of a total of the six power split rotors of the first and second planetary gear sets which are different in rotational speed in a monographic chart, at least three are coupled mechanically to the rotary electric machine, the internal combustion engine, and the driven wheel, respectively. Specifically, the four of the six power split rotors are so linked as to have rotational speeds arrayed on a straight line in the monographic chart, thus specifying the speeds of the rotary electric machine, the internal combustion engine, and the driven wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0038">The power transmission apparatus may further comprise a switch working to switch one of the power split rotors coupled mechanically to the driven wheel to another.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0039">The adjustment of the speed of the driven wheel to a desired value results in addition of a limitation to the speeds of the power split rotors, which will result in addition of a limitation to the speed of the rotary electric machine or the internal combustion engine. Such speed adjustment may be a factor contributing to obstruction to the running of the rotary electric machine or the internal combustion engine in an effective speed range. In contrast, the structure of this invention alleviates the limitation to the speeds of the rotary electric machine or the internal combustion engine when it is required to bring the driven wheel to a desired speed, thereby enabling the rotary electric machine or the internal combustion engine to run in the effective speed range.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0040">The vehicle may be an automotive vehicle with two driven wheels. The power transmission apparatus may further comprise a switch working to switch ones of the power split rotors coupled mechanically to the driven wheels of the vehicle to others. The ones and the others of the power split rotors to be coupled to the driven wheels include the second rotor and one of the power split rotors other than the first rotor, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0041">The second rotor is coupled mechanically to the driven wheels through the second power transmission control mechanism. This structure prohibits the power from being transmitted from the internal combustion engine to the second rotor through the second power transmission control mechanism and enables the speed of the internal combustion engine to be adjusted to the speed of the driven wheels when the torque is being transmitted from the internal combustion engine to the second rotor. At this time, the torque may continue to be applied from the power split rotors to the driven wheels. Afterwards, the driven wheels may be connected mechanically to the second rotor through the second power transmission control mechanism, thereby enabling the driven wheels to be connected to the rotating shaft of the engine when they are rotating at the same speed. This minimizes the time for which the supply of torque to the driven wheels is being cut during the operation of the switch.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0042">According to the second aspect of the invention, there is provided a power transmission apparatus for a vehicle which comprises: (a) a plurality of power split rotors which work to rotate in conjunction with each other to split power among a rotary electric machine, an internal combustion engine, and a driven wheel of a vehicle; (b) a first power transmission control mechanism working to selectively establish and block transmission of the power between a first rotor that is one of the power split rotors and a rotating shaft of the internal combustion engine; and (c) a second power transmission control mechanism working to selectively establish and block transmission of the power between a second rotor that is one of the power split rotors and the rotating shaft of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0043">Specifically, the engine may be started by the torque outputted from the power split rotor, thus eliminating the need for a separate engine starter. Further, the transmission of power between the first and second rotors and the engine may be blocked and established selectively, thus minimizing the amount of energy consumed by the application of torque to the engine when being at a stop and enabling the transmission of torque between the first and second rotors and the engine as a function of differences in speed between the rotating shaft of the engine and the first and second rotors.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0096" num="0102">Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like parts in several views, particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>), there is shown a hybrid system made up of an in-vehicle power transmission device and a driving system according to the first embodiment of the invention. The in-vehicle power transmission device of this invention may alternatively be used with either an electric vehicle (EV) equipped only with an electric motor as a power source for running a road wheel or an automotive vehicle equipped only with an internal combustion engine as a power source for running a road wheel. The driving system is equipped with the in-vehicle power transmission device and a controller working to control an operation of the power transmission device. The driving system may also have installed therein a power source such as a motor-generator, an electric motor, or an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates the structure of the hybrid system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>) is a skeleton view of power transmission paths.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0104">The hybrid system includes a motor-generator <b>10</b> and a power split device <b>20</b>. The motor-generator <b>10</b> is made of a three-phase ac motor-generator and works as an in-vehicle power producing device along with an internal combustion engine <b>12</b>. The power split device <b>20</b> works to split power or torque among the motor-generator <b>10</b>, the internal combustion engine (e.g., a gasoline engine) <b>12</b>, and driven wheels <b>14</b> of an automotive vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0105">The power split device <b>20</b> includes a first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and a second planetary gear set <b>24</b>. The first planetary gear set <b>22</b> has a ring gear R joined mechanically to a carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> and also has a sun gear S joined mechanically to a sun gear S of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>. To the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>, an output axis (i.e. a rotating shaft) <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the motor-generator <b>10</b> is coupled mechanically. The driven wheels <b>14</b> of the vehicle are joined mechanically to the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>. Specifically, the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> are coupled mechanically to the driven wheels <b>14</b> through a typical differential gear and a typical drive shaft. Note that rotors (which will also be referred to as power split rotors below) of the power split device <b>20</b>, as referred to herein, are not limited to the sun gears S, the carriers C, and the ring gears R of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, but may additionally or only include rotating parts of the differential gear and/or the drive shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0106">The carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> is connected mechanically to the crankshaft (i.e., a rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a</i>) of the internal combustion engine <b>12</b> through a clutch <b>30</b> and a one-way bearing <b>32</b>. The clutch <b>30</b> works as an electronically controlled mechanical breaker to block the transmission of power (torque) between the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the one-way bearing <b>32</b>. In this embodiment, the clutch <b>30</b> is of a normally open type. The one-way bearing <b>32</b> works as a one-way transmission mechanism to permit the transmission of power (torque) from the clutch <b>30</b> to the engine <b>12</b> under the condition that the rotational speed of the clutch <b>30</b> is not lower than that of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b>. In other words, when the clutch <b>20</b> is engaged, the one-way bearing <b>32</b> works to have the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> follow the rotation of the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> unless the speed of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> is greater than that of the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0107">A one-way bearing <b>34</b> is disposed between the sun gear S of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the sun gear S of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>. Like the one-way bearing <b>32</b>, the one-way bearing <b>34</b> works as a one-way transmission mechanism to permit the transmission of power (torque) from the engine <b>12</b> to the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> under the condition that the speed of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> is not lower than the speed of the sun gears S. In other words, the one-way bearing <b>34</b> works to have the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> follow the rotation of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> unless the speed of the sun gears S is greater than that of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0108">The sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are coupled mechanically to a rotating shaft <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the motor-generator <b>10</b> through a clutch <b>38</b> and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) <b>36</b>. The CVT <b>36</b> is, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), joined mechanically to the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> through a counter gear CN. In other words, the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are so linked as to receive the torque from the motor-generator <b>10</b> without any rotating parts or rotors (i.e., the power split rotors) of the power split device <b>20</b> which engage the sun gears S. The number of teeth of the counter gear CN may be either identical with or different from that of the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>. The CVT <b>36</b>, as used in this embodiment, is of a mechanical type using a metallic or rubber belt. The clutch <b>38</b> functions as an electronically controlled mechanical breaker to block or open the transmission of power between the CVT <b>36</b> and the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0109">The hybrid system also includes a controller <b>40</b> to control an operation of the power transmission device. The controller <b>40</b> works to actuate the clutches <b>30</b> and <b>38</b> to control the operation of the power transmission device and determine a controlled variable of the engine <b>12</b>. The controller <b>40</b> also works to control an operation of an inverter <b>42</b> to determine a controlled variable of the motor-generator <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0110">A vehicle starting operation using the power transmission device and starting control of the engine <b>12</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0111">First, the vehicle starting operation using the motor-generator <b>10</b> will be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates a power transmission path when the vehicle is started. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>) is a monographic chart which represents the operation of the power split device <b>20</b> along with the speed of the engine <b>12</b>. In the illustrated case, the clutch <b>30</b> is blocking the connection between the one-way bearing <b>32</b> and the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>. The clutch <b>28</b> is connecting between the CVT <b>36</b> and the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0112">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), the engine <b>12</b> is at a stop. The speeds of the rotors of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> which constitute the power split device <b>20</b> depend upon the speed of the motor-generator <b>10</b> and the gear ratio (also called an input-to-output speed ratio, a variable speed ratio, a pulley ratio, or a CVT ratio) of the CVT <b>36</b>. Specifically, in the monographic chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), the speed of the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> (i.e., the speed of a transmission shaft or axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>)), the speed of the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> (i.e., the speed of a starting axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>)), the speed of the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> (i.e., the speed of output in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>)), and the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> (i.e., the speed of the MG <b>10</b>) lie on a diagonal straight line. The speeds of the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> other than the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> are, therefore, set by determining the speeds of the sun gears S and the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>. The sun gears S, the carriers C, and the ring gears R of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> rotate in conjunction with each other. For instance, the speed of the carriers C may be zero (0) depending upon the speeds of the sun gears S and the ring gears R.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0113">The structure of the power transmission device of this embodiment is designed to enable the motor-generator <b>10</b> to produce a higher degree of torque when starting the vehicle without need for increasing the size of the motor-generator <b>10</b>. This is for the following reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0114">If, in the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>, a ratio of the number Zs of teeth of the sun gear S to the number Zr of teeth of the ring gear R (i.e., Zs/Zr) is defined as &#x3c1;, a ratio of the speed Nm of the motor-generator <b>10</b> to the speed Ns of the sun gear S (i.e., Nm/Ns) is defined as &#x3b2;, and torques of the ring gear R, the sun gear S, the carrier C, and the motor-generator <b>10</b> are defined as Tr, Ts, Tc, and Tm, respectively, equations, as listed below, are met.

<p id="p-0109" num="0115">Eliminating torques Tr and Ts from Eq. (c3) using Eqs. (c1) and (c2), we obtain

<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Tc</i>=(1+&#x3c1;)<i>Tm</i>/{(&#x3c1;/&#x3b2;)&#x2212;1}&#x2003;&#x2003;(c4)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0116">Eq. (c4) shows that a great increase in torque Tc of the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> (i.e., the output axis of the power split device <b>20</b>), in other words, the torque to be transmitted to the driven wheels <b>14</b> is achieved by approximating the ratios &#x3c1; and &#x3b2; to each other. This ensures the torque required to start the vehicle without need for increasing the size of the motor-generator <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0117">The hybrid system of this embodiment is capable of selecting the gear ratio (i.e., a speed ratio) of the CVT <b>36</b> to achieve the so-called geared neutral which places the speed of the driven wheels <b>14</b> at zero (0) during running of the motor-generator <b>10</b>. Specifically, the power split device <b>20</b> is so designed that amounts of output rotational energy (i.e., power) of the sun gear S and the ring gear R that are the rotors of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> other than the carrier C coupled to the driven wheels <b>14</b> are, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>), opposite in sign to each other. Therefore, when the geared neutral is established to place the speed of the driven wheels <b>14</b> at zero (0), it will cause the power to be circulated between the sun gear S and the ring gear R through a looped mechanical path equipped with the clutch <b>38</b> and the CVT <b>36</b>. In other words, when the power split device <b>20</b> is in the geared neutral, the amount of rotational energy (i.e., power) outputted to the driven wheels <b>14</b> will be zero (0). If the power is not circulated through the looped mechanical path extending through the sun gear S and the ring gear R, it will cause the output energy of the motor-generator <b>10</b> to be consumed fully as thermal energy in the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> according to the energy conservation law. This will result in impractical structure of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> which does not work to split the power, in other words, in which the rotors do not function as power split rotors of the power split device <b>20</b>. When the geared neutral is established in the hybrid system of this embodiment, it will cause the power to be recirculated inevitably in the power split device <b>20</b>. The looped path extending from the ring gear R, to the sun gear S of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>, and back to the ring gear R needs not continue mechanically completely. For instance, the looped path may be a path which has a disconnected portion to be closed selectively by a clutch to enable the rotational energy to be recirculated. Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>), the plus (+) and minus (&#x2212;) signs of the rotational direction of each of the sun gear S, the carrier C, and the ring gear R represent opposite directions: a normal direction and a reverse direction thereof, the plus (+) sign of the rotational energy (i.e., power) indicates when the rotational energy is outputted from the power split device <b>20</b>, and the plus (+) and minus (&#x2212;) signs of the torque are so defined as to meet the condition that the product of signs of the rotational direction and the torque will be the sign of the rotational energy (i.e., power).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0118">In the geared neutral, the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> does not function to transmit the power. Specifically, the clutch <b>30</b> is disengaged, so that the torque of the carrier C will be zero (0), and thus the torque of the sun gear S and the ring gear R will also be zero (0) according to Eqs. (c1) and (c2), as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0119">The starting control of the engine <b>12</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>) show an operation of the power transmission device to start the engine <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates a power transmission path when the engine <b>12</b> is started. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>) is a monographic chart which represents the operation of the power split device <b>20</b> along with the speed of the engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0121">When it is required to start the engine <b>12</b>, the controller <b>40</b> (not shown) engages the clutch <b>30</b> to transmit the torque from the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> (i.e., the torque from the starting axis) to the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> through the clutch <b>30</b> and the one-way bearing <b>32</b>, thereby achieving initial rotation of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b>. The rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> is driven or rotated by the rotation of the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>. When the speed of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> is increased to a given value, the controller <b>40</b> starts to control the burning of fuel in the engine <b>12</b>. At an initial stage when the fuel has started to be burned after the engine <b>12</b> is cranked, the torque on the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>rises rapidly, so that the speed thereof increases quickly. At this time, the speed of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>is, however, higher than that of the carrier C, so that the torque is not transmitted to the carrier C, so that the pulsation of torque is, thus, not transmitted to the power split device <b>20</b> at the initial stage of burning of the engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0122">The hybrid system of this embodiment is capable of regulating the speed of the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> to an extremely low value or exactly to zero (0). Specifically, the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> is so linked that when the clutch <b>30</b> is engaged to output a positive (+) rotational energy from the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> to the engine <b>12</b>, some (i.e., two in this embodiment) of the power split rotors other than the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> are opposite in sign of output rotational energy thereof to each other, thereby enabling the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> to be placed at the geared neutral. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>c</i>), the sun gear S and the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> is opposite in sign of output rotational energy (i.e., power) thereof to each other and are coupled to each other through a looped mechanical path, thus enabling the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> to be placed at the geared neutral in the same way, as described above with respect to the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>, without need for two rotary electric machines (e.g., motor-generators): one for receiving the output rotational energy, as produced by the ring gear R, and the other for inputting the output rotational energy to the sun gear S. The looped mechanical path, like in the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>, needs not continue mechanically and completely.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0123">Upon completion of the starting of the engine <b>12</b>, the controller <b>40</b> disengages the clutch <b>30</b>. When it is required to restart the engine <b>12</b> within a short time after the engine <b>12</b> is stopped, it may cause the engine <b>12</b> to have been restarted before the speed of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> drops to zero (0). In such an event, the restarting of the engine <b>12</b> is achieved by regulating the speed of the motor-generator <b>10</b> and/or the gear ratio of the CVT <b>36</b> to bring the speed of the sun gear S into agreement with that of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> while keeping the speed of the driven wheels <b>14</b> at a required value.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>) show an operation of the power transmission device after the engine <b>12</b> is started up. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates a power transmission path through which the torque, as outputted from the engine <b>12</b> is transmitted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) is a monographic chart which represents the operation of the power split device <b>20</b> along with the speed of the engine <b>12</b>. The clutch <b>30</b> is disengaged to block the connection between the one-way bearing <b>32</b> and the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0125">After the engine <b>12</b> is started up, the speed of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> reaches the speed of the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> (i.e., the speed of the power transmission axis), thereby giving the torque of the engine <b>12</b> to the power split device <b>20</b>. After the torque is provided from the engine <b>12</b> to the power split device <b>20</b>, the controller <b>40</b> may operate the motor-generator <b>10</b> as an electric generator or turn off the inverter <b>42</b> to place the motor-generator <b>10</b> in a no-load operation.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0126">As apparent from the above discussion, the hybrid system of this embodiment is capable of starting the internal combustion engine <b>12</b> during running of the vehicle powered by the motor-generator <b>10</b>, in other words, during the operation of the motor-generator <b>10</b> without use of a typical engine starter equipped with an electric motor. The rotor used to start the engine <b>12</b> (i.e., the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>) and the rotors to which the torque of the engine <b>12</b> is given (i.e., the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>) are designed to be separate, in other words, disposed independently from each other, thereby enabling the speed of the rotors to which the torque is provided from the engine <b>12</b> to be elevated quickly after the starting of the engine <b>12</b>. This results in an increase in time the engine <b>12</b> is run in an effective operation range.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0127">The structure of the hybrid system of this embodiment offers the following advantages.
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0128">1) The power transmission device is equipped with a first power transmission control mechanism working to establish or block transmission of power between the first rotor that is a part of the power split device <b>20</b> (i.e., the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>) and the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> and a second power transmission control mechanism working to establish or block transmission of power between the second rotors that are parts of the power split device <b>20</b> (i.e., the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>) and the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b>. Specifically, the power transmission device works to ensure the start of the engine <b>12</b> during the running of the vehicle using the motor-generator <b>10</b> and also bring the speed of the engine <b>12</b> to an effective speed range quickly.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0129">2) The first power transmission control mechanism is equipped with a one-way transmission mechanism (i.e., the one-way bearing <b>32</b>) which works to permit the power or torque to be transmitted from the power split device <b>20</b> to the engine <b>12</b> when the speed of the first rotor (i.e., the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>) relative to that of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine is not negative or below zero (0). This eliminates the addition of pulsation of torque, as arising from the initial burning of fuel in the combustion chamber of the engine <b>12</b>, to the power split device <b>20</b>, thus avoiding undesirable swinging of the vehicle body.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0130">3) The first power transmission control mechanism also includes an electronically-controlled power transmission breaker (i.e., the clutch <b>30</b>) which block the transmission of power between the first rotor (i.e., the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>) and the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> in addition to the one-way bearing <b>32</b>. This avoids the transmission of power or torque from the first rotor to the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>before the engine <b>12</b> is to be started, thereby saving the energy consumption.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0131">4) The controller <b>40</b> disengages the clutch <b>30</b> after the start-up of the engine <b>12</b>, thereby minimizing the supply of electric power to the clutch <b>30</b>.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0132">5) The second power transmission control mechanism is equipped with a one-way transmission mechanism (i.e., the one-way bearing <b>34</b>) which works to permit the power or torque to be transmitted from the generator-motor <b>10</b> to the engine <b>12</b> when the speed of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine relative to that of the second rotor (i.e., the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>) is not negative or below zero. The torque, as produced by the engine <b>12</b>, is therefore transmitted to the sun gears S when the speed of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> becomes identical with that of the sun gears S. The use of the second power transmission control mechanism results in simplicity of control of start of addition of torque from the engine <b>12</b> to the sun gears S and also permits the speed of the engine <b>12</b> to be controlled below that of the sun gears S to place the engine <b>12</b> in a no-load operation when the power of the engine <b>12</b> is not required.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0133">6) The speed of the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> at which the initial torque is to be added to the engine <b>12</b> is selected to be lower than or equal to the speed of the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, thereby bringing the engine <b>12</b> to the effective operation range quickly immediately after the engine <b>12</b> is started up.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0134">7) The power split device <b>20</b> is equipped with the three or more rotors (i.e., the three rotors S, C, and R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> in this embodiment) which are designed to have speeds thereof lying on the straight line in the monographic chart and uses one of the three or more rotors which is to have the middle of the speeds in the monographic chart as a rotor for giving the initial torque to the engine <b>12</b>, thereby resulting in a decreased difference in speed between that rotor and the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> immediately before the engine <b>12</b> is started.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0135">8) Two of the rotors (i.e., the rotors of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> in this embodiment) which are to have the right and left ends of the speeds in the monographic chart are joined mechanically to the motor-generator <b>10</b>, thereby enabling the motor-generator <b>10</b> to be run in an increased effective operation range.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0136">9) Of the two of the rotors of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>, as described above, which are to have the rightmost and leftmost ones of the speeds in the monographic chart, respectively, one is joined mechanically with the motor-generator <b>10</b> through the CVT <b>36</b>, thereby enabling the two of the rotors to be controlled in speed independently from each other like the case where two motor-generators are used in connection with the two of the rotors, respectively. In the case of use of such two motor-generators, this structure may also eliminate the loss of electric energy, as produced by one of the motor-generators which is operating as a generator, when the electric energy is supplied to the other motor-generator operating as an electric motor.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0137">10) Of the four rotor groups (i.e., (a) the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, (b) the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>, (c) the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>, and (d) the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> in the first embodiment) which are to have different speeds in the monographic chart, respectively, one (i.e., the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>) other than one used to add the initial torque to the engine <b>12</b> for starting it is joined mechanically with the driven wheels <b>14</b>, thereby facilitating ease of rotating the driven wheels <b>14</b> in a normal or a reverse direction and stopping them. The speed of the rotor for use in giving the initial torque to the engine <b>12</b> may be set independently from that of the driven wheels <b>14</b>.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0138">11) The power split device <b>20</b> is designed to joint two of the three rotor of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> mechanically to two of the three rotors of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>, respectively, thereby enabling the four groups of the power split device <b>20</b> to be arrayed in speed on the straight line in the monographic chart, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>).</li>

<p id="p-0122" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a hybrid system according to the second embodiment of the invention. The same reference numbers as employed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> refer to the same parts, and explanation thereof in detail will be omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0140">The hybrid system of this embodiment is designed to switch between the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> which are to be connected mechanically to the driven wheels <b>14</b> of the vehicle. Specifically, the hybrid system, as clearly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, includes an electronically controlled clutch <b>50</b> which works as a switch or selector to select one of (a) a pair of the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> and (b) the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> which is to be coupled to the driven wheels <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0141">The use of the clutch <b>50</b> enables the motor-generator <b>10</b> or the engine <b>12</b> to be run in an increased effective operation range. For example, increasing of the speed of the driven wheels <b>14</b> coupled to the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> during the operation of the motor-generator <b>10</b> requires increasing the speed of the motor-generator <b>10</b> above that of the driven wheels <b>14</b>. The increasing of the speed of the motor-generator <b>10</b> up to an inefficient operation range will result in an increase in consumed amount of energy in the hybrid system. In order to alleviate this problem, when the inefficient operation range is entered, the controller <b>40</b> connects the driven wheels <b>14</b> mechanically to the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>, thereby eliminating the need for increasing the speed of the motor-generator <b>10</b> above that of the driven wheels <b>14</b>. Similarly, when the driven wheels <b>14</b> are being powered by the internal combustion engine <b>12</b>, the controller <b>40</b> may work to switch between the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> which are to be connected mechanically to the driven wheels <b>14</b> in a range where it is difficult to run the engine <b>12</b> effectively only through control of the CVT <b>36</b> in order to keep the engine <b>12</b> running in the effective operation range.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0142">The switching of a first mode in which the driven wheels <b>14</b> are coupled to the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> to a second mode in which the driven wheels <b>14</b> are coupled to the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> is achieved by operating the clutch <b>50</b> to block the transmission of torque from the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> to the driven wheels <b>14</b>, bringing the speed of the motor-generator <b>10</b> to that of the driven wheels <b>14</b>, and operating the clutch <b>50</b> to establish a mechanical connection of the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> to the driven wheels <b>14</b>. Conversely, the switching of the second mode in which the driven wheels <b>14</b> are coupled to the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> to the first mode in which the driven wheels <b>14</b> are coupled to the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> is achieved by operating the clutch <b>50</b> to block the transmission of torque from the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> to the driven wheels <b>14</b>, controlling the operation of the motor-generator <b>10</b> to bring the speed of the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> to that of the driven wheels <b>14</b>, and operating the clutch <b>50</b> to establish a mechanical connection of the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> to the driven wheels <b>14</b>.</p>

Note that a counter gear (not shown) is actually installed between the clutch <b>50</b> and the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0179">The switching between the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> to be connected mechanically to the driven wheels <b>14</b> in the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref><i>a</i>) is achieved, like in the structure of the second embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, by disconnecting the power split device <b>14</b> from the driven wheels <b>14</b> temporarily. In contrast, the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref><i>b</i>) has the advantage that the power may continue to be given to the driven wheels <b>14</b> while the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> are being switched. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>16</b>(<i>c</i>) demonstrate a sequence of switching operation, as performed by the controller <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1)</figref>, i.e., how to switch the connection of the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> to the driven wheels <b>14</b> to the connection of the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> to the driven wheels <b>14</b> in the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref><i>a</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>a</i>) shows that the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> are coupled to the driven wheels <b>14</b>, and the engine <b>12</b> is increased in speed to increase the amount of energy supplied from the engine <b>12</b> to the driven wheels <b>14</b>. When it has been required to supply an additional amount of energy to the driven wheels <b>14</b>, however, a further increase in speed of the engine <b>12</b> will result in a decrease in efficiency in supplying the energy to the driven wheels <b>14</b>, the controller <b>40</b> lowers, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>b</i>), the speed of the engine <b>12</b> toward the speed of the driven wheels <b>14</b>. The speed of the driven wheels <b>14</b> is kept by the motor-generator <b>10</b>.

The speed of the engine <b>12</b> is, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>c</i>), coincident with that of the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, so that the engine <b>12</b> and the CVT <b>36</b> set two of the four different speeds in the monographic chart. In the case of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>, the speeds of the sun gear S and the ring gear R are set.

<p id="p-0162" num="0180">The switching of the mechanical connection of the power split device <b>20</b> to the driven wheels <b>14</b> through clutch <b>50</b> in of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref><i>a</i>) may be achieved in one of three following manners: (a) in which the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are first connected to the driven wheels <b>14</b> through the clutch <b>50</b> to make two mechanical connections of the driven wheels <b>14</b> to (1) a combination of the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> and to (2) a combination of the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, and the connection of the driven wheels <b>14</b> to (1) the combination of the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> is opened by the clutch <b>50</b>; (b) in which the clutch <b>50</b> is controlled to simultaneously switch the mechanical connection of the driven wheels <b>14</b> to (1) the combination of the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> to (2) the combination of the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>; and (c) in which the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and the carrier C of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> are first disconnected from the driven wheels <b>14</b> through the clutch <b>50</b> to disengage the clutch <b>50</b> fully, and the mechanical connection of the driven wheels <b>14</b> to the combination of the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> is achieved by the clutch <b>50</b>. The first manner (a) is most preferable in that the switching of the mechanical connections to the driven wheels <b>14</b> is achieved without any omission of transmission of torque to the driven wheels <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0181">The structure of the hybrid system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref><i>a</i>) or <b>15</b>(<i>b</i>) permits the vehicle to be towed in the event of an emergency.

Alternatively, the clutch <b>38</b> is disengaged to disconnect the sun gear S from the ring gear R of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>, thereby allowing the driven wheels <b>14</b> to rotate freely.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0182">The hybrid system of the second embodiment or the above modifications is designed to switch or change the rotors of the power split device <b>40</b> which are to be connected mechanically to the driven wheels <b>14</b>, but however, may alternatively be designed to change the rotor of the power split device <b>40</b> which is to be connected mechanically to the motor-generator <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0183">The first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the power split device <b>20</b> may alternatively be designed to have structures different from those described in the above embodiments as long as any two of the three rotors (i.e., the sun gear S, the carrier C, and the ring gear R) of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> are coupled mechanically to any two of the three rotors (i.e., the sun gear S, the carrier C, and the ring gear R) of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>17</b>(<i>j</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>18</b>(<i>j</i>) are monographic charts illustrating possible modifications of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Each of the monographic charts represents a relation in connection between a total of six rotors of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and a relation between four different speeds arraying straight in the monographic chart and the six rotors of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Note that the ratio of the number of teeth of the run gear S to that of the ring gear R is, however, indicated schematically for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0184">In each of the monographic charts, the sun gear S, the carrier C, and the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> are illustrated on the upper side.

Which of the ratio of the number of teeth of the run gear S to that of the ring gear R of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> and that of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> is greater is represented by lateral locations of vertical lines indicating the sun gears S. The same advantages, as described in the first embodiment, may be obtained by connecting the motor-generator <b>10</b> to the rotor of the power split device <b>20</b> which lies in speed at the right or left end in the monographic chart, and connecting the rotors having intermediate speeds to the starting axis for the engine <b>12</b> and the driven wheels <b>14</b>, respectively from the left in the monographic chart. The rotor to which the motor-generator <b>10</b> is connected mechanically without the CVT <b>36</b> is not limited to the rotor lying in speed at the right end in the monographic chart, but may be the rotor lying at the left end in the monographic chart. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>19</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>19</b>(<i>c</i>) illustrate modifications of the first embodiment in which the motor-generator <b>10</b> is connected mechanically to the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> without the CVT <b>36</b> which lie in speed at the left end in the monographic chart. The examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>19</b>(<i>b</i>) are opposite in location of the one-way bearing <b>32</b> and the clutch <b>30</b>. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>c</i>) omits the one-way bearing <b>32</b>. The rotors connected to the starting axis for the engine <b>12</b> and the driven wheels <b>14</b> need not always have intermediate speeds in the monographic chart. When there are the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> other than the rotor coupled mechanically to the starting axis are different in sign of output rotational energy thereof, the speed of the starting axis may be placed at an extremely low value or exactly zero (0). This ensures the addition of the initial torque to the engine <b>12</b>. When there are the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> other than the rotors coupled mechanically to the driven wheels <b>14</b> are different in sign of output rotational energy, the speed of the driven wheels <b>14</b> may be placed at a positive value, a negative value, or zero (0) while the rotation of the motor-generator <b>10</b> is kept in one of opposed directions.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0185">The power split device <b>20</b> may alternatively be designed to have a single planetary gear set, that is, either of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. For instance, the power split device <b>20</b> may be equipped with a single planetary gear set and two motor-generators: first and second motor-generators. The first motor-generator is connected mechanically to the sun gear of the planetary gear set. The second motor-generator is connected mechanically to the ring gear of the planetary gear set. The carrier of the planetary gear set is connected mechanically to the starting axis of the power split device <b>20</b>. The power transmission axis is connected to the ring gear of the planetary gear set. This enables the engine <b>12</b> to be started. The power split device <b>10</b> may also be designed to have the structure, as taught in the first to third publications already referred to in the introductory part of this application, instead of the planetary gear set equipped with the sun gear, the carrier, and the ring gear. The same advantage (6), as described in the first embodiment, may be obtained by selecting the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> which are to be connected to the starting axis and the power transmission axis so that the speed of the starting axis may be lower than or equal to that of the power transmission axis. The power split device <b>20</b> may be so designed that the speed of the rotor connecting with the starting axis depends upon that of the rotor connecting with the motor-generator <b>10</b>. This structure ensures the accuracy in controlling the speed of the rotor connecting with the starting axis, i.e., starting of the engine <b>12</b>. The power split device <b>20</b> may be so designed that the speed of the rotors connecting with the driven wheels <b>14</b> depends upon those of the rotors connecting with the motor-generator <b>10</b> and the engine <b>12</b>. This structure ensures the accuracy in controlling the speed of the rotors connecting with the driven wheels <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0186">In the above examples, the motor-generator <b>10</b> needs not always be connected mechanically to the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> which lie in speed at the right and left ends in the monographic chart. For instance, the motor-generator <b>10</b> may be connected mechanically to the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> other than those lying in speed at the right or left end in the monographic chart. In the case where such a connection sets the speed of the rotor(s) lying at either of the right or left ends in the monographic chart, that rotor(s) may be joined to the power transmission axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>22</b>(<i>b</i>) illustrate modifications of the power split device <b>20</b> which are different from the one of the first embodiment in mechanical connection with the motor-generator <b>10</b> and/or the CVT <b>36</b>. Such modifications may be used with the hybrid system in the second to fifth embodiments or in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>18</b>(<i>j</i>). It is, however, advisable that the rotor(s) of the power split device <b>20</b> connecting mechanically with the motor-generator <b>10</b> or the CVT <b>36</b> be, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>20</b>(<i>d</i>), different from those connecting mechanically with the driven wheels <b>14</b>, which enables the speed of the motor-generator <b>10</b> to be adjusted to a value other than zero (0) when the speed of the driven wheels <b>14</b> is zero (0). Therefore, when the speed of the driven wheels <b>14</b> is zero (0), the engine <b>12</b> may be started to run the vehicle. Additionally, when the driven wheels <b>14</b> are at a stop, the motor-generator <b>10</b> may be used to drive an accessory installed in the vehicle such as a compressor of an in-vehicle air conditioner or a brake pump.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0187">The power split device <b>20</b> may also be designed to have the rotor(s) which lies in rotational speed at either of the right or left end in the monographic chart and is connected mechanically to the driven wheels <b>14</b>. The installation of a gear change mechanism such as a speed variator between that rotor(s) and the driven wheels <b>14</b> results in increased accuracy in controlling the speed of the driven wheels <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0188">The power split rotors of the power split device <b>20</b>, as already described above, need not include only the rotors of the planetary gear set(s), but may be implemented only by or additionally include rotating parts of the differential gear and/or the drive shaft of the automotive vehicle. The power split device <b>20</b> may also be designed to have three or more rotors which are out of the straight line in speed in the monographic chart. For example, the power spilt device <b>20</b> may be made of a typical gear box with clutches.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0189">The power split device <b>20</b> of the first to fifth embodiment has the rotors which lie in speed at the right and left ends in the monographic chart and either of which is connected to the motor-generator <b>10</b> through the CVT <b>36</b>, but however, both these rotors may alternatively be coupled to the CVT <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0190">The mechanical connections of the driven wheels <b>14</b>, the engine <b>12</b>, the motor-generator <b>10</b> to the power split device <b>20</b> may alternatively be achieved in some way different from those as described above.

The selection of the counter gear depending upon specifications of the engine <b>12</b> such as the direction of rotation thereof will ensure the desired distribution of power to the driven wheels <b>14</b>. The mechanical connection of the driven wheels <b>14</b> to the power split device <b>20</b> may also be achieved using a chain or a belt instead of a rigid gear mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0191">Similarly, a counter gear may also be disposed between the engine <b>12</b> and the power transmission axis or the starting axis of eth power split device <b>20</b>.

The mechanical connection of the engine <b>12</b> and the power split device <b>20</b> may also be achieved using a chain or a belt instead of a rigid gear mechanism. A gear change mechanism such as a speed variator may also be disposed between the power spilt device <b>20</b> and the engine <b>12</b>. In this case, the same advantages as those in the above embodiments may be obtained by connecting the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> which are coupled to the power transmission axis to the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> through the gear change mechanism. This also enables the speed of the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>to differ from that of the speed of the power transmission axis. Additionally, a speed increasing mechanism such as a speed increasing gear set or a speed reducer such as a speed reduction gear set may also be disposed between the engine <b>12</b> and the power split device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0192">A speed increasing mechanism such as a speed increasing gear set or a speed reducer such as a speed reduction gear set may also be disposed in a mechanical connection between the motor-generator <b>10</b> and the power split device <b>20</b> without the CVT <b>36</b>. The hybrid system of the first embodiment, as clearly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), has the motor-generator <b>10</b> mechanically connected to the ring gear of the second planetary gear set <b>24</b> through the counter gear CN. Similarly, a rotary reversing mechanism such as a counter gear may also be disposed between the CVT <b>36</b> and the sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. This is achieved under the condition that the speed of the carrier C can be zero (0) when the speeds of the sun gear S and the ring gear R are opposite in sign to each other, however, may also be achieved under the condition that the speed of the carrier C can be zero (0) when the speeds of the sun gear S and the ring gear R are the same in sign. For example, it may be realized by using a so-called double planetary gear set, as taught in Japanese Patent First Publication No. 2001-108073. The mechanical connection of the motor-generator <b>10</b> to the power split device <b>20</b> without the CVT <b>36</b> may also be achieved using a chain or a belt as well as a rigid gear mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0193">In the first to fifth embodiments, the CVT <b>36</b> disposed between the motor-generator <b>10</b> and the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> which lie at one of ends in the monographic chart defining the speeds of the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> needs not be of a belt-type. For example, a traction drive type or hydraulic continuously variable transmission may be used. Alternatively, a gear transmission may be used instead of the CVT <b>36</b>. The same applies to the CVT <b>36</b> installed between the motor-generator <b>10</b> and the rotor of the power split device <b>20</b> which is at the intermediate location of the monographic chart in the structures, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>22</b>(<i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0194">The rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> to which the motor-generator <b>10</b> and the CVT <b>36</b> are to be connected mechanically need not be objects which are arrayed in speed on the straight line in the monographic chart. The rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> referred to herein are, as described above, not limited to the rotors of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, but may additionally or only include rotating parts of the differential gear and/or the drive shaft of the automotive vehicle. For instance, in the case where the power split device <b>20</b> is equipped with two planetary gear sets which are coupled, as like in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20(</figref><i>c</i>) or <b>20</b>(<i>d</i>), through the CVT <b>36</b>, one of three rotors of one of the two planetary gear sets is connected mechanically (directly) to one of three rotors of the other planetary gear set so that two straight lines each of which extends through vertical axes of the monographic chart indicating the rotational speeds of the three rotors of one of the planetary gear sets may intersect at a single point in the monographic chart. The rotor on one of the two lines and the rotor on the other line may be selected as the objects to which the motor-generator <b>10</b> and the CVT <b>36</b> are to be connected mechanically.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0195">In each of the above embodiments, the starting axis is separate from the power transmission axis, but a single axis may alternatively be used as working as the starting and power transmission axes, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>23</b>(<i>b</i>). The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(</figref><i>a</i>) is a modification of the first embodiment. The carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> is used as both a first rotor to provide the initial torque to start the engine <b>12</b> and a second rotor to which the power, as produced by the engine <b>12</b>, is added. The feature of this structure is that the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> is connected to the engine <b>12</b> through a first power transmission path equipped with the clutch <b>30</b> and the one-way bearing <b>32</b> and a second power transmission path equipped with the one-way bearing <b>34</b> and the clutch <b>31</b>. This ensures the starting of the engine <b>12</b> and supply of power from the engine <b>12</b> to the power split device <b>20</b> through only one (i.e., the carrier C) of the rotors of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>. Specifically, when it is required to start the engine <b>12</b>, the controller <b>40</b> disengages the clutch <b>31</b> and engages the clutch <b>30</b> to transmit the torque of the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> to the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b>. After the engine <b>12</b> is started up, the controller <b>40</b> engages the clutch <b>31</b> to transmit the torque of the engine <b>12</b> to the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0196">Similarly, the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(</figref><i>b</i>) is a modification of the first embodiment. The sun gears S of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>14</b> is used as the rotors of the power split device <b>20</b> to provide the initial torque to start the engine <b>12</b> and to which the power, as produced by the engine <b>12</b>, is added. The feature of this structure is, like in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>a</i>), that the sun gears S the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are connected to the engine <b>12</b> through the first power transmission path equipped with the clutch <b>30</b> and the one-way bearing <b>32</b> and the second power transmission path equipped with the one-way bearing <b>34</b> and the clutch <b>31</b>. The first power transmission path in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(</figref><i>a</i>) or <b>23</b>(<i>b</i>) may alternatively be equipped with only the one-way bearing <b>32</b>. Similarly the second transmission path may alternatively be equipped with only the clutch <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0197">The same structure as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(</figref><i>a</i>) or <b>23</b>(<i>b</i>) may be used in each of the other embodiments or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>18</b>(<i>j</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0198">The above structure in which the engine <b>12</b> and the power split device <b>20</b> are connected through the single power transmission path may be modified as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>24</b>(<i>b</i>). In the example of each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>24</b>(<i>b</i>), the power transmission path has installed therein the clutch <b>30</b> which works to establish or block the transmission of power to or from the engine <b>12</b> as needed. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(</figref><i>a</i>) is so designed that the speed of the rotor of the power split device <b>20</b> which connects mechanically with the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b> can be zero (0) when the speed of the driven wheels <b>14</b> is not zero (0).

<p id="p-0181" num="0199"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>25</b>(<i>c</i>) demonstrate an operation of the hybrid system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(</figref><i>a</i>) to start the engine <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25(</figref><i>a</i>) represents the speed of the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25(</figref><i>b</i>) represents the status of the clutch <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25(</figref><i>c</i>) represents the speed of the engine <b>12</b>. When the speed of the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25(</figref><i>a</i>), zero (0), the controller <b>40</b> engages the clutch <b>30</b> to provide the initial torque to the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>to start or crank the engine <b>12</b>. Afterwards, the controller <b>40</b> disengages the clutch <b>30</b> to open the mechanical connection between the engine <b>12</b> and the carrier C and starts the burning of fuel in the engine <b>12</b>. When the speed of the engine <b>12</b> becomes equal to that of the carrier C, the controller <b>40</b> engages the clutch <b>30</b> to establish the mechanical connection between the engine <b>12</b> and the carrier C. The engagement of the clutch <b>30</b> needs not always be established only when the speed of the engine <b>12</b> is exactly identical with that of the carrier C. Such engagement may be achieved when a difference in speed between the engine <b>12</b> and the carrier C lies within a given range near zero (0). The use of such a condition enables the hybrid system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(</figref><i>b</i>) to start the engine <b>12</b> during running of the motor-generator <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0200">The hybrid system of each of the above embodiments is equipped with a single or two rotary electric machines which are also called a dynamo-electric machine (i.e., the motor-generator <b>10</b> or the motor-generators <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B), but may alternatively be equipped with three or more rotary electric machines. These machines need not be designed as a motor-generator. For example, one or some of the rotary electric machines may be used as only the electric motor or the electric generator.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0201">The rotary electric machines may be implemented by a three-phase AC motor or a DC motor with brushes, or an induction motor.</p>

<p id="p-0185" num="0203">The in-vehicle power transmission device and the driving system may alternatively be used with a vehicle equipped with a single driven wheel such as a motorcycle.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0204">The power transmission device, as discussed in each of the above embodiments and modifications, may be equipped with a four-axis power split device instead of the first and second planetary gear sets <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. For instance, a Ravineaux planetary gear set may be used which is equipped substantially with the four power split rotors: the sun gear, the sun gear, the carrier, and the ring gear which define four rotary axes. The four rotary axes are coupled mechanically to the motor-generator <b>10</b>, the driven wheels <b>14</b>, the engine <b>12</b>, and the motor-generator <b>10</b> through the CVT <b>36</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0205">The driving system of the invention, as described above, is equipped with the power transmission device, as discussed in the above embodiments and modifications and the controller <b>40</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>). For instance, the driving system may be designed to have the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>). In this case, when the speed of the internal combustion engine <b>12</b> is lower than a predetermined value, and it is required to restart the engine <b>12</b>, the controller <b>40</b> may engage the clutch <b>30</b> to transmit the torque (i.e., the rotational energy which is positive in sign, as defined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>)) from the carrier C of the first planetary gear set <b>22</b> to the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b>. The predetermined value is, for example, a lower limit of the speed of the engine <b>12</b> at which the vehicle is running, and the engine <b>12</b> is enabled to be restarted or fired up without need for adding the torque to the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>externally. In other words, when it is required to restart the engine <b>12</b>, but the speed of the engine <b>12</b> is too low to restart it without the addition of torque to the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the controller <b>40</b> engages the clutch <b>30</b> to transmit the torque from the power split device <b>20</b> to the rotating shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the engine <b>12</b>.
