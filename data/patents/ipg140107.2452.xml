<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to novel and substantially improved compositions and methods for providing DNA for methylation analysis, in particular for methylation analysis of the septin 9 gene. The invention further relates generally to novel and substantially improved compositions and methods for methylation analysis of the septin 9 gene.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF ASPECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Development of a Medical Test.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The probability of curing a disease (e.g. a cancer disease) is many times predominantly dependent from an early as possible detection of the disease. It is also often advantageous to detect a predisposition for a disease or if for example the disease is already advanced to make an estimation for the most promising treatment for the disease. Such an early as possible detection, prediction or estimation reduces the costs for direct and associated medical treatment. It ensures also a higher quality of life for the affected patient.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This leads to the situation that a lot of samples derived from individuals with a suspected disease have to be tested, the majority may not be affected by the disease. Or, in case of patients with a diagnosed disease, a lot of samples have to be tested, and only a small percentage will respond to a certain treatment. Usually the majority of said tests is performed in so-called reference laboratories. Because of the huge number of samples which are processed in reference laboratories, the actual test and the corresponding workflow of processing the sample underlie the following requirements: combinable with methods of carry over prevention; low demands on laboratory equipment; low handling effort; capable of being automated by means of robotics or manually; capable of being standardized; realizable in plate scale; high yield of DNA in order to reduce the amount of sample and to increase the sensitivity and specificity; high sensitivity; high specificity; low costs; DNA free of interfering compounds such as but not limited to proteins, RNA, nucleotides or disturbing chemical reagents; high reproducibility and high reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, in general, it is desirable that a test should have a high as possible sensitivity, a high as possible specificity and a high as possible accuracy. Sensitivity is a measure of a test's ability to correctly detect the target disease in an individual being tested. A test having poor sensitivity produces a high rate of false negatives, i.e., Individuals who have the disease but are falsely identified as being free of that particular disease. The potential danger of a false negative is that the diseased individual will remain undiagnosed and untreated for some period of time, during which the disease may progress to a later stage wherein treatments, if any, may be less effective. Mathematical it can be described as: Sensitivity=TP/(TP+FN). Thereby TP represents a true positive result and FN a false negative result. A true positive result means that the test is positive and the condition is present while a false negative result is where the test is negative but the condition is not present.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Specificity, on the other hand, is a measure of a test's ability to identify accurately patients who are free of the disease state. A test having poor specificity produces a high rate of false positives, i.e., individuals who are falsely identified as having the disease. A drawback of false positives is that they force patients to undergo unnecessary medical procedures or treatments with their attendant risks, emotional and financial stresses, and which could have adverse effects on the patient's health. A feature of diseases which makes it difficult to develop diagnostic tests with high specificity is that disease mechanisms, particularly in cancer, often involve a plurality of genes and proteins. Additionally, certain proteins may be elevated for reasons unrelated to a disease state. Mathematical specificity can be described as: Specificity=TN/(FP+TN). Thereby TN represents a true negative result and FP a false positive result. A true negative result is where the test is negative and the condition is not present. A false positive result is where the test is positive but the condition is not present.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Starting Material for a Test.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is advantageous for a test with regard to cost reduction and to a high quality of life of the patient that it can be performed non-invasively. If this is not possible, it is desirably to perform it by invasive means which affect as less as possible the patient, which are easy to perform, which cause low costs or combinations thereof. Because of that, remote samples such as but not limited to blood, sputum, stool or body fluids are the starting material of choice for a test.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the use of remote samples is quite limited by the low amount of DNA, in particular by the low amount of DNA which originates by the diseased cell or tissue. Therefore the workflow from the sample collecting to the start of the test has to be characterized by high yields of DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, the DNA of interest might be partially degraded in a remote sample. This depends on the type of the remote sample and also on the way of collecting and handling the remote sample. A fragmentation of DNA in remote sample down to a fragment size of 100 bp and under it is possible. Therefore a workflow from collecting a sample to the start of a test should ensure that small DNA fragments as well as large DNA fragments are provided and that the DNA does not get further fragmented. Numerous documents exist which address these problems. Exemplary only the following are cited herein: Diehl F., et al. (2005) PNAS 102(45), 16368-16373; and Li J., et al. (2006) Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, 8(1), 22-30.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Methylation Analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As revealed in recent years, one of the most powerful and promising approaches for detecting a disease, the pre-disposition for a disease or for estimating a probable response with respect to a certain disease treatment is the methylation analysis of the patient's genomic DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Many diseases, in particular cancer diseases, are accompanied by modified gene expression. This may be a mutation of the genes themselves, which leads to an expression of modified proteins or to an inhibition or over-expression of the proteins or enzymes. A modulation of the expression may however also occur by epigenetic modifications, in particular by changes in the DNA methylation pattern. Such epigenetic modifications do not affect the actual DNA coding sequence. It has been found that DNA methylation processes have substantial implications for health, and it seems to be clear that knowledge about methylation processes and modifications of the methyl metabolism and DNA methylation are essential for understanding diseases, for the prophylaxis, diagnosis and therapy of diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The precise control of genes, which represent a small part only of the complete genome of mammals, involves regulation in consideration of the fact that the main part of the DNA in the genome is not coding. The presence of such &#x2018;trunk&#x2019; DNA containing introns, repetitive elements and potentially actively transposable elements, requires effective mechanisms for their durable suppression (silencing). Apparently, the methylation of cytosine by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent DNA methyl transferases, which form 5-methylcytosine, represents such a mechanism for the modification of DNA-protein interactions. Genes can be transcribed by methylation-free promoters, even when adjacent transcribed or not-transcribed regions are widely methylated. This permits the use and regulation of promoters of functional genes, whereas the trunk DNA including the transposable elements is suppressed. Methylation also takes place for the long-term suppression of X-linked genes and may lead to either a reduction or an increase of the degree of transcription, depending on where the methylation in the transcription units occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Nearly the complete natural DNA methylation in mammals is restricted to cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide palindrome sequences, which are controlled by DNA methyl transferases. CpG dinucleotides are about 1 to 2% of all dinucleotides and are concentrated in CpG islands. According to an art-recognized definition, a region is considered as a CpG island when the C+G content over 200 bp is at least 50% and the percentage of the observed CG dinucleotides in comparison to the expected CG dinucleotides is larger than 0.6 (Gardiner-Garden, M., Frommer, M. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196, 261-282). Typically, CpG islands have at least 4 CpG dinucleotides in a sequence of a length of 100 bp.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">CpG islands located in promotor regions frequently have a regulatory function for the expression of the corresponding gene. For example, in case the CpG island is hypomethylated, the gene can be expressed. On the other hand, hypermethylation frequently leads to a suppression of the expression. Normally tumor suppressor genes are hypomethylated. But if they become hypermethylated, their expression becomes suppressed. This is observed many times in tumor tissues. By contrast, oncogenes are hypermethylated in healthy tissue, whereas they are hypomethylated in many times in tumor tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The methylation of cytosine has the effect that the binding of proteins is normally prohibited which regulate the transcription of genes. This leads to an alteration of the expression of the gene. Relating to cancer, the expression of genes regulating cell division are thereby altered, for example, the expression of an apoptotic gene Is down regulated, while the expression of an oncogene is up regulated. Additionally, hypermethylation may have a long term influence on regulation. Proteins, which deacetylate histones, are able to bind via their 5-methylcytosine binding domain to the DNA when the cytosines get methylated. This results in a deacetylation of the histones, which itself leads to a tighter package of the DNA. Because of that, regulatory proteins are not precluded from binding to the DNA.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Background of the Septin 9 Gene.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The human Septin 9 gene (also known as MLL septin-like fusion protein, MLL septin-like fusion protein MSF-A, Sipa, Eseptin, Msf, septin-like protein Ovarian/Breast septin (Ov/Br septin) and Septin D1) is located on chromosome 17q25 within contig AC068594.15.1.168501 and is a member of the Septin gene family. The Septin 9 gene is known to comprise four transcript variants, the Septin 9 variants and the Q9HC74 variants (which are truncated versions of the Septin 9 transcripts). The Septin 9 and Q9HC74 transcripts comprise each a CpG rich promotor region, respectively. It has been postulated that members of the Septin gene family are associated with multiple cellular functions ranging from vesicle transport to cytokinesis. Disruption of the action of Septin 9 results in incomplete cell division, see Surka, M. C., Tsang, C. W., and Trimble, W. S. Mol Biol Cell, 13: 3532-45 (2002). Septin 9 and other proteins have been shown to be fusion partners of the protooncogene MLL suggesting a role in tumorogenesis, see Osaka, M, Rowley, J. D. and Zeleznik-Le, N. J. PNAS, 96:6428-6433 (1999). Burrows et al. reported an in depth study of expression of the multiple isoforms of the Septin 9 gene in ovarian cancer and showed tissue specific expression of various transcripts, see Burrows, J. F., Chanduloy, et al. S. E. H. Journal of Pathology, 201:581-588 (2003). A recent study of over 7000 normal and tumor tissues indicates that there is consistent over-expression of Septin 9 isoforms in a number of tumor tissues, see Scott, M., Hyland, P. L., et al. Oncogene, 24: 4688-4700 (2005). The authors speculate that the gene is likely a type II cancer gene where changes in RNA transcript processing control regulation of different protein products, and the levels of these altered protein isoforms may provide answers to the gene's role in malignancy.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0063">Advantages of Aspects of the Invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0064">In particular aspects, the exemplary inventive method has the following advantages:</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0065">It is characterized by high yields of provided DNA. This is achieved although many samples such as but not limited to remote samples are characterized in that they comprise only low levels of DNA, especially low levels of DNA of interest. On the other hand, in many cases the amount of a sample (remote sample) is not limited. Therefore according to the invention large amount of samples are preferably processed. In particular, DNA isolation methods were selected amongst the enormous number of possible DNA isolation methods which allow the use of large volumes of starting material. Also in particular, methods for the purification of bisulfite treated DNA were selected amongst the enormous number of possible DNA purification methods, which are characterized by high yields of bisulfite treated DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0066">The exemplary inventive method is further characterized by a low handling effort. The selected methods for DNA isolation, bisulfite treatment and purification of bisulfite treated DNA were selected amongst the enormous number of possible methods for DNA isolation, bisulfite treatment and DNA purification because of their low handling effort. The handling effort is in particular critical when it comes to the analysis of huge numbers of samples as for example but not limited to in references laboratories where an enormous number of patient samples are analyzed. Because of its low handling effort, the method of the invention is characterized in that it can be applied in high through put processes.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0067">The exemplary inventive method is further characterized in that the whole method or parts thereof are capable of being automated for example by means of robots. Of course, the whole method or parts thereof are capable of being performed manually. Also a standardization is possible. In addition, it is possible to carry out the exemplary inventive method in plate scale.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0068">The exemplary inventive method is further characterized in that it makes only low demands on laboratory equipment to isolate DNA, bisulfite treat it and to purify the treated DNA. Therefore it can be applied in most laboratories and is in particular suitable for reference laboratories.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0069">The exemplary inventive method is further characterized in that it is easily combinable with the method of carry over prevention as disclosed by WO 2006/040187. According to the method of the invention, DNA is treated with bisulfite so that unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracil sulfonate, while methylated cytosines remain unchanged. After purification, the so treated DNA is subjected to a detection reaction such as but not limited to PCR amplification. For carry over prevention of contaminating nucleic acids, the DNA is brought into contact with UNG (Uracil-DNA-Glycosylase). Thereby, the contaminating DNA containing uracil Is degraded while the DNA of the sample remains intact because after the inventive bisulfite treatment the DNA of the sample contains only uracil sulfonate. Thereafter the decontaminated DNA is heated under modest alkaline conditions (ph 8.0 or higher). This leads to a desulfonation of uracil sulfonate and enables the decontamination of subsequent sample. Contaminating DNA is in particular a problem in laboratories processing a huge number of sample such as but not limited to reference laboratories. Therefore the method of the invention is in particular valuable for such kind of laboratories.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0070">The exemplary inventive method is further characterized in that it allows a highly sensitive and reliable detection of the methylation of the septin 9 gene. Inventive oligonucleotides and inventive oligonucleotide combinations were selected from the enormous number of possible oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide combinations which resemble parts of the sequence of the septin 9 gene or hybridize under stringent conditions to it. Particular embodiments of the inventive method are characterized by a doubled sensitivity. According to said embodiments, the methylation of septin 9 is analyzed by means of two reactions, each reaction specific for one strand of converted DNA (EP06090132). Correspondingly, particular oligonucleotide combinations are selected from the enormous number of possible oligonucleotide combinations which resemble parts of the sequence of the septin 9 gene or hybridize under stringent conditions to it.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0071">The exemplary inventive method is further characterized in that the provided DNA is free of associated or linked proteins, peptides, amino acids, RNA, nucleotides or bases as well as interfering chemical reagents. According to the invention, this is based therein, that i) a DNA isolation method is selected which is characterized by a efficient removal of associated or linked proteins, peptides, amino acids, RNA, nucleotides or bases amongst the enormous number of possible DNA isolation methods; ii) a purification method for bisulfite treated DNA is selected which efficiently removes associated nucleotides or bases amongst the enormous number of possible devices; and iii) a method for discrimination between methylated and unmethylated cytosine is selected which minimizes further DNA fragmentation amongst the enormous number of discrimination methods. The removal of such components is of particular importance because the may sterically hinder the methylation analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0072">An exemplary particular preferred embodiment of the inventive method is further characterized by an increased recovery of low molecular weight DNA after DNA isolation, bisulfite treatment and purification of bisulfite treated DNA. This is achieved by an extended digestion with proteinase K, most preferably for 60 min, and only a single washing of the DNA binding beads in the DNA isolation step.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0073">The exemplary inventive method is further characterized by low costs because it is based on the use of devices and solutions which are already available at low expenses. In addition, its suitability for being capable to be automated, for being capable to be standardized, for high throughput, as well as for low handling efforts also leads to a reduction in costs.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0074">Taken together, because of the above explained advantages, the exemplary inventive method allows in particular the use of remote samples for methylation analysis in high throughput reference laboratories. In particular, said use is characterized in that it is reliable and reproducible. These are two necessary requirements for a medical test.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0075">The exemplary inventive method makes also remote samples available for methylation based discovery of markers. In particular, it allows the identification of markers, characterized by a high sensitivity, a high specificity, or both.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0103">According to a preferred embodiment, the treatment of DNA is a treatment with a bisulfite reagent or solution. Suitable bisulfite reagents or solutions are known to those skilled in the art. The bisulfite conversion may take place both in solution as well as also on DNA bound to a solid phase. Preferably sodium disulfite (=sodium bisulfite/sodium metabisulfite) is used, since it is more soluble in water than sodium sulfite. The disulfite salt disproportionates in aqueous solution to the hydrogen sulfite anions necessary for the cytosine conversion. When bisulfite concentration is discussed below, this refers to the concentration of hydrogen sulfite and sulfite anions in the reaction solution. For the method according to the invention, concentration ranges of 0.1 to 6 mol/l are possible. Particularly preferred is a concentration range of 1 to 6 mol/l, and most particularly preferred, 2-4 mol/l.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0104">According to a preferred embodiment, a bisulfite treatment is essentially carried out as described in WO05/038051 or in WO 2006/113770. According to this, in one embodiment DNA is reacted with a bisulfite reagent, characterized in that said reaction is carried out in the presence of n-alkylene glycol compounds, preferably in the presence of their dialkyl ethers, and particularly preferred in the presence of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0105">The n-alkylene glycol compounds according to the invention can be utilized in a different concentration range. DME is preferably used in concentrations between 1-35% (vol/vol), more preferably between 5 and 25%, and most preferably in a concentration of 10% DME.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0106">According to a preferred embodiment, the treatment with a bisulfite comprises a radical scavenger. Preferably the radical scavenger is chromane derivatives, e.g., 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8,-tetramethylchromane 2-carboxylic acid (also known as: Trolox-C&#x2122;) or derivative thereof. In a preferred embodiment the concentration for 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8,-tetramethylchromane 2-carboxylic acid is between 35 and 50 mmol/l. Preferably the radical scavenger is gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxy benzoic acid) or a derivative thereof. In a preferred embodiment the concentration for gallic acid and gallic acid derivatives is between 50 and 60 mmol/l.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0107">According to a preferred embodiment, the treatment with a bisulfite comprises a radical scavenger, in particular 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8,-tetramethylchromane 2-carboxylic acid or gallic acid, and an organic solvent, in particular DME.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0108">Further scavengers suitable for use according to the invention are listed in the patent application WO 01/98528.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0109">The bisulfite conversion can be conducted in a wide temperature range from 0 to 95&#xb0; C. However, as at higher temperatures the rates of both the conversion and decomposition of the DNA increase, in a preferred embodiment the reaction temperature lies between 0-80&#xb0; C., preferably between 30-75&#xb0; C. Particularly preferred is a range between 35-65&#xb0; C.; most particularly preferred between 45-55&#xb0; C. The optimal reaction time of the bisulfite treatment depends on the reaction temperature. The reaction time normally amounts to between 1 and 18 hours (see: Grunau et al. 2001, Nucleic Acids Res. 2001, 29(13):E65-5). The reaction time is ordinarily 4-10 hours for a reaction temperature in the range of 45-55&#xb0; C. In a most particular preferred embodiment, the reaction temperature is 50&#xb0; C. and the reaction time 7 hours. (we use 50 C 7 h!)</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0110">In a particularly preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the bisulfite conversion is conducted at mild reaction temperatures, wherein the reaction temperature is then clearly increased for a short time at least once'during the course of the conversion. In this way, the effectiveness of the bisulfite conversion can be surprisingly clearly be increased. The temperature increases of short duration are named &#x201c;thermospikes&#x201d;. The &#x201c;standard&#x201d; reaction temperature outside the thermospikes is denoted as the basic reaction temperature. The basic reaction temperature amounts to between 0 and 80&#xb0; C., preferably between 30-75&#xb0; C., more preferably between 35-65&#xb0; C., most preferably between 45-55&#xb0; C., as described above. Most particularly, preferred is a reaction temperature of 50&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0111">The reaction temperature during a thermospike is increased to over 85&#xb0; C. by at least one thermospike. The optimal number of thermospikes is a function of the basic reaction temperature. The higher the optimal number of thermospikes is, the lower is the basic reaction temperature. At least one thermospike is necessary in each case. And, on the other hand, in principle, any number of thermospikes is conceivable. Of course, it must be considered that with a large number of temperature increases, the decomposition rate of the DNA also increases, and an optimal conversion is no longer assured. The preferred number of thermospikes is thus between 1 and 10 thermospikes each time, depending on the basic reaction temperature. A number of two to 5 thermospikes is thus particularly preferred. The thermospikes increase the reaction temperature preferably to 85 to 100&#xb0; C., particularly preferably to 90-100&#xb0; C., and most preferably to 94&#xb0; C.-100&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0112">The duration in time of the thermospikes also depends on the volume of the reaction batch. Preferably, it is assured that the temperature is increased uniformly throughout the total reaction solution. In a particularly preferred embodiment, for a 320 &#x3bc;l reaction batch when using a thermocycler, a duration of 5 min at 99&#xb0; C. is preferred. From this, a person skilled in the art will easily be able to determine suitable durations of thermospikes in relation to a variety of reaction volumes. The above-described thermospikes lead to a significantly better conversion rates in the bisulfite conversion reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0113">According to the invention, the said treatment of DNA with bisulfite is particularly preferred because it has several important advantages in comparison to other known methods or kits of the state of the art. These advantages are: i) higher yield of converted DNA; ii) a nearly complete conversion of unmethylated cytosine while methylated cytosine remain unchanged; and iii) almost no further fragmentation of DNA. These advantages are based in milder reaction conditions because of i) a thermal denaturation of DNA; ii) a comparably lower bisulfite concentration; iii) a slightly more alkaline pH; and iv) the use of a more efficient and more effective radical scavengers.</p>

Said methods are described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0140">According to an embodiment, the amplification method can be any kind of amplification method. A person skilled in the art is in knowledge of suitable amplification methods. According to a preferred embodiment, the amplification method is a PCR method. A person skilled in the art knows suitable PCR methods which can be used according to the invention. According to a preferred embodiment, the amplification method is a isothermal amplification. Suitable amplification methods for use according to the invention are well known in the art. Such a method can be for example but not limited to it the Primer Extension method. According to a preferred embodiment, the amplification method is a NASBA method. NASBA methods are RNA-DNA based amplification methods which comprise the use of a Reverse Transcriptase, a RNA polymerase and a RNase. A person skilled in the art is aware of NASBA methods which can be used according to the invention. According to a preferred embodiment, the amplification method is a Ligase Chain Reaction method. In general, these are amplification methods which are based on the use of a ligase. A person skilled in the art knows suitable LCR which can be used according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0141">According to a preferred embodiment, the amplification method is a methylation specific amplification. Suitable methylation specific amplification methods are known to those skilled in the art. According to a preferred embodiment, the methylation specific amplification method is the Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) method. The MSP method allows the assessing of the methylation status of virtually any group of CpG sites within a CpG island, independent of the use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (Herman et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:9821-9826, 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,146). Briefly, DNA is modified by sodium bisulfite converting all unmethylated, but not methylated cytosines to uracil, and subsequently amplified with primers specific for methylated versus unmethylated DNA. MSP primer pairs contain at least one primer, which hybridizes to a bisulfite treated CpG dinucleotide. Therefore, the sequence of said primers comprises at least one CpG dinucleotide. MSP primers specific for non-methylated DNA contain a &#x201c;T&#x201d; at the 3&#x2032; position of the C position in the CpG. Preferably, therefore, the base sequence of said primers is required to comprise a sequence having a length of at least 9 nucleotides which hybridizes to the bisulfite converted nucleic acid sequence, wherein the base sequence of said oligomers comprises at least one CpG dinucleotide. MSP requires only small quantities of DNA and is sensitive to 0.1% methylated alleles of a given CpG island locus. Bisulfite treatments and amplification method described herein may be used in combination with this detection method.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0142">According to a preferred embodiment, the amplification is a nested MSP method. The nested MSP method is essentially carried out as described in WO 02/18649 and US 20040038245. This MSP method considers the apparent conflict of requiring high specificity of the MSP primer to sufficiently differentiate between CG and TG positions and of allowing a mismatch in order to create a unique restriction site.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0143">It comprises the expanding of copy numbers of the genetic region of interest. Therefore a polymerase chain reaction is used to amplify a portion of said region wherein the methylation of interest resides. Thereby an amplification product is generated. An aliquot of said product is then used in a second, methylation-specific, polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of methylation. In other words a non methylation specific PCR is performed prior to the methylation specific PCR.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0144">According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the amplification method is the HeavyMethyl&#x2122; method. The HeavyMethyl&#x2122; method is essentially carried out as described in WO 02/072880 and Cottrell S E et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 January 13; 32(1):e10. This method comprises the use of blocking probe oligonucleotides which may be hybridized to the bisulfite treated template nucleic acid concurrently with the PCR primers. Preferably, the blocking oligonucleotides are characterized in that their base sequence comprises a sequence having a length of at least 9 nucleotides which hybridizes to the chemically treated nucleic acid sequence. Thereby the base sequence of said blocker oligonucleotides comprises at least one CpG, TpG or CpA dinucleotide. The amplification of the template nucleic acid is suppressed in case the complementary sequence of the blocking probe is present in the template. In such a case the amplification is terminated at the 5&#x2032; position of the blocking probe. The blocking probe may be designed to hybridize to the bisulfite treated nucleic acid in a methylation status specific manner. For example, methylated nucleic acids within a population of unmethylated nucleic acids can be detected by suppressing the amplification of nucleic acids which are unmethylated at a position in question. Therefore a blocking probe would comprise a &#x2018;CpA&#x2019; or &#x2018;TpA&#x2019; at the position in question, as opposed to a &#x2018;CpG&#x2019; if the suppression of amplification of methylated nucleic acids is desired. The use of blocker oligonucleotides requires for an efficient disruption of polymerase-mediated amplification that the blocker oligonucleotides can not be elongated by the polymerase. According to the HeavyMethyl&#x2122; method, this is achieved through the use of blockers that are 3&#x2032;-deoxyoligonucleotides, or oligonucleotides derivatized at the 3&#x2032; position with other than a &#x201c;free&#x201d; hydroxyl group. For example, but not limited to it, 3&#x2032;-O-acetyl oligonucleotides are representative of a preferred class of blocker molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0145">Additionally, polymerase-mediated degradation of the blocker oligonucleotides should be precluded. Preferably, such preclusion comprises either i) the use of a polymerase lacking 5&#x2032;-3&#x2032; exonuclease activity, or ii) the use of modified blocker oligonucleotides. These modified blocker oligonucleotides are characterized in having, for example but not limited to, thioate bridges at the 5&#x2032;-terminii. This renders the blocker molecule nuclease-resistant. Particular applications may not require such 5&#x2032; modifications of the blocker oligonucleotide. For example, degradation of the blocker oligonucleotide will be substantially precluded if the blocker- and primer-binding sites overlap. Thereby the binding of the primer is precluded (e.g., in case of excess blocker oligonucleotide). Therefore the polymerase can not bind on the primer and elongated it. Because no polymerase is extending the primer, the blocking oligonucleotide will not be degraded. A particularly preferred embodiment of the HeavyMethyl&#x2122; method, for purposes of the present invention and as implemented herein, comprises the use of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers as blocking oligonucleotides. Such PNA blocker oligomers are ideally suited because they are neither degraded nor extended by the polymerase.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0146">According to an embodiment, the detection method can be any kind of detection method. A person skilled in the art is in knowledge of suitable detection methods. Preferably, a detection method can be any kind of detection method which comprises the use of a fluorescent dye, a non-fluorescent dye, a mass label, a separation by size, or a separation by weight. For example, but not limited to it, the detection method is a separation by size in an agarose gel followed by a staining of DNA by means of a fluorescent dye. According to a preferred embodiment, the detection method is a methylation specific detection. A person skilled in the art knows suitable methylation specific detection methods. According to a preferred embodiment, the methylation specific detection method is a bisulfite sequencing method. The bisulfite sequencing method is essentially carried out as described in Frommer et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1827-1831, 1992. The bisulfite sequencing method is a method wherein the sequencing of a previously amplified fragment of the bisulfite treated genomic DNA is carried out. As the bisulfite treated DNA is amplified before sequencing, an amplification method as described herein may be used in combination with this detection method. It is further especially preferred that the results of a bisulfite sequencing are essentially analyzed as described in EP 02090203.7. In brief, according to this method the degree of methylation of a cytosine is determined by means of an electropherogram of one or more bases. Thereby the area underneath the electropherogram of a detected base is calculated. The degree of methylation is then deduced by comparison this value for a cytosine position to be analyzed with the value obtained for an unmethylated cytosine. For better results, the determination and the consideration of the conversion rate of cytosine to uracil of the bisulfite treatment and/or a standardization of electropherogram signals is favorable.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0147">According to a preferred embodiment, the detection method is a method of detection by means of a DNA-array. A person skilled in the art knows at lot of suitable DNA-arrays. Preferably, a DNA array comprises DNA molecules which are bound to or elsewise associated with a solid phase. The array can be characterized, for example but not limited to it, in that the DNA molecules are arranged on the solid phase in the form of a rectangular or hexagonal lattice. Thereby the solid phase is at least one phase selected from the group comprising: silicon, glass, polystyrene, aluminum, steel, iron, copper, nickel, silver, gold, nitrocellulose, or plastics such as but not limited to it nylon. But also combinations of the said materials are thinkable. For detection, the DNA hybridized on the array is labeled, preferably with a fluorescent dye. Such labelling is for example, but not limited to it, the simple attachment of Cy3 and Cy5 dyes to the 5&#x2032;-OH of the DNA fragment. The detection of the fluorescence of the hybridized DNA may be carried out, for example, but not limited to it, via a confocal microscope.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0148">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the detection method is a method of detection by means of a oligonucleotide microarray. An overview of the prior art in oligomer array manufacturing can for example but not limited to be gathered from a special edition of Nature Genetics (Nature Genetics Supplement, Volume 21, January 1999, and from the literature cited therein).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0149">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the detection method is a method of detection by means of a CpG-island-microarray. Thereby the immobilized or associated DNA of the array comprises sequences which were derived from CpG islands.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0150">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the detection method is a method of detection by means of a DNA-array as essentially described in WO 99/28498, WO 01/38565, or in WO 02/18632.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0151">According to a preferred embodiment, the detection method is a method of detection by means of restriction enzymes. A person skilled in the art is in knowledge of suitable methods.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0152">According to a preferred embodiment, the methylation specific amplification and the detection are carried out simultaneously. Suitable methods are known to those skilled in the art. According to a particular preferred embodiment, the method for simultaneous methylation specific amplification and detection is the COBRA method. The COBRA method is a quantitative methylation method useful for determining DNA methylation levels at specific gene loci in small amounts of genomic DNA (Xiong &#x26; Laird, Nucleic Acids Res. 25:2532-2534, 1997). According to the COBRA method, restriction enzyme digestion is used to reveal methylation-dependent sequence differences in PCR products of bisulfite-treated DNA. Methylation-dependent sequence differences are first introduced into the genomic DNA by bisulfite treatment. PCR amplification of the bisulfite converted DNA is then performed using methylation unspecific primers followed by restriction endonuclease digestion, gel electrophoresis, and detection using specific, labeled hybridization probes. Methylation levels in the original DNA sample are represented by the relative amounts of digested and undigested PCR product in a linearly quantitative fashion across a wide spectrum of DNA methylation levels. Additionally, restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products amplified from bisulfite-converted DNA is also used, in the method described by Sadri &#x26; Hornsby (Nucl. Acids Res. 24:5058-5059, 1996). Bisulfite treatments and amplification methods described herein may be used in combination with this detection method.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0153">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the method for simultaneous methylation specific amplification and detection is a real-time PCR method. A person skilled in the art knows suitable real-time PCR methods. According to a particular preferred embodiment, the real-time PCR method is a HeavyMethyl&#x2122; method. The HeavyMethyl&#x2122; method is thereby performed as described above by means of a real-time PCR machine.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0154">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the real-time PCR method is a MethyLight&#x2122; method. The MethyLight&#x2122; method is a high-throughput quantitative methylation method that utilizes fluorescence-based real-time PCR (TaqMan&#x2122;) technology that requires no further manipulations after the PCR step (Eads et al., Cancer Res. 59:2302-2306, 1999). Briefly, the MethyLight&#x2122; process begins with a mixed sample of genomic DNA that is converted, in a bisulfite reaction, to a mixed pool of methylation-dependent sequence differences according to standard procedures. Fluorescence-based PCR is then performed either in an &#x201c;unbiased&#x201d; (with primers that do not overlap known CpG methylation sites) PCR reaction, or in a &#x201c;biased&#x201d; (with PCR primers that overlap known CpG dinucleotides) reaction. Sequence discrimination can occur either at the level of the amplification process or at the level of the fluorescence detection process, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0155">The MethyLight&#x2122; method may be used as a quantitative test for methylation patterns in the genomic DNA sample, wherein sequence discrimination occurs at the level of probe hybridization. In this quantitative version, the PCR reaction provides for unbiased amplification in the presence of a fluorescent probe that overlaps a particular putative methylation site. An unbiased control for the amount of input DNA is provided by a reaction in which neither the primers, nor the probe overlie any CpG dinucleotides. Alternatively, a qualitative test for genomic methylation is achieved by probing of the biased PCR pool with either control oligonucleotides that do not &#x201c;cover&#x201d; known methylation sites (a fluorescence-based version of the &#x201c;MSP&#x201d; technique also named MSP MethyLight&#x2122; method), or with oligonucleotides covering potential methylation sites.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0156">The MethyLight&#x2122; process can be used with a &#x201c;TaqMan&#xae;&#x201d; probe in the amplification process. For example, double-stranded genomic DNA is treated with bisulfite and subjected to one of two sets of PCR reactions using TaqMan&#xae; probes; e.g., with either biased primers and TaqMan&#xae; probe, or unbiased primers and TaqMan&#xae; probe. The TaqMan&#xae; probe is dual-labeled with fluorescent &#x201c;reporter&#x201d; and &#x201c;quencher&#x201d; molecules, and is designed to be specific for a relatively high GC content region so that it melts out at about 10&#xb0; C. higher temperature in the PCR cycle than the forward or reverse primers. This allows the TaqMan&#xae; probe to remain fully hybridized during the PCR annealing/extension step. As the Taq polymerase enzymatically synthesizes a new strand during PCR, it will eventually reach the annealed TaqMan&#xae; probe. The Taq polymerase 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; endonuclease activity will then displace the TaqMan&#xae; probe by digesting it to release the fluorescent reporter molecule for quantitative detection of its now unquenched signal using a real-time fluorescent detection system.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0157">Variations on the TaqMan&#xae; detection technology that are also suitable include the use of dual-probe technology (LightCycler&#x2122;), fluorescent amplification primers (Sunrise&#x2122; technology), Molecular Beacon Probes (Tyagi S., and Kramer F. R., Nature Biotechnology 14, 303-308, 1996), Scorpion primers (Whitcombe et al., Nature and Biotechnology, 17, 804-807, 1999), or LNA (Locked Nucleid Acid) Double-Dye Oligonucleotide probes (Exiqon A/S). All of these techniques may be adapted in a manner suitable for use with bisulfite treated DNA, and moreover for methylation analysis within CpG dinucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0158">Bisulfite treatments and amplification methods described herein may be used in combination with the MethyLight&#x2122; method or its variants.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0159">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the real-time PCR method is the MethyLight&#x2122; ALGO&#x2122; method. The MethyLight&#x2122; ALGO&#x2122; method is an improved method of the MethyLight&#x2122; method as essentially described in EP 04090255.3. According to this improved method, the degree of methylation is calculated from the signal intensities of probes using different algorithms.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0160">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the real-time PCR method is the QM (quantitative methylation) assay. This assay is a methylation unspecific and therefore unbiased real-time PCR amplification. It is accompanied by the use of two methylation specific probes (MethyLight&#x2122;) one for the methylated amplificate and a second for the unmethylated amplificate. In this way, two signals are generated which can be used a) to determine the ratio of methylated (CG) to unmethylated (TG) nucleic acids, and at the same time b) to determine the absolute amount of methylated nucleic acids. For the later, a calibration of the assay is necessary with a known amount of control DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0161">According to preferred embodiment, the method for simultaneous methylation specific amplification and detection is a Headloop PCR method. The Headloop PCR method is a suppression PCR method. It essentially carried out as described in Rand K. N., et al., Nucleic Acid Research, 33(14), e127. It is a PCR method for distinguishing related sequences in which the selectivity of amplification is dependent from the amplicon's sequence. A 5&#x2032; extension is included in one (or both) primer(s) that corresponds to sequences within one of the related amplicons. After copying and incorporation into the amplificate this sequence is then able to loop back, anneal to the internal sequences and prime to form a hairpin structure. This structure prevents then further amplification. Thus, amplification of sequences containing a perfect match to the 5&#x2032; extension is suppressed while amplification of sequences containing mismatches or lacking the sequence is unaffected.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0162">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the method for simultaneous methylation specific amplification and detection is a combination of the Headloop PCR method and the MethyLight&#x2122; method, also named Headloop MethyLight&#x2122; method.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0163">According to preferred embodiment, the method for simultaneous methylation specific amplification and detection is a Scorpion&#x2122; method. This method was first described by Whitcombe et al.: Detection of PCR products using self-probing amplicons and fluorescence. Nat Biotechnol. 1999; 17(8):804-7; Thelwell et al.: Mode of action and application of Scorpion&#x2122; primers to mutation detection. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000 October 1; 28(19):3752-61; U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,145; U.S. Pat. No. 6,365,729; US 20030087240 A1). Several embodiments of this method are known to those skilled in the art. All of this methods have the intramolecular probing in common. According to the so-called Hairloop variant, Scorpion&#x2122; primers posses a specific probe sequence at their 5&#x2032; end. This sequence is present in a hairloop like configuration. A fluorescent dye and a quencher are located in spatial proximity at the end of the probing sequence. After denaturation subsequent to an amplification cycle, the probe hybridizes intramolecularly onto the elongated primer sequence of the same strand. Thereby the hairloop is opened, the dye and the quencher are separated and thus the dye's signal can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0164">Other Scorpion&#x2122; method variants are for example the Duplex variant (Salinas et al.: Duplex Scorpion&#x2122; primers in SNP analysis and FRET applications. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Oct. 15; 29(20):E96), or the variants as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,145 and US 20030087240).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0165">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the Scorpion&#x2122; method is a method as essentially described in WO 05/024056.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0166">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the method for simultaneous methylatlon specific amplification and detection is a combination of the HeavyMethyl&#x2122; method and the Scorpion&#x2122; method, also named HeavyMethyl&#x2122; Scorpion&#x2122; method.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0167">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the method for simultaneous methylation specific amplification and detection is a combination of the HeavyMethyl&#x2122; method and the MethyLight&#x2122; method, also named HeavyMethyl&#x2122; MethyLight&#x2122; method.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0168">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the method for simultaneous methylation specific amplification and detection is a combination of the MSP method and the Scorpion&#x2122; method, also named MSP Scorpion&#x2122; method.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0170">According to a preferred embodiment, the method for simultaneous methylation specific amplification and detection is a method of methylation specific primer extension. A person skilled in the art knows several methods which can be used according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0171">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the method of methylation specific primer extension is the Ms-SNuPE (methylation-sensitive Single Nucleotide Primer Extension) method. The Ms-SNuPE method is a method as essentially carried out as described in Gonzalgo et al., Nucleic Acids Research 25(12), 2529-2531, 1997 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,251,594. According to the Ms-SNuPE method, regions of interest are amplified by PCR from bisulfite treated DNA. After purification of the PCR products, primers are proximately hybridized in front of the position to be analyzed. The primer is then elongated by a single nucleotide either with labeled dCTP or with differently labeled dTTP. In case the cytosine in the original DNA was methylated, then dCTP will be incorporated because methylated cytosines remain unchanged during bisulfite treatment. In the other case, the cytosine in the original DNA was unmethylated, then dTTP will be incorporated because unmethylated cytosine is converted to uracil by bisulfite treatment and subsequent PCR will substitute uracil by thymine. By detection of the different labels, it can be distinguished if a cytosine of a CpG position was methylated or unmethylated. The MS-SNuPE method can also be performed in a quantitative manner.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0172">According to a particular preferred embodiment, the method of methylation specific primer extension is a method as essentially described in WO 01/062960, WO 01/062064, or WO 01/62961. All of these methods can be performed in a quantitative manner. According to WO 01/062960, the primer to be extended hybridizes with its 3&#x2032; terminus complete or only partially onto the positions of interest. A extension of at least one nucleotide occurs only if the primer hybridizes completely. WO 01/062064 discloses a method in which the primer to be extended hybridizes proximately adjacent or at a distance of up to ten bases to the position to be analyzed. The primer is then extended by at least a single nucleotide. The third method is described in WO 01/62961. According to this method, two set of oligonucleotides are hybridized to the amplified DNA after bisulfite treatment. The first type of oligonucleotide hybridizes 5&#x2032; proximately adjacent or at a distance of up to 10 bases to the position to be analyzed. The second type of oligonucleotide hybridizes on the amplified DNA so that its 5&#x2032; terminus hybridizes 3&#x2032; proximately adjacent to said position to be analyzed. Through this, the two oligonucleotide are separated from each other by a gap of in the range of 1 to 10 nucleotides. The first type of oligonucleotide is then extended by means of a polymerase, wherein not more than the number of nucleotides lying between the two oligonucleotides are added. Thereby nucleotides are used which comprise differentially labeled dCTP and/or dTTP. The two oligonucleotides are then linked to each other by means of a ligase enzyme. In case the cytosine in the original DNA was methylated, then dCTP will be incorporated. In case the cytosine in the original DNA was unmethylated, then dTTP will be incorporated.</p>

<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Detection of Methylated Sequences of the Septin 9 Gene by Amplification of Bisulfite Converted Sequences of the Forward and Reverse Strand of the Original Genomic DNA in a Duplex PCR</heading>
<p id="p-0562" num="0653">DNA fragmentation is many times limiting the sensitivity of the methylation analysis of samples, in particular wherein DNA is already highly fragmented in the original sample. Examples for such samples are body fluid samples like blood, stool, urine, branchial lavage or histological samples like formalin-fixed samples. During bisulfite treatment the DNA is further fragmented resulting in very short fragments in average. This example demonstrates that very small fragments (up to length of 65 nucleotides) are sufficient for the methylation analysis of the septin 9 gene by means of a duplex PCR or a single PCR.</p>
<p id="p-0563" num="0654">In this example methylated bisulfite converted DNA of the septin 9 gene was amplified using a duplex HeavyMethyl PCR and a referring single HeavyMethyl PCR. The example demonstrates the advantage of the duplex PCR over the single PCR by the shown higher detection rate of low copy number samples. This can be explained by the two times higher theoretical number of template DNA being capable of being amplified, because the duplex PCR uses both bisulfite converted strands of the original DNA as template, whereas the single PCR is only based on either bisulfite or bisulfite 2 strand of the Septin 9 gene. To achieve this the following steps were carried out:</p>
<p id="p-0564" num="0655">Human genomic DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg Germany) were adjusted to a concentration of 0.2 ng/&#x3bc;l. This solution was used to dilute universal methylated human DNA (GpGenome&#x2122; Universal Methylated DNA, Chemicon International, Temecula USA) to final concentrations of 0.75 pg/&#x3bc;l and 0.375 pg/&#x3bc;l. 100 &#x3bc;l of each dilution and the solution without methylated DNA were bisulfite treated in 30 replicates. In all 90 different samples were prepared. For this 100 &#x3bc;l of each sample were applied a the bisulfite conversion reaction as previously described (see for example WO2005036051). Each sample was eluted in 50 &#x3bc;l water. After desalting and purification the success of the bisulfite conversion was confirmed by a bisulfite DNA specific reference PCR as previously described (EP05075404). Afterwards 10 &#x3bc;l of each samples was used as template in the duplex PCR and in the single PCR. The reaction mixtures for the duplex HeavyMethyl PCR contained:</p>

<p id="p-0588" num="0681">The primers of PCR1 (SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 21) amplify a fragment of 63 bp of the Septin 9 gene (SEQ ID NO: 10. nucleotide 9295902 to nucleotide 9295840 of GenBank Accession Number NT<sub>&#x2014;</sub>010641.15). The primers of PCR2 (SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6) amplify a fragment of 65 bp of the Septin 9 gene (SEQ ID NO: 11. nucleotide 9295830 to nucleotide 9295894 of GenBank Accession Number NT<sub>&#x2014;</sub>010641.15). The detection was carried out during the annealing phase at 56&#xb0; C. In the duplex reaction PCR1 was specifically detected a the channel 533 nm (filter setup 483-533), whereas PCR2 was specifically detected at the channel 610 nm (filter setup 558-610). The single PCR was detected a the channel 533 nm (filter setup 483-533), because the probe dye was changed from TexasRed to FAM for the single reaction (SEQ ID NO: 8). The crossing points (CP) were calculated according to the &#x201c;second derivative maximum&#x201d; method by means of the LightCycler 480 software.</p>
<p id="p-0589" num="0682">Representative amplification curves of 6 samples with PCR1 of the duplex HeavyMethyl PCR are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The amplification curves of the PCR2 of the duplex reaction are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> showed again the same representative 6 samples amplified with the single HeavyMethyl PCR. As shown in the Figures samples A1.2 and A1.3 were detected in all three cases. Sample A1.1 was not detected by PCR1 but by PCR2, whereas sample E3.4 was positive in PCR2 and not in PCR1 of the duplex reaction. All 4 out of 6 exemplary samples were detected by the duplex PCR. In contrast to that the single HeavyMethyl PCR detects only 3 out of these 6 samples (A1.1, A1.2, and A1.3).</p>
<p id="p-0590" num="0683">The detection rate was calculated for the three dilutions, which were processed 30 times each. Each single curve, called by the automated analysis of the LightCycler 480 software, was counted as positive. The table 4 collects all crossing points (CP) of the experiment. The resulting detection rates are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Non of the samples without methylated DNA was detected by the single PCR, whereas one amplification curve was obtained with the duplex PCR in the channel 533 nm (PCR1). The samples containing 37.5 pg methylated DNA (dilution 2) were detected with rates of 67% (confidence interval of 95% (CI95): 50%-80%) using the single PCR and 70% (CI95: 53%-83%) using the duplex PCR. The samples containing 75 pg methylated DNA were detected with rates of 77% (CI95: 60%-88%) using the single PCR and 80% (CI95: 64%-91%) using the duplex PCR. In the duplex PCR samples were counted as positive, if either the PCR1 (533 nm) or PCR2 (610 nm) showed a amplification curve.</p>
<p id="p-0591" num="0684">The characteristic of the developed duplex HeavyMethyl PCR was additionally evaluated. For that a dilution series of methylated bisulfite converted DNA was prepared to evaluate the efficiencies of the different PCRs. The standard curve of the PCR1 and PCR2 of the duplex PCR are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The PCR efficiencies were determined to 1.838 for PCR1 and to 1.810 for PCR2 respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the standard curve of the single PCR is shown with a PCR efficiency of 1.903.</p>
<p id="p-0592" num="0685">A schematic presentation of the two sequences amplified in the duplex HeavyMethyl PCR are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Both amplicons cover the same CpGs of the Septin 9 CpG island. The blocker oligonucleotides span over 5 CpGs, whereas the detection probes bind to only 3 CpGs out of the amplified region. As indicated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, PCR1 and PCR2 comprise each a primer which spans over a single CpG (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the bisulfite treated genomic Sequence, primer hybridization areas are printed in bold). To prevent a methylation specific binding of the C-free primers of PCR1 and PCR2 the primer sequences contained a dSpacer modification, which acts as a stable a-basic site at these positions. The methylation specific amplification therefore is only driven by binding of the blocker oligonucleotides to the 5 CpGs in between the primer binding sites.</p>
<p id="p-0593" num="0686">In general, the clinical sensitivity of a DNA methylation based assay, which is based on the detection of cancer derived methylated DNA in bodily fluids or other remote samples is limited due to the low copy number of cancer specific DNA. The approach of cancer detection and diagnosis of other diseases will be improved by the implementation of the concept of detecting both bisulfite converted strands of the original target DNA.</p>

<p id="p-0597" num="0690">Plasma was collected as described in WO 2006/113770. In brief, blood was drawn in 10 ml EDTA plasma tubes using the vacutainer system. Tubes were centrifuged at 1500&#xd7;g for 10 min, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged a second time at 1500&#xd7;g for 10 min. The supernatant is the plasma for further use (4-5 ml).</p>
<p id="p-0598" num="0691">For DNA isolation, 5 ml of the Lysis Buffer 1, 7 &#x3bc;l poly-A RNA, 30 &#x3bc;l of Proteinase K solution and 15 &#x3bc;l of a 1:10 dilution of antifoam (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Article Number A5633) were added to the plasma samples (all adjusted to 5 ml). Samples were incubated at 56&#xb0; C. for 10 min. Thereafter 100 &#x3bc;l of magnetic beads (Article number 1002) and 15 ml of Binding Buffer 2, 2*1, 2*2, 2*3 or 2*4 were added. In order to keep the beads in suspension by gentle agitation, the samples were place on a rotary mixer at room temperature for about 10 or 60 min, respectively, to allow the binding of DNA to the beads. Magnetic beads were separated by placing the reaction tube in a magnetic stand and discarding the plasma/lysis buffer mixture. Beads were washed only once or twice with 3 ml of Wash Buffer 3, before the were resuspended in 1 ml of Wash Buffer 4, and transferred to new tubes. Beads were separated on a magnetic stand, the wash buffer was poured off and the beads were dried at 56&#xb0; C. After addition of 100 &#x3bc;l Elution Buffer 5, the suspension is incubated for 15 min on the thermomixer at 65&#xb0; C. After separation of the beads, the elution buffer containing the genomic DNA was recovered. (All reagents were supplied by the chemagic Viral RNA/DNA kit if not indicated otherwise; Binding Buffers 2*1, 2*2, 2*3, and 2*4 are variations of the Binding Buffer 2 which are all commercial available from Chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG, Germany).</p>

<p id="p-0601" num="0694">For detection of methylated sequences of the Septin 9 gene, the purified DNA obtained by the protocol of Example 5 was subjected to the single Septin 9 HeavyMethyl PCR (PCR2 of the duplex PCR) of Example 6.</p>
<p id="p-0602" num="0695">The results of this PCR are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Best results i.e. increased recovery of low and high molecular weight DNA was obtained by (i) a single wash with wash buffer 3, (ii) by 60 min incubation to allow binding of the DNA to beads, and (iii) by use of the binding buffers 2*3 and 2*4.</p>

The sample were incubated for 60 min at room temperature upon continuous agitation. Thereafter each sample was placed in a magnetic separator for 4 min before the supernatant is discarded. Beads of each sample were resuspended in 3 ml of Wash Buffer 3 and 1.5 ml of each sample were transferred into ml tube. Each tube was placed in a magnetic separator for 2 min before the supernatant was discarded. The remainders of each sample were again combined in a 2 ml tube. Said tube was then placed in a magnetic separator for 2 min and the supernatant is discarded. After a short centrifugation, each tube was again placed in a magnetic separator for 2 min and the remaining supernatant was removed. Beads of each sample were then dried at 56&#xb0; C. for 3-5 min with open tube lid. For DNA elution, 100 &#x3bc;l of Elution Buffer 5 were added to the beads of each sample. After resuspension, beads of each sample were incubated at 65&#xb0; C. for 15 min upon continuous agitation (1,400 rpm). Beads of each sample were briefly centrifuged, before each tube was placed in a magnetic separator for 2 min and the eluate with DNA is transferred into a 0.5 ml tube.

<p id="p-0626" num="0721">To each 8 ml urine sample 8 ml Chemagen Lysis Buffer, 10.5 &#x3bc;l polyadenylic acid (poly A RNA Roche Applied Sciences #10108626, 1 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;l), and 45 &#x3bc;l Chemagen Protease solution were added. Samples were mixed by vortexing for 10 s, and incubated at 56&#xb0; C. for 10 min. 150 &#x3bc;l of Chemagen beads were added to the lysate, and 22.5 &#x3bc;l of Chemagen Binding Buffer 2*3. The sample was mixed by vortexing for 10 s. Samples were then mixed on a rotator for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then placed on a magnetic separator for 4 min, the supernatant discarded and 3 ml of wash buffer were added. The samples were mixed. 1.5 ml aliquots were transferred to a 2 ml safelock tube, placed on a magnetic separator for 2 min and wash buffer was removed by pipetting. The remaining sample was transferred to the safelock tube, placed on the separator and wash buffer was removed. Residual buffer was removed following a 20 s centrifugation at 1,000 rpm, and the magnetic particles were air dried for 5 min at 65&#xb0; C. 100 &#x3bc;l elution buffer was added and the beads were incubated at 65&#xb0; C. in a thermal mixer at 1,000 rpm. Samples were then placed in a magnetic separator for 2 min and the eluate containing extracted DNA was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and stored for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0627" num="0722">This workflow was tested in a study of 20 urine samples, said samples were collected from patients following prostatic massage. Two 8 ml whole urine samples were tested per patient. Samples were prepared without centrifugation and extracted as described above. Following extraction, DNA samples were diluted 1/10 in elution buffer and total genomic DNA recovery was determined by real time PCR with the CFF1 assay (performed as described in WO 2007/039101). As illustrated in the following table, total DNA recovery was very similar between replicates from the same patient, demonstrating consistent DNA extraction. Total DNA levels varied greatly between patients, consistent with previous observations.</p>
