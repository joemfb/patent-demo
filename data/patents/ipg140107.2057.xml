<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for converting carbon monoxide and water into carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with simultaneous removal of one or more products, is described. The method includes the following steps: in a first reactor, carbon monoxide from the gas phase is bound in a first solvent and converted into formate, in a third reactor, formate is decomposed and resultant hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>is removed, and in a second reactor a solid which is a hydrogen-carbonate salt or a carbonate salt is removed. The thermal decomposition of the solid and the expulsion of the carbon dioxide are carried out in an additional fourth reactor, optionally in a second solvent. Further presented is an apparatus for converting carbon monoxide and water into carbon dioxide and hydrogen, including a fourth reactor which thermally decomposes solids formed in the course of the reaction, and gives off carbon dioxide.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the US National Stage of International Application No. PCT/EP2010/059094, filed Jun. 25, 2010 and claims the benefit thereof. The International Application claims the benefits of German application No. 10 2009 035 388.7 DE filed Jul. 30, 2009. All of the applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to the carbon monoxide shift reaction CO+H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2192;CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>. The industrial utilization of this reaction is addressed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The carbon monoxide shift reaction is among the most important reactions of the chemical industry. Recently, this chemical reaction has also become important for power stations using fossil fuels. The background to this is the current trend towards low-carbon dioxide power generation in power stations burning fossil fuels. Here, the carbon monoxide shift reaction can be combined with simultaneous removal of the carbon dioxide formed. According to the present-day prior art, three fundamental approaches are possible: precombustion, post-combustion and oxyfuel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the precombustion CO<sub>2 </sub>capture approach, the carbon monoxide has to be converted into carbon dioxide according to the chemical equation of the carbon monoxide shift reaction before the combustion in order to be able to remove the total carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. Here, the major part of the energy of the carbon monoxide is transferred &#x201c;shifted&#x201d; to hydrogen which can be used in a gas turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A disadvantage here is that removal of the two products hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the gas phase is energy-intensive.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A combination frequently proposed in the prior art is the precombustion approach with removal of carbon dioxide combined with the carbon monoxide shift reaction in the gas phase. Here, a synthesis gas is &#x201c;shifted&#x201d; in admixture with steam over catalysts at temperatures in the range 300-500&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The carbon dioxide is subsequently separated off by means of a physical gas scrub, for example a Rectisol scrub, in a second subprocess. Here, the carbon dioxide is absorbed in cooled methanol at about &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. Since these low temperatures are necessary to be able to separate off the carbon dioxide to a sufficient extent, a great amount of energy has to be expended for cooling and this reduces the overall efficiency of the power station.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The European patent EP 0 299 995 B1 discloses a process for converting carbon monoxide and water into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The combination of a carbon monoxide shift reaction with simultaneous removal of the carbon dioxide formed from the combustion gases described therein is realized in the liquid phase. Particular mention may be made here of example No. 6 and also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the patent text. In this process, water-containing methanol having a water content of about 2% is used as solvent, with the pH thereof being increased by addition of a carbonate such as potassium carbonate. The chemical reactions, which can in each case proceed physically separately, are as follows:

</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the first step corresponding to equation (1), carbon monoxide is bound from the gas phase in a solution and separated from the accompanying components of the synthesis gas. Thermal decomposition of the dissolved hydrogencarbonate HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212; </sup>formed according to equations (1) and (3) is subsequently carried out by increasing the temperature to at least 150&#xb0; C., with carbon dioxide being formed and preferably being completely removed. The reactions corresponding to equations (1), (2) and (3) in each case take place with the same numbering in a reactor. As last step, the formate HCOO<sup>&#x2212;</sup> formed according to equation (1) is decomposed according to the equation (3) and hydrogen is formed. Hydrogen formed according to equation (3) is discharged from the process physically separately from carbon dioxide in a further step.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It has been found that the process corresponding to the patent EP 0 299 995 B1 is not satisfactory for the present use.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, for example, the carbon dioxide cannot be separated off sufficiently in a second reactor. Carbon dioxide is instead discharged with part of the hydrogen and of the residual gases. Furthermore, a large proportion of the solvent methanol is lost with the driving-off of the carbon dioxide in the second reactor. This has to be recovered, for example by means of a water scrub with subsequent distillation. However, this requires increased outlays in terms of process engineering and energy.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The lost hydrogen which is entrained in the carbon dioxide stream in the process and is not separated off amounts to about 8%. These losses lead to very uneconomical operation of the power station with carbon dioxide removal by this process.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Based on the equations (1) and (3), a relatively low yield is therefore achieved in the carbon dioxide removal or the isolation of hydrogen since both gases are not separated off in sufficient purity but partly appear at the outlet for the respective other gas.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The problem addressed by the invention is to provide a process and an apparatus for carrying out the carbon monoxide shift reaction with improved efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advantageous embodiments may be found in the description that provide particular advantages for the processes and the apparatuses described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The invention is based on the recognition that the thermal decomposition of hydrogencarbonate HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212; </sup>or of carbonate CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x2212; </sup>and the driving-off of carbon dioxide CO<sub>2 </sub>cannot be carried out to completion in the methanolic solution of the second reactor since this solution also contains other dissolved gases. This applies in particular to hydrogen from the synthesis gas or hydrogen residues which could not be desorbed in the decomposition of formate. These gases lead to dilution of the carbon dioxide and on the hydrogen side to a loss of fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the invention, the reaction conditions are set so that either a hydrogencarbonate or a carbonate is precipitated in solid form in a precipitation reactor. A solid can be separated off from the reaction mixture and can subsequently be decomposed to drive off carbon dioxide in an additional fourth reactor. The carbon monoxide shift reaction is carried out in the liquid phase. The formation of the two gases hydrogen and carbon dioxide proceeds in different places, so that they can consequently be produced separately from one another. The energy consumption of such a process is lower than that of a carbon monoxide shift reaction in the gas phase with subsequent separation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">If the decomposition of the solid, viz. a hydrogencarbonate or a carbonate, does not occur readily, the solid can be dissolved beforehand in a solvent which ideally has a high boiling point compared to water in order to prevent high solvent losses.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A preferred precipitation of the hydrogencarbonate can, for example, advantageously be brought about by decreasing the temperature in the precipitation reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The use of a saturated hydrogencarbonate solution leads to hydrogencarbonate formed in the first reactor and in the third reactor not being able to be dissolved and thus precipitating spontaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, the precipitation can be carried out by addition of a nonpolar second solvent which is not miscible with the first solvent, with the second solvent serving as precipitate for salts. After the precipitation, such additions can be distilled off again.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A further advantageous possibility for precipitating the hydrogencarbonate is addition of a readily soluble salt having the same cation as that present in the hydrogencarbonate. As a result, the solubility product of the hydrogencarbonate salt is reached at a relatively low hydrogencarbonate concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, it is particularly advantageous to recirculate the carbonate or solid metal oxide formed from the fourth reactor for the thermal decomposition of the hydrogencarbonate or the carbonate to the first reactor. This closes a carbonate circuit or a materials circuit.</p>
