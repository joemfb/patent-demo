<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY CLAIM</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application claims priority to German Patent Application No. 10 2007 034 364.9, filed Jul. 24, 2007, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a stent comprising a degradable metal stent main body and an agent-containing coating which is applied to the stent main body. The present disclosure further relates to a method for producing the stent, a method for the spatial separation of degradation products of a degradable metal stent main body, one or more agents which are applied to the stent, and the use of a stent according to the present disclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Stents in general are endovascular prostheses and/or implants which are used for treating stenoses, for example. Stents are additionally known for the treatment of aneurysms. Stents fundamentally have a support structure which is capable of supporting the wall of a vessel to widen the vessel and/or bypass an aneurysm.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For this purpose, stents are inserted in a compressed state into the vessel and then expanded at the location to be treated and pressed against the vascular wall. This expansion may be performed with the aid of a balloon catheter, for example. Alternatively, self-expanding stents are also known in the art. These stents are constructed from a superelastic metal, such as Nitinol, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Stents are currently classified in two main types, the nondegradable (permanent) stents and the (bio)degradable stents. Nondegradable stents are designed such that they remain in the vessel for an unspecified period of time. (Bio)degradable stents (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;degradable&#x201d; stents), in contrast, are degraded over a predetermined period of time in a vessel. Degradable stents are preferably first degraded when the traumatized tissue of the vessel is healed, a support function is no longer necessary, and the stent no longer has to remain in the vascular lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, it has been shown that side effects, such as restenosis and thromboses, may occur due to the introduction of stents into vascular systems.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For this reason, stents have been developed which contain one or more agents which are discharged to the organism, as well as to the support structure, upon or after implantation in the vascular system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Known stents coated with agent have a coating, the support structure of the stent typically being coated with an agent-containing polymer on both the luminal and also the abluminal (mural) surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The release of the agents from the polymer matrix typically results via diffusion processes and/or erosion processes of the polymer matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In stents whose luminal and abluminal surfaces have been coated with growth-inhibiting antiproliferative agents, it has been established that the endothelialization of the stent (overgrowth of the stent with vascular cells) is slowed or prevented and the risk of a thrombosis is thus increased.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a stent having magnesium alloy, the pH value of the magnesium stent implanted in a vessel rises in the immediate surroundings of the support structure because of the Mg(OH)<sub>2 </sub>formation as a result of the degradation. Such a pH value shift into the basic range may be particularly harmful for pH-unstable agents, in particular, rapamycin and paclitaxel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">If polymer material (e.g., polyester) degradable by hydrolysis is used as the matrix for the agent coating, the pH value of a stent implanted in a vessel sinks as a result of the hydrolysis of the degradable polymer and formation of the corresponding acids (lactic acid, glycolic acid, and the like). In particular, the decomposition speed of a degradable metal stent main body may be negatively influenced by the pH value shift into the acid range.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One feature of the present disclosure provides a degradable metal stent charged with at least one agent. One aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a stent with improved stability of the agent notwithstanding the presence of the degradation products of the stent materials, in particular, stent main body materials, and/or the endothelialization of the stent being improved.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure describes several exemplary embodiments of the present invention. One aspect of the present disclosure provides a stent, comprising a) a degradable metal stent main body, b) a partition layer which is applied to the surface of the stent main body so that at least parts of the surface of the luminal side are not covered, and c) an agent-containing layer which is applied to the surface of the partition layer at least partially on the abluminal side of the stent main body, the stent containing a layer comprising one or more agents.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The coating of the stent according to the present disclosure is accordingly designed in such a way that the stent struts are only in contact with the partition layer b) and not with the agent layer c). Accordingly, the partition layer b) is situated precisely between the stent main body and the agent layer c) or, in a further design, may project beyond the partition area between stent main body and agent layer. In a stent according to the present disclosure, the partition layer b) is applied to the surface of the metal stent main body in such a manner that at least parts of the surface of the luminal side of the stent main body are not covered by the partition layer b), so that the degradation of the stent main body on the luminal side may begin upon or after implantation in a human or animal body.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For this purpose, the preferred designs of the stent according to the present disclosure may be provided all together, partially&#x2014;in arbitrary combination, and individually.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for producing a stent, comprising a) providing a degradable metal stent main body and a first preparation which comprises one or more substances, b) coating the surface of the stent main body with the first preparation so that a partition layer is formed, at least a part of the surface of the luminal side not being covered, c) providing a second preparation which comprises one or more agents, and d) coating the surface or parts of the surface of the partition layer on the abluminal side of the stent main body with the second preparation so that an agent-containing layer is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A further aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for the spatial separation of degradation products of a degradable metal stent main body and one or more agents and possibly one or more degradable polymer layers which are applied to a stent during or after implantation in a human or animal body, the method comprising a) providing a stent having (i) a degradable metal stent main body, (ii) a partition layer which is applied to the surface of the stent main body so that at least a part of the surface of the luminal side are not covered, and an agent-containing layer which is applied to the surface of the partition layer at least partially on the abluminal side of the stent main body, the agent containing layer comprising one or more agents; and b) implanting the stent in a human or animal body.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An additional aspect of the present disclosure provides a method of using a stent having a partition layer which is applied to the surface of the stent main body so that at least parts of the surface of the luminal side are not covered for the spatial separation of degradation products of the stent main body on one hand and the agents and possibly degradation products of the first polymer layer on the other hand during or after implantation of the stent in a human or animal body.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure is based on the finding that a spatial separation of the agents and possibly the degradation products of an agent-polymer coating on one hand and the degradation products of the degradable metal stent main body on the other hand may be achieved upon implantation of the stent in a vessel by the coating of the stent with a partition layer between stent main body and agent layer, possibly having a polymer matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An advantage of the invention of the present disclosure is that the degradation products of the stent may not exert an influence on pH-unstable agents because the partition layer spatially separates the degradation products of the stent from the agents. A further advantage of the invention of the present disclosure is that, if the agents are incorporated in a polymer matrix, the degradation products of the polymer matrix have no disadvantageous effect on the degradation speed of the degradable stent because the partition layer is also designed such that the degradation products of a polymer-containing agent layer are spatially separated from the stent main body.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Finally, a further advantage of the invention of the present disclosure is that the stent is endothelialized more rapidly, i.e., overgrown by endothelial cells (EC) more rapidly, because known (nondegradable and degradable, preferably magnesium-containing) metal surfaces, in contrast to surfaces coated to be antiproliferative using rapamycin or paclitaxel, are typically nearly completely populated by EC within a few days or weeks. In particular, it has been shown that magnesium surfaces even endothelialize significantly more rapidly than surfaces made of typical metallic main body materials, such as medical steel (316L) or cobalt-chromium alloys. The danger of late thromboses, as may be observed, in particular, in agent-releasing stents of the prior art, is reduced by more rapid and complete overgrowth with endothelium.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A further advantage of the more rapid endothelialization is that the agents intended for the vascular wall are not delivered or are only delivered in such a small amount to the vascular lumen so that the agent concentrations at the desired location are higher and more reproducible.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The exemplary embodiments of the stent according to the present disclosure described hereinafter can be applied to the particular features of the present application according to the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the present disclosure, the materials of the stent main body typically comprise degradable metal and/or degradable metal alloys.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For purposes of the present disclosure, &#x201c;degradable metal stent&#x201d; means that the metal stent is degraded in physiological surroundings, in particular, in the vascular system of the human or animal body, in such a way that the stent loses its integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The degradable metallic material is preferably a biocorrodible alloy, the main components of the alloy being selected from the group consisting of magnesium, iron, zinc, and tungsten. In particular, a magnesium alloy is preferable as a degradable metallic material.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The alloy, in particular, comprising magnesium, iron, zinc, and/or tungsten, is to be selected in its composition so that the alloy is biocorrodible. For purposes of the present disclosure, &#x201c;biocorrodible&#x201d; alloys mean alloys in which degradation occurs in physiological surroundings, which finally results in the entire stent or the part of the stent formed from the material losing its mechanical integrity. For purposes of the present disclosure, an alloy means a metallic structure whose main component is magnesium, iron, zinc, or tungsten. The main component is the alloy component whose weight proportion in the alloy is highest. A proportion of the main component is preferably more than 50 wt.-%, more preferably more than 70 wt.-%. A magnesium alloy is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">If the material is a magnesium alloy, the material preferably contains yttrium and further rare earth metals because an alloy of this type is distinguished due to its physiochemical properties and high biocompatibility, in particular, also its degradation products.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Magnesium alloys of the WE series, in particular, WE43, as well as magnesium alloys of the composition rare earth metals 5.2-9.9 wt.-%, thereof yttrium 3.7-5.5 wt.-%, and the remainder &#x3c;1 wt.-% are especially preferable, magnesium making up the proportion of the alloy to 100 wt.-%. These magnesium alloys have already confirmed their special suitability experimentally and in initial clinical trials, i.e., they display a high biocompatibility, favorable processing properties, good mechanical characteristics, and corrosion behavior adequate for the intended uses. For purposes of the present disclosure, the collective term &#x201c;rare earth metals&#x201d; includes scandium (21), yttrium (39), lanthanum (57) and the 14 elements following lanthanum (57), namely cerium (58), praseodymium (59), neodymium (60), promethium (61), samarium (62), europium (63), gadolinium (64), terbium (65), dysprosium (66), holmium (67), erbium (68), thulium (69), ytterbium (70) und lutetium (71).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">All possible and typical stent geometries are usable as the stent geometries. Preferably, the web or strut cross sections are to be identical at all points of the stent. The web or strut cross sections are preferably rectangular by which the coating with the partition layer, the agent-containing layer, and the third polymer layer, which may also be referred to as a topcoat, is simplified. Such cross sections are typical for stents which are, typically, cut into shape by laser from tubular starting material. The edges may be rounded and the surfaces smoothed by subsequent electropolishing. Alternatively, oval cross sections of the webs or struts of the metal stent main body may be used, as occur in welded stents which are sold, in particular, by Medtronic.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For purposes of the present disclosure, &#x201c;luminal side of the surface of a stent main body&#x201d; means the surface of a stent main body which is predominantly in contact with the vascular lumen and thus with the vascular fluid. In other words, in a typical cylindrical stent, this is the internal face in the direction of the central cylinder axis.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For purposes of the present disclosure, &#x201c;abluminal side of the stent main body&#x201d; means the surface of the stent main body which is in contact with the vascular tissue. In other words, in the typically cylindrical stent, this is the external cylindrical surface.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The various designs for the abluminal coating of the stent main body and/or for a coating of the surface of the stent main body, at least parts of the luminal surface not being coated by partition layer b) (2), agent-containing layer c) (3), and third polymer layer d) (4), are shown in the figures, in particular.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The agents are discharged from the stent main body to the vascular tissue so that the agents may act effectively against neointimal proliferation. For example, paclitaxel is to be discharged in a few seconds up to a few days to the vessel. For sirolimus and related limus compounds, such as zotarolimus, tacrolimus, everolimus, biolimus, in particular biolimus A9, the agent is to be discharged to the vessel over a few weeks. Suitable elution kinetics of these agents, but also further agents to be used according to the present disclosure, are known in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The stent degradation is to be viewed independently therefrom, because the stent main body has its function in the support of the vessel. A noteworthy collapsing pressure is to be withstood for at least two weeks, preferably 3 to 6 months. The complete stent degradation is accordingly to be completed up to 24 months, preferably 3 to 6 months, after loss of the collapsing pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A further exemplary embodiment of a stent according to the present disclosure comprises a polymer layer which is applied to the surface or a part of the surface of the agent-containing layer c) and/or the partition layer b) and/or the main body a).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">This exemplary embodiment is advantageous because, for one thing, the additional polymer layer provides the agents protection against abrasion, e.g., during storage or implantation. This polymer layer d) is preferably applied in a form-7fitting manner to the abluminal surface of the stent according to the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Coating with the polymer layer d) only on the abluminal side of the stent surface is preferable because an additional luminal coating with polymer decelerates the degradation speed of the stent main body or possibly accelerates the degradation speed with magnesium alloys, because the pH value sinks upon hydrolytic cleavage of suitable polymers. Further advantages of the abluminal coating according to the step d) are avoiding undesired adhesion of the polymer to the carrier balloon (so-called &#x201c;sticking&#x201d;) and a reduction of the profile of the stent (diameter of the stent crimped on the balloon).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Such a polymer layer d) (also called a topcoat) also offers an advantage if specific, preferably delayed elution kinetics of the agents is required. For example, if in spite of abluminal elution, an at least partial obstruction of the endothelialization by the antiproliferative action of the agent is to be prevented. The polymer layer d) is also preferably applied on the abluminal surface, more preferably on the surface or parts of the surface of the agent-containing layer c) and possibly the partition layer b).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If polymers are used for the agent-containing layer c) or the polymer-containing layer d), they are typically selected from the group consisting of:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0042">nondegradable polymers: polyethylene; polyvinylchloride; polyacrylates; preferably polyethyl- and polymethylacrylates, polymethylmethacrylate, polymethyl-co-ethyl-acrylate, and ethylene/ethylacrylate; polytetrafluoroethylene, preferably ethylene/chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymers, ethylene/tetrafluoroethylene copolymers; polyamides, preferably polyamide-imide, PA-11, PA-12, PA-46, PA-66; polyetherimide; polyethersulfone; poly(iso)butylene; polyvinylchloride; polyvinylfluoride; polyvinylalcohol; polyurethane; polybutylene terephthalate; silicones; polyphosphazene; polymer foams, preferably polymer foams made of carbonates, styrenes; copolymers and/or blends of the listed polymer classes, polymers of the class of thermoplastics as well as</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0043">degradable polymers: polydioxanone; polyglycolide; polycaprolactone; polylactides, preferably poly-L-lactide, poly-D,L-lactide, and copolymers and blends thereof, preferably poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide), poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide), poly(L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate); triblock copolymers; polysaccharides, preferably chitosan, levan, hyaluronic acid, heparin, dextran, cellulose; polyhydroxyvalerate; ethylvinylacetate; polyethylene oxide; polyphosphorylcholine; fibrin; albumin; polyhydroxy butyric acid, preferably atactic, isotactic, and/or syndiotactic polyhydroxy butyric acid and their blends.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">Especially preferred polymers for the agent-containing layer c) or polymer-containing layer d) of the present disclosure are the degradable polymers described hereinabove because no component foreign to the body remains in the organism due to the complete degradation of the polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">Furthermore, a stent according to the present disclosure is especially preferable if the partition layer b), over the entire period of time in which the agents are released from the stent main body and the stent main body is degraded, spatially separates the degradation products of the stent main body on one hand and the agents on the other hand as well as possibly the degradation products of the agent-containing layer c) and possibly the degradable, in particular, degradable under hydrolysis, polymer layer d).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">Preferred partition layer materials for the partition layer b) comprise silicon carbide (SiC), Parylene (poly-paraxylylene), in particular, Parylene N, Parylene C, and Parylene D (GALXYL&#xae;), glycocalix, polysulfone, silicone rubber, polyurethane, hydroxylapitite, and/or diamond-like carbon.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">The partition layer b) is preferably provided as a thin layer, preferably in the range of 100 nm to 5 &#x3bc;m, which is designed so that in the observed time window of a stent having noticeable collapsing pressure and/or a sustained agent elution, the thin layer represents a largely inert partition layer, which separates the agents on one hand and possibly the degradation products of the second layer c) and possibly the third polymer layer d) on the other hand. In addition, the partition layer b) preferably has good adhesion properties on the main body and to the layers c) and d), is flexible, and is distinguished by good biocompatibility.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">Furthermore, a stent according to the present disclosure is preferred if the agents are suitable for prophylaxis and/or therapy of in-stent restenosis and/or tissue inflammation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">Preferred agents are particularly selected from the group consisting of lipid regulators, immunosuppressives, vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, calcineurin inhibitors, antiphlogistics, anti-inflammatory agents, antiallergy agents, oligonucleotides, estrogens, endothelium producers, steroids, proteins, peptides, proliferation inhibitors, analgesics, antirheumatics, and cytostatics, preferably cyclosporin A, paclitaxel, and limus compounds, preferably sirolimus (rapamycin), zotarolimus, tacrolimus, biolimus, everolimus.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">The coating b) of the surface of the stent main body having the first preparation, preferably comprising SiC, parylene, hydroxylapatite, and/or diamond-like carbon according to the method for producing the stent is typically applied via plasma methods, the luminal surface of the stent main body is protected, for example, by heating a stent on a cylinder, a mandrel, a cannula, or the like, that the luminal surface of the stent main body is not coated by the first preparation. The coating having parylene is typically applied to the stent main body in vacuum by condensation from the gas phase as a preferably nonporous and transparent polymer film. Other preferred preparations, such as polysulfone, silicone rubber, is and/or polyurethane, may be applied by spraying and immersion methods, the luminal surface of the stent main body again being protected.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">The coating of the surface of the partition layer from step b) on the abluminal side of the stent main body using the second agent-containing preparation c), so that an agent-containing layer c) is implemented according to the method of the present disclosure, may be performed by typical methods. In particular, a pure agent melt, an agent-solvent mixture, or an agent-polymer mixture may be used for the typical methods, such as immersion methods (dip coating), the stent main body being plugged onto a mandrel, spray coating using single or multiple material nozzles, rotary atomization and pressure nozzles, sputtering, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">For precise dosing of the agents of the agent-containing layer c), the agent melt, the agent solution, or the agent incorporated in the polymer is painted on the stent main body, preferably using typical pipetting techniques. If the stent main body has notches in the form of dents or cups, the agent-containing preparation is preferably dosed into the notches, in particular, the dents or cups, using an agent jet.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">Alternatively, the agent-containing layer may be poured in the form of regularly applied agent islands, preferably of equal size on a linear row on the partition layer b) (see, in particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref> <i>a</i>) through <b>5</b> <i>d</i>)) on the stent struts and/or in suitable depressions, in particular, holes. The agent-containing layer c) may contain the agents, either homogeneously, in layers, or having a concentration gradient for one or more agents, possibly in an agent-carrier mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">A further conceivable coating method comprises a roller application, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in particular.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">The coating of the surface of the stent produced according to a method of the present disclosure with the third preparation d), which comprises one or more polymers, so that a polymer layer d) is implemented, may also be performed using typical methods hereinabove described. If no polymer is to be provided on the luminal side, the luminal side of the surface of the stent main body is covered so that, during the coating method, this part of the surface does not come into contact with the polymer. A cylinder, a cannula, or a mantle is preferably used for this purpose. The cylinder, cannula or mantle is inserted longitudinally into the stent so that the luminal side of the surface of the stent main body covers it and is not coated by the polymer preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">If necessary, a typical drying step or other typical physical or chemical post-processing steps, such as vacuum or plasma treatment, may follow one or more coating steps before the stent is treated further.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a stent main body <b>1</b> in cross-section and two rollers <b>5</b> in cross-section, the arrows indicating the movement directions of the particular rollers. In addition, the coating medium <b>6</b> is shown. The coating medium <b>6</b> may either represent the preparation of the agent-containing layer or alternatively the preparation of the polymer layer of the topcoat.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">For a coating method according to a roller application, a stent main body <b>1</b> which already has a partition layer <b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is brought into contact with the two rollers <b>5</b> rotating in opposite directions. As soon as the rollers <b>5</b> rotate in the direction of the movement arrows, the coating medium <b>6</b> is applied to the surface of the rollers <b>5</b> and thus to the abluminal surface of the stent main body <b>1</b>. The stent main body <b>1</b> is preferably additionally rotated longitudinally to the axis so that the abluminal surface of the stent may be coated completely.</p>
