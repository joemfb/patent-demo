<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments relate generally to mail processing and, more particularly, to remote encoding center automation systems and methods providing automated mail piece image recognition processing to existing manual remote encoding centers.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Postal services, such as the United States Postal Service (USPS), may send large volumes of images of mail pieces that cannot be reliably resolved with their primary automation equipment to Remote Encoding Centers (RECs). The Remote Encoding Centers (RECs) may employ many human workers who view the mail piece images and manually resolve the image by determining the correct addressing information associated with the mail piece. Current automated mail recognition systems and methods may have higher success rates than the automation equipment currently deployed in the field by a postal service. Updating automation equipment currently deployed across a postal service's delivery area (for example the entire United States for the USPS) may not be technically feasible due to technical limitations of the legacy components still in use and may not be economically feasible due to deployment costs, contractual obligations, and/or the proprietary nature of some automation equipment. A need may exist to retrofit the existing Remote Encoding Centers (RECs) to provide improved automated mail recognition processing of all mail piece images received by the Remote Encoding Centers (RECs) and manually processing of only those images that cannot be resolved by the improved automated mail recognition processing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One embodiment includes a computer system configured to provide automated mail recognition processing to a legacy manual mail recognition processing system. The computer system can include a processor and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory can store software instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations. The operations can include receiving a manual mail recognition processing request from an originating mail processing component. The manual mail recognition processing request can include a mail piece scan image that the originating mail processing component failed to automatically resolve an address in. The manual mail recognition processing request can request manual processing of the mail piece scan image by a human and the mail piece scan image can comprise a digital image of at least a portion of a mail piece. The digital image can capture a plurality of digital image addressing information associated with the mail piece. The operations can also include ignoring the request for manual processing of the mail piece scan image by a human and performing automated mail recognition processing of the mail piece scan image. If the automated mail recognition processing is successful, the automated mail recognition processing can include creating a plurality of computer recognized address portions corresponding to the plurality of digital image addressing information associated with the mail piece. If the automated mail recognition processing is successful, a mail piece scan image processing result can be created containing the plurality of computer recognized address portions. If the automated mail recognition processing is successful and the mail piece scan image processing results contains the plurality of computer recognized address portions, the mail piece scan image processing result can be transmitted to the originating mail processing component. If the automated mail recognition processing is not successful and the mail piece scan image processing results does not contain the plurality of computer recognized address portions, the mail piece scan image can be transmitted to the manual mail recognition system. The manual mail recognition system can include a plurality of human users performing manual mail recognition of the mail piece image if the mail piece scan image is transmitted to the manual mail recognition system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another embodiment can include a method for retrofitting a legacy manual mail recognition system with automated mail recognition processing. The method can include redirecting, at a network component, a mail piece scan image manual processing request to an automated recognition interception computer. The mail piece scan image manual processing request could have been transmitted by a requesting mail processing component. The mail piece scan image manual processing request can include a mail piece scan image. The mail piece scan image can include a digital image that can represent at least a portion of a mail piece. The mail piece scan image manual processing request can request manual mail recognition processing to be performed on the mail piece scan image by a human. The method can also include receiving, at the automated recognition interception computer, a mail piece scan image manual processing request. The mail piece scan image can be processed, including creating a plurality of computer recognized address portions if the processing is successful. The plurality of computer recognized address portions can correspond to the addressing information of the mail piece captured in the mail piece scan image. A mail piece scan image processing result can be generated that includes at least a portion of the plurality of computer recognized address portions if the processing was successful. The method can include transmitting, from the automated recognition interception computer, the mail piece scan image processing result to the requesting mail processing component if the processing was successful. The method can also include transmitting, from the automated recognition interception computer, the mail piece scan image to a manual recognition system for manual processing if the processing was unsuccessful.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another embodiment can include a nontransitory computer readable medium having stored thereon software instructions that, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to perform a series of operations. The operations can include intercepting a manual mail recognition processing request requesting manual processing of a mail piece image. The manual mail recognition processing request can have been transmitted by an originating mail processing component that can have failed to resolve the mail piece image. After receiving the manual mail recognition processing request, the manual mail recognition processing request can be ignored and instead the mail piece scan image can be forwarded to an automated mail recognition processing system. The operations can include receiving an automated mail recognition processing response from the automated mail recognition processing system. The automated mail recognition processing response can include a plurality of addressing data corresponding to the mail piece scan image if the automated mail recognition processing system was able to successfully resolve the mail piece image. At least a portion of the plurality of addressing data can be transmitted to the originating mail processing component if the automated mail recognition processing system was able to successfully resolve the mail piece scan image. The manual mail recognition processing request can be forwarded to a legacy manual mail recognition processing system if the automated mail recognition processing system was not able to successfully resolve the mail piece scan image.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In operation, the plurality of MPE <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>108</b> perform mail recognition processing of mail piece scan images and select unrecognizable images for manual processing by the manual REC <b>110</b>. The REC automation system <b>102</b> can capture and/or intercept those mail piece scan images selected for manual processing before they reach the manual REC <b>110</b> and perform automated mail recognition processing of the mail piece scan images according to the processes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b>. The REC automation system <b>102</b> can be software and/or hardware (e.g., a computer programmed for REC automation).
