<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image forming system, a management apparatus, and a non-transitory computer readable medium.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many information processing apparatuses, such as computers, and various apparatuses using such an information processing apparatus use, when using a commercial power supply, an uninterruptible power supply apparatus (UPS) in order to, for example, protect the apparatuses and information even in a case where the status of power supply is unstable due to a power failure and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of using an uninterruptible power supply apparatus, the capacity of the uninterruptible power supply apparatus is determined in accordance with the power consumption of an apparatus that receives power from the uninterruptible power supply apparatus. Accordingly, in the case where the apparatus consumes a large amount of power, a large-capacity uninterruptible power supply apparatus or plural uninterruptible power supply apparatuses are used.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided an image forming system including plural uninterruptible power supply apparatuses, plural image processing apparatuses, and a management apparatus. The image processing apparatuses are each connected to a corresponding one of the uninterruptible power supply apparatuses. The management apparatus issues, when a fault has occurred in one of the uninterruptible power supply apparatuses, a stop instruction to one of the image processing apparatuses that is connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus in which the fault has occurred. The image processing apparatuses include a first image processing apparatus that develops print information into image information, stores the developed image information, and outputs the stored image information to an image forming apparatus, and a second image processing apparatus that develops the print information into image information and outputs the developed image information to the first image processing apparatus. The management apparatus issues, in a case where the first image processing apparatus is connected to an uninterruptible power supply apparatus in which a fault has occurred, stop instructions to all the image processing apparatuses.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A process for changing the status of the image forming system or stopping the image forming system to be performed in the case where a fault has occurred in an uninterruptible power supply apparatus will now be explained in accordance with an operation of the management apparatus <b>103</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> are flowcharts illustrating processes performed by the management apparatus <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the power supply management unit <b>133</b> of the management apparatus <b>103</b> receives a notification indicating a fault from an uninterruptible power supply apparatus (UPS), the management apparatus <b>103</b> determines that a fault in the uninterruptible power supply apparatus has been detected (YES in step <b>201</b>), and specifies the uninterruptible power supply apparatus in which the fault has occurred (step <b>202</b>). Specification of an uninterruptible power supply apparatus in which a fault has occurred is performed on the basis of the identification number, network address, and the like of the uninterruptible power supply apparatus. A fault in an uninterruptible power supply apparatus is not necessarily detected on the basis of a notification from the uninterruptible power supply apparatus. The power supply management unit <b>133</b> may query an uninterruptible power supply apparatus as to whether a fault has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the uninterruptible power supply apparatus in which the fault has occurred is specified, the power supply management unit <b>133</b> identifies an image processing apparatus to be stopped (step <b>203</b>). In this identification processing, the power supply management unit <b>133</b> first specifies an image processing apparatus that is connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus in which the fault has occurred and that receives power from the uninterruptible power supply apparatus (step <b>231</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The power supply management unit <b>133</b> specifies the image processing apparatus on the basis of a system configuration management list stored in the management apparatus <b>103</b>. The system configuration management list is, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. For example, in the system configuration management list, combinations of operating image processing apparatuses and uninterruptible power supply apparatuses to which the image processing apparatuses are connected are described. The system configuration management list is generated by sequentially reading, for image processing apparatuses activated when the image forming system is activated, information on the combinations of image processing apparatuses and uninterruptible power supply apparatuses set in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the image processing apparatus specified to be connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus in which the fault has occurred includes a color management apparatus (YES in step <b>232</b>), the power supply management unit <b>133</b> determines that the entire image forming system is to be stopped (step <b>233</b>). When the image processing apparatus specified to be connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus in which the fault has occurred does not include a color management apparatus (NO in step <b>232</b>), the power supply management unit <b>133</b> determines that part of the image forming system is to be stopped (step <b>234</b>). Then, the process for identifying an image processing apparatus to be stopped is terminated. A color management apparatus includes a storage unit that stores image information and a formation control unit that outputs the image information to an image forming apparatus. The image processing apparatus <b>102</b>C including the storage unit <b>122</b>C and the formation control unit <b>123</b>C, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>M including the storage unit <b>122</b>M and the formation control unit <b>123</b>M, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>Y including the storage unit <b>122</b>Y and the formation control unit <b>123</b>Y, and the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>K including the storage unit <b>122</b>K and the formation control unit <b>123</b>K correspond to color management apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When, in accordance with the result of the process for identifying an image processing apparatus to be stopped, it is determined that part of the image forming system is to be stopped (NO in step <b>204</b>), the power supply management unit <b>133</b> specifies, on the basis of the system configuration management list, an image processing apparatus connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus in which the fault has occurred (step <b>205</b>), and sends a stop instruction to the specified image processing apparatus (step <b>206</b>). Basically, the power supply management unit <b>133</b> sends a stop instruction, via the distribution processing unit <b>132</b>, using a communication path through which print information is distributed. However, the power supply management unit <b>133</b> may send stop instructions directly to individual image processing apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">After sending the stop instruction to the image processing apparatus connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus, the power supply management unit <b>133</b> deletes from the system configuration management list the image processing apparatus to which the stop instruction has been sent (step <b>207</b>). Then, the process is terminated. In this case, the image forming system continues to perform an operation, while using only an image processing apparatus that is not stopped. At this time, the distribution processing unit <b>132</b> refers to the system configuration management list to exclude the stopped image processing apparatus from destinations of distribution of print information. Accordingly, the destination of distribution is changed in such a manner that print information is to be distributed only to an operating image processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When, in accordance with the result of the process for identifying an image processing apparatus to be stopped, it is determined that the entire image forming system is to be stopped (YES in step <b>204</b>), the power supply management unit <b>133</b> sends stop instructions to all the image processing apparatuses, on the basis of the system configuration management list (step <b>208</b>). Basically, the power supply management unit <b>133</b> sends a stop instruction, via the distribution processing unit <b>132</b>, using a communication path through which print information is distributed. However, the power supply management unit <b>133</b> may send stop instructions directly to individual image processing apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">After sending the stop instructions to all the image processing apparatuses, the power supply management unit <b>133</b> causes the management apparatus <b>103</b> to perform stop processing for itself (step <b>209</b>), and the process is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The above-described processing will be explained more specifically. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the system configuration management list, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>C, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>M, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>Y, and the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>K connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>106</b>, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>-n, and so on connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>107</b>, an image processing apparatus <b>102</b>-(n+1) and so on (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) connected to an uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>108</b> (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and so on exist, and all the apparatuses are normally operating.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this state, when a fault has occurred in the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>108</b>, since the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>C, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>M, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>Y, or the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>K, which corresponds to a color management apparatus, is not connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>108</b>, it is determined that part of the image forming system is to be stopped (NO in step <b>232</b>, and then step <b>204</b>). Thus, only the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>-(n+1) and so on connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>108</b> are stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Similarly, when a fault has occurred in the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>107</b>, since the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>C, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>M, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>Y, or the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>K, which corresponds to a color management apparatus, is not connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>107</b>, it is determined that part of the image forming system is to be stopped (NO in step <b>232</b>, and then step <b>234</b>). Thus, only the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>-n, and so on are stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, in the state where a fault has occurred in the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>108</b> and the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>-(n+1) and so on are stopped and where the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>C, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>M, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>Y, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>K, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>-n, and so on are operating, when a fault has occurred in the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>107</b>, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>-n, and so on are stopped for the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>107</b>. Thus, the image forming system is operated by the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>C, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>M, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>Y, and the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In contrast, when a fault has occurred in the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>106</b>, since the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>C, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>M, the image pickup apparatus <b>102</b>Y, and the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>K, which correspond to color management apparatus, are connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus <b>106</b>, it is determined that the entire image forming system is to be stopped (YES in step <b>232</b>, and then step <b>233</b>). Thus, all the image processing apparatuses and the management apparatus <b>103</b> are stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A stop process performed by an image processing apparatus (for example, the image processing apparatus <b>102</b>C) will now be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the flow of a stop process performed by an image processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When receiving a stop instruction from the management apparatus <b>103</b>, an image processing apparatus (<b>102</b>C) starts a stop process. First, a &#x201c;waiting time&#x201d; as a variable is initialized to a predetermined value (step <b>301</b>). This value is determined in accordance with the capacity of the battery of the uninterruptible power supply apparatus (<b>106</b>), the number of image processing apparatuses connected to the uninterruptible power supply apparatus, and the like. In addition, during the period of time represented by this value, the image processing apparatus (<b>102</b>C) are able to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Then, the image processing apparatus (<b>102</b>C) continues to operate when a page (part of print information) for which image processing is being performed exists (YES in step <b>302</b>) and the variable representing the &#x201c;waiting time&#x201d; is positive (NO in step <b>304</b>). During this period of time, the variable representing the &#x201c;waiting time&#x201d; is reduced with time (step <b>303</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Then, when image processing is terminated (NO in step <b>302</b>) or the variable representing the &#x201c;waiting time&#x201d; reaches &#x201c;0&#x201d; (YES in step <b>304</b>), the image processing apparatus (<b>102</b>C) performs processing for stopping the operation (step <b>305</b>). Then, the process is terminated. The processing for stopping the operation includes processing for storing various types of information, like shutdown processing for general computers.</p>
