<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Content management relates to managing the content involving digital data of a group of business enterprises. This promotes effectiveness and efficiency of business processes that are carried out using the digital data. Business process management may be described as a part of content management that is responsible for aligning the business data of the enterprise with a business requirement. The activities of business process management generally include designing, modeling, executing, monitoring and optimizing the business process.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Monitoring the business process includes tracking of individual processes that are involved in achieving an end result. Tracking of business process is useful to understand business logics involved in executing the process and to make corresponding business decisions. For instance, a business process executed in an enterprise may include a field work, an intellectual work, an oversight carried out to complete a task and the like. Each individual process may further include certain specifications that are useful in determining daily wages of employees executing the business process. Such statistical information may be derived by tracing the business process and analyzing events that have occurred during the process. However, the process of tracing involves analyzing enormous amount of business data, thereby creating an overload for an associated business processor. Hence, providing a tracing mechanism that can act upon the massive business data and comprehend the business logics involved in the business process is useful.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of techniques for systems and methods to trace an execution of a business process are disclosed herein. Business process may include business rules and business objects involved in executing the business process. These business rules may define a manner in which the business objects have to be applied to execute the business process. In an embodiment, the business objects are configured to receive an input from a user, and based upon the received input, business logic associated with the business rules may define the application of the received inputs to the business objects corresponding to the business rules. Based upon an instruction to trigger the execution of the business process, the business rules are processed by processing the business objects, and a process-resultant of the business process is computed. The process-resultant may be a business result desired for the business process. For instance, for a business process of calculating daily wages for fifty employees of an organization, the process-resultant may be the amount of the daily wages paid to each employee; and to calculate the amount to be paid, business objects such as number of hours worked, and type of work done may be considered. Based upon the input received for the business objects, the business rules (e.g., formulae to calculate the daily wages) are processed by applying the business logic to the business rules to compute the process-resultant (e.g., daily wages).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a business environment, business logic involved in computing a process-resultant may need to be understood may be analyzed to make various business decisions. For instance, a type of work done may include type of field work, type of intellectual work, type of oversight carried out to complete a task, and the like. Each type of work may further include certain specifications required to determine an employee's daily wages. Thus, comprehending the procedures followed to execute a business process and generate a process-resultant may be helpful. To create a comprehensive map describing a compilation of the process-resultant, a tracing mechanism is applied to trace the business rules, the corresponding business objects and the other parameters that are involved in computing the process-resultant. The tracing mechanism thus applied creates a trace-resultant by tracing a process-path of the computed process-resultant. Furthermore, the trace-resultant is parsed to derive a business definition for the traced business processes involved in computing the process-resultant. Based upon the business definition, a comprehensive trace-map is generated, that describes the compilation of the process-resultant to execute the business process.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;this embodiment&#x201d; and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an overview of a system to trace a software execution of a business process, according to an embodiment. Business processes in large enterprises typically involve enormous amounts of business data structured according to particular requirements for generating intended results. A business process may be described as an arrangement of a collection of inter-dependent actions with a purpose of achieving an intended result.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Business processes may include a set of business rules that define certain aspects of the business process. The business rules may be associated with the business process for purposes of making the business process&#x2014;effective to an extent of arriving at desirable outputs, efficient with reference to time taken to execute the business process and performance of the business process, and for controlling the flow of business data involved in executing the business process. Thus, depending upon factors such as the output desired, the time and performance, and the manner of flow of business data, a specific set of business rules may be associated with each business process. Business rules may also be defined as formulae applied to a region of data to execute an associated business process. Examples of business rules include currency translations, allocations, and simple mathematical calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The business rules include business objects that are business entities describing definitions, criteria and operations of the business process. Business objects describe a structure and behavior of a real-world object. A business object includes a hierarchy of business object nodes, which represent the data, and bundles functions along with the data. Business objects may accept business input from a user, and based upon the business rules associated with corresponding business processes, the business input is processed to execute the business process and a business resultant is generated as a result of the execution. The data comprised in the business object may be referred to as business information. In an embodiment, business logic describes a principle or a functional algorithm to handle the business rules, the business objects and any business information required to execute the business process. The business logic may comprise the business rules and may define the manner of interaction of business objects with one another, within the business rules, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For instance, a business process DETERMINATION OF PROFIT OF ITEM &#x2018;A&#x2019; may include two business rules CALCULATE A TOTAL INCOME FOR ITEM &#x2018;A&#x2019; and CALCULATE A TOTAL EXPENSE FOR ITEM &#x2018;A&#x2019;. The two business rules may further include business objects SELLING PRICE, COST PRICE and DISCOUNT that accept business input from a user. Based upon receiving an instruction to trigger an execution of the business process, the business rules and the business objects are processed. In an embodiment, a business rule may further include one or more business rules and corresponding business objects to describe a formula to execute the business process.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a business environment, the functional algorithms involved in handling business information of the business process have to be analyzed to make various business decisions. This analysis may be implemented to consider the entities involved in the business process, to perform a detailed study of parts of the entities and their relationships in generating the entity, and to obtain a comprehensive explanation of the procedure followed to arrive at a resultant of the business process. To accomplish this analysis, a mechanism of tracing the business process may be followed. Tracing the execution of a business process includes analyzing a development of the business input into a business resultant. Tracing involves analyzing the procedural steps of the business process by analyzing business data present in the business objects at regular intervals of the business process. Tracing a business process enables tracing the enormous business data present in the business process. Tracing also enables providing a comprehensive explanation of the process followed to arrive at the business resultant. Hence, tracing business data that is sufficient to provide the comprehensive explanation causes efficient utilization of a business processor operable to execute the business process.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Block <b>100</b> illustrates an overview of a system to trace an execution of a business process, according to an embodiment. Block <b>100</b> comprises a computer generated user interface (UI) <b>102</b> including an UI element representing the associated business object <b>116</b>, an UI element representing the process-resultant <b>122</b> and an UI element representing the trace map <b>134</b>; business processing unit <b>104</b> including business processor <b>114</b>, input reader <b>118</b>, memory element <b>120</b>, path tracing engine <b>128</b>, trace-parser <b>130</b> and compiler <b>132</b>; business repository <b>106</b> including business object repository <b>108</b>, business rules repository <b>110</b>, business logic <b>112</b>, key-string table <b>124</b> and database <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">User interface (UI) <b>102</b> is utilized for establishing interactions between a user and the backend of a system to trace the execution of a business process. In an embodiment, UI <b>102</b> includes UI element <b>116</b> representing a set of one or more business objects, UI element <b>122</b> representing a process resultant and UI element <b>134</b> representing a trace map. Business object associated with the selected business process may be residing in business object repository <b>108</b>, and business rules associated with the selected business process may be residing in business rules repository <b>110</b>. Business logic <b>112</b> includes the functional algorithm to handle the business rules and the business objects involved in executing the business process.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, a user selects a business process from a group of business processes available on UI <b>102</b>. Based upon a selected business process, business rules and their corresponding business objects involved in executing the business process are identified. In an embodiment, the business objects that are operable to receive an input are rendered on UI <b>102</b> as UI elements (for e.g., <b>116</b>). For instance, a first business rule may include a first business object and a second business object; a second business rule may include a third business object and a fourth business object. The execution of the selected business process may require processing of both the business rules (i.e. first business rule and second business rule). The first business object and the fourth business object may be operable to receive an input. However, the second business object and the third business object may not be operable to receive an input. In such cases, only the first business object and the fourth business object are rendered as UI elements <b>116</b> on UI <b>102</b>. In another embodiment, only one of the two business rules may be required for execution of the business process. In such cases, only the business objects corresponding to the required business rule may be rendered on UI <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment, UI <b>102</b> includes an option to execute the selected business process, and the user is provided with an option to trigger the execution. The business processor <b>114</b> recognizes an instruction to trigger the execution the business process, and executes the business process by processing the business rules and their corresponding business objects associated with the business process. According to one embodiment, input reader <b>118</b> included in business processor <b>114</b> is responsible for assigning a received input for a corresponding business object, and storing the received input along with an identification of the corresponding business object in memory element <b>120</b>. In an embodiment, the business object is stored in the memory element <b>120</b> along with the received input. Based upon the received input, business processor <b>114</b> processes the business rules and their corresponding business objects associated with the business process. In an embodiment, the business rules and their corresponding business objects associated with the business process include dependant business rules and dependant business objects. A dependant business rule may be described as a child business rule that depends on a parent business rule in a hierarchy of business rules involved in executing the business process. Similarly, a dependant business object may be described as a child business object that depends on a parent business object in a hierarchy of business objects involved in executing the business process. For instance, a first business rule BR<b>1</b> may include business objects BO<b>1</b> and BO<b>2</b>, and the first business rule may be described as BR<b>1</b>=BO<b>1</b>+BO<b>2</b>. Further, BO<b>7</b> and BO<b>9</b> may be dependent on BO<b>1</b>, described as BO<b>1</b>=BO<b>7</b>*(BO<b>9</b>/2). According to the above relation, BO<b>7</b> and BO<b>9</b> may be necessary to calculate BO<b>1</b>; or BO<b>7</b> and BO<b>9</b> may need to be processed to process BO<b>1</b>. Although they are not directly involved in executing a business process, the dependant business rules and dependant business objects may be required to process the business rules and the corresponding business objects associated with the business process. Hence, during processing of the business rules, business processor <b>114</b> identifies one or more such dependant business rules and/or dependant business objects involved in executing the business process.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Processing the business rules and the corresponding business objects includes preparing the business rules and the corresponding business objects to undergo a prescribed set of logical operations on the data present in the business rules and the corresponding business objects, to obtain a required process-resultant. Preparing the business rules and the corresponding business objects may further include:

<p id="p-0026" num="0029">For instance, for a business process of calculating daily wages for the employees of an organization, a desired outcome may be the amount of the daily wages paid to each employee. To calculate the amount to be paid, business objects such as number of hours worked and type of work done may be considered. Based upon the input received for the business objects, the business rules (e.g., the formulae to calculate the daily wages) are processed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">Based upon the processing of the business rules and corresponding business objects, business processor <b>114</b> computes a process-resultant for the business process. The process-resultant may be described as a business result that is desired for the business process. The process-resultant is an outcome of the processing of business rules and their corresponding business objects associated with the business process. For instance, for a business process of calculating daily wages for the employees of an organization, the process-resultant may be the amount of the daily wages paid to each employee. In an embodiment, the process-resultant is stored in memory element <b>120</b>. Business processor <b>114</b> may display the process-resultant as a UI element <b>122</b> on UI <b>102</b>. In an embodiment, business processor <b>114</b> stores the process-resultant in database <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">To provide an understanding of the logic involved in computing the process-resultant, a tracing mechanism is applied to trace the business rules and corresponding business objects and other parameters involved in computing the process-resultant. Tracing may be described as a process of detecting the steps followed while executing the business process, to arrive at the process-resultant. Path tracing engine <b>128</b> traces a process-path of the computed process-resultant by detecting the steps followed to compute the process-resultant. Tracing the process-path includes tracing a key-string of the business objects involved in computing the process-resultant.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">A key-string may be described as a fundamental identification sequence of business object information that includes comprehensive information about the business object. The key-strings include key-identifiers and key-values of business objects, wherein the key-identifiers are unique expressions identifying corresponding business objects. The key-value may be a system generated value based upon a corresponding business rule or a user input received from the computer-generated user interface or may be a constant for a corresponding business process, or a resultant of a related business process, or the like. The key-string may also include a time-stamp denoting a date and time associated with the business object, for instance, a time and date at which the business object was created, modified, moved from one destination to another and the like. In an embodiment, key-string table <b>124</b> may be generated for the business rules and their corresponding business objects residing in business rule repository <b>110</b> and business object repository <b>108</b>. The key-string generated for each business object is typically unique. For example, a business object BO<b>1</b> is associated with a key-string KS<b>1</b>=BO<b>1</b>&#x2212;123/344/20:05-10-22-2009, where BO<b>1</b>&#x2212;123 denotes the key-identifier, 344 denotes the key-value and 20:05-10-22-2009 denotes the time-stamp of the business object.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">Business information or a business definition associated with the business rules and their corresponding business objects are subject to modifications during a lifecycle of a business process. With reference to the above example of the key-string, for a modified business object BO<b>1</b>&#x2032;, the key-string KS<b>1</b>&#x2032;=BO<b>1</b>&#x2032;&#x2212;1234/345/20:05&#x2014;Oct. 22, 2010, where BO<b>1</b>&#x2032;&#x2212;1234 denotes the key-identifier of the modified BO<b>1</b>&#x2032;, 345 denotes a modified key-value and 20:05&#x2014;Oct. 22, 2010 denotes a time-stamp at which the business object was modified.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">The definition of the business rule may include a name, description, content of the business rule, and the like. The definition of a business object may include a name, a description, a data structure, a business value, content of the business object and the like. In an embodiment, the business rules and/or the business objects may be modified to accommodate new parameters, or to revise a desired output of the business process, or the like. The business objects of a previous instance may be revised to match with a current instance. In such instances, a modified business object may be created based upon a modification applied to a related business object. Such modified business objects are versioned and the versioned business objects are stored in business object repository <b>108</b>. For instance, the versions of a business object BO<b>1</b> having a key-value <b>344</b> generated at (timestamp) 04:00 Dec. 25, 2011 may include&#x2014;a first modified version BO<b>1</b>&#x2032; having a key-value <b>345</b> generated at 05:00 Dec. 26, 2011; a second modified version BO<b>1</b>&#x2033; having a key-value <b>350</b> generated at 18:00 Dec. 26, 2011; and a third modified version BO<b>1</b>&#x2033; having a key-value <b>360</b> generated at 19:00 Dec. 27, 2011. Versioning of business objects includes a process of assigning a unique key-string to the modified business objects. For instance, a unique key-string is assigned to BO<b>1</b>&#x2032;, BO<b>1</b>&#x2033; and BO<b>1</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; due to the unique key-value and the unique time-stamp associated with them.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">Versioning of modified business objects helps in retaining the original business object along with its modified versions. Thus, the original business object and its modified versions are associated with their own unique key-strings. With reference to the above example, BO<b>1</b>&#x2032; is a first version of BO<b>1</b>. Hence, BO<b>1</b>&#x2032; is associated with a unique key-string KS<b>1</b>&#x2032;; BO&#x2033; is a second version of BO<b>1</b>. Hence, BO<b>1</b>&#x2033; is associated with a unique key-string KS<b>1</b>&#x2033;; and BO<b>1</b>&#x2033; is a third version of BO<b>1</b>. Hence, BO<b>1</b>&#x2033; is associated with a unique key-string KS<b>1</b>&#x2032;. The key-identifier and the time-stamp associated with the unique key-string helps in determining the version of the business object. The unique key-string associated with the versioned business objects are updated in a key-string table <b>124</b>. The unique key-strings of the business objects (the original and its modified versions) includes unique key-identifier to identify the versions of the business object, the key-value and a unique time-stamp to determine a time at which the modification was performed on the business object. This time-stamp helps distinguishing between a latest modification of the business object, an original version of the business object, an intermediate version, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">In an embodiment, path tracing engine <b>128</b> traces all the parameters of the business object including an input, a value, an identifier, a resultant, and the like, and this information may differ for different business objects. For instance, an input received for a first business object may be in a table format, and an input received for a second business object may be in a graphical format. To trace the business objects, a universal format may be required. Hence, path tracing engine <b>128</b> may convert the parameters of the business object into a universal format, for instance a key-string having a key-identifier and a key-value along with a time-stamp. This method of conversion makes the parameter storage format independent from the business object definition, and facilitates tracing one or more values of each parameter associated with the business objects.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">Path tracing engine <b>128</b> traces the process-path of the computed process-resultant by tracing the key-strings of all the business objects involved in computing the process-resultant. Path tracing engine <b>128</b> generates a trace-resultant describing the path followed to compute the process-resultant. For instance, to execute a business process BP<b>1</b>, business rules BR<b>1</b> and BR<b>2</b> are identified. To execute BP<b>1</b>, BR<b>1</b> and BR<b>2</b> have to be processed as: BP<b>1</b>&#x2212;BR<b>1</b>+BR<b>2</b>. The business rules may be described as: BR<b>1</b>=(BO<b>1</b>+BO<b>2</b>)*BO<b>3</b> and BR<b>2</b>&#x2212;BO<b>4</b>+BO<b>5</b>, where BO<b>1</b>, BO<b>2</b>, BO<b>3</b>, BO<b>4</b> and BO<b>5</b> denote the business objects. A process-resultant may be computed as 15435 for BP<b>1</b> based upon processing the BR<b>1</b> and BR<b>2</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0040">In an embodiment, there exists a possibility of tracing the business data that are not essential to explain the execution of the business process. This may occur when the processor traces the business definition of the business rules and the business objects involved in executing the business process. The business definition may not be essential in explaining the execution of the business process, since the business definition may be derived from the key-string of the associated business object. According to an embodiment, a lean-tracing mechanism may be used to trace the process-path of the computed process-resultant. The lean-tracing mechanism may be described as a tracing mechanism that traces a minimum set of information that is sufficient to detect the steps followed while computing the process-resultant. For instance, a lean-tracing mechanism may trace only a key-string of a business object rather than tracing the business definition of the business object. For example, with reference to Table 1, the first three columns representing the business object identifier, business object value and timestamp are sufficient to detect the steps followed while computing the process-resultant. The fourth column representing the business definition is not essential in determining the process-resultant. In an embodiment, the path tracing engine <b>128</b> traces a minimum information including a key-identifier, a key-value and a time-stamp of the business objects involved in computing the process-resultant. In an embodiment, the minimum information will at least include the key-identifier, the key-value and the time-stamp of the business object.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">Path tracing engine <b>128</b> does not trace any other business information that may be associated with the business object. By excluding all other business information, path tracing engine <b>128</b> traces comparatively a small amount of data instead of tracing the enormous data present in the business environment. By utilizing the versioned business objects, lean trace may be performed to evaluate and demonstrate the steps followed to compute the process-resultant. For instance, by performing lean-tracing, a key-identifier, a key-value, a time-stamp of each business object and/or each versioned business object involved in computing the process-resultant is traced by path tracing engine <b>128</b>. Thus, the lean-tracing mechanism reduces the workload of tracing an entire business definition of each business object involved in computing the process-resultant. Also, a complete set of original business objects and versioned business objects are identified and available for evaluating and demonstrating purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">According to another embodiment, strategic-tracing mechanism may be used to trace the process-path of the computed process-resultant. The strategic-tracing mechanism may be described as a tracing mechanism that traces relevant information required to evaluate and demonstrate the steps followed while computing the process-resultant. For instance, a business object &#x2018;PRODUCT RATING&#x2019; involved in computing a process-resultant &#x2018;MARKETING STRATEGY&#x2019; may include business information such as &#x2018;SALES INFORMATION&#x2019;, &#x2018;GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION&#x2019;, &#x2018;QUALITY INFORMATION&#x2019;, &#x2018;PURCHASE ORDERS RECEIVED&#x2019;, &#x2018;DURATION FOR PRODUCTION&#x2019;, &#x2018;LOGISTICS FOR SALES&#x2019;, &#x2018;DEMOGRAPHY OF WORKMEN&#x2019;, and &#x2018;BANK INFORMATION&#x2019;. While processing the business objects to compute the process-resultant, business processor <b>114</b> considers the business information, and utilizes the business information required to compute the process-resultant. However, while performing strategic-tracing, business information like &#x2018;DEMOGRAPHY OF WORKMEN&#x2019; and &#x2018;BANK INFORMATION&#x2019; that do not contribute to the computation of the process-resultant may be excluded from being traced. Path tracing engine <b>128</b> may consider only the business information required to evaluate the computation of the process-resultant.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">Here, the relevant information may be described as that business information associated with the business object that is directly related to the business rules and the business object that are necessary to execute the business process. Any business information that has no relevance with the computed process-resultant may be skipped while tracing the process-path. For instance, business processor may evaluate many steps during the executing of the business process to arrive at the desired result. These steps may include business rules and business objects that are directly not required to execute the business process. Though this information is required to compute the process-resultant, the information may be irrelevant with reference to the computed process-resultant. Such information, for instance, dependant business rules or the dependant business objects that exist in a hierarchy of the business rules involved in executing the business process and the like, may be excluded during the process of strategic-tracing.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">For example, consider a business case where a computation of a process-resultant may include several mathematical formulae containing multiple condition branches. To compute the process-resultant for this business case, each branch is processed, until a branch that meets all the conditions is found. However, while carrying out strategic-tracing, path tracing engine <b>128</b> traces only the condition branch that meets the condition, since that is the only true-branch that leads to the process-resultant. The one or more false-branches that do not meet the conditions are not traced.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">In another embodiment, path tracing engine <b>128</b> excludes unnecessary values of the process-resultant while strategically tracing the process-path. For instance, when a business object has a constant value, the value can be derived from the business definition of the business object. In such cases, path tracing engine <b>128</b> does not trace the value unnecessary for computing the process-resultant. For example, a business object BO<b>5</b> may have a value BO<b>5</b>=47. Here, path tracing engine <b>128</b> need not trace the value &#x2018;47&#x2019; to determine any information that is unknown by the expression of the business object.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">In another example where a decision table is being traced, business processor <b>114</b> may process one or more condition cells present in the decision table to compute a resultant in a result cell. When the result of such a decision table is traced, path tracing engine <b>128</b> may exclude tracing the condition cells, since the condition cells should have already been satisfied for the result cell to be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">In an embodiment, the tracing mechanism includes a tracing buffer. The tracing buffer may be described as a persistent storage medium that stores business data that may have resulted from tracing, at regular instances of the business process. While tracing multiple business rules, multiple sets of process-path may need to be traced. Instead of establishing a connection with database <b>126</b> for each process-path traced, a tracing buffer may be used to temporarily store the traced data, and based upon a completion of tracing of all the business rules associated with the business process, the tracing buffer may establish a communication with database <b>126</b> to persist the entire collection of data in database <b>126</b>. The method of using the tracing buffer may reduce the utilization of business processing unit <b>104</b> for transferring the data during mass processing.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">The tracing mechanism thus applied generates a trace-resultant by tracing the process-path of the computed process-resultant. The trace-resultant is persisted into database <b>126</b> by path tracing engine <b>128</b>. In an embodiment, the trace-resultant is regarded as encoded business information, since the traced business data is not directly available for analysis. In other words, the mechanism of tracing involves tracing the key-string of business objects and/or business rules, rather than tracing the enormous business information that is persisted in the business object and/or business rule involved in computing a process-resultant for the business process.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">Further, trace parser <b>130</b> retrieves the persisted trace-resultant, which is a minimal amount of data compared to the enormous business data involved in computing the process-resultant, and parses the trace-resultant to derive a business definition for the traced business objects and business rules involved in computing the process-resultant. Parsing generally involves detecting, evaluating and explaining or demonstrating the traces involved in the process-path. During parsing, all the business logic involved during tracing is applied again to decode the encoded business data. For instance, while performing tracing, minimal amount of data is considered to provide an understanding of the business logic involved in computing the process-resultant. To execute the process of parsing, the encoded business information needs to be decoded to derive a complete set of business information of the process-path followed to compute the process-resultant.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">While parsing, trace parser <b>130</b> determines the versioned business objects and business information of the key-strings traced by path-tracing engine, to derive a business definition for the traced business objects and/or business rules involved in computing the process-resultant. To derive the business definition, trace parser <b>130</b> determines the key-identifier and the key-value included in the key-string of each traced business object. Based upon the key-identifier, trace parser <b>130</b> determines the business information corresponding to the traced business object. Based upon the key-value, trace parser <b>130</b> determines a business input received for the corresponding traced business object. Further, trace parser <b>130</b> determines one or more versioned business objects that are associated with the key-string of the corresponding traced business object.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">Compiler <b>132</b> compiles the versioned business objects, the key-identifier and the key-value of each traced business object, and the business information comprised in each traced business object to derive a business definition for the corresponding traced business object. Compiler <b>132</b> may be responsible for translating the encoded business data into computer readable information that can be executed to derive the business definition. Further, compiler <b>132</b> evaluates the business definition to identify the business objects involved in computing the process-resultant, and maps the business information present in the business definition to the corresponding business objects and business rules. Complier <b>132</b> also maps the versioned business objects to the original business objects and the corresponding business rules. Compiler <b>132</b> generates a comprehensive trace-map including the business definition, the business information, the versioned business objects and the business objects and business rules involved in computing the process-resultant. The comprehensive trace-map may be described as a resultant of the evaluation of the process-resultant and demonstration of the trace-resultant. The comprehensive trace-map thus provides an explanation of the process of computing the process-resultant of an executed business process. The comprehensive trace-map describes the processing of the business rules, including the inputs, the processing steps and the output of the business rules, along with the business objects involved in the computation, their relationships with each other, and their dependencies. Business processor <b>114</b> may display the comprehensive trace-map as a UI element <b>134</b> on UI <b>102</b>. This trace-map may be utilized for further business analysis to make business decisions.</p>
