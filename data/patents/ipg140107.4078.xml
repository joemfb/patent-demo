<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to overlay printing in which a form and text data are printed in such a manner that the text data is overlaid on the form.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In service systems for printing forms, such as &#x201c;written estimates&#x201d; and &#x201c;written applications&#x201d;, editing and approval processing is often performed on printed paper.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">After paper is printed, necessary information such as personal information may be filled in a specific region of the paper.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, in the case of printing forms, a large number of sheets of thin paper may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Printing techniques employing transparent recording materials are generally categorized into &#x201c;techniques for performing printing on a print object&#x201d; represented by (1) and (2) and a &#x201c;technique for applying gloss to a printed material&#x201d; represented by (3). Transparent recording materials have a characteristic of adding a colorless and transparent image having no pigment and are typified by transparent (clear) toners and transparent (clear) ink.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">(1) Waterproofing processing is performed by coating a surface of a recording medium with transparent surface treatment liquid so that a recorded image is not degraded due to bleeding or leakage of recording ink ejected from a recording head of an inkjet recording apparatus (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 01-085766).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">(2) An ink receptive layer having an excellent transparency is formed in a necessary portion of a sheet base material such as a plastic film or a plastic card so that inkjet ink printing can be performed (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-223762).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">(3) The glossiness of an image region where an image or a letter is formed in a printed material is changed by using a transparent toner that can provide an appropriate gloss or by adding a member for increasing the gloss to the image region (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2007-052175).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, when a user writes letters with a fountain pen on a thin sheet of paper, ink may bleed through to the back of the sheet of paper. Thus, a phenomenon called &#x201c;strike through&#x201d; in which ink is adhered to another sheet of paper or a desk under the sheet of paper may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As described above, depending on the combination of the type of paper and the type of a writing material used by a user, strike through in which ink bleeds through to the back of the paper may occur.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention can prevent occurrence of strike through, irrespective of the combination of the type of paper and the type of a writing material used by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A printing method according to an aspect of the present invention for performing printing of paper having a user entry field, which is a region into which a user performs writing after printing is performed, includes setting a transparent recording material setting for the user entry field; and causing a printing unit to perform recording, by using a transparent recording material, for the user entry field for which the transparent recording material setting has been set.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, a transparent recording material setting is set for a user entry field for which recording using a transparent recording material has been instructed, and recording using the transparent recording material can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, in the printing method, when it is determined that data is to be printed in the user entry field, the transparent recording material setting is automatically released. Thus, occurrence of strike through in which ink bleeds through to the back of the paper can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, in the printing method, since recording using the transparent recording material need not be performed for regions outside of the user entry field, consumption of the transparent recording material can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment of the present invention, printing is performed by overlaying text data on a form created by a form creation apparatus. Such printing processing is called &#x201c;overlay printing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">General overlay printing will be explained first.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">First, a form creation apparatus creates a form. A laser printer or the like having a function of creating a form is used to create a form.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A configuration including frames and the like in a form is registered in advance as form information in a form information file.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The form information is created by a form information design system.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In general, the form information includes a form pattern, which is a fixed pattern not depending on field data; and a field pattern, which is a pattern indicating received field data in accordance with a designated output format.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, text data to be input into a form is created. The text data includes field data to be input into a designated region of the form. Then, when the field data is input into the form and is printed, print data in which the field data is overlaid on the form created from the form information is created and then is printed as an output form. Printing the form and the field data in such a manner that the field data is overlaid on the form is called &#x201c;overlay printing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">This printing method is used, for example, for creating forms.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a central processing unit (CPU) <b>105</b> controls an operation of the entire computer system in accordance with a control program stored in a central storage (CS) <b>106</b>.</p>
