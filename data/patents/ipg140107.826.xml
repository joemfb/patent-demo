<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention is in the field of mounting systems for televisions to be wall-mounted or carried on a base (console).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The introduction of so-called flat panel televisions has added additional complexity to the task of the purchaser to support the television on a suitable stand or to mount it from a wall or above a console. As used herein televisions should be understood to include monitors without tuners and televisions with built in tuners. Although referred to as flat panel televisions, many of these devices have substantial depth and may weigh up to 165 lbs or more. Flat panel televisions (referred to herein as panel televisions) represent a substantial investment for the purchaser and therefore mounting them without damaging them during the installation or thereafter, is a major concern.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Panel television manufacturers normally make a bracket system to mount the panel television on a wall. However, purchasers may prefer to use a stand, or to position the panel television on a console. For that reason mounting systems are frequently sold separately. This forces the panel television retailer to carry a large inventory of incompatible mounting systems, or to leave the consumer to purchase the mounting system directly from the manufacturer. A purchase direct from the manufacturer forces the consumer to wait for an extended period while the mounting system is shipped and leads to dissatisfaction with the retailer for not stocking the mounting system for the panel television purchased</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prior art mounting systems require a high degree of skill in mounting the system to the wall or other support and then securing the television on the mount. The resulting installation is likely (as a consequence of stud position) to be offset from the ideal position. Additionally the manufacture's system normally provides only one mode of mounting, such as wall mount or stand mount.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore desirable to have a universal television support and mounting kit that accommodates the principal varieties of televisions that have to be mounted, namely CRT type, and two panel types (plasma and LCD), in a single kit. It is especially to be desired to have a kit that allows the consumer to employ any of the three modes of support, namely stand mount, console mount and wall mount.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A kit according to the exemplary embodiment of the invention resolves the deficiencies of prior art solutions in a kit that provides all forms of mounting televisions in a single kit. The components are designed to be economical of manufacture and ease of assembly with common tools. By the assembly of the provided components, the user can elect to support a wide range of televisions on a console, suspended above a support, or mounted to a wall. Kit components are designed to be used in as many of the different configurations as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The kit incorporates components for a console with multiple shelves carried on shelf supports. A short spine is provided for use when the console is to be used to support a television on a stand on the upper shelf. The short spine has mounting openings that engage the shelf supports and extends between the floor, or lowest shelf support, to the level of the upper most shelf support. A console with three shelves, and therefore three shelf supports, is described as exemplary. The short spine connects to the shelf supports to increase the weight carrying capacity of the shelves and transfer the weight to the floor. Using the short spine allows the user to assemble a console with an upper surface that can carry a conventional (CRT) television or a panel television with a stand. The spine is preferably of a rectangular hollow cross-section. The use of a rectangular configuration allows more of the spine to be in contact with the shelf supports than would a circular cross-section, for example. The spine has a plurality of openings in it's rear surface. Because the spine is hollow, these openings permit wires and cabling to be run internally between, for example, electronic equipment on the shelves and the panel television, thus preventing entanglement of the wires and cables and improving the finished appearance of the installation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The kit also includes a long spine, horizontal offset support arm (offset arm) with a panel television mounting structure on the arm. In one configuration, the long spine is used instead of the short spine. Since it attaches to the shelf supports, it provides for the transfer of loads carried on the shelves, but in addition extends above the console to provide an elevated support for a panel television. The offset arm extends horizontally forward (as mounted) to suspend the panel television over the console base and give the panel a floating appearance. The offset support incorporates an offset arm that carries a mounting structure. In one embodiment, the mounting structure has a spaced structural support with a hole pattern that provides mounting openings for mating the structure to the rear of a panel television. In the exemplary embodiment the mounting structure is in the form of a mounting plate but could be formed, for example, of spaced radial arms. Many panel televisions, especially LCD panel televisions contain hard points with threaded holes with standard spacing (the VESA standard). The mounting structure has openings matching the VESA standard so that the structure is easily bolted to the television to carry the television above the console.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Spacing the mounting structure and therefore the television forward of the spine, allows for the incorporation of pivoting and titling mechanisms in the offset arm. The offset arm incorporates mating tilting brackets that are hinged together at their upper ends and free for limited pivoting rotation at the lower ends. This allows the installed panel television to be aimed down to face the level at which the television will be viewed (such as at the level of facing chairs or other furniture). The tilting mechanism is locked in the selected position with fasteners at the lower end of the tilting brackets. The offset arm has a pivot mount at its outer end that cooperates with a pivot mount on the mounting structure to constrain a pivot pin. The pivot mounts collectively provide for pivoting the panel television about a substantially vertical axis so that the television can be turned to face the viewing area or to avoid glare.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another embodiment of the mounting structure and another component of the kit is a XYZ frame. The term XYZ frame, or mounting frame, refers to a frame that is adjustable in 3 dimensions, and is commonly used in the industry to refer to a frame that can accommodate a wide range of non-standard hole patterns and which spaces the panel television from the mount. The frame is designed so that it can be used in conjunction with the offset arm, or for directly mounting a panel television to a wall. The XYZ frame is useful for larger panel televisions and those which don't use a standard mounting hole pattern. These panel televisions may also be heavier and therefore, without special provisions, lifting and attaching the television to a mounting device would difficult or impossible for the average consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The mounting frame incorporates two spaced channels, with U-shaped cross-section, that are oriented to be horizontal when mounted. The channels lie in a plane. The channels are formed with a center web and two sides arranged at right angles to the web. The webs have spaced holes along their length. At least one rail is carried on the frame. In the exemplary embodiment two rails are provided. The rails lie in a second plane spaced horizontally from the first plane. This spacing permits the panel television to be easily lifted and attached as will be described. The channels and rails are joined together in a unitary structure by vertical elements that extend between and are secured to the rails. In the exemplary embodiment the vertical elements and rails are comprised of rectangular tube stock which provides the necessary rigidity at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The connection of the frame to the television is made through panel mounting brackets. These brackets are not interconnected so that they can be positioned anywhere along the back of the panel television to connect to the threaded holes in hard points on the back of the panel television. They can desirably be formed of stock similar to the channels and include parallel sides and a right angularly related connecting web. The web has multiple spaced holes along its length. The web is placed against the panel television and fasteners are passed through the holes to secure the brackets to the panel television. Each bracket has secured to it at least one, and preferably two rail engagement hooks. Where two hooks are employed they are spaced the same distance apart as are the rails on the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For mounting the XYZ frame on an offset arm with a mounting plate fitted, the holes on the mounting plate are aligned with holes on the channels and then secured together with fasteners. Then the panel television, with the panel mounting brackets installed, is lifted into position. The hooks are received over the rails and the television lowered into position. The panel television is then free to pivot and tilt as in a Vesa-standard mounted television.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The same XYZ frame can be employed to wall-mount a panel television. In a wall mount, the channels are secured to the wall. Normally it is necessary to locate a pair of studs to insure that connection between the wall and frame is sufficiently strong to support the frame and panel television. Standard and non-standard stud spacing is accommodated because the channels extend across the full width of the frame and have multiple spaced holes. After the frame is securely mounted to the wall through the frame channels, the panel television can be lifted so that the engagement hooks pass over the rails and then are lowered with the panel television to engage and be supported from the rails. The rails are longer than all but the largest televisions and therefore, the television may be moved horizontally on the rails to center it perfectly relative to, for example, a wall alcove. Stops prevent movement beyond the ends of the rails.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In both the wall-mount and offset arm mount of the frame, the security of the connection between the panel television and mount structure is enhanced by a removable latch which is inserted through the vertical channel members above the hooks so that the hooks cannot be lifted off of the rails.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention as described has advantages for the consumer and the retailer. For the retailer, stocking the kit avoids having to stock multiple disparate kits, avoids creating a customer service burden and helps the consumer select the right kit, and avoids restocking costs when kits are returned. For the consumer the kit satisfies the mounting requirements for virtually any television that the consumer might initially use it with, and any television that the consumer may acquire in the future. The console may be assembled and used alone with a conventional CRT television, or with a panel mount on a stand. Then later when the consumer acquires a Vesa standard LCD television, for example, the consumer can substitute the long spine and offset arm and suspend the panel television above the console. Should the consumer later acquire a still larger television, or prefer wall mounting, the XYZ frame can be used. The kit incorporates multi-purpose components to reduce the parts count. All components can be broken down to lie flat for shipping and storage in the minimum space. The kit provides for a floating appearance of the panel television above a console and this visual effect is enhanced by being able to hide the wires and cables within the support. Wall mounting is accomplished with minimum need to &#x201c;work behind&#x201d; the panel television because the panel television is merely lifted on the rails and supported without having to manipulate additional fasteners. The use of two engagement hooks on each bracket prevents the panel television from swinging from the upper rail before it is secured by other means.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated a console base <b>10</b> carrying a plasma panel television <b>12</b> using an XYZ frame <b>14</b> connection to the panel television through panel brackets <b>15</b> and <b>18</b>. The panel brackets incorporated rail engagement hooks <b>110</b>. When supporting the panel <b>12</b>, the hooks <b>110</b> are received over rails <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. Limited left and right movement of the panel television on the frame is possible until the hooks engage the stops <b>113</b>. The frame is carried by the offset arm <b>21</b> through the mounting structure which comprises a mounting plate <b>16</b>. The mounting plate <b>16</b> is connected by pivot bearing <b>19</b> and the offset arm <b>21</b> to the long spine <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Spine <b>22</b>, in combination with the side panels <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>, supports the television <b>12</b> and the shelf supports <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> (partially visible). The shelf supports in turn carry the shelves <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. The spine <b>22</b> contains the wire and cable openings <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the same console base <b>10</b>, supporting a LCD television <b>44</b> that has four standard hard points with threaded bores <b>46</b>. These bores match up with a set of four holes on the plate <b>16</b> so that the panel television is supported directly from the plate <b>16</b> by inserting fasteners <b>47</b> into the bores.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The VESA Standard currently calls for all LCD televisions to have at least four hard points and threaded holes positioned at the corners of a rectangular shape with distances between the holes being:</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">75 mm&#xd7;75 mm</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">100 mm&#xd7;100 mm</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">400 mm&#xd7;200 mm</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The plate <b>16</b> has holes to accommodate LCD televisions with all of those hole patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the details of the structure for the console <b>10</b>, which incorporates side panels <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>. The upper members <b>52</b> of the side panels support the upper shelf supports <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. The lower members <b>58</b> of the side panels support the console from the floor and support the lowermost shelf support <b>28</b>. The illustrated console is shown assembled with the short spine <b>62</b> which is bolted to the shelf supports <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> and so cooperates with the side panels <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> to support weight carried on the upper shelves to the lower shelf support <b>28</b> and the floor on which the console rests.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the primary structural components of an exemplary form of the kit including the short spine <b>62</b> and long spine <b>22</b>. As will appear, the spines <b>22</b>, <b>62</b> each have a series of spaced fastener openings <b>64</b> which permit the spines to be secured to the shelf supports and a series of spaced shelf slits <b>66</b> which accommodate that portion of the shelves that overlie the shelf supports. The side panels <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are part of the kit as are the shelves <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. A single shelf support <b>28</b> is representative of the three shelf supports in the full kit. The offset mount <b>20</b> is included. The illustrated offset mount <b>20</b> is one without the tilt mechanism but includes the mounting plate <b>16</b>, the pivot bearing <b>19</b> and the offset arm <b>21</b>, with vertical flanges <b>70</b> and horizontal flanges <b>72</b> for connection to the long spine <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A panel bracket <b>15</b> with engagement hooks <b>110</b> is representative of the two brackets that are part of the kit. The XYZ frame <b>14</b> is included for mounting larger televisions, televisions with non-standard hole patterns and for wall mounting.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The kit may alternatively or additionally include a tilting offset mount and a tilting XYZ frame to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a front view of a console and long spine <b>22</b>. The installation is shown configured for use with a panel television to be carried on an XYZ frame mount <b>14</b>. The panel brackets <b>15</b> and <b>18</b> are shown in position over, and carried by, the rails <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. The panel television, which would be attached to the brackets <b>15</b> and <b>18</b> is not shown for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the details of the XYZ frame mount <b>14</b>. The rails <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are of square tubular stock and are interconnected by frame elements <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> also of tubular stock. The rails and frame elements are desirably joined by welding to eliminate the need for the consumer to assemble them. A frame produced using tubular stock is as stiff as a continuous formed plate of the same size, but much less expensive to produce. Open face channels <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> bridge behind the rails and frame elements and have a series of openings of which holes <b>88</b> are representative. The open face of the channels is presented forwardly so that the consumer has access to insert and tighten lag bolts <b>77</b> that penetrate into the studs <b>87</b>A or other solid structure of the wall <b>87</b>. The holes <b>88</b> are elongated so that the lag bolts can be precisely aligned with the studs. These same channels are used to secure the frame mount <b>14</b> to the mounting plate <b>16</b> of the gooseneck mount <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A locking bar <b>89</b> is shown partially inserted in holes <b>91</b>. The bar is fully inserted after a panel television and brackets is received over the rails <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. The locking bar <b>89</b> prevents the panel television from being lifted or jarred off of the rails (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a detailed view of the offset mount with the details of the tilt mount illustrated. The offset arm <b>21</b> is shown secured to the spine <b>22</b> by the flanges <b>70</b> and supports the pivot bearing <b>19</b>. The pivot bearing <b>19</b> is made of a pivot pin <b>103</b> (not shown) fixedly attached to the holder <b>90</b>. The pivot pin is <b>103</b> received in a bearing receptacle <b>92</b>. Tilt brackets <b>94</b> and <b>96</b> have overlapping flanges <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> and are hinged together at their upper ends by a horizontal hinge pin <b>98</b> received through the flanges <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. The amount of pivoting is selected by rotating the hinge shaft <b>100</b> to frictionally hold the brackets in a fixed relative position as will appear in greater detail by an examination of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the bracket flanges <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> which cooperate with slot <b>106</b> and hinge shaft <b>100</b> to limit the total range of tilting to a safe amount so that if the panel television moves the mount under the force of gravity and with insufficient friction developed by the shaft <b>100</b>, then the total titling movement will be limited to an amount such that the television won't contact the spine or the wall <b>87</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a top view of the offset mount <b>20</b> and shows the pin <b>103</b> in the holder <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an exemplary panel bracket <b>15</b>. The panel bracket <b>15</b> has a series of holes <b>111</b> which allow it to adapt to virtually any hole spacing on a panel television. The mounting is accomplished through a spacer <b>108</b> selected for proper length, such as spacer <b>108</b> to insure that the rear of the panel television (such as a television with a curved back) doesn't interfere with the rails and engagement hooks <b>110</b>, when the panel television is placed over the rails on the XYZ frame.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 10A</figref>, show an alternative embodiment for the XYZ mount with a titling mechanism, which uses tilting panel brackets <b>128</b> for mounting to the rear of a panel television. A rail hook flange <b>134</b> has hooks <b>135</b> received over the rails <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. The hook flange <b>134</b> has right angular related sides <b>136</b> with an arcuate slot <b>138</b>. A panel television is carried on brackets <b>132</b>. A handle <b>140</b> is inserted through slot <b>138</b> in flange <b>136</b> and is threaded into the bracket <b>132</b>. When the handle <b>140</b> is tightened, the handle <b>140</b> bears up against the flange <b>136</b> and frictionally engages it so that the brackets <b>132</b> are held in a desired angular relationship to the frame. As will appear the tilt brackets may be used on a long spine <b>22</b> and offset arm <b>21</b>. The tilt brackets also function when the XYZ frame is mounted on a wall <b>87</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the details of the tilting brackets of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 10A</figref>. The slot <b>138</b> accommodates bolts <b>150</b> with carry a guide <b>151</b>. The bolts <b>150</b> and a third bolt <b>152</b> are received in the bracket <b>128</b>. They act as stops for the tilting movement of a panel television carried on the brackets <b>132</b> so that the range of travel does not exceed a safe amount. The selected angle is locked in by operating of the handle <b>140</b> which frictionally engages the hook flange <b>136</b> and draws the bracket <b>132</b> into frictional engagement with the hook flange.</p>
