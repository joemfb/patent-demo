<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/240,957, entitled &#x201c;Method For Simultaneous Reception of FLO and FLO-EV Waveforms In a Device&#x201d; filed on Sep. 9, 2009, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The continued development and implementation of wireless communications systems has made it possible to transmit a large amount of data over a radio frequency (RF) air interface. There are a number of technologies that can be used to broadcast video and other programming from a central location to a receiver device. Forward Link Only (FLO) is an example of a transmission methodology that uses a radio frequency (RF) air interface to broadcast video and other programming from one or more central locations to one or more receiver devices. The basic structure of a transmission block in FLO is referred to as a &#x201c;superframe.&#x201d; In one implementation, a superframe contains 1200 MAC time units and has a duration of one (1) second. A superframe contains pilot, control and data frames. Typically, four data frames, each containing one or both of wide-area and local-area data are part of a superframe.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The FLO methodology has been improved to increase bandwidth and data carrying capability. The enhanced FLO system is referred to as FLO-EV. The enhanced FLO-EV system introduced additional physical layer transmit modes and allows additional services and capacity to be carried on the FLO network. In addition, it is also possible to increase the bandwidth of such networks by using multiple radio frequency (RF) channels over which to transport the FLO and the FLO-EV data.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As used herein the term FLO transmitter and FLO receiver refers to transmitters and receivers that are compliant with Revisions 0 and A of TIA-1099. The term FLO-EV and FLO-EV receiver refers to transmitters and receivers that are compliant with Revision B of TIA 1099. In particular, a FLO-EV multicast logical channel (MLC) is an MLC that is compliant with Revision B of TIA 1099, but not compliant with earlier releases. A FLO-EV MLC is either a physical layer type 2 (PHY Type 2) MLC that is encoded with a turbo code that spans the bits in the 4 frames of a superframe, or a physical layer type 1 (PHY Type 1) MLC that is encoded similarly to Rev A of TIA-1099 but that has a different trailer and OIS (overhead information symbol) location record structure to allow a larger peak rate on the MLC.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the physical layer coding structure of FLO-EV is different from that of FLO, thereby introducing challenges when attempting to receive both FLO and FLO-EV data in a single device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it would be desirable to allow both FLO and FLO-EV data to be received and decoded by the same device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the invention include a system for receiving data, comprising a receiver configured to receive a radio frequency communication signal comprising at least one superframe, the at least one superframe having at least a first data stream and a second data stream encoded therein, wherein the receiver decodes at least one of the first data stream and the second data stream.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other embodiments are also provided. Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the invention will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The system and method for the simultaneous reception of FLO and FLO-EV data will be described in the context of a receiver in a portable communication device having the ability to receive and discriminate between multiple data streams on a single radio frequency (RF) channel or on multiple RF channels.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The system and method for the simultaneous reception of FLO and FLO-EV data can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. When implemented in hardware, the system and method for the simultaneous reception of FLO and FLO-EV data can be implemented using specialized hardware elements and logic. When portions of the system and method for the simultaneous reception of FLO and FLO-EV data are implemented in software, the software can be used to control the various components in a receiver of a portable communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The software can be stored in a memory and executed by a suitable instruction execution system (microprocessor). The hardware portion of the system and method for the simultaneous reception of FLO and FLO-EV data can include any or a combination of the following technologies, which are all well known in the art: discrete electronic components, a discrete logic circuit(s) having logic gates for implementing logic functions upon data signals, an application specific integrated circuit having appropriate logic gates, a programmable gate array(s) (PGA), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The software for the system and method for the simultaneous reception of FLO and FLO-EV data comprises an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions, and can be embodied in any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the context of this document, a &#x201c;computer-readable medium&#x201d; can be any means that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer readable medium can be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection (electronic) having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette (magnetic), a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory) (magnetic), an optical fiber (optical), and a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM) (optical). Note that the computer-readable medium could even be paper or another suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via for instance, optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted or otherwise processed in a suitable manner if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the basic elements of a forward link only (FLO) network. The flow network <b>100</b> comprises a network operations center <b>102</b> one or more flow transmitters <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, a reverse link <b>152</b> and one or more portable communication devices <b>200</b>. In an embodiment, the network operations center <b>102</b> comprises a national operations center <b>104</b> and a local operations center <b>106</b>. The national operations center <b>104</b> provides a national multiplex distribution stream over connection <b>108</b> to the local operations center <b>106</b>. The connection <b>108</b> can be any high capacity communications channel.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The network operations center <b>102</b> receives content from a number of different sources over a number of different paths. Content may include, but is not limited to, data, audio, video, television programming, or other content. For example, the national operations center <b>104</b> can receive national content from a content provider <b>124</b> directly over a connection <b>126</b>. The connection <b>126</b> can be a direct physical connection, a wireless connection or any other connection over which content can be provided to the national operations center <b>104</b>. Alternatively, the national operations center <b>104</b> can receive national content from a content provider <b>116</b> over a network <b>122</b>. The network <b>122</b> can be any of a wide area, a local area, or any other communications network over which content can be received over connection <b>118</b> from the content provider <b>116</b> and provided over connection <b>123</b> to the national operations center <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Similarly, the local operations center <b>106</b> can receive local content directly from a content provider <b>136</b> over connection <b>138</b>. The connection <b>138</b> can be similar to the connection <b>126</b>. Alternatively, the local operations center <b>106</b> can receive local content from a content provider <b>128</b> over the network <b>122</b> via connection <b>134</b>. National content is content that can be provided to all portable communication devices <b>200</b>, while local content is content that can be provided to a subset of all portable communication devices based on geographical location.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The network operations center provides the content to a wireless broadcast network embodied by transmitters <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>. The transmitters <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> are intended to illustrate the entire infrastructure used to receive a terrestrial-based communication signal over connections <b>146</b> and <b>148</b>, and to provide a wireless transmission to the portable communication device <b>200</b>. While the details of the FLO network are known to those having ordinary skill in the art, it should be mentioned that the FLO network is a diversity-type network in which multiple transmitters (e.g., transmitters <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>) are used to send multiple signals having identical content from a number of transmitters to each portable device <b>200</b>. The portable communication device <b>200</b> comprises any mobile or portable communication device, such as, for example, a cell phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless television receiver, or any other portable communication device. The portable communication device <b>200</b> includes a receiver configured to receive the FLO transmission from the transmitters <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>. Further, it is possible for the transmission to occur from the transmitters <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> to the portable communication device <b>200</b> using more than one RF channel. As an example, FLO data can be carried over a first RF channel having a first radio frequency, FLO-EV data can be carried over a second RF channel having a second radio frequency, and both FLO and FLO-EV data can be carried on a third RF channel.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The portable communication device <b>200</b> is also coupled to the national operations center <b>104</b> via a reverse link <b>152</b>. In an embodiment, the reverse link <b>152</b> can be a 3G, or a 4G wireless communication channel provided by a cellular communication carrier or provider. The reverse link <b>152</b> allows the portable communication device <b>200</b> to submit registration and authentication information to the national operations center <b>104</b> so that the portable communication device <b>200</b> receives the appropriate content. However, it should be mentioned that the transmission of content from the network operations center, via the FLO transmitters <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>, to the portable communication device <b>200</b> are one way only.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a portion of a receiver of the portable communication device <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The receiver portion <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates only the basic components of a receiver within the portable communication device <b>200</b>. Details of a receiver are known to those having ordinary skill in the art. The receiver portion <b>210</b> receives a radio frequency (RF) signal over connection <b>212</b>. The received RF signal is provided to a channel filter <b>212</b>, which filters the received RF signal to develop a signal on connection <b>215</b> at the desired receive frequency. The RF signal on connection <b>215</b> is an analog signal that has undergone initial receiver processing, which may also include one or more of switching, low noise amplification or other front end receiver processing to prepare the RF signal for decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The signal on connection <b>215</b> is provided to a downconverter <b>216</b>. The downconverter <b>216</b> translates the signal on connection <b>215</b> from an RF signal to either an intermediate frequency (IF) or to baseband, or near-baseband if the receiver is implemented as a direct conversion receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The signal on connection <b>217</b> is provided to a DC offset correction element <b>218</b>, which corrects for any DC offset imparted to the signal in connection <b>217</b>. The output of the DC offset correction element <b>218</b> is provided over connection <b>221</b> to an automatic gain control (AGC) element <b>222</b>. The AGC element <b>222</b> adjusts the gain of the signal on connection <b>221</b> and provides a gain adjusted signal on connection <b>224</b>. The AGC element <b>222</b> may comprises one or more analog and/or digital gain stages and can also convert the analog signal on connection <b>221</b> to a digital signal on connection <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The output on connection <b>224</b> is provided to an automatic frequency control (AFC) element <b>226</b>. The AFC element <b>226</b> stabilizes the frequency of the signal on connection <b>224</b> and provides an output over connection <b>227</b> to the FFT element <b>228</b>. The FFT element <b>228</b> provides a data output over connection <b>229</b> and provides a pilot symbol output over connection <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The data output of the FFT element <b>228</b> on connection <b>229</b> is provided to a log likelihood ratio (LLR) generator <b>232</b>, which performs signal processing to determine the accuracy of the received data stream, and provides the data output to a turbo decoding element (not shown), and other processing elements over connection <b>234</b>. The pilot symbol signal provided on connection <b>231</b> is provided to a channel estimate (CE) element <b>242</b>. The CE element <b>242</b> provides the pilot symbol and estimate of the channel energy for each symbol over connection <b>244</b> to the LLR generator <b>232</b> and also provides an estimate of the channel energy for each symbol over connection <b>246</b>. A memory <b>252</b> is coupled to the LLR generator <b>232</b> over connection <b>254</b>. The memory can be used to store the information on connections <b>229</b> and <b>244</b>, and can be used to store the software for the system and method for signaling overhead information in a network.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of a superframe <b>300</b> suitable for carrying FLO and FLO-EV data over one or more RF channels. In an embodiment, the superframe <b>300</b> can be assembled by the network operations center <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for transmission to the portable communication device <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The superframe <b>300</b> comprises a preamble portion <b>310</b> that comprises pilot and OIS (overhead information symbol) information, frames <b>320</b> and <b>330</b>, and portion <b>340</b>, which includes positional pilot channel (PPC) <b>342</b> and signaling parameter channel (SPC) <b>344</b> as overhead information. The SPC <b>344</b> includes two bits that are used to indicate the physical device type (PHY Type 1 or PHY Type 2) for the particular radio frequency (RF), and includes two bits to indicate PPC status. By indicating the physical device type in the SPC <b>344</b> for the particular RF, the portable communication device <b>200</b> can determine whether it can receive and decode the contents of that particular RF.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The SPC <b>344</b> indicates a radio frequency (RF) type so that the portable communication device <b>200</b> uses the SPC <b>344</b> to set decoding registers prior to moving to a different RF channel. The decoding registers can be registers <b>223</b>, <b>225</b>, <b>233</b> and <b>235</b> associated with the AGC element <b>222</b>, AFC element <b>226</b>, FFT element <b>228</b> and LLR generator <b>232</b>, respectively. Further, additional registers will be associated with other decoder processing elements (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The PPC <b>342</b> includes PPC presence bits that the portable communication device <b>200</b> uses to determine whether PPC symbols are broadcast on an RF channel prior to decoding the RF channel. The SPC bits and PPC presence bits are part of the control channel (in the ENDM message to be described below) as well as in the SPC <b>344</b>. The portable communication device <b>200</b> received and decodes the control channel to determine whether a new RF contains a PPC channel that should be considered. Two (2) bits in the SPC <b>344</b> also indicate in the PPC <b>342</b> is present or absent in that particular RF channel on which the SPC <b>344</b> is carried.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The PPC status allows the portable communication device <b>200</b> to determine whether the PPC status information may be available on the current RF channel, thus allowing the portable communication device <b>200</b> to determine whether it can use the PPC information for location determination or another purpose without needing a turbo decoder for decoding the OIS SystemParameters message. In addition, the portable communication device <b>200</b> can read the OIS information <b>500</b> and determine whether PPC location information are broadcast or not. Although four (4) frames are included in a superframe <b>300</b>, only frames one (1) and four (4) are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for simplicity of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, the PHY Type of an RF channel and PPC information can be listed in an extended neighbor description message (ENDM) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to provide the device with prior knowledge of the encoding of other RF channels in the same local-area operational infrastructure (LOI), or of the RF channels in neighboring LOIs. An LOI is identified by the Infrastructure ID value (field <b>522</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in the Local OIS. An LOI is the smallest geographic area over which the same set of multiplexed signals are broadcast over the exact same RF channels in the same manner. Thus, obtaining the ENDM and FDM and EFDM in the current LOI is sufficient to determine on which RF channel a flow is broadcast in the current LOI. The ENDM carries the mapping between RF_IDs used in the FDM and EFDM to identify RF channels, and physical RF channels characterized by the SPC parameters. The same content may be broadcast in two neighboring LOIs. If such is the case, then the LOI ID is a geographical identifier and can be used, for example, to determine whether certain channels are blacked out. Details of the fields in an ENDM are shown below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The preamble <b>310</b> comprises 18 OFDM symbols, e.g., in 4K FFT mode in which TDM pilot channels occupy the first four symbols and a wide area transition pilot channel (WTPC) occupies the fifth symbol. The next five symbols are divided among wide area FDM pilot and wide area OIS information. The wide area OIS information portion includes a system parameters message <b>500</b>, which will be described in greater detail below. The following two symbols comprise wide area transition pilot channel (WTPC) information and local area transition pilot channel (LTPC) information, while the following five symbols are divided between local area FDM pilot information and local area OIS information. The local area OIS information portion also includes a system parameters message <b>505</b>, similar to the systems parameter message <b>500</b>, for local OIS information. The following symbol comprises a local area transition pilot channel (LTPC).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Frames one through four are similar in structure so only frame one, <b>320</b>, will be described in detail. Frame one, <b>320</b>, comprises a wide area transition pilot channel (WTPC) <b>321</b> occupying a first symbol, &#x201c;W&#x201d; symbols comprising wide area FDM pilot information <b>322</b> and wide area FDM data <b>324</b>, a single OFDM symbol comprising WTPC information <b>326</b>, a single OFDM symbol comprising LTPC information <b>328</b>, &#x201c;L&#x201d; OFDM symbols comprising local area FDM pilot information <b>322</b> and local area FDM data <b>334</b>, followed by a single OFDM symbol <b>336</b> comprising the LTPC.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The superframe <b>300</b> can comprise both wide area and local area data, depending on system application. Further, in an embodiment, the superframe <b>300</b> can comprise both FLO and FLO-EV data. A FLO-EV multicast logical channel (MLC) is an MLC that is compliant with Revision B of TIA 1099, but not compliant with earlier releases. A FLO-EV MLC is either a physical layer type 2 (PHY Type 2) MLC that is encoded with a turbo code that spans the bits in the 4 frames of a superframe, or a physical layer type 1 (PHY Type 1) MLC that is encoded similarly to Rev A of TIA-1099 but that has a different trailer and OIS (overhead information symbol) location record structure to allow a larger peak rate on the MLC. A device capable of receiving PHY type 1 is able to decode transmit modes specific to PHY Type 1 transport. Similarly, a device capable of receiving PHY type 2 is able to decode transmit modes specific to PHY Type 2 transport. A PHY Type 1 transmit mode carries the data in what is referred to as a PHY Type 1 multicast logical channel (MLC) and a PHY Type 2 transmit mode carries the data in a PHY type 2 MLC. The term &#x201c;transmit mode&#x201d; refers to the transmit scheme used to send information from the transmitters <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, to the portable communication device <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A PHY Type 1 transmit mode generally uses a first set of RF carrier frequencies and a PHY Type 2 transmit mode generally uses a second set of RF carrier frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A PHY Type 1 transmit mode may be used to send the superframe <b>300</b> containing FLO data to a portable communication device <b>200</b>; a PHY Type 2 transmit mode may used to send the superframe <b>300</b> containing FLO-EV data to a portable communication device <b>200</b>; and PHY Type 1 and PHY Type 2 transmit modes may be used to send the superframe <b>300</b> containing FLO data and FLO-EV data to a portable communication device <b>200</b>. Further, FLO data and FLO-EV data can be transported in the same superframe or in different superframes, only FLO data can be transported in a superframe, and only FLO-EV data can be transported in a superframe.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A portable communication device <b>200</b> can be implemented in a variety of ways to receive any or all of FLO and FLO-EV data in either or both of a PHY Type 1 transmit mode or a PHY Type 2 transmit mode, whether in the same superframe or in different superframes. In an embodiment, and for example purposes only, the portable communication device <b>200</b> can be considered a class 1 device that can receive and decode FLO data; a class 2 device that can receive and decode FLO-EV data; a class 3 device that can receive and decode FLO data and FLO-EV data in separate superframes, i.e., the device can either decode the FLO data being broadcast or the FLO-EV data being broadcast, but not both, in one superframe; and a class 4 device that can receive and decode FLO data and FLO-EV data in the same superframe. Further, it is also possible that an implementation may be such that the PHY Type 1 and PHY Type 2 transmit modes may occur over the same or different frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">There is typically no restriction on the location of FLO (PHY Type 1 device and MLC) and FLO-EV (PHY Type 2 device and MLC) and either or both of PHY Type 1 transmit modes and PHY Type 2 transmit modes. Corresponding MLCs may be carried anywhere within the wide area FDM data portion <b>324</b>. Similarly, either or both of PHY Type 1 transmit modes and PHY Type 2 transmit modes, and corresponding MLCs, may be carried anywhere within the local area FDM data portion <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The wide area FDM data portion <b>324</b> comprises a control channel (CC) multicast logical channel (MLC) <b>355</b>, and for example purposes only, comprises a FLO MLC <b>357</b> and a FLO-EV MLC <b>358</b>. Similarly, the local area FDM data portion <b>334</b> comprises a control channel (CC) multicast logical channel (MLC) <b>365</b>, and for example purposes only, comprises a FLO MLC <b>367</b> and a FLO-EV MLC <b>368</b>. Control information associated with the CC MLC <b>355</b> is delivered to the wide service area over a plurality of radio frequency channels is identical regardless of transmit mode. Similarly, control information associated with the CC MLC <b>365</b> that is delivered to the local service area over a plurality of radio frequency channels is identical regardless of transmit mode.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, the wide area FDM data portion <b>324</b> may optionally include a wide area FLO-EV CC MLC <b>375</b>; and the local area FDM data portion <b>334</b> may optionally include a local area FLO-EV CC MLC <b>385</b>. The inclusion of a wide area FLO-EV CC MLC <b>375</b> and a local area FLO-EV CC MLC <b>385</b> allows a control channel to be sent in a network that includes both PHY Type 1 devices and PHY Type 2 devices, and in a network that includes only PHY Type 2 devices. Furthermore, this embodiment is compatible with the first 3 classes of devices mentioned above, since a device would always be able to decode updates to the control channel to enable continued reception of data flows.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graphical illustration <b>400</b> showing a frame portion <b>402</b> containing example multicast logical channels. The frame portion <b>402</b> can be part of either the wide area FDM data portion <b>324</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) or the local area FDM data portion <b>334</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The frame portion <b>402</b> comprises a number (&#x201c;W&#x201d; or &#x201c;L&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, depending on whether the subject frame contains wide area or a local area data) of symbols that can occur, for example, within the data portion <b>324</b> or <b>334</b> of the frame <b>320</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The frame portion <b>402</b> contains a number of MAC time units <b>404</b>, which are each further subdivided into eight (8) slots <b>406</b>. Each slot is further mapped to an interlace, which is a physical layer concept representing a set of &#x215b; subcarriers spaced regularly across the FFT bandwidth. In one implementation, this mapping may be designed such that the data sent over an MLC experiences significant frequency diversity. In general, one MAC time unit is either &#xbd; (if FFT=8K), 1 (if FFT=4K), 2 (if FFT=2K) or 4 (if FFT=1 K) OFDM symbols. A MAC time unit may be spread over multiple OFDM symbols. Each MLC is mapped to MAC time units.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example purposes only, a first multicast logical channel (MLC) <b>412</b> is shown as spanning MAC time units <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, and as occurring within slots <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>.

No. 12/876,958, entitled &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SIGNALING OVERHEAD INFORMATION IN A NETWORK&#x201d;, filed on Sep. 7, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating the system parameters message (SystemParameters Message) <b>500</b> carried in the wide area OIS (and <b>505</b> when carried in the local-area OIS) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The SystemParameters Message comprises a number of information fields that define FLO and FLO-EV data, carried by PHY Type 1 and PHY Type 2 transmit modes, respectively, and that can also indicate the radio frequency (RF) information for different transmit modes. As an example, to support the availability of both FLO and FLO-EV data, the fields <b>510</b> are modified from that used in deployments with only PHY Type 1 transmit modes to accommodate a PHY Type 2 transmit mode as well. Previously, when carrying only a PHY Type 1 MLC, the field <b>512</b> referred to the transmit mode (modes <b>0</b> to <b>11</b>, where modes <b>12</b> to <b>15</b> are unused), and the field <b>514</b> was the outer-code mode (0000=no outer code, 1=14/16, 2=12/16, 3=8/16). This arrangement still applies if the subject MLC is PHY Type 1. If the subject MLC is a PHY Type 2 MLC, then the field <b>514</b> contains the 4 most significant bits of the 8 bit PHY Type 2 transmit mode, and the field <b>512</b> contains the 4 least significant bits of the 8 bit PHY Type 2 transmit mode. The following values of {field<b>2</b>}{field<b>1</b>} (field <b>514</b>/field <b>512</b>) are in use: {0000}{0000-1011} (i.e. values 0 to 11 indicating PHY Type 1 modes <b>0</b> to <b>11</b> with no outer code), {0001}{0000-1011} (i.e. values 16 to 27 indicating PHY Type 1 modes <b>0</b> to <b>11</b> with RS(14,16) outer code), {0010}{0000-1011} (i.e. values 32 to 43 indicating PHY Type 1 modes <b>0</b> to <b>11</b> with RS(12,16) outer code), {0011} {0000-1011} (i.e. values 48 to 59 indicating PHY Type 1 modes <b>0</b> to <b>11</b> with RS(8,16) outer code). This is the reason that PHY Type 2 transmit modes start at 64. It is possible to have filled the numerical gaps and used modes <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, etc., but such would be less practical from a usability point of view. Therefore, possible combinations include FLO=&#x3e;PHY Type 1 transmit modes, and new combinations for the two fields=&#x3e;8 bit transmit mode numbers (PHY Type 2 modes are 64 to 72, and 80 to 91).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The field <b>512</b> comprises four (4) available bits for ControlChannelTXMode_Field<b>1</b> information and the field <b>514</b> comprises four (4) available bits for ControlChannelTXMode_Field<b>2</b> information. By including the fields <b>512</b> and <b>514</b>, the SystemParameters Message <b>500</b> can signal to the receiver <b>210</b> within the portable communication device <b>200</b>, a specific transmit mode that can support FLO and/or FLO-EV data. For example, the fields <b>512</b> and <b>514</b> can be used to carry information relating to a physical type 1 transmit mode that carries a first type MLC (PHY Type 1 MLC) or the fields <b>512</b> and <b>514</b> can be used to carry information relating to a physical type 2 transmit mode that carries a second type MLC (PHY type 2 MLC). A PHY Type 1 MLC and a PHY Type 2 MLC can be carried on the same RF channel or on different RF channels. In still another embodiment, a new field could be added to signal the presence of a second control channel with the understanding that the two control channels would carry the same data, but that one control channel would use a PHY Type 1 transmit mode for FLO devices, and that the second control channel would use a PHY type 2 transmit mode for a) greater coverage, and/or b) ability of devices decoding PHY Type 2 MLCs to simultaneously decode the control channel without requiring the receiver to be able decode PHY Type 1 and PHY Type 2 MLCs simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The SystemParametersMessage <b>500</b> also includes a minimum protocol version (MinProtocolVersion) field <b>516</b> and a Protocol Version field <b>518</b>. The field <b>516</b> is used to signal the minimum protocol version specified for the portable communication device <b>200</b> to receive a particular flow. For example, when the control channel MLC is sent using a transmit mode associated with FLO data (PHY Type 1) the MinProtocolVersion field <b>516</b> can be set to a logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; indicating that all devices can decode and interpret the OIS and the control channel. When the control channel MLC is sent using a transmit mode associated with FLO-EV data (PHY Type 2) the MinProtocolVersion field <b>516</b> can be set to a logic &#x201c;2&#x201d; indicating that PHY Type 1 devices cannot decode and interpret the OIS and the control channel.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The SystemParametersMessage <b>500</b> also includes a protocol version (ProtocolVersion) field <b>518</b>. The field <b>518</b> is used to signal the current version of the Forward Link Only system protocol supported by the infrastructure. For example, in deployments where OIS and control channel are signaled using a PHY Type 1 transmit mode, and the data MLCs are sent using both PHY Type 1 and PHY Type 2 transmit modes, field <b>516</b> of the SystemParametersMessage <b>500</b> may be set to &#x201c;0&#x201d; and field <b>518</b> may be set to &#x201c;2&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The field <b>520</b>, referred to as MLCRecordsTableAbsent, comprises a length of one bit, and is used to inform the receiver <b>210</b> whether the superframe <b>300</b> carries an MLC records table.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A through 6D</figref> are diagrams illustrating various additional fields of the SystemParameters Message of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as it relates to an MLC Records Table.

When backward compatibility from a PHY Type 2 device to a PHY Type 1 device is desired, the StartMLC field, the NumMLCRecords field, and an MLC Records Table (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) should always be present, and the MLCRecordsTableAbsent field <b>520</b> should be set to &#x201c;0&#x201d;. This bit may be set by the infrastructure in deployments with the minimum protocol version (field <b>516</b>) set to &#x201c;2&#x201d;.</p>

The ExtendedStreamLengths field <b>665</b> is made 2 bits longer than the StreamLengths field of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> to allow a maximum number of packets on a larger stream that is 4 times greater than in the StreamLengths field. Further, the ExtendedStreamLengths field could be even longer (with no loss of generality) to increase the peak rate on medium and small streams as well.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6H</figref> shows a diagram <b>670</b> illustrating a case where if the ExtendedMLCPresent field <b>655</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref> is equal to logic &#x201c;0&#x201d;, then the following fields are included: NextSuperframeOffset, having a length of 10 bits; and FixedLengthReserved, having a length of 31 bits.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram <b>700</b> illustrating the relationship between an MLC, the OIS, and the control channel (CC). An MLC is generally shown using reference <b>710</b>, the OIS is generally shown using reference <b>720</b> and the control channel is generally shown using reference <b>730</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this example, the MLC <b>710</b> can be one of a physical type 1 MLC (PHY Type 1 MLC) or a physical type 2 MLC (PHY Type 2 MLC). In an embodiment, a portable communication device <b>200</b> that is capable of receiving a FLO transmission is only capable of decoding PHY Type 1 MLCs encoded using the protocols defined in Rev. 0 and A of TIA-1099. A portable communication device <b>200</b> that is capable of receiving a FLO-EV transmission is capable of decoding PHY Type 2 MLCs encoded using the protocols defined in Rev. B of TIA-1099. Further, it is possible that a single portable communication device <b>200</b> can be capable of receiving and decoding both a PHY Type 1 MLC and a PHY Type 2 MLC. Further still, it is possible that a single portable communication device <b>200</b> can be capable of receiving and decoding only a PHY Type 1 MLC, in which case all PHY Type 2 MLCs should be ignored. Moreover, it is possible that a single portable communication device <b>200</b> can be capable of receiving and decoding both a PHY Type 1 MLC and a PHY Type 2 MLC but not within the same superframe. Further, it is possible that a single portable communication device <b>200</b> can be capable of receiving and decoding a PHY Type 1 MLC, associated with a longer stream length (and thus higher peak rate), thus using the new trailer structure and the extended location table structure in OIS as defined in TIA 1099 Rev. B.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The OIS <b>720</b> is shown as including SystemParameters Message <b>722</b>. The SystemParameters Message <b>722</b> is similar to the SystemParameters Message <b>500</b> described above. However, the SystemParameters Message <b>722</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as including an MLC Records Table <b>724</b> and an Extended MLC Records Table <b>726</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The MLC Records Table <b>724</b> includes the MLC location information of all flows listed in the Flow Description Message (FDM) <b>734</b>. Similarly, the Extended MLC Records Table <b>726</b> includes the MLC location information of all flows listed in the Extended Flow description Message (EFDM) <b>736</b>. If only PHY Type 2 flows are broadcast, then all MLC location information will be carried in the EFDM <b>736</b>. The FDM <b>734</b> and the FDM <b>736</b> also include information, such as for example, Tx_Mode, RF_ID, Stream number, RS Outer Code Rate (if applicable for PHY Type 1 transmit mode), and other attributes of the respective data stream identified in the FDM <b>734</b> and/or EFDM <b>736</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The FDM <b>734</b> includes the flow description of all flows that are assigned to MLCs with transmit modes <b>0</b> through <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> through <b>11</b> and whose MLC locations are listed in the MLC Records Table <b>724</b>. Similarly, the EFDM <b>736</b> includes the flow description of all flows that are assigned to MLCs with transmit modes <b>0</b> through <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> through <b>11</b> and whose MLC locations are listed in the Extended MLC Records Table <b>726</b>; and includes the flow description of all flows that are assigned to MLCs with transmit modes <b>64</b> through <b>72</b> (regular) and <b>80</b> through <b>91</b> (layered) and whose MLC locations are listed in the Extended MLC Records Table <b>726</b>. Any MLC_ID listed in the EFDM <b>736</b> will be in the extended MLC Records Table <b>726</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It is also possible to describe a PHY Type 1 MLC in the EFDM <b>736</b> and in the extended MLC Records Table <b>726</b>. This is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> using dotted lines to indicate that it is optional. Describing a PHY Type 1 MLC in the EFDM <b>736</b> and in the extended MLC Records Table <b>726</b> takes advantage of the higher peak rate available with a PHY type 2 transmit mode. Furthermore, such MLCs would use the same MAC trailer syntax as a PHY Type 2 MLCs to be able to carry the longer length fields as defined in the extended MLC records table <b>726</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The flows described in the FDM <b>734</b> are decodable by PHY Type 1 devices and by PHY Type 2 devices. The flows described in the EFDM <b>736</b> are decodable by PHY Type 2 devices only.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The Extended Flow Description Message <b>736</b> is readable only by a portable communication device <b>200</b> configured to receive FLO-EV data.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Control channel information for accessing the FLO data stream is placed in the FDM <b>734</b> and the control channel information for accessing the FLO-EV data stream is placed in the EFDM.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The control channel <b>730</b> also includes an Extended Neighbor Description Message (ENDM) <b>738</b>. The ENDM <b>738</b> contains the exact frequency that corresponds to their RF_ID (radio frequency identifier) of the control channel, and all the MLCs contained within the FDM <b>734</b> and the EFDM <b>736</b>. Moreover, the ENDM <b>738</b> can correspond to either or both of a wide control channel (CC) MLC or a local control channel (CC) MLC.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The locations of FLO and FLO-EV MLCs within the superframe can be placed in either the MLC Record Table <b>724</b>, or in the extended MLC Records Table <b>726</b>. A reason for segregating the MLCs in the SystemParameter message <b>722</b> with respect to the MLC Record Table <b>724</b> and the extended MLC Records Table <b>726</b> is that such separation aids transmission security and allows a clear design demarcation. The segregation scheme is done at the control channel level and thus a FLO device will never attempt to capture an MLC_IDs that carries FLO-EV data.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It is possible that a single portable communication device <b>200</b> can be capable of receiving both a PHY Type 1 MLC and a PHY Type 2 MLC on one, two or more different RF channels.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A number of possibilities exist for the transport of FLO and FLO-EV data over one or more RF channels. For example, it is possible for an RF channel to either transmit FLO data or FLO-EV data. This arrangement has a relatively low implementation complexity, but requires that a network transition from FLO data to FLO-EV data occur on an RF by RF basis.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Another implementation option is to allow a number of different RF channels to each transport both FLO data and FLO-EV data. In such an implementation, all of the control channels could be transported using FLO transmit modes, or control channels could be sent simultaneously using both FLO and FLO-EV transmit modes.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Another implementation option is to allow a number of different RF channels to transport FLO-EV data only.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Either a single control channel or dual control channels (where one control channel is transported using a PHY type 1 transmit mode and the other control channel is transported using a PHY type 2 transmit mode) can be transported.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In a single control channel implementation, the wide area control channel MLC and the local area control channel MLC will be carried on the same RF channel.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The wide area or local area FDM (e.g., <b>734</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) will carry the flow description of all wide area and local area flows carried by PHY Type 1 MLCs whose MLC locations are listed in the MLC records tables (e.g., <b>724</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) in the wide area and local area OIS.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The wide area or local area EFDM (e.g., <b>736</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) will carry the flow description of all wide area and local area flows carried by PHY Type 2 MLCs whose MLC locations are listed in the Extended MLC records tables (e.g., <b>7226</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) in the wide area and local area OIS.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In a dual control channel implementation, the wide area control channel MLC and the local area control channel MLC for FLO data will be carried on an RF channel compliant with a PHY Type 1 device and the wide area control channel MLC and the local area control channel MLC for FLO-EV data will be carried on an RF channel compliant with a PHY Type 2 device.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If a portable communication device <b>200</b> receives OIS information that is out of range, but that can be processed by the device, the device should treat that OIS as an OIS erasure and should then scan other RF channels for another decodable OIS.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A device receiving a PHY Type 1 MLC will read the FDM <b>734</b> and only recognize RF_IDs carrying FLO (PHY type 1) MLCs. Thus, these devices will not attempt to decode FLO-EV data, or a PHY Type 2 RF channel. Thus, a device receiving a PHY type 1 MLC (FLO) will implicitly stay on a PHY Type 1 or a mixed PHY Type 1 and PHY type 2 RF channel.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A device receiving a PHY Type 2 MLC will read the EFDM <b>736</b> and only recognize RF_IDs carrying FLO-EV (PHY type 2) MLCs. Thus, these devices will not attempt to decode FLO data, or a PHY Type 1 RF channel. Thus, a device receiving a PHY type 2 MLC (FLO-EV) will implicitly stay on a PHY Type 2 RF channel.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In case a device moves to a PHY Type 2 RF channel due to an interruption, such as an &#x201c;out of coverage&#x201d; period then reacquisition (or due to moving to another wide-area operational infrastructure (WOI)/local-area operational infrastructure (LOI)), then the device may scan a PHY Type 2 only RF channel. In this case, the device would continue to look for a FLO signal on other RF channels and treat the current RF channel as if there was no signal.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">If a device finds only one RF channel in the FDM message, then the device assumes that it is on a single frequency network (SFN). In such an instance, the device would only assume that this is an SFN (or pseudo SFN for FLO devices ignoring FLO-EV RF channels), if the FDM message refers to only one RF_ID and simultaneously the MLC Records Table <b>724</b> is not empty. This condition will indicate that there is only a single RF channel carrying FLO MLCs, and that the subject RF channel is the current RF channel.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">It is desirable to allow the receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in the portable communication device <b>200</b> to be implemented in a variety of configurations. For example, it may be desirable to implement the receiver such that one or more RF channels can be received. A network implementation in which more than one RF channel can be received is referred to as a so-called &#x201c;multi-frequency network.&#x201d; In such a multi frequency network, FLO data and/or FLO-EV data can be received over one or more RF channels, where FLO data can be received on a first RF channel, FLO-EV data can be received on a different RF channel, or FLO and FLO-EV data can be received simultaneously on the same or on different RF channels.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A number of receiver configurations are shown below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 13</figref> making it possible to receive both FLO data and FLO-EV data in the same RF channel or on different RF channels.

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a multiplexer <b>1109</b> controls the flow of OIS and data to a single turbo decoder processing path comprising a turbo decoder input buffer <b>1112</b> and a turbo decoder <b>1116</b>.

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In an embodiment, the turbo decoder scheduler <b>1132</b> determines the priority of decoding of the incoming OIS/FLO/FLO-EV streams. For instance, whenever OIS data is available, it may be important to suspend FLO and FLO-EV decoding and complete OIS decoding in order to meet the device decoding timeline. Similarly, between FLO and FLO-EV streams, the turbo decoder scheduler <b>1132</b>, with input from software and upper layers (not shown), may decide to prioritize between the streams depending on the nature and amount of information carried in the streams. In yet another embodiment, the turbo decoder scheduler <b>1132</b> could have a deterministic order of scheduling decoding where OIS is followed by a FLO data stream followed by the a FLO-EV data stream, or any combination of these.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The receiver architecture <b>1100</b> allows near-simultaneous decoding of both FLO and FLO-EV data while using two memory elements and a single turbo decoder processing path.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Further, in an embodiment in which both FLO and FLO-EV data is transported on a single frequency, FLO MLCs generally cannot be scheduled, transported and decoded in portions of the superframe (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) where FLO-EV MLCs are scheduled, transported and decoded during the first frame of a superframe. For example, without FLO buffering there would be a restriction on FLO MLC scheduling if FLO-EV MLCs are present.
