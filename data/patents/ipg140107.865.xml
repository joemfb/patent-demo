<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In an intake arrangement for a combustion chamber in which a first intake duct produces a substantially rotational flow in the chamber, the flow from a second intake duct is divided into two components. The first component is an axial flow into the chamber and the second component is a rotational flow having the same sense of rotation as the first duct. The first and second components arise from the shaping of a junction region between branches of the second intake duct adjacent the chamber.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to British Patent Application No. 1017275.7, filed Oct. 12, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The technical field relates to an intake arrangement for a combustion chamber and in particular to an intake port configuration for a combustion chamber of a direct injection diesel engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An important aspect when designing a combustion chamber or cylinder and its associated ports is the production of an effective in-chamber motion field in the form of an axial eddy known as &#x201c;swirl&#x201d;. An efficient design produces a high swirl to enable a quick distribution of the air or air/fuel mixture in the chamber which leads to efficient combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another design criterion is the discharge coefficient, a measure of mass flow rates from a port, or the permeability of the chamber, which represents the efficiency with which the intake ports fill the chamber with air or air/fuel mixture. This is also known as engine breathing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In known four cylinder engines, volumetric efficiency is increased by providing two intake ports or ducts for each cylinder. The design of the ducts is different. One is configured to have a high swirl value and the other is configured to have a high level of permeability. A problem with such an arrangement is that the port with high permeability provides an opposite swirl vortex leading to a reduction in the overall swirl value. One previously proposed solution is the installation of a swirl flap adjacent to a port in order to produce the desired swirl value and thus the desired combination efficiency. However, the use of a swirl flap necessarily leads to a loss of volumetric efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is desirable to seek to provide an improved in-chamber motion, and provide an intake arrangement with improved volumetric efficiency. In addition, other desirable features and characteristics will become apparent from the subsequent summary and detailed description, and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is provided an intake arrangement for a generally cylindrical combustion chamber and comprising first and second intake ducts. The arrangement is configured so that the first duct produces a substantially rotational flow in the chamber and the second duct produces a flow having first and second components, the first component being directed substantially axially into the chamber and the second component producing a substantially rotational flow in the chamber wherein the rotational flow generated by the first duct and the second component have the same sense of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An advantage of the above-described arrangement is the combination of high volumetric efficiency with good flow distribution in the chamber. This permits an increase in the power density of engines, in particular modern diesel engines without any deterioration in low end torque. Thus high performance and fuel economy are maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the second duct comprises a first branch, having a first end arranged to open into the combustion chamber and a second end connected to a second branch, the second branch extending transversely of the first branch, the junction of the first and second branches being configured to have an outer part-cylindrical wall with a longitudinal axis substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the combustion chamber and an inner part-cylindrical wall substantially coaxial with the outer wall. An advantage of this arrangement is that an incoming longitudinal flow along the second branch passes between the outer wall and the inner wall to produce a rotational flow which passes through the first branch to produce the substantially rotational flow of the second component in the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the inner wall extends only within a part of the height of the outer wall remote from the combustion chamber. Preferably, the inner and outer walls have cross-sections forming parts of circles. Preferably, the part-circular section of the inner wall merges into a substantially straight section which extends across the second branch. An advantage of this arrangement is that the incoming flow along the second branch impinges on the substantially straight section and becomes a flow along the first branch to produce the substantially axial flow of the first component into the chamber. Accordingly, in the first branch there is no need to provide a wall for separating the flows, thus simplifying the costing and machining processes involved in manufacturing the first branch. The height of the substantially straight section may increase away from the part-circular section of the inner wall.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, at parts of the inner and outer walls remote from the second branch and remote from the combustion chamber, the inner and outer walls terminate and are interconnected by an end wall extending in a substantially vertical direction, the inner, and outer and end walls forming an annular passageway. An advantage of this arrangement is that the configuration of the annular passageway can assist in directing the rotational flow through the first branch and into the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, a substantially cylindrical sub-chamber is formed adjacent to the combustion chamber, the sub-chamber being partly delimited by a part of the height of the outer wall adjacent to the combustion chamber. An advantage of this arrangement is that the sub-chamber provides a suitable path for the passage of the rotational and axial flows to the first branch.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Between the vertically extending end wall and the second branch, the outer wall may continue circumferentially in a radially recessed portion which also partly delimits said sub-chamber. The top of the sub-chamber may be defined by a plateau portion, the edge of which is defined by the bottom of the inner part-cylindrical wall and the top of said recessed portion of the outer cylindrical wall.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an embodiment there is provided an intake duct arrangement for a combustion chamber and comprising a first branch, having a first end arranged to open into the combustion chamber and a second end connected to a second branch, the second branch extending transversely of the first branch, the junction of the first and second branches being configured to have an outer part-cylindrical wall with a longitudinal axis substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the first branch, and an inner part-cylindrical wall substantially coaxial with the outer wall. An advantage of this arrangement is that it can produce a good flow distribution in an associated combustion chamber. Arrangements may have the same preferred features as arrangements in accordance with other arrangements and have the same, similar or other advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to an embodiment, there is provided a combination of a combustion chamber and an intake configuration therefor, the intake configuration comprising an intake arrangement as previously described for other embodiments. According to an embodiment, there is provided an automotive engine comprising the combination of a combustion chamber and an intake configuration therefor according to previously described embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The engine may be a diesel engine preferably a direct injection diesel engine.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit application and uses. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background or summary or the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> show a prior art chamber or cylinder <b>10</b> of an internal combustion engine, in particular a direct injection diesel engine. In its top wall <b>32</b> the chamber has intake ports or ducts <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> for admitting air and exhaust ports <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. As generally indicated by arrow <b>22</b>, the first intake port <b>12</b> generates a flow that is substantially tangential to the wall <b>30</b> of the chamber to produce a high swirl. As generally indicated by arrow <b>24</b>, the second intake port <b>14</b> generates a flow which is primarily axially directed into the chamber. However, the flow has a non-negligible rotary or tangential component which generates a swirl vortex in the opposite sense of rotation to arrow <b>22</b> thus leading to an overall reduction of the value of the swirl of the chamber as indicated by arrow <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> show a combustion chamber <b>40</b> in accordance with an embodiment. A top wall <b>62</b> of the chamber has intake ports or ducts <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> and exhaust ports <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. A first intake port <b>42</b> is similar to first intake port <b>12</b> of the chamber of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and produces a rotary flow as indicated by arrow <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As indicated by arrows <b>54</b> and <b>55</b>, the flow of air emerging from the second intake port <b>44</b> is divided into two substantial components. Thus intake port <b>44</b> can be regarded as a hybrid duct. A first component represented by arrow <b>54</b> is directed substantially axially into the chamber <b>40</b>. This achieves an efficient flow into the chamber by increasing the discharge coefficient and permeability. A second component represented by arrow <b>55</b> introduces a swirl into chamber <b>40</b> having the same sense of rotation as the first flow component <b>54</b> and thus contributing to the overall rotational motion in the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The enlarged cross-sectional and side views of intake port <b>44</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrate that the port or duct is divided by a plane <b>60</b> into two semi-cylindrical passageways <b>64</b> and <b>68</b>. It is emphasized that plane <b>60</b> is not an actual physical barrier but is a virtual plane indicating the differences between the relatively axial flows <b>54</b><i>a </i>to <b>54</b><i>d </i>from region <b>64</b> and the relatively rotational flow <b>55</b> from region <b>68</b>. By suitably configuring the intake port <b>44</b>, and in particular the region thereof adjacent to its mouth opening into the chamber <b>40</b>, flows <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> can be simultaneously produced without a compromise between the factors of discharge coefficient and swirl generation. The two flows are generated before they pass through the valve curtain into the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> show perspective views of the exterior of intake duct <b>44</b> with branches or passageways <b>72</b>, <b>76</b>. A passageway <b>72</b>, which when installed extends with a slightly downwards slope, is connected at a junction region or elbow <b>74</b> to a shorter passageway <b>76</b> arranged to open into the chamber <b>40</b>. The configuration of the junction region <b>74</b> is arranged to produce the two-component flow referred to above.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Duct <b>44</b> comprises an outer, generally cylindrical wall <b>80</b>. Radially-inwardly spaced from wall <b>80</b> is an inner part-cylindrical wall <b>82</b>. The walls <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> are interconnected at the top by a part-circular wall <b>84</b>. The walls <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> define between them an annular passageway <b>106</b> for generating the rotational components of flow (indicated by arrow <b>55</b>) in the chamber <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Inner wall <b>82</b> extends vertically downwards from wall <b>84</b> by a distance &#x201c;d&#x201d; which is only part of the height &#x201c;h&#x201d; of outer cylindrical wall <b>80</b>. At one end wall <b>82</b> merges into a wall portion <b>90</b> which has a height &#x201c;D&#x201d; where it meets wall <b>92</b> of the passageway <b>72</b> (where D&#x3e;d). It is the effect of the flow within passageway <b>72</b> impinging on the interior of wall <b>90</b> and the adjoining part of the wall <b>82</b> which generates the axial or vertical component of flow (indicated by arrow <b>54</b>) in chamber <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The part-circular chamber formed inside walls <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> terminates in a substantially vertical wall portion <b>94</b>. Thus it will be seen that there is a circumferential gap between walls <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> towards the front of the duct, i.e., in the direction of the viewer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Through the gap can be seen a part-cylindrical wall <b>100</b>, slightly recessed compared to wall <b>80</b> and a plateau region <b>102</b> which forms the top of a generally cylindrical sub-chamber <b>108</b> within the duct. The sub-chamber <b>108</b> is formed by walls <b>80</b>, <b>100</b>. The edge of plateau region <b>102</b> is formed at the rear by the bottom edge of wall <b>82</b> and at the front by the top edge of wall <b>100</b>. It is through sub-chamber <b>108</b> that the rotational and axial flows <b>55</b> and <b>54</b> are transferred to the chamber <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An advantage of the above-described embodiment is the combination of high volumetric efficiency with good air distribution in the chamber. This permits an increase in the power density of engines, in particular modern diesel engines without any deterioration in low end torque. Thus high performance and fuel economy are maintained. The configuration of the intake port <b>44</b> without the need for a separating wall in the plane <b>60</b> simplifies the casting and machining processes. However, if desired an actual wall may be provided in a modification. The relative shapes and sizes of the walls and duct portions <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> are shown as an example and can be varied as desired. For direct-injection diesel engines, only air passes through the intake ports. The intake arrangement can also be employed in other engines, in which an air/fuel mixture passes through the ports.</p>
