<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/157,260 entitled &#x201c;DUAL TRACK LADDER WITH BRAKE MECHANISM THAT IS AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED TO THE UPPER TRACKS TO HOLD THE LADDER IN PLACE DURING USE&#x201d; filed Jun. 9, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to a ladder system used between a pair of laterally spaced apart storage shelves located in a store or warehouse. Applicant's prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,413,191, issued May 9, 1995, entitled &#x201c;DUAL TRACK LADDER&#x201d; and 6,619,427, issued Sep. 16, 2003, entitled &#x201c;FOLDABLE DUAL TRACK LADDER&#x201d; disclose ladder systems which have been commercially successful. The existing dual track ladders have spring-loaded casters and rubber pads at the lower end of the ladder. When the ladder is in use, the weight of the user or worker is sufficient to compress the caster springs and urge the rubber pads against the floor to thereby lock, secure or immobilize the base of the ladder on the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, with taller ladders and especially ladders provided with a platform for the user or worker at the top of the ladder, some have found that the construction of the ladder permitted movement of the upper part of the ladder longitudinally parallel to the dual tracks despite the compression of the spring casters at the base of the ladder as in U.S. Pat. No. 6,619,427. Also, it was found that the ladder was slightly unstable on the transverse track or rod forming a part of the roller carriage and thus the top of the ladder could also move slightly laterally or from side to side. Such movements are undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the prior art ladders, a person can inch the ladder forward or longitudinally as well as laterally despite the compressed spring-loaded casters at the base. The wheels or rollers on the dual tracks and on the wheels or rollers on the lateral track at the top of the ladder have no restraint and by jerking the ladder forward, a person can move the ladder either intentionally or mistakenly forward as well as laterally from side to side.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The dual track ladder of the present disclosure incorporates brake mechanisms that are applied automatically to each of the upper tracks by a person on the ladder to hold the ladder in place during use and a separate lateral brake mechanism that is applied by spring tension to the lateral track or rod to hold the ladder in one position on the transverse track until the lateral brake is manually deactivated. Such mechanisms work in conjunction with the spring-loaded casters and rubber pads at the lower end of the ladder. When the ladder is in use, the lateral brake is applied automatically by spring tension, and the weight of the user is thereafter sufficient to compress the spring-loaded casters and lock the base of the ladder to the floor. As the worker progresses up the ladder, whether provided with or without a platform, the weight of the worker automatically applies the brake mechanisms to the upper tracks to hold the ladder in place during use and to prevent the ladder from moving either intentionally or mistakenly forward. The final result is that the ladder is now completely immobilized. Thus, the user can no longer inch the ladder forward hence the wheels of the carriage system on the dual tracks at the top of the ladder are now restrained and prevented from jerking forward, either intentionally or mistakenly forward.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The lateral brake is normally actuated so that the ladder remains in one position on the transverse track until the brake is deactivated. A user desiring to move the ladder transversely pulls an actuating or positioning cable thereby deactivating the brake. The ladder is then moved transversely. At the desired position the cable is released, the brake locks and the ladder is in the new transverse position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The final result is that the ladder is now completely immobilized. By stepping on the ladder, the casters at the bottom retract and the ladder is locked to the floor. By releasing the positioning cable the ladder is locked in a transverse position. The weight of the person on the ladder locks the carriage to the dual tracks on top. All movement is stopped and the ladder is completely stable.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure also constitutes an improvement over U.S. Pat. No. 6,619,427 by providing a gas cylinder which, when a latch is released, pushes the ladder section up and to the right at one side of the aisle. Thus, the ladder comes to rest against the face of the shelving and it is held in that position by the gas cylinder. In order to use the ladder, it is necessary for the ladder to be pushed back manually to the normal position until the latch snaps shut and thereby retains the ladder in position in the aisle ready for use. Such features meet local building codes and regulations.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The brake mechanisms on the dual tracks are spring-loaded and are applied to the rolling carriage on the tracks at the top of the ladder when the user steps on the ladder. Not only are the spring-loaded casters compressed at the base, but also the spring-loaded brakes provided with rubber pads on the tracks at the top of the ladder are compressed and the ladder is thereby held stationary both at the top and at the bottom. Thus, the ladder is completely immobilized.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate the ladder system <b>10</b> which includes a pair of dual tracks or rails including a first overhead guide track <b>12</b> and a second overhead guide track <b>14</b>. The dual tracks <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are mounted at the top of a pair of longitudinally extending, laterally spaced apart storage shelves <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. The dual tracks <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are mounted on the front surface or side of the storage shelves <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> by means of a plurality of longitudinally spaced brackets <b>20</b> or end mounts <b>22</b>. The storage shelves <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are mounted on the floor <b>96</b> of a building, store or warehouse, with the space between the shelves <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> defining an aisle or aisle way <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, the term &#x201c;longitudinal direction&#x201d; is defined as extending parallel to the laterally spaced apart storage shelves <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. The term &#x201c;lateral direction&#x201d; is defined as extending laterally between the storage shelves <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The track system <b>10</b> includes an overhead roller carriage or roller structure <b>26</b> which is mounted for longitudinal movement along the guide tracks or rails <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The roller carriage <b>26</b> includes a pair of side walls or members <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> which are laterally spaced apart and are parallel to one another as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>8</b>. The roller carriage <b>26</b> further includes a pair of telescopically adjustable tubular supports including a first support <b>34</b> and a second support <b>35</b>. The first support <b>34</b> includes a pair of tubular members <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, with tubular member <b>36</b> slidable within tubular member <b>38</b>. The second support <b>35</b> includes a tubular member <b>40</b> slidable within the tubular member <b>42</b>. The members <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are provided at the ends thereof with means for securing the adjustable first and second supports <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> to the side members <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> in order to fit or to adjust to the spacing between the laterally spaced apart shelves <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The longitudinal ends of each of the side members <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> of the roller carriage <b>26</b> has mounted thereon a pair of roller sets <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, thereby providing two pairs of rollers on each side member <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The rollers are movable along their respective dual guide tracks <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The roller carriage <b>26</b> is mounted for movement in the longitudinal direction parallel to the shelves <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each roller set <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> (total of 4) has a bracket <b>47</b> attached to one of the side walls <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. Mounted on each bracket <b>47</b> is an upper roller <b>48</b> and a lower roller <b>50</b>. Two pairs of roller sets <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are carried on each of the side walls <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and have annular curved surfaces which are received on or engageable with the dual tracks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. The guide tracks <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are of circular cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The track system <b>10</b> includes a ladder <b>52</b> having a frame <b>54</b>. The ladder <b>52</b> has a first side <b>55</b> and a second side <b>56</b>. Each side <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> has a pair of side rails <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>. The side rails <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> support the vertically spaced apart steps or stairs <b>62</b>. The upper most step <b>62</b> is integral with a ladder platform <b>66</b> having a lateral support structure <b>68</b> integral with the ladder frame <b>54</b>. The upper ends of the side rails <b>60</b> near the top step <b>62</b> extends rearwardly and abuts the other side rail <b>58</b>. The side rails <b>58</b> are connected near the top by a cross rail <b>70</b> and at the top of the side rails <b>58</b> are connected by a cross rail <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hand rails <b>74</b> are laterally spaced apart and parallel to one another and are carried by the frame <b>54</b> of the ladder <b>52</b>. The hand rails <b>74</b> provide a grip for a person climbing the ladder steps or stairs <b>62</b> and also lie in the plane <b>56</b> in order to abut the front surface of shelf <b>16</b> when the ladder <b>52</b> is pivoted and stored at one side of the aisle <b>24</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The ladder <b>52</b> includes a mounting structure or bar <b>80</b> which provides support for a pair of roller sets <b>82</b>. One roller set <b>82</b> has a bracket <b>84</b> which is welded or otherwise secured to one end of the mounting bar <b>80</b>. The bracket <b>84</b> maintains the upper and lower rollers <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> in a vertically spaced relationship. The rollers <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> are of arcuate configuration and are designed to ride along the first support <b>34</b>. The other roller set <b>82</b> is mounted on a bracket which is welded to the other end of the mounting bar <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The lower end of the ladder <b>52</b> is provided with a pair of stop or brake mechanisms <b>89</b> which includes a pair of spaced apart spring-loaded casters <b>90</b> and a pair of rubber pads <b>92</b> which are carried by the bottom ends of a U-shaped support <b>94</b> which is secured to the ladder frame <b>54</b>. When the ladder <b>52</b> is not in use, the spring-loaded casters or wheels <b>90</b> are designed to roll along the floor <b>96</b>, with the bumpers <b>92</b> raised and spaced from the floor <b>96</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, when a person steps on the ladder step <b>62</b>, the springs within the caster wheels <b>90</b> are compressed, thereby lowering the rubber pads <b>92</b> of the ladder <b>52</b> onto the floor <b>96</b> to prevent movement of the ladder <b>52</b> at the bottom thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The roller carriage <b>26</b> differs from the roller carriage described in my U.S. Pat. No. 6,619,427 by providing in addition, a pair of brake mechanisms <b>100</b> and a pair of compression springs <b>102</b> as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-17</figref>. Each brake mechanism <b>100</b>, includes an L-shape bracket <b>104</b> having a first leg <b>106</b> and a second leg <b>108</b> perpendicular to the first leg <b>106</b>. Brake pad <b>110</b> is made from rubber or other compressible material and is secured to the underside of the first leg <b>106</b> by means of a pair of fastening devices (nuts and bolts) <b>112</b>. The second leg <b>108</b> is welded at <b>109</b> to the outer side or surface of the side members <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus the locating means also includes the pair of braking mechanisms <b>100</b>. One braking mechanism <b>100</b> is connected to each of the side members <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and overlies and is engageable with one of the first and second guide tracks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> when subjected to a load of a person on the ladder <b>52</b> during use. This prevents movement of the ladder <b>52</b> at the top when a force is applied by the worker whether intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A side plate <b>49</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) is located adjacent a pair of upper and lower rollers <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> near one end of each side member <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. Each side plate <b>49</b> is provided with a lower spring cup <b>51</b>. An upper spring cup <b>53</b> is welded or secured to the end of the mounting bar or side member <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and is located above and is spaced from the lower spring cup <b>51</b>. The compression spring <b>102</b> has opposite end portions received in the opposing upper and lower cups <b>51</b>, <b>53</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>15</b> and <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As mentioned previously, when the user applies a force to the ladder <b>52</b>, the upper braking mechanisms <b>100</b> are applied urging the brake pads <b>110</b> into engagement with the dual tracks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> while simultaneously compressing the compression springs <b>102</b>. When the worker removes himself from the ladder, the compression springs <b>102</b> release the brake pads <b>110</b> from the dual tracks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The mounting structure for the ladder <b>52</b> which includes the mounting bar <b>80</b> and a pair of roller sets <b>82</b> engageable with the first rod or support <b>34</b>, has been provided with locating means including a lateral brake <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) which is pivotally carried by the ladder frame <b>54</b> and is engageable with the first support <b>34</b> to prevent lateral movement of the ladder <b>52</b> and roller carriage <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> inclusive, the ladder <b>52</b> near the upper end of the first side <b>55</b> is provided with a pivot mechanism, assembly or means <b>152</b>. The pivot mechanism <b>152</b> includes a C-shape bracket <b>154</b> which is secured to the ladder rail <b>58</b> and a corresponding C-shape bracket <b>156</b> is secured to the mounting bracket <b>154</b> previously described. An elongated bolt or mounting member <b>158</b> extends through the overlapping upper flanges <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> of bracket <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> and the overlapping lower flanges <b>161</b>, <b>163</b> of said bracket <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. The bolt <b>158</b> is secured on the lower end by nut <b>164</b> as illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 21</figref>. A compression spring <b>166</b> is coiled around portions of the bolt <b>158</b>, with the spring <b>166</b> having ends <b>168</b>, <b>170</b>. The spring end <b>168</b> abuts the face of the mounting bar <b>80</b>. The other spring end <b>168</b> contacts the ladder side rail. When the ladder <b>52</b> is unlatched from the mounting bar <b>80</b>, to be subsequently described, it swings about the pivot mechanism or assembly <b>152</b> from the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> inclusive to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the folded position at one side of aisle <b>24</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The mounting bar <b>80</b> forms an abutment for the ladder <b>52</b> as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The lateral brake <b>116</b> is illustrated and described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-23</figref>. The lateral brake <b>116</b> includes a brake housing <b>118</b> pivoted at <b>120</b> to the ladder structure. Housing <b>118</b> includes a brake pad <b>122</b>, made from rubber or other suitable compressible material and a longitudinally extending arm <b>124</b>. The arm <b>124</b> is integral with housing <b>118</b> and has one end <b>126</b> extending into the space between the spaced brackets <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> of pivot mechanism <b>152</b>. The end <b>126</b> of arm <b>120</b> has a formation <b>130</b> for receiving an end of a cable <b>132</b>. The other end <b>128</b> of arm <b>124</b> is integral with housing <b>118</b>. A force is applied to the actuating cable <b>132</b> to release the lateral brake <b>116</b> in order to permit lateral movement of roller carriage <b>26</b> on the first supports <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The lateral brake <b>116</b> is maintained in engagement with the first support <b>34</b> by the compression spring <b>166</b>. In summary, the lateral brake <b>116</b> is normally engaged with the first support <b>34</b> to prevent lateral movement of the ladder <b>52</b>. This is accomplished by the compression spring <b>166</b> which maintains the brake pad <b>122</b> in engagement with the track or first support <b>34</b> until the cable <b>132</b> is pulled to release the lateral brake <b>116</b> and thereby permit adjustment of the ladder <b>52</b>. After that occurs, the cable <b>132</b> is released and the spring <b>166</b> forces the arm <b>124</b> in a clockwise direction about pivot <b>120</b>, as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, to release the compression of the springs <b>166</b> and apply the lateral brake <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The other side of the ladder <b>52</b> is provided with a latch mechanism <b>170</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The latch mechanism <b>170</b> includes a latch mounting plate <b>172</b> and a latch or lever <b>174</b>. The latch plate <b>172</b> is attached to the ladder side rails <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> where they abut near the top of the ladder <b>52</b>. The latch <b>174</b> has on one end a head <b>176</b> provided with a latching surface <b>178</b>. The other end <b>180</b> of the latch <b>174</b> provides an anchor for an actuating cable <b>182</b>. An end of the cable <b>182</b> extends through an opening <b>184</b> provided in the latch end <b>186</b>, with the ends thereafter tied to the main cable <b>182</b> in an appropriate fashion by means of a cable tie or nut <b>188</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The other end of the cable <b>182</b> is retained by a fastening device <b>190</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A pivot <b>192</b> is mounted between the head <b>176</b> and anchor end of the latch <b>174</b>. The pivot may be in the form of a bolt which extends through aligned openings provided in the lever <b>174</b> and the plate <b>172</b>. A biasing coil spring <b>187</b> has one end <b>189</b> connected to the latch end <b>186</b> and the other end <b>191</b> connected to side rail <b>60</b> to thereby bias the latch <b>174</b> to a latch position, with the latching surface <b>178</b> engaging the rod <b>198</b> carried by the mounting bar <b>80</b>. The top surface of the mounting bar <b>80</b> at the actuating end is provided with a relatively short rod <b>194</b> of generally circular configuration. The rod <b>194</b> overlies a cut-out or notch provided in the mounting bar <b>80</b>. The rod <b>194</b> is engaged by the latching surface <b>178</b> of latch <b>174</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The present disclosure includes a way to mechanically move the ladder system <b>10</b> to the stored position against one of the shelving <b>16</b>. This design involves a use of a gas cylinder or gas spring <b>200</b>. The gas spring <b>200</b> includes a cylinder <b>202</b> having a rod <b>204</b> movable therein. The cylinder has one end <b>206</b> attached to a bracket <b>208</b> carried by the rail <b>70</b>. The piston rod has an outer end <b>210</b> affixed to a bracket <b>212</b> carried by the support as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The gas spring <b>200</b> is a self-contained, hermetrically-sealed hydro-pneumatic linear actuator which contains pressurized nitrogen gas which pushes or directs the entire ladder section up and to the right as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The ladder <b>50</b> comes to rest against the face of the shelving <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the ladder <b>52</b> is held in that position at one side of the aisle <b>26</b> against the shelving <b>16</b> by the gas cylinder <b>200</b>. In order to use the ladder <b>52</b> it is necessary for the ladder <b>52</b> to be pushed back to the normal position until the latch <b>174</b> snaps shut and retains the ladder <b>52</b> in position for use. The use of the gas cylinder <b>200</b> permits the ladder <b>52</b> to be easily moved out of the way when necessary where crowded, narrow aisles exist.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 20</figref> shows the track system <b>10</b> for a ladder <b>52</b>, with the track system mounted on the first support <b>34</b> between a pair of modified shelves <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> having vertically spaced storage compartments with packages <b>150</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It should also be understood that other types of ladders such as those having safety structures with or without platform or gates, may incorporate the novel features of the present disclosure and would come within the scope of the claims of this disclosure. Moreover, the ladder may be made from various materials such as metal or wood.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure has been disclosed, it should be understood that a worker of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope of the disclosure. The followings claims should be studied in order to determine the scope and content of this disclosure.</p>
