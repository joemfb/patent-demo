<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a structural schematic view of a heat absorbing or dissipating device for passing thermal conductive fluids at fixed flow direction, where the thermal conductive fluid is a conventional heat absorbing or dissipating gas or liquid or gas that changes state to liquid, or liquid that changes state to gas, etc. The thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>) is passed through the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) to thermally contact the heat absorbing or dissipating assembly constituted by the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>). This configuration allows: 1) the passing through of the thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>) in the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) to perform cooling or heating functions by transferring the heating or cooling energy of the thermal conductive fluid through the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>) to the passive heat dissipation or absorption receiving solid, or colloid, or liquid, or gaseous state article or space (<b>200</b>); or 2) the passing through of the thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>) in the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) to reversely absorb the surrounding cooling or heating energy of the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>). The first configuration is often applied in engine cooling water radiators, heat absorbing cooling energy discharge devices utilizing thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>), or heat dissipating warming energy discharge devices such as warming devices, heaters, evaporators, condensers, or the cooling or warming energy transfer device, etc. In this application, thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>) is inputted via the inlet of the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) at one side end of the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>) and outputted via another side end to form a larger temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the thermal conductive fluids (<b>110</b>) of the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) of the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>). The second configuration is often applied in cooling or warming energy transfer devices. In this application, the second configuration will form a larger temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the thermal conductive fluids (<b>110</b>) of the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) of the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>). These configurations have the defects of the conventional heat absorbing or dissipating device.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a temperature difference distribution diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> where the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>) has a warming function by providing heating energy to the thermal conductive fluid. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>) flowing in a fixed flow direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> operated as having a conventional heat dissipating function where warming energy is absorbed by the thermal conductive fluid. The thermal conducive fluid flow in the piping having an unidirectional flow path, where when the thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>) passes through the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>), a larger difference in the temperature distribution forms between the inlet and outlet of the thermal conductive fluids (<b>110</b>) of the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>). In other words, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the temperature at the inlet of the thermal conductive fluid is 10&#xb0; C. and progressively increases to an outlet temperature of 50&#xb0; C. Similarly, the temperature of the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>) has a similar temperature distribution where a first end, e.g., an inlet position, has a temperature significantly lower than at a second end, e.g., an outlet position. This creates a non-uniform temperature distribution within the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a temperature difference distribution diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> being operated as the heat dissipating function by using a device that absorbs warming energy. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>) flowing in a fixed flow direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> having an unidirectional flow path. The thermal conductive fluid flows in a conventional heat absorbing device that transfers heating energy to the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>) thus cooling the thermal conductive fluid. When the thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>) passes through the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>), a large temperature difference distribution occurs between the inlet and outlet of the thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>) of the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>). As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the temperature of the thermal conductive fluid at the inlet of the heat absorbing or dissipating body is at 100&#xb0; C., while the temperature of the thermal conductive fluid at the outlet of the heat absorbing or dissipating body is at 20&#xb0; C. Since the temperature of the thermal conductive fluid is significantly higher at the inlet of the heat absorbing or dissipating body, the thermal distribution profile of the heat absorbing or dissipating body similarly has a large difference in temperature at the inlet and outlet positions, i.e., the inlet side is hotter than the outlet side.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0055">The present invention improves over the above temperature distribution phenomenon by innovatively disclosing a device that passes thermal conductive fluids for heat absorption or dissipation using a method that pumps thermal conducive fluids in a multi-pipe structure in reverse directions to produce a heat absorbing or dissipating function to a passive heat dissipation or absorption receiving article or space. This allows the heat absorbing or dissipating thermal conductive fluid to have a more uniform temperature distribution profile.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a main structural schematic view of the heat absorbing or dissipating device with a multi-pipe structure configured in a way to allow reversely transporting the temperature difference fluids of the present invention. The assembly structure of the heat absorbing or dissipating device mainly comprises the following:</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0057">A heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>) made of thermal conductive material configured to receive the thermal energy from the thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>). The thermal conductive fluid can be in a gaseous or liquid state fluid, or can change from a gaseous to liquid state or from a liquid to gaseous state inside the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) and the second fluid piping (<b>102</b>) to perform a heat absorbing function by absorbing warming energy or heat dissipating function by releasing warming energy to the passive heat dissipation or absorption receiving article or space (<b>200</b>). Additionally, there can be one or more than one of the heat absorbing or dissipating bodies (<b>100</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0058">A fluid piping (<b>101</b>) and a second fluid piping (<b>102</b>) are made of thermal conductive material to allow the reverse passing of the thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>) for transferring thermal energy to the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>). The first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) and the second fluid piping (<b>102</b>) can have one or more than one passage.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0059">An inlet manifold (<b>105</b>) having a first fluid outlet (<b>111</b>) is connected to the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) in parallel with a second fluid outlet (<b>121</b>) of the inlet manifold connected to the second fluid piping (<b>102</b>) to receive the inflow of the thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>) and the first fluid inlet (<b>112</b>) of an outlet manifold (<b>106</b>) is connected to the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) in parallel with the second fluid inlet (<b>122</b>) of the outlet manifold connected to the second fluid piping (<b>102</b>) to receive the outflow of the thermal conductive fluid (<b>110</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0060">The first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) and the second fluid piping (<b>102</b>) are arranged to form a first and second circuit within the heat absorbing or dissipating device in a parallel or substantially parallel configuration having a planar structure or three-dimensional structure in the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>). This structure is characterized as having the first fluid outlet (<b>111</b>) and the second fluid inlet (<b>122</b>) installed at adjacent locations to the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>), while the first fluid inlet (<b>112</b>) and the second fluid outlet (<b>121</b>) are installed at another adjacent location on the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>). In other words, the first fluid outlet is arranged on an opposite end of a first side of the heat absorbing or dissipating body than the second fluid outlet of the inlet manifold and the first fluid inlet is arranged on an opposite side of the first side of the heat absorbing or dissipating body than the second fluid inlet of the outlet manifold. This configuration allows the thermal conductive fluids (<b>110</b>) to flow in two circuits inside the first fluid piping (<b>101</b>) and the second fluid piping (<b>102</b>) installed on the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>) to transport the fluids in reverse directions to commonly allow a more uniform temperature distribution in the heat absorbing or dissipating body (<b>100</b>) for performing heat absorbing or dissipating function to the passive heat dissipation or absorption receiving solid, or colloid, or liquid, or gaseous state article or space (<b>200</b>). In other words, the flow of the thermal conducitve fluid through the first and second circuits is arranged so that the thermal conductive fluid is flowable in the heat absorbing or dissipating body such that the flow through the at least one first circuit is in one direction and the flow in the at least one second circuit is in a parallel and opposite direction to the one direction.</p>
