<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to exercise devices and, more particularly, to exercise devices which enable simulation of a functional activity.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exercise has been shown to have significant benefits to the general population as well as athletes of all types. The term Functional Training has started to become more popular recently. Functional Training may be referred to as &#x201c;purposeful training&#x201d;, as it is not exercise for the sake of exercise or exercise to build a bigger biceps muscle. Functional training is performing exercises to simulate an activity or motion used on the playing field or in life.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Endurance athletes have traditionally trained functionally. If they are runners, they ran. If they are cyclists, they rode. Many athletes fall under the umbrella of strength and power. Throwing a discus, jumping and sprinting are better equated to power development than to strength as an optimal result is the work done over the shortest amount of time. A football lineman exploding off the line to meet his opponent relies on his power for optimal performance. Holding his position against the forces of the opponent uses his strength. An athlete's strength is important when it comes to slow movements under a great deal of resistance. When power is important is when the movement is fast. It is easy to see that both strength and power are important in many physical events.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Functional training in strength and power has only started to gain some popularity. Functional strength training in a gym or weight room has been very limited due to the lack of equipment available to simulate functional events. A barbell squat is very good for developing strength in the lower body extensor muscles of the user, but it is only functional if that athlete competes by lifting a bar placed on his back. For a powerlifter, it is functional, as this type of lifting is his how that athlete competes. For the football lineman, a squat may be a good supplementary exercise to build strength, but the conditions on the field are far from replicated in a squat rack. On the field, the athlete will move and step. Under load they may be momentarily balanced on one foot. Load may be applied to the hands and supported by the feet on the ground, thus the arms to the torso to the legs are all under stress. Little, if any, gym based exercise equipment is currently available to prepare the athlete for these conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One item currently used by strength and conditioning professionals is old truck tires. The tires are laid flat on the ground or turf. The user approaches the tire, puts their hands under the lower edge of the tire and then lifts the tire to vertical and pushes it over. Though this presents a very functional movement, the tire has several limitations as a form of resistance. First, the weight cannot be changed to accommodate different users or progressive resistance as an athlete increases in strength and power. The diameter and thickness (height) are different for many tires and are therefore inconsistent from one program to the next. New tires can cost tens of thousands of dollars and are therefore, not practical. The usual process is to buy tires before they are recycled. This presents a &#x201c;this is what is available, take it or leave it&#x201d; situation for the strength coach and his athletes. In addition, a 700 pound tire cannot be broken down to a 200 pound frame, that may be more easily moved and stored, and 500 pounds of weight plates that can be used elsewhere. The tire was designed to be a tire and not a piece of exercise equipment, so there are other natural limitations such as the lack of proper handles. Also, worn tires often have exposed steel belts that can rub against the athlete's arms, resulting in injury to the athlete and limiting the weight they can lift due to an inability to hold on to the tire.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It should, therefore, be appreciated that there is a need for a functional training device that allows for altering resistance for different users, as well as enables progressive training as the user increases in strength and power development. The present invention fulfills this need and others.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a frame including a first end opposite to a second end and a top portion opposite to a bottom portion, thereby defining four opposing corners. A pin may be coupled to the frame between the first end and the second end. The pin may be adapted to receive one or more weight plates. A bumper may be coupled to each of the four opposing corners. The bumper may be a substantially longitudinal hollow member which may include a plurality of treads on a side opposite to that coupled to the frame. The device may be supported by two of the bumpers and flipped over to be supported by the other two bumpers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The frame may be substantially symmetrical about three orthogonal planes, the planes intersecting at a geometric center of the frame. The pin may be one or more pins positioned substantially midway between the top portion and the bottom portion of the frame. The exercise device may include a pair of pins, each pin may be positioned substantially midway between the top portion and the bottom portion of the frame and each pin positioned on opposing sides of a midpoint between the first end and the second end of the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The exercise device may include a chest support coupled to the frame and positioned adjacent to each bumper. The chest support may be coupled to a bumper. The chest support may be coupled to the frame such that a portion of the chest support has a greater distance from a geometric center of the frame compared to the distance from any portion of the frame to the geometric center of the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Handles may also be coupled to the frame and may be adjacent to the first end and the second end of the frame. The handles may be positioned such that a portion of the chest support may have a greater distance from a geometric center of the frame compared to the distance of the handle to the geometric center of the frame.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference to the illustrative drawings, and particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there is shown a functional exercise device <b>12</b>. The device may include a first end <b>14</b> and a second end <b>16</b>. The device may also include a top portion <b>18</b> and a bottom portion <b>20</b>. In this embodiment the device is symmetrical about each of the axes x-x, y-y and z-z. Therefore, plane x-z would bisect the device <b>12</b> between the first end <b>14</b> and the second end <b>16</b>. Plane x-y would bisect the device <b>12</b> between the top portion <b>18</b> and the bottom portion <b>20</b>. Plane y-z would bisect a left and right half of the device <b>12</b>. Here the centroid, or the dimensional center of the device <b>12</b>, is the intersection of all three axes (x-x, y-y and z-z), as well as planes x-y, x-z and y-z, which are understood to be orthogonal to one another. It is not critical that the device <b>12</b> be symmetrical about the centroid, but it may be preferred. This will become more evident as the use of the device <b>12</b> is disclosed in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The device <b>12</b> may include a base frame <b>22</b> which may be substantially longitudinal in shape. The base frame <b>22</b> may extend from the first end <b>14</b> to the second end <b>16</b> of the device <b>12</b>. The base frame <b>22</b> may support one or more pins <b>24</b> which may be coupled to the base frame <b>22</b>, preferably as illustrated here, substantially centered on the base frame <b>22</b> in the x-y plane. In the preferred embodiment, as shown here, there are two pins <b>24</b> on each side of a center beam <b>26</b>. The pins <b>24</b> may be located substantially equal distance from the x-z plane, which may bisect the device <b>12</b> equally between the first end <b>14</b> and the second end <b>16</b>. The pins <b>24</b> may be adapted to receive one or more weight plates. Adding or removing weight plates enables the total weight of the device <b>12</b> to be altered.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this embodiment, the structure and features of the first end <b>14</b> are the same as that of the second end <b>16</b>. As such, the description and detail of the first end <b>14</b> may also apply to that of the second end <b>16</b>. A first bumper <b>28</b> may be coupled to the frame <b>22</b> on the top portion of the first end <b>14</b> and a second bumper <b>30</b> may be coupled to the frame <b>22</b> on the bottom portion of the first end <b>14</b>. In this embodiment, the device <b>12</b> is symmetrical about all three planes, therefore the top portion may be identical to the bottom portion. This symmetrical arrangement may allow the device <b>12</b> to be flipped over about the x-x axis and still maintain substantially the same physical representation to a user. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the device <b>12</b> would be supported on the second bumper <b>30</b> and the third bumper <b>32</b> on the ground or other supporting surface. If flipped over, the device <b>12</b> may be supported on the first bumper <b>28</b> and the fourth bumper <b>34</b>. Regardless of the orientation, the view from a user standing adjacent to the first end <b>14</b> or the second end <b>16</b> may be substantially the same.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Adjacent to the first bumper <b>28</b> may be a chest support <b>36</b>. The chest support <b>36</b> may be coupled to the first bumper <b>28</b> by a screw <b>38</b> on either side of the chest support <b>36</b>. A support plate <b>39</b> may be used to help distribute the load of the screw <b>38</b> over a larger area of the chest support <b>36</b>. Alternatively, the chest support <b>36</b> may be made continuous with the first bumper <b>28</b> as one single molded part. The chest support <b>36</b> may be disassociated from the first bumper <b>28</b>, but it may be desirable to add structural integrity to the first bumper <b>28</b> by the added support of the chest support <b>36</b>, and also to the chest support <b>36</b> by way of the structure of the first bumper <b>28</b>. In a similar manner, a chest support <b>36</b> may be provided adjacent to each of the other bumpers (<b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To further assist in securing the chest supports <b>36</b>, one or more additional plates may be used. In this embodiment, a front plate <b>40</b> may be received by a recess in the chest support <b>36</b> and secured to the frame by screws <b>42</b>. In a similar manner, a bottom plate <b>44</b> may be used to capture a large portion of material of the chest support <b>36</b> and secure it to the frame provided under the chest support <b>36</b>. As previously noted, screws <b>46</b> may be used to fasten the bottom plate <b>44</b> to the frame. This may be desirable as the chest support <b>36</b> may be constructed of a pliable material such as rubber or polyurethane. When high compressive loads are placed on the chest support <b>36</b> it may tend to deform and be pulled off of the frame during use. The support structure as shown and described may help keep the chest support <b>36</b> in the proper position.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A set of handles <b>48</b> may be provided wherein the handles are closer to the centroid of the device <b>12</b> as compared to a distal portion of the chest support <b>36</b>. In doing so, if a user places their chest against the chest support <b>36</b>, there may be a space between the user's torso and the handles <b>48</b>. The user may grasp the handles <b>48</b> on the bottom portion <b>20</b> with their chest against the chest support <b>36</b> on the top portion <b>18</b>. The space provided between the chest support <b>36</b> and the handles <b>48</b> may reduce the likelihood of inadvertent contact between the shoulders or arms of the user and the handles <b>48</b>. Without this spacing, the handles <b>48</b> on the top portion <b>18</b> may be in the way of the user. The handles <b>48</b> are necessary, as when the device <b>12</b> is flipped over, the top portion <b>18</b> then becomes the bottom portion <b>20</b>. By positioning the handles <b>48</b> more toward the centroid of the device <b>12</b>, compared to the outermost portion of the chest support <b>36</b>, the potential is reduced for interference between the arm or shoulder of the user and the unused handles <b>48</b> on the upper portion <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the device is shown with weight plates <b>50</b> added to the pins <b>24</b>. A spring clip <b>52</b> may be used as a collar to secure the weight plates <b>50</b> in place on the pins <b>24</b>. A collar such as the spring clips <b>52</b> is not critical to the function of the device <b>12</b>, but it is desirable for safety so the weight plates <b>50</b> do not become displaced from the pins <b>24</b> during use.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref>, a use of the device <b>12</b> is shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> a user <b>54</b> is provided on the first end <b>14</b>. The user <b>54</b> is being shown to grasp the handles <b>48</b> on the bottom portion <b>20</b> of the device <b>12</b>. The chest support <b>36</b> on the upper portion <b>18</b> of the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b> may position the upper body of the user <b>54</b> such that the arms and shoulders of the user <b>54</b> may be positioned away from the handles <b>48</b> on the upper portion <b>18</b> of the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b>. This spacing reduces the potential of the arms of the user <b>54</b> to contact the handles <b>48</b> on the upper portion <b>18</b> of the device <b>12</b> during the lift. Prior to the lift, the device <b>12</b> is supported by the second bumper <b>30</b> and the third bumper <b>32</b> on a supportive surface <b>56</b>, such as the ground or floor. From this position, the user <b>54</b> extends their hips, knees and ankles to begin to lift the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b> off the supportive surface <b>56</b>, while the bottom portion <b>20</b> of the second end <b>16</b> of the device <b>12</b> remains in contact with the supportive surface <b>56</b>. This initial movement of the device <b>12</b> may be referred to as the &#x201c;first pull&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the user <b>54</b> continues to lift the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b> higher off the supportive surface <b>56</b>. When the user <b>54</b> lifts the bottom portion <b>20</b> of the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b> to approximately knee height, the user <b>54</b> may step toward the device <b>12</b> while rapidly extending the hips, knees and ankles and driving the shoulders up and slightly back. This rapid movement drives the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b> up so that the bottom portion <b>20</b> of the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b> may move up toward the chest of the user <b>54</b>. This rapid movement of the device <b>12</b> toward the chest of the user <b>54</b> may be referred to as the &#x201c;second pull&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the user <b>54</b> may continue to step toward the device <b>12</b> as the first end <b>14</b> continues to be elevated by the user <b>54</b>. At this point the user <b>54</b> may rotate their hand grip from a pull grip (wrists toward the body) to a push grip (wrists facing away from the body). This may be referred to as the &#x201c;transition phase&#x201d;. Immediately following the transition phase, the user <b>54</b> may begin to extend the elbows and move the upper arms forward to press the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b> off their chest. This may be done while continuing to move toward the second end <b>16</b> of the device <b>12</b>. As the user <b>54</b> nears full extension of the arms and anterior rotation of the shoulder, the user may continue to step toward the second end <b>16</b> of the device <b>12</b>, which has remained on the supportive surface <b>56</b>. With one final explosive extension of the legs, arms and slight flexion of the trunk, the user <b>54</b> may throw the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b> over the second end <b>16</b> of the device <b>12</b>. The contact of the device <b>12</b> with the supportive surface <b>56</b> will transition from the bottom portion <b>20</b> to the second end <b>16</b> of the device as it approaches a vertical orientation. The device <b>12</b> may continue to rotate until supported on the supportive surface <b>56</b> by the first bumper <b>28</b> and the fourth bumper <b>34</b>, thereby being flipped by the user <b>54</b>. This final phase may be referred to as the &#x201c;press phase&#x201d; of the lift. The user <b>54</b> may approach the device <b>12</b>, now inverted, and repeat the process.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The weight plates <b>50</b> may be added to one or both of the pins <b>24</b>. By loading both pins <b>24</b> equally, the center of mass of the device <b>12</b> may remain at the centroid or dimensional center of the device <b>12</b>. This means the first complete lift as previously described would be equal in difficulty and work performed as a subsequent second lift, flipping the device <b>12</b> in the same direction. By loading one pin <b>24</b> different than the other pin <b>24</b>, the center of mass of the device <b>12</b> may not be located at the centroid of the device <b>12</b>. This would enable the user <b>54</b> to do more work during a flip of the device <b>12</b> when the center of mass is closer to the user <b>54</b>, compared to less work when performing a flip of the device <b>12</b> when the center of gravity is farther away from the user <b>54</b>. This enables varied training where a user <b>54</b> may do a light-heavy-light-heavy series of lifts without stopping to change weights. Also, two users <b>54</b> of different strength potentials may be paired to train together. Lifting in sequence, both users <b>54</b> may lift to their physical potentials by doing alternating lifts with varied loading on the pins <b>24</b>. This may be used to build teamwork between athletes of different physical abilities that must work together during their athletic competition.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The internal structure of a preferred embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The base frame <b>22</b> may be joined on each end by an end frame <b>58</b>. The end frame <b>58</b> may be identical on the top portion <b>18</b> and the bottom portion <b>20</b> of the device <b>12</b> and mounted to the base frame <b>22</b> by fastening one end frame <b>58</b> to the other end frame <b>58</b> with the base frame <b>22</b> in between. End frames <b>58</b> may summarily be mounted to the base frame <b>22</b> on the second end <b>16</b>. The combination of the end frames <b>58</b> and the base frame <b>22</b> may comprise a frame <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The handles <b>48</b> may be coupled to the end frame <b>58</b>. The end frame <b>58</b> may also support a leaf spring <b>62</b>. The leaf spring <b>62</b> may be positioned under the chest support <b>36</b> to offer additional resistance to deformation of the chest support <b>36</b> under the load of the device <b>12</b>. The chest support <b>36</b> may be produced of a pliable material, and therefore have elastic properties. It may also be desirable to increase the elastic strength of the chest support <b>36</b>, especially under heavy loads while flipping. The leaf spring <b>62</b> may offer this additional support.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first bumper <b>28</b> may include a hollow center <b>64</b>. This hollow center <b>64</b> may increase the ability of the first bumper <b>28</b> to deform slightly upon impact with the ground while being flipped. This deformation may result in a dissipation of energy to reduce the impulse load on the frame <b>60</b> and the ground on which the first bumper <b>28</b> will impact. By doing so, the first bumper <b>28</b> may act as a resilient spring to increase the time over which the impact takes place, thus reducing the peak force of the impulse. This feature may also be the same for the other bumpers (<b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This hollow center <b>64</b> may also be used to assist mounting of the first bumper <b>28</b> and the other bumpers (<b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>) to the end frames <b>58</b>. The first bumper <b>28</b> may be mounted to the end frame <b>58</b> by way of bumper bolts <b>66</b>. The bumper bolts <b>66</b> may extend through the end frame <b>58</b> and then through holes in the bottom of the first bumper <b>28</b>. A bumper plate <b>68</b> may be provided which includes a nut <b>70</b> for each bumper bolt <b>66</b>. The bumper plate <b>68</b> may be inserted into the hollow center <b>64</b> of the first bumper <b>28</b> such that the bumper bolts <b>66</b> may be received by the nuts <b>70</b> of the bumper plate <b>68</b>. The bumper bolts <b>66</b> may be secured to the bumper plate <b>68</b>, capturing the first bumper <b>28</b> between the bumper plate <b>68</b> and the end frame <b>58</b>, thus securing the first bumper <b>28</b> to the frame <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A first bumper <b>28</b> is shown in an end view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a detail of the top portion of the bumper <b>28</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and an isometric view of the entire bumper <b>28</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. As previously noted, the second bumper <b>30</b>, third bumper <b>32</b> and fourth bumper <b>34</b> may be similar in structure to the first bumper <b>28</b>. For the purposes of this disclosure, the details of the first bumper as shown and described herein may also be applied to the other bumpers (<b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>). The first bumper <b>28</b> may include a substantially flat base <b>72</b>. The base <b>72</b> may include one or more mounting holes <b>74</b> to receive the bumper bolts <b>66</b> to mount to the end frame <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Side holes <b>76</b> may also be provided to assist in securing the first bumper <b>28</b> to the chest support <b>36</b> by way of the screws <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A primary function of the first bumper <b>28</b> may be to absorb the impact of the weight of the device <b>12</b> as it falls to the ground or floor at the conclusion of being flipped. It may then be desirable for the first bumper <b>28</b> to have elastic properties pursuant to the choice of material with which it is constructed as well as the design of the bumper <b>28</b>. As previously noted, the first bumper <b>28</b> may include a hollow center <b>64</b>. This hollow center <b>64</b> may allow for compression, or shortening of the dimension between a top section <b>78</b> relative to the base <b>72</b>. Deflection in this height dimension &#x201c;H&#x201d; results in energy that is absorbed and dissipated as heat, as the elastic nature of the first bumper <b>28</b> is deformed and returns substantially to its original shape after impact. This energy that is dissipated through the first bumper <b>28</b> is not transferred to the frame <b>60</b>, thereby reducing the stress on the more rigidly constructed frame <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Another unique design feature of the first bumper <b>28</b> may be an arcuate convex shape of the top section <b>78</b>. The outside edges <b>80</b> of the top section <b>78</b> may be closer to the base <b>72</b> as compared to the center section <b>82</b> of the top section <b>78</b>. This is graphically illustrated in that the height dimension &#x201c;H&#x201d; may be greater than &#x201c;h&#x201d;. This shape of the top section <b>78</b> may have more than one benefit, as opposed to a concave or flat top section. First, the gradual transition of material contact with a flat surface, such as the ground upon impact, further increases the time over which the impact takes place. This increase in time, decreases the peak forces of the impulse of the collision with the ground, thus decreasing the stress on the frame <b>60</b>. A second advantage may be an increased ability to displace air at the time of impact with the ground. This may reduce the shockwave amplitude, thus decreasing the noise as the first bumper <b>28</b> hits the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The side walls <b>84</b> of the first bumper <b>28</b> may offer the primary structural support to substantially maintain the height dimension &#x201c;H&#x201d;. The side walls <b>84</b> may be slightly wider near the base <b>72</b>, as compared to nearer to the top section <b>78</b>. This is not considered critical to the novelty of the invention but is considered an element in the optimization of the functional design of the first bumper <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Another added design element that may offer more than one functional feature is the tread <b>86</b> incorporated into the top section <b>78</b> of the first bumper <b>28</b>. The tread <b>86</b> may include a plurality of grooves <b>88</b> and ridges <b>90</b>. The combination of grooves <b>88</b> and ridges <b>90</b> may also offer a decreased section of material upon initial impact of the first bumper <b>28</b> with the ground. This may add to the cushioning effect of the first bumper <b>28</b> upon initial impact between the ground and the first bumper <b>28</b>. Secondly, the grooves <b>88</b> may allow for air to be channeled out to the sides of the first bumper <b>28</b> as it strikes the ground. This may also help reduce noise upon impact. A third advantage may be an increased resistance to slide or slip. During the initial stage of the first pull phase of the lift, there may be a good deal of horizontal force applied to the device <b>12</b>. If the device <b>12</b> slides away from the lifter at that time, the lifter may lose their balance and drop the device <b>12</b>. The placement of the longitudinal tread <b>86</b> in the top section <b>78</b> of the first bumper <b>28</b> may help grip the ground or floor, relying not just on the friction between the surfaces, but the sheer force of the material of the first bumper <b>28</b> as the tread <b>86</b> may interact with an uneven surface of the floor or ground. This may help stabilize the device <b>12</b> during the lift.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An alternative to the preferred embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The base frame <b>22</b>&#x2032; may include an end frame <b>58</b>&#x2032; on the top portion <b>18</b> and the bottom portion <b>20</b> of the first end <b>14</b> and the second end <b>16</b> of the device <b>12</b>&#x2032;. The base frame <b>22</b>&#x2032; may include two pins <b>24</b>, which may be adapted to receive weight plates, as previously disclosed. The end frames <b>58</b>&#x2032; may each support a handle <b>48</b>&#x2032;. A first bumper <b>28</b>&#x2032; may be supported on the end frame <b>58</b>&#x2032; on the top portion <b>18</b> of the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b>&#x2032;. In a similar manner, a second bumper <b>30</b>&#x2032; may be positioned on the bottom portion <b>20</b> of the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b>&#x2032;. A third bumper <b>32</b>&#x2032; and a fourth bumper <b>34</b>&#x2032; may be on the bottom portion <b>20</b> and top portion <b>18</b> respectively of the second end <b>16</b> of the device <b>12</b>&#x2032;. In this embodiment, a first end pad <b>92</b> may act as a chest support for a lifter on the first end <b>14</b> of the device <b>12</b>&#x2032; and a second end pad <b>94</b> may function in a similar manner for a lifter on the second end <b>16</b> of the device <b>12</b>&#x2032;. In that the end pads <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> may be centered about two axes of the frame <b>60</b>&#x2032;, the end pads <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> may function equally well regardless of the orientation of the upper portion <b>18</b> or the bottom portion <b>20</b> relative to the lifter.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this embodiment, the details of the first bumper <b>28</b>&#x2032; and the other bumpers (<b>30</b>&#x2032;, <b>32</b>&#x2032; and <b>34</b>&#x2032;) as before, may be similar regardless of the location on the device <b>12</b>&#x2032;. The first bumper <b>28</b>&#x2032; may include a hollow center, treads and a curved top section, as previously disclosed. Alternatively, the first bumper <b>28</b>&#x2032; may be a foam pad covered with upholstery. In this embodiment, the air trapped in the covered first bumper <b>28</b>&#x2032; acts as a damper to slow the deceleration of the device <b>12</b>&#x2032; upon impact with the ground. The air trapped in the foam is forced to escape through vents incorporated into the construction of the bumper <b>28</b>&#x2032;. When not under load, the foam acts as a spring to slowly expand and draw the air back into the first bumper <b>28</b>&#x2032;, readying it for the next impact with the ground.</p>
