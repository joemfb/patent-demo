<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a technique for detecting a vehicular collision.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In prior art, a variety of vehicle impact sensors configured to detect the occurrence of a collision at the time of a vehicular accident are known. For example, in JP, A, 2007-71596, there is disclosed a technique for detecting the collision particulars of a vehicle using a pressure sensor. This pressure sensor disclosed in JP, A, 2007-71596, is arranged in a vehicle door cavity formed between a door outer panel and a door inner panel of the vehicle door, and detects the change in pressure within this door cavity. The difficulty in achieving a high level of airtightness within the door cavity partitioned by the door outer panel and the door inner panel, however, results in limited appropriate association of the pressure fluctuation within the door cavity and the collision particulars of the vehicle. In particular, in the event of a collision resulting in a large amount of vehicle deformation despite a low collision velocity, such as a pole collision in which the vehicle collides with a pole-like collision object, the time rate of change of pressure is small, resulting in the problem that the detection accuracy achieved by the pressure sensor decreases considerably when the airtightness of the door cavity is low.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention was designed in light of the above, and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an effective technique for accurately detecting the collision particulars of a vehicle using a pressure sensor.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is applied to resolve the above-described problems. While typically applicable to techniques for determining information related to a side collision that occurs on an automobile, the present invention can similarly be applied to techniques for detecting information related to a side collision that occurs on a vehicle other than an automobile. The term &#x201c;vehicle&#x201d; here includes a variety of vehicles, such as automobiles, trains, buses, and trucks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The vehicular collision detection apparatus according to the present invention is an apparatus mounted to a vehicle comprising a displaced member, a compressed member, a cavity, a pressure sensor, a deriving portion, and a determining portion. Of these components, the deriving portion and determining portion may be individual processing elements or a single processing element.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The displaced member is a member that is arranged in a partitioned region between a door outer panel of a vehicle door and a door inner panel of the vehicle door, and displaced in accordance with the deformation of the door outer panel at the time of a vehicular collision. The displaced member used may be any of a variety of members arranged in the partitioned region between the door outer panel and the door inner panel, and typically includes at least one of the following: a reinforcement member arranged in the partitioned region to reinforce the vehicle door, an inner wall portion of the door outer panel, or an installation member installed to the reinforcement member or the door outer panel. In particular, use of a reinforcement member that extends lengthwise across an extensive range in the vehicle front-back direction is effective in reliably transmitting the deformation of the door outer panel to the displaced member regardless of the area on the vehicle door where the collision object collides.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The compressed member is arranged in the partitioned region between the door outer panel and the door inner panel, and compressed by the displaced member at the time of displacement of the displaced member. This compressed member is typically juncturally connected to the displaced member in the partitioned region. The term &#x201c;juncturally connected&#x201d; here includes a state in which the compressed member is connected in close contact with the displaced member, and a state in which the compressed member is connected with the displaced member across a space. The cavity is a sealed cavity provided to this compressed member. The pressure fluctuation of this cavity, particularly the pressure fluctuation when this cavity reduces in volume, is detected by the pressure sensor. Note that the term &#x201c;sealed cavity&#x201d; here may be a cavity section that is completely sealed and does not permit the air therein to leak into the partitioned region, or a cavity section that permits a slight amount of air therein to leak into the partitioned region to absorb the effects caused by atmospheric pressure and thermal expansion. In a case where the cavity is configured to permit a slight amount of air therein to leak into the partitioned region, a small open hole that passes through the cavity and partitioned region, that is an open hole provided with a diameter of a size that does not result in a predetermined amount of loss in cavity airtightness, is preferably used to control the air leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The deriving portion has a function of deriving the displacement amount and displacement velocity of the displaced member based on the pressure fluctuation detected by the pressure sensor. The deriving portion typically stores in advance a database that associates data related to pressure fluctuation and data related to the displacement amount and displacement velocity of the displaced member, and derives the actual displacement amount and displacement velocity of the displaced member by reading from this database the displacement amount and displacement velocity corresponding to the pressure fluctuation actually detected. The determining portion has a function of determining the collision particulars of the vehicle based on the displacement amount and displacement velocity of the displaced member derived by the deriving portion. This determining portion typically determines that a vehicular collision has occurred or that there is a vehicular collision that requires activation of an activated device when the relationship between the displacement amount and displacement velocity of the displaced member is within a predetermined range defined in advance. On the other hand, the determining portion determines that a vehicular collision has not occurred or that there is not a vehicular collision that requires activation of an activated device in a case where the relationship between the displacement amount and displacement velocity of the displaced member is outside the predetermined range. The term &#x201c;activated device&#x201d; here may be a device for restraining a vehicle occupant via an airbag or seatbelt, or a device that outputs information related to the vehicular collision.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the vehicular collision detection apparatus of the present invention, a sealed cavity is further provided in the compressed member in the partitioned region between the door outer panel and door inner panel of the vehicle door as in the above configuration, and the pressure fluctuation of this cavity is detected by a pressure sensor. With this arrangement, the cavity pressure appropriately fluctuates in response to the displacement of the door outer panel at the time of a vehicular collision, making it possible to accurately detect the collision particulars of the vehicle using the pressure sensor. In particular, in the event of a collision resulting in a large amount of vehicle deformation despite a low collision velocity, such as in a case where the vehicle collides with a pole-like collision object, the time rate of change of pressure is small, resulting in the problem that the sensitivity achieved by the pressure sensor decreases considerably when the airtightness of the cavity for detecting pressure fluctuation is low. In response, according to the vehicular collision detection apparatus of the present invention, the pressure fluctuation of the sealed cavity is detected, thereby preventing a decrease in sensitivity of the pressure sensor even in a case such as a pole collision.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The vehicular collision detection apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention is preferably configured to further comprise a guide mechanism. This guide mechanism is a mechanism that guides the compressed member so that the cavity collapses and decreases in volume in a predetermined direction defined in advance when the compressed member is compressed by the displaced member. According to such a configuration, directionality is imparted by the guide mechanism so that the direction in which the cavity collapses after the compressed member is compressed is always the same, thereby making it possible to stably detect the pressure using the pressure sensor. Note that examples of possible configurations include a configuration wherein a cylindrical member that forms a cavity with its cylinder wall serves as the compressed member and an accordion-shaped folded portion provided to the cylinder wall of the cylindrical member serves as the guide mechanism, and a configuration wherein a piston member compressed by the displaced member serves as the compressed member and a cylinder member that guides the movement of this piston member and forms a cavity with the piston member serves as the guide mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the vehicular collision detection apparatus of yet another embodiment of the present invention, the compressed member is preferably a cylindrical member that forms a cavity with its cylinder wall that extends between the door inner panel and displaced member. In addition, the guide mechanism is an accordion-shaped folded portion that is provided to the cylinder wall of the cylindrical member, and preferably guides the cylindrical member so that the cavity collapses and decreases in volume along the extending direction of the cylinder wall. With such a configuration, the rigidity of the cylinder wall itself of the cylindrical member regulates the collapse of the cavity in relation to the direction that crosses the cylinder wall, and the accordion-shaped folded portion provided to the cylinder wall permits the collapse of the cavity in relation to the extending direction of the cylinder wall, causing the cavity to readily decrease in volume. With such a configuration, the provision of the accordion-shaped folded portion to the cylinder wall of the cylindrical member making it possible to achieve a simple structure that comprises the compressed member and guide mechanism in a single component.</p>

In this case, when the airbag device is used as the occupant restraint device, the airbag device employed may have an airbag housed in the seat, pillar, or upper roof rail, for example. In addition, the drive controller that controls the drive of the occupant restraint device may be a controller that exclusively controls the occupant restraint device, or a controller that further controls other control targets (such as the engine driving system or electrical equipment system of the vehicle) in addition to the occupant restraint device. According to such a configuration, the present invention provides an occupant restraint system capable of controlling the occupant restraint device based on the determination result of the collision particulars of a vehicle accurately detected using the pressure sensor of the above-described vehicular collision detection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The vehicle according to the present invention includes an engine driving system, electrical equipment system, control device, vehicle door, collision determination device, occupant restraint device, and drive controller. The engine driving system functions as a system related to the driving of the engine and vehicle.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>110</b>, while described in detail later, comprises a pressure sensor <b>120</b> that is mounted to a vehicle door <b>30</b>, and functions as a device for detecting pressure information related to collision particulars of the vehicle <b>10</b> via a pressure sensor <b>120</b>. The vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>110</b> here is equivalent to the &#x201c;vehicular collision detection apparatus&#x201d; of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The ECU <b>140</b> has a function of outputting a drive control signal to the airbag module <b>150</b> based on the pressure information detected via the air pressure sensor <b>120</b>. This ECU <b>140</b> may be a part of the control unit that serves as the control device (equivalent to the &#x201c;control device&#x201d; of the present invention) configured to control the engine driving system and electrical equipment system of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The airbag module <b>150</b>, while not particularly shown, comprises at least an airbag and a gas supply device. The airbag is a member that is typically formed into a bag shape by fabric and capable of inflation and deflation. This airbag deploys and inflates in an occupant restraint region by the supply of gas from the gas supply device when the gas supply device is activated based on the drive control signal outputted from the ECU <b>140</b>. With this arrangement, the airbag of the airbag module <b>150</b> is capable of restraining the vehicle occupant at the time of a vehicular accident.

The airbag module <b>150</b> here functions as a device configured to restrain a vehicle occupant at the time of a vehicular side collision, and is equivalent to the &#x201c;occupant restraint device&#x201d; of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, further details of the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>110</b> and the ECU <b>140</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the structure of a longitudinal cross-section of the vehicle door <b>30</b> in which the pressure sensor <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is installed, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the structure of the lateral cross-section of the vehicle door <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the vehicle door <b>30</b> of the vehicle <b>10</b> connects with a vehicle body <b>37</b> via a door hinge <b>36</b>. This vehicle door <b>30</b> comprises a door outer panel <b>31</b> that forms the outer side wall of the vehicle, and a door inner panel <b>32</b> that forms the inner side wall of the vehicle. The vehicle door <b>30</b> may serve as a front seat door installed between pillar A and pillar B, or a rear seat door installed between pillar B and pillar C of the vehicle <b>10</b>. A door beam <b>38</b> made of metal is installed as a door reinforcement member in a partitioned region <b>33</b> between the door outer panel <b>31</b> and the door inner panel <b>32</b>. The vehicle door <b>30</b>, the door outer panel <b>31</b>, the door inner panel <b>32</b>, and the partitioned region <b>33</b> here are equivalent to the &#x201c;vehicle door,&#x201d; &#x201c;door outer panel,&#x201d; &#x201c;door inner panel,&#x201d; and &#x201c;partitioned region&#x201d; of the present invention, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This door beam <b>38</b> is a long cylinder, rod, or pillar shaped member that extends long in shape in the vehicle front-back direction and is fixed to the vehicle body <b>37</b> via a vehicle front side bracket <b>34</b> on one end, and to the vehicle body <b>37</b> via a vehicle rear side bracket <b>35</b> on the other end. That is, this door beam <b>38</b> is installed lengthwise between the door front end portion (vehicle front side bracket <b>34</b>) and the door rear end portion (vehicle rear side bracket <b>35</b>) in the vehicle front-back direction, with both ends corresponding to the brackets <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> being fixed. This door beam <b>38</b> functions as a displaced member that absorbs the impact caused by displacement into a bent shape in association with the deformation of the door outer panel <b>31</b> at the time of a side collision of the vehicle <b>10</b>. The door beam <b>38</b> here is equivalent to the &#x201c;displaced member&#x201d; of the present invention. In addition, this door beam <b>38</b> is also referred to as a &#x201c;reinforcement member for reinforcing the vehicle door <b>30</b>&#x201d; or a &#x201c;construction member constructed in the front-back direction of the vehicle door <b>30</b>.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The cylindrical member <b>130</b> is arranged in the partitioned region <b>33</b> between the door outer panel <b>31</b> and the door inner panel <b>32</b>, connected to this door beam <b>38</b>. The cylindrical member <b>130</b> may be directly connected in close contact with or connected at a predetermined interval or across a space to the door beam <b>38</b>. This cylindrical member <b>130</b> is a member compressed by the door beam <b>38</b> displaced at the time of a side collision of the vehicle <b>10</b>. Specifically, this cylindrical member <b>130</b> is a closed-end cylinder-shaped member comprising a cylinder wall <b>131</b> that forms a sealed cavity <b>133</b> with the pressure sensor <b>120</b>, and extends between the door inner panel <b>32</b> and the door beam <b>38</b>. This cylindrical member <b>130</b> is made of material such as a metal or resin material, as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An accordion-shaped folded portion <b>132</b> is provided to the cylinder wall <b>131</b> of this cylindrical member <b>130</b>. This folded portion <b>132</b> functions as a member that permits horizontal expansion and contraction of the cylindrical member <b>130</b> (contraction in the direction toward the vehicle interior and expansion in the direction toward the vehicle exterior). This folded portion <b>132</b> at least fulfills the function of guiding the cylindrical member <b>130</b> so that the cavity <b>133</b> decreases in volume in a direction toward the vehicle interior defined in advance, particularly when the bottom of the cylindrical member <b>130</b>, that is, an end portion <b>131</b><i>a </i>facing the door outer panel <b>31</b>, is compressed by the door beam <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, at the time of a side collision of the vehicle <b>10</b> with a collision object P, the door inner panel <b>32</b> deforms from the initial state indicated by the chain double-dashed line to a deformed position indicated by the solid line, causing the door beam <b>38</b> that bends toward the vehicle interior (the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) along with the door inner panel <b>32</b> to compress the cylindrical member <b>130</b>. Then, as a result of this compression, the cylindrical member <b>130</b> contracts toward the vehicle interior via the folded portion <b>132</b>, causing the cavity <b>133</b> to collapse toward the vehicle interior and decrease in volume. At this time, the collapse of the cavity <b>133</b> is regulated in relation to the direction crossing the cylinder wall <b>131</b> by the rigidity of the cylinder wall <b>131</b> itself of the cylindrical member <b>130</b>, and permitted to occur in the direction toward the cylinder wall <b>131</b> by the accordion-shaped folded portion <b>132</b> provided to the cylinder wall <b>131</b>, causing the cavity <b>133</b> to readily decrease in volume. The cylindrical member <b>130</b> here is equivalent to the &#x201c;compressed member&#x201d; and &#x201c;cylindrical member&#x201d; of the present invention, and the cylinder wall <b>131</b>, the folded portion <b>132</b>, and the cavity <b>133</b> of this cylindrical member <b>130</b> are equivalent to the &#x201c;cylinder wall,&#x201d; &#x201c;folded portion (guide mechanism),&#x201d; and &#x201c;cavity&#x201d; of the present invention, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The pressure sensor <b>120</b> is a diaphragm-type pressure sensor where a sensor element comprising a diaphragm portion <b>122</b> of a thin shape is housed within a sensor housing <b>121</b>. This pressure sensor <b>120</b> detects the change in pressure based on the change in the resistance value that occurs due to the distortion when pressure acts in the thickness direction of the diaphragm portion <b>122</b>. According to this embodiment, the pressure acts in the thickness direction of the diaphragm portion <b>122</b> via a continuous portion <b>123</b> that passes between the cavity <b>133</b> and the pressure sensor <b>120</b> of the cylindrical member <b>130</b>. With this arrangement, the pressure fluctuation that occurs when the cavity <b>133</b> of the cylindrical member <b>130</b> decreases in volume at the time of a side collision of the vehicle <b>10</b> is detected by the pressure sensor <b>120</b>. This pressure sensor <b>120</b> is directly installed or indirectly installed via a bracket to the door inner panel <b>32</b>, the door outer panel <b>31</b>, the door beam <b>38</b>, and the like. The pressure sensor <b>120</b> here is equivalent to the &#x201c;pressure sensor&#x201d; of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The detected signal detected by the pressure sensor <b>120</b> is transmitted to the ECU <b>140</b> and suitably processed. The ECU <b>140</b> comprises a CPU (central processing unit), input/output device, storage device, drive device, peripheral devices, and the like, and at least has a deriving portion <b>141</b>, a determining portion <b>142</b>, and a drive controller <b>143</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The deriving portion <b>141</b> fulfills the function of deriving the displacement amount and displacement velocity of the door beam <b>38</b> at the time of a side collision of the vehicle <b>10</b> based on the pressure fluctuation detected by the pressure sensor <b>120</b>. The deriving portion <b>141</b> here is equivalent to the &#x201c;deriving portion&#x201d; of the present invention. This deriving portion <b>141</b> typically stores in advance data related to pressure fluctuation and a database that associates the displacement amount and displacement velocity of the door beam <b>38</b>. Then, the deriving portion <b>141</b> derives the actual displacement amount and displacement velocity of the door beam <b>38</b> by reading from this database the displacement amount and displacement velocity corresponding to the pressure fluctuation actually detected.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The determining portion <b>142</b> fulfills a function of determining the collision particulars of the vehicle <b>10</b> based on the displacement amount and displacement velocity of the door beam <b>38</b> derived by the deriving portion <b>141</b>. The determining portion <b>142</b> here is equivalent to the &#x201c;determining portion&#x201d; of the present invention. This determining portion <b>142</b> typically determines that a collision of the vehicle <b>10</b> has occurred or that there is a vehicular collision that requires activation of the airbag module <b>150</b> when the relationship between the displacement amount and displacement velocity of the door beam <b>38</b> is within a predetermined range defined in advance. On the other hand, the determining portion <b>142</b> determines that a collision of the vehicle <b>10</b> has not occurred or that there is not a collision that requires activation of airbag module <b>150</b> in a case where the relationship between the displacement amount and displacement velocity of the door beam <b>38</b> is outside the predetermined range.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, the drive controller <b>143</b> outputs a drive control signal to the airbag module <b>150</b> in a case where the determining portion <b>142</b> has determined either that a collision of the vehicle <b>10</b> has occurred or that there is a collision that requires activation of the airbag module <b>150</b>. With this arrangement, the airbag of the airbag module <b>150</b> deploys and inflates in the restraint region of the vehicle occupant, making it possible to restrain the vehicle occupant. The drive controller <b>143</b> here is equivalent to the &#x201c;drive controller&#x201d; of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Note that, in this occupant restraint system <b>100</b>, an occupant restraint device other than the airbag module <b>150</b> may be used as the occupant restraint device controlled by the drive control signal from the drive controller <b>143</b> of the ECU <b>140</b> in place of or in addition to the airbag module <b>150</b>. Examples of occupant restraint devices other than the airbag module <b>150</b> include occupant restraint devices such as a seatbelt device, or a warning device that outputs a display and audio to warn occupants of a side collision.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With a configuration in which the pressure fluctuation of the partitioned region <b>33</b> between the door outer panel <b>31</b> and the door inner panel <b>32</b> of the vehicle door <b>30</b> is directly detected by the pressure sensor <b>120</b>, it is difficult to achieve a high level of airtightness of the partitioned region <b>33</b>, resulting in a limit to the accuracy of detection of the collision particulars of the vehicle. Here, in the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>110</b> of this embodiment, the sealed cavity <b>133</b> is further provided to the partitioned region <b>33</b> partitioned by the door outer panel <b>31</b> and the door inner panel <b>32</b>, and the pressure fluctuation of this cavity <b>133</b> is detected by the pressure sensor <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With this arrangement, the pressure of the cavity <b>133</b> fluctuates in appropriate accordance with the displacement of the door outer panel <b>31</b> at the time of a vehicular collision, making it possible to accurately detect the collision particulars of the vehicle <b>10</b> using the pressure sensor <b>120</b>. In particular, while in the event of a collision resulting in a large amount of vehicle deformation despite a low collision velocity, such as in a case where the vehicle collides with a pole-like collision object, the time rate of change of pressure decreases, resulting in the problem that the sensitivity achieved by the pressure sensor decreases considerably when the airtightness of the cavity for detecting pressure fluctuation is low, the present embodiment prevents the decrease in sensitivity of the pressure sensor, even in a case of pole collision, by using the sealed cavity <b>133</b>. Such an operation and effect will now be further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an overview of the pressure change over time (vertical axis: pressure P, horizontal axis: time t) in the pressure detection region for a case where the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>110</b> of this embodiment is used, that is, for a case where the pressure of the cavity <b>133</b> of the cylindrical member <b>130</b>, which serves as the pressure detection region, is detected (embodiment A), and for a case where the pressure of the partitioned region <b>33</b> of the vehicle door <b>30</b>, serving as the pressure detection region, is detected (comparison example B). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, curve A<b>1</b> indicates the state at the time of a high-velocity collision in which the collision velocity of the collision object of embodiment A is relatively high, and curve A<b>2</b> indicates the state at the time of a low-velocity collision in which the collision velocity is about half that at the time of the high-velocity collision of embodiment A. In addition, curve B<b>1</b> indicates the state at the time of a high-velocity collision in which the collision velocity of the collision object of comparison example B is relatively high, and curve B<b>2</b> indicates the state at the time of a low-velocity collision in which the collision velocity is about half that at the time of the high-velocity collision of comparison example B.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, according to comparison example B, the airtightness of the pressure detection region is low compared to that of embodiment A, and thus the pressure sensitivity decreases when the time rate of change of the pressure is small, particularly at the time of a low velocity collision. Conversely, according to embodiment A, it is understood that the airtightness of the pressure detection region is high, and thus the decrease in pressure sensitivity can be suppressed, even in a case where the time rate of change of pressure is small, particularly at the time of a low velocity collision.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, according to the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>110</b> of the above configuration, the accordion-shaped folded portion <b>132</b> is provided to the cylinder wall <b>131</b> of the cylindrical member <b>130</b>, thereby imparting directionality so that the deformation direction is always the same when the cylindrical member <b>130</b> deforms, making it possible to stably detect the pressure using the pressure sensor <b>120</b>. Furthermore, since the configuration is designed so that the cylindrical member <b>130</b> is compressed and deformed by the door beam <b>38</b> that extends across an extensive range in the front-back direction of the vehicle door <b>30</b>, the deformation of the door outer panel <b>31</b> can be reliably transmitted to the cylindrical member <b>130</b> via the door beam <b>38</b>, regardless of the area of the vehicle door <b>30</b> with which the collision object collides.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Note that the configuration of the cylindrical member <b>130</b>, the arrangement of the pressure sensor <b>120</b>, and the like are not limited to the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>110</b> of the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, etc., allowing the design specifications and the like to be suitably changed as necessary. Vehicular collision detection apparatuses <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b> of other embodiments of the &#x201c;vehicular collision detection apparatus&#x201d; of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Note that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the components that are identical to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are denoted using the same reference numerals, and descriptions thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>210</b> of another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the door outer panel <b>31</b> is employed as the displaced member that compresses a cylindrical member <b>230</b>. That is, this cylindrical member <b>230</b> is not compressed by the door beam <b>38</b>, but rather functions as a compressed member directly compressed by the door outer panel <b>31</b>. Specifically, at the time of a side collision of the vehicle <b>10</b>, the end portion <b>131</b><i>a </i>of the cylindrical member <b>230</b> is compressed by an inner wall surface <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the door outer panel <b>31</b>, that is, by the wall surface opposite the door inner panel <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, according to the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>310</b> of yet another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an installation member <b>39</b> installed to the door beam <b>38</b> is employed as the displaced member that compresses a cylindrical member <b>330</b>. That is, this cylindrical member <b>330</b> is not directly compressed by the door outer panel <b>31</b> and the door beam <b>38</b>, but rather functions as a compressed member that is indirectly compressed by the door beam <b>38</b> via the installation member <b>39</b>. Specifically, at the time of a side collision of the vehicle <b>10</b>, the end portion <b>131</b><i>a </i>of the cylindrical member <b>330</b> is compressed by the wall surface of the installation member <b>39</b> facing the door inner panel <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, according to the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>410</b> of yet another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, both the door beam <b>38</b> and the door outer panel <b>31</b> are employed as displaced members that compress a cylindrical member <b>430</b>. That is, this cylindrical member <b>430</b> functions as a compressed member that is directly compressed by the door beam <b>38</b> and the door outer panel <b>31</b>. Specifically, at the time of a side collision of the vehicle <b>10</b>, the end portion <b>131</b><i>a </i>of the cylindrical member <b>430</b> is compressed by the inner wall surface <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the door outer panel <b>31</b>, that is, by the wall surface opposite the door inner panel <b>32</b>, and an indented portion <b>131</b><i>b </i>formed on the end side of the cylindrical member <b>430</b> is compressed by the door beam <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>510</b> of yet another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a further modification of the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>410</b>. According to this vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>510</b>, the configuration employs a design in which the pressure sensor <b>120</b> is arranged at a location away from the door inner panel <b>32</b>, and the continuous portion <b>123</b> of the pressure sensor <b>120</b> passes through a pressure lead-through pipe <b>124</b>, directly connecting with the cavity <b>133</b> of the cylindrical member <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Even in a case where the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, or <b>510</b> is employed, the collision particulars of the vehicle <b>10</b> can be accurately detected using the pressure sensor <b>120</b>, similar to a case where the vehicular collision detection apparatus <b>110</b> is employed.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment only, and various applications and modifications are possible. For example, each of the following embodiments, which apply the above-described embodiment, may also be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While according to each of the above embodiments, the cylindrical member <b>130</b> is used as the compressed member compressed by a displaced member, such as the door beam <b>38</b> or the door outer panel <b>31</b>, the present invention allows use of members other than the cylindrical member <b>130</b> as long as a sealed cavity can be formed in the partitioned region <b>33</b> between the door outer panel <b>31</b> and the door inner panel <b>32</b>. For example, a piston member compressed by the displaced member and a cylinder that guides the movement of this piston member and forms a sealed cavity with the piston member may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, in each of the above embodiment, a small-diameter open hole that permits a small amount of air movement (leakage) between the partitioned region <b>33</b> and the cavity <b>133</b> may be provided on the cylindrical member <b>130</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>330</b>, or <b>430</b> to absorb the effects of atmospheric pressure and thermal expansion. In this case, the open hole is preferably provided with a diameter of a size that does not result in loss of the desired airtightness of the cavity <b>133</b>. Air leakage through this open hole can be controlled. That is, the sealed cavity <b>133</b> of the cylindrical member <b>130</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>330</b>, and <b>430</b> of each of the embodiments may be a cavity section that is completely sealed and does not permit the air of the cavity <b>133</b> to leak into the partitioned region <b>33</b>, or a cavity section that permits a slight amount of air of the cavity <b>133</b> to leak into the partitioned region <b>33</b> to absorb the effects caused by atmospheric pressure and thermal expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, while the above-described embodiment employs the airbag module <b>150</b> that restrains the vehicle occupant using an airbag as the occupant restraint device, the present invention allows use of other occupant restraint devices in addition to or in place of the airbag module <b>150</b>, such as a seatbelt device that restrains the chest and abdomen of an occupant seated in a vehicle seat.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, while the above-described embodiment describes the configuration of an occupant restraint system mounted to an automobile, the present invention can be applied to the configuration of an occupant restraint system mounted to various vehicles, including automobiles, trains, buses, or trucks.</p>
