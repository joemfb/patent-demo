<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 35 USC 371 application of PCT/EP 2007/062440 filed on Nov. 16, 2007.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to an SCR injection.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is known, for example from DE 103 24 482 A1, that the nitrogen oxide content in the exhaust of an internal combustion engine can be reduced by means of a selective catalytic reduction (SCR). To accomplish this, a substance with an immediate reducing action such as ammonia or a precursor is supplied into the exhaust and releases reducing substances once it comes into contact with the exhaust. For example, a urea/water solution can be used as a precursor. Ammonia is converted into molecular nitrogen and water in the selective catalytic reduction with nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. The selective catalytic reduction takes place in an SCR catalytic converter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The urea/water solution, for example, is introduced into the exhaust by means of an SCR injection unit. This injection unit in turn includes an injector and a fastening device that serves to fasten the injector to a flange of an exhaust pipe. In this way, the injector injects the urea/water solution directly into the exhaust pipe, upstream of the SCR catalytic converter.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT AND ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to be able to introduce the reducing agent into the exhaust in an optimal fashion, the injector must be positioned as close as possible to the hot exhaust pipe. For reasons of component strength, the aging of the reducing agent, and the corrosion tendencies connected with it, though, the temperature of the injector must not exceed a certain level during operation. The object of the present invention is to create an SCR injection unit that has a low temperature during operation of the injector, can simultaneously be manufactured in a simple and inexpensive fashion, and is rugged in design.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This object is attained with an SCR injection unit. Advantageous modifications of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims. Defining characteristics that are important to the invention are also explained in the description below and shown in the accompanying drawings. These defining characteristics can also be important for the invention in entirely different combinations, without requiring explicit reference to them.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is based on the realization that during operation, the injector is heated not only by the direct contact of its tip with the hot exhaust, but also through the conduction of heat via the support structure fastened to the exhaust pipe. The SCR injection unit according to the present invention counteracts this by virtue of the fact that the conduction of heat from the exhaust pipe to the injector is significantly reduced or even entirely eliminated. This is accomplished by means of two measures. In the first measure on the one hand, the conduction of heat via the sleeve element is reduced by virtue of its being equipped with an elongated, thin-wall connecting section that constitutes a sort of &#x201c;heat flow throttle&#x201d; through which the heat must flow. The second measure is the fact that the support structure for the injector is nonpositively connected to only the axial end of the sleeve element oriented away from the exhaust pipe. As a result, the flow of heat traveling through the sleeve element is kept away from the support structure for the injector.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a result, the reducing agent in the injector is subjected to less aging and the injector has an increased ruggedness in terms of temperature strain. Since the reducing agent in the injector transitions into the vapor phase at a temperature greater than 140 to 160&#xb0; C., depending on the system pressure, the improved heat dissipation makes it possible to avoid boiling in the injector and a resulting incorrect metering. This is all achieved through simple structural measures that reduce the complexity of production.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This is particularly true if the sleeve element is composed of metal, in particular is manufactured as a formed part. In addition, a sleeve element of this kind has an improved service life since a metal part has only a slight tendency to crack in comparison to a ceramic part.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The flow of heat via the sleeve element to the cooling body is further reduced if a thermal insulation is provided between the cooling body and the connecting section.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The length/thickness ratio of the connecting segment is preferably greater than 3 since all by itself, this feature produces a good &#x201c;heat throttle&#x201d;. With a ratio of greater than 10, the throttle action is improved even more significantly and with a ratio of greater than 20, the component can already be referred to as a &#x201c;heat flow block&#x201d;. Because the flow of heat is throttled via the sleeve element, the cooling body can be a passive cooling body; it is not necessary to use a cooling fluid, for example an aqueous urea solution, rendering it unnecessary to provide the accompanying cooling conduits in the support structure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an advantageous structural embodiment of the SCR injection unit, the region of the sleeve element oriented toward the flange of the exhaust pipe includes a shield section that extends radially inward toward the tip of the injector, leaving a narrow gap between its free edge and the injector. In this way, the sleeve element performs a double function: on the one hand, it serves to support the injector and on the other hand, it protects the injector from an intense thermal contact with the exhaust flowing in the exhaust pipe, thus preventing an undesirable heating of the injector. A conduction of heat from the injector into the shield section and therefore into the sleeve element is avoided by means of the gap.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The shield section can have an axially extending collar formed onto it, which transitions into a counterpart flange of the exhaust pipe. This forms a tubular base by means of which the sleeve element can be fastened to the flange of the exhaust pipe in a simple, secure fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The connecting section can in turn be formed onto the shield section in the region of the collar. Such a part is simple to manufacture. In addition, the collar all by itself can function as a heat throttle, already resulting in a reduced heat quantity being introduced into the connecting section.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one specific structural embodiment of the sleeve element, the sleeve element includes a first region extending radially outward from the shield section, a second region adjoining the first and extending axially away from the exhaust pipe, and a radially extending third region adjoining the second. This gives the sleeve element a C-shaped or alternatively Z-shaped cross section, which on the one hand, has an advantageous strength and on the other hand, is able to provide the connecting section with the length required to form a heat throttle, without the sleeve element having particularly large dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In lieu of the above-mentioned collar, at least some areas of the above-mentioned first region of the connecting section can be embodied in the form of a counterpart flange to the flange of the exhaust pipe. The sleeve element is thus simpler and less expensive to manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A particularly favorable thermal coupling is achieved if the cooling body is formed onto the sleeve element, particularly in its third region.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another proposal, a heat-conducting body is supported in the press fit between the cooling body and the injector, particularly in the region of the tip of the injector. Such a heat-conducting body can include a graphite element, for example, and the support in the press fit on the one hand produces a good thermal contact and thus a favorable heat dissipation from the injector to the cooling body and on the other hand, this provides a particularly simple support for the injector. The heat-conducting body is thus part of the support structure for the injector.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The support structure for the injector can also include a wall section that extends approximately parallel to, spaced apart from, and radially inside the connecting section in some regions and that is nonpositively attached to the end of the connecting section remote from the flange of the exhaust pipe. All by itself, this arrangement achieves a good thermal decoupling of the support structure from the sleeve element, thus reducing or even entirely eliminating the introduction of heat from the sleeve element into the injector. This is true to an even greater degree if the nonpositive connection between the connecting section and the support structure includes a thermal insulation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">To simply fasten the injector to the support structure, a heat-conducting body can be supported in the press fit between the support structure and the injector. This can in turn have a direct thermal connection to the cooling body in order to be able to dissipate the heat from the tip of the injector as effectively as possible. The same is true of the support structure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is easier to attach the SCR injection unit to the exhaust pipe if the sleeve element has a circumferential shoulder that largely protrudes outward in a region adjacent to the flange of the exhaust pipe and in the installed position, is engaged by at least one V-bracket for attaching the sleeve element to the flange of the exhaust pipe.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An internal combustion engine is symbolically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and labeled as a whole with the reference numeral <b>10</b>. Hot exhaust is supplied via an exhaust pipe <b>12</b> to an SCR catalytic converter <b>14</b>. Upstream of this, a flange <b>16</b> is formed onto the exhaust pipe <b>12</b>, to which an SCR injection unit <b>18</b> with a sleeve element <b>20</b> is fastened. A urea/water solution <b>26</b> stored in a tank <b>28</b> is supplied to the SCR injection unit <b>18</b> by means of a pump <b>22</b> and a valve device <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">During operation of the internal combustion engine <b>10</b>, if the SCR injection unit <b>18</b> injects the urea/water solution <b>26</b> in the form of a fine spray into the exhaust flowing in the exhaust pipe <b>12</b>, a reaction of the urea with the water produces ammonia, which is then converted in the SCR catalytic converter <b>14</b> into molecular nitrogen and water through selective catalytic reduction with nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A first embodiment of the SCR injection unit <b>18</b> will now be explained in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>: the SCR injection unit <b>18</b> includes an injector <b>30</b> whose tip <b>31</b> has a nozzle (not visible) that atomizes the urea/water solution <b>26</b> into a fine spray. The injector <b>30</b> is fastened to the flange <b>16</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>12</b>, as mentioned above, by means of the sleeve element <b>20</b>, which in turn has a thin-walled connecting section <b>34</b> that is indirectly connected in a nonpositive fashion to the flange <b>16</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>12</b> at one axial end and at the other axial end, is indirectly connected in a nonpositive fashion to a support structure <b>36</b> for the injector <b>30</b>. The type of nonpositive connection, however, is not shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>; it is conceivable to use a press fit, clamps, crimping, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In its region oriented toward the flange <b>16</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>12</b>, the sleeve element <b>20</b> has a shield section <b>38</b> extending radially inward toward the tip <b>31</b> of the injector <b>30</b>. During operation, this shield section <b>38</b> functions as a &#x201c;thermal shield&#x201d; that prevents the upper part of the injector <b>30</b> and the support structure <b>36</b>, for example, as well as other components described below from coming into contact with the hot exhaust. Between the free, protruding edge (unnumbered) of the shield section <b>38</b> and the tip <b>31</b> of the injector <b>30</b>, there is a narrow gap <b>40</b> that prevents a direct thermal contact between the shield section <b>38</b> and the injector <b>30</b> and prevents a vibration-induced wear on the contact points.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The connecting section <b>34</b> includes a first region <b>42</b> extending radially outward from the shield section <b>38</b>, a second region <b>44</b> adjoining the first and extending on the whole axially away from the exhaust pipe <b>12</b>, and a third region <b>46</b> adjoining the second and in turn extending radially outward. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the wall of the sleeve element <b>20</b> has a cross-sectional geometry that is approximately Z-shaped on the whole. The actual connecting section <b>34</b> of the sleeve element <b>20</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is constituted by the second region <b>44</b>. The ratio of the length L to the thickness D of the connecting section <b>34</b> is approximately 20.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first region <b>42</b> of the sleeve element <b>20</b> situated between the shield section <b>38</b> and the connecting section <b>34</b> is embodied in the form of a counterpart flange to the flange <b>16</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>12</b>. A thermal insulation element <b>48</b> is situated between the first region <b>42</b> and the flange <b>16</b>. The insulation element is supported between a shoulder <b>50</b> and the shield section <b>38</b>. The shoulder <b>50</b> protrudes radially outward from the connecting section <b>34</b> of the sleeve element <b>20</b> and then toward the flange <b>16</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>12</b>, with a first section <b>50</b><i>a </i>extending approximately horizontally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a second section <b>50</b><i>b </i>adjoining the first and extending downward at an angle of approximately 45&#xb0;, and a third section <b>50</b><i>c </i>extending approximately perpendicular to the flange <b>16</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the installed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a V-bracket <b>52</b> embraces the shoulder <b>50</b>, thus fastening the sleeve element <b>20</b> to the flange <b>16</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>12</b>. Due to the thermal insulation element <b>48</b>, a flow of heat from the flange <b>16</b> into the sleeve element <b>20</b> is essentially possible only via the V-bracket <b>52</b> and the shoulder <b>50</b>. The flow of heat is correspondingly low since these components have only a small cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The support structure <b>36</b> for the injector <b>30</b> is likewise embodied as sleeve-shaped, with a sleeve wall, which, like the sleeve element <b>20</b>, has a cross-sectional geometry that is approximately Z-shaped on the whole. It includes two wall sections <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> extending approximately parallel to and spaced apart from the connecting section <b>34</b> and the first region <b>42</b> of the sleeve element <b>20</b>. The two wall sections <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> also extend radially inside the connecting section <b>34</b>. The wall section <b>54</b> is nonpositively connected to the third region <b>46</b> of the sleeve element <b>20</b> by means of a wall section <b>58</b> extending parallel to the third region <b>46</b> of the sleeve element <b>20</b>, as explained above. The support structure <b>36</b>, however, is thermally decoupled from the sleeve element <b>20</b> by means of a thermal insulation element <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Between the axially extending wall section <b>54</b> of the support structure <b>36</b> and the injector <b>30</b>, an annular heat-conducting body <b>62</b> is supported in the press fit. In this way, the injector <b>30</b> is also at least indirectly supported on the support structure <b>36</b>. The SCR injection unit <b>18</b> also has a passive cooling body <b>64</b> that is likewise largely embodied in the form of a ring and is provided with cooling fins <b>66</b> on the radial outside. The cooling body <b>64</b> has a slightly larger diameter than the axial wall section <b>54</b> of the support structure <b>36</b>. The end surface of the cooling body <b>64</b> oriented toward the support structure <b>36</b> therefore has an extension <b>68</b> with a reduced diameter that protrudes slightly into the support structure <b>36</b> and rests directly flush against the upper end surface of the heat-conducting body <b>62</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this way, the heat-conducting body <b>62</b> and the cooling body <b>64</b> have a direct thermal connection to each other. The diameter and axial length of the extension, however, are sized so that the cooling body <b>64</b> also has a direct thermal connection to the support structure <b>36</b>, particularly with the upper end region of the axial wall section <b>54</b> and the radially inner region of the wall section <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that the heat-conducting body <b>62</b> is situated very close to the tip <b>31</b> of the injector <b>30</b>. In this way, the heat-conducting body <b>62</b> absorbs the flow of heat from the injector <b>30</b> that has permeated into the injector's tip <b>31</b> and carries it away to the cooling body <b>64</b>. The corresponding flow of heat is indicated by an arrow <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It is also clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that in large areas between the support structure <b>36</b> and the sleeve element <b>20</b>, there is a thermally insulating air gap <b>72</b>, which reduces or even completely eliminates a heat exchange between the support structure <b>36</b> and the sleeve element <b>20</b>. The conduction of heat via the sleeve element <b>20</b> is also minimal: this is due on the one hand to the thermal insulation provided by the thermal insulation element <b>48</b>, but on the other hand, is also due to the embodiment of the connecting section <b>34</b>, which functions as a &#x201c;thermal throttle,&#x201d; in the form of an elongated, thin-walled part that additionally constitutes a heat exchanger with the ambient air. In addition, the thermal insulation element <b>60</b> prevents a heat exchange between the sleeve element <b>20</b> on the one hand and the cooling body <b>64</b> and support structure <b>36</b> on the other. Due to all of these measures, the flow of heat indicated by an arrow <b>74</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> from the flange <b>16</b> via the sleeve element <b>20</b>, into the support structure <b>36</b> and the cooling body <b>64</b> is extremely slight.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An alternative embodiment of the SCR injection unit <b>18</b> will be described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Those elements and regions that have functions equivalent to elements and regions that have already been described have been provided with the same reference numerals and will not be further explained.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A first difference relates to the connection of the sleeve element <b>20</b> to the flange <b>16</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>12</b>: by contrast with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the SCR injection unit <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the shield section <b>38</b> has a collar <b>76</b> formed onto it, which extends axially toward the flange <b>16</b> and transitions into a radially outward-extending counterpart flange <b>50</b> to the flange <b>16</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>12</b>. This counterpart flange once again constitutes a shoulder <b>50</b> that is embraced by the V-bracket <b>52</b>, thus permitting the sleeve element <b>20</b> to be affixed to the flange <b>16</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cross-sectional geometry of the sleeve element <b>20</b> is not Z-shaped, but rather C-shaped since the third region <b>46</b> extends radially inward. In addition, the support structure <b>36</b> and cooling body <b>64</b> are not embodied as separate parts, but are instead integrally joined to the sleeve element <b>20</b>. The support structure <b>36</b> is actually constituted by the cooling body <b>64</b>: to be precise, this cooling body simply has a ring <b>58</b> extending axially upward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> from the third region <b>46</b> of the sleeve element <b>20</b>, with radially outer cooling fins <b>66</b> formed onto it. The heat-conducting body <b>62</b> is supported in the press fit between the injector <b>30</b> on the one hand and the cooling body <b>64</b> and ring <b>58</b> of the support structure <b>36</b> on the other.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the connecting section <b>34</b> is composed of all three sections <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, and <b>46</b>. Since the second region <b>44</b> has only a short length, the sleeve element <b>20</b> is very short in the axial direction, which in turn permits the heat-conducting body <b>62</b> to be placed very close to the tip <b>31</b> of the injector <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The foregoing relates to the preferred exemplary embodiments of the invention, it being understood that other variants and embodiments thereof are possible within the spirit and scope of the invention, the latter being defined by the appended claims.</p>
