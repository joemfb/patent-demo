<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an arrangement for dynamic control of running trim and list of a boat according to the preamble of claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A number of different devices and arrangements intended for dynamic control of running trim of vessels or boats are previously known.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One such previously known arrangement comprises the use of a so-called interceptor member, constituted of a plate or an interceptor member preferably arranged transverse to the bottom of the vessel and arranged thereto. During driving of the vessel, such an interceptor member increases the water pressure acting on the bottom of the hull in front of the interceptor member and, accordingly, changes the running trim of the boat or vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">EP 1 075 415 discloses an arrangement for dynamic control of running trim and list of a boat, which boat has a hull with a stern. The disclosed arrangement comprises a T-shaped interceptor member and a T-shaped housing member, actuating means provided in the vicinity of a substantially vertical part of the interceptor member and the housing member, respectively, and a power supply means. The actuating means is arranged for displacing the interceptor member in a generally continuous and linear movement, in a generally vertical direction, between first and second end positions in relation to the housing member. The interceptor member has a first and a second portion, wherein the first portion extends essentially perpendicular from the middle of the entire length of the second portion. The housing member partially encloses the first portion so that the housing member guides the first portion during the linear movement of the interceptor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to EP 1 075 415, the actuating means is arranged in the middle of the external edges of the elongated housing member and the interceptor member, i.e. the actuating means is arranged to act symmetrically in the direction of displacement of the interceptor member. This is to avoid jamming of the interceptor member during movement of the interceptor member between the first and second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the case when a water jet units are used to operate a boat or vessel, the discharge openings, i.e. the outlet nozzles, of such water jet units are normally positioned far down on the stern, for example in the vicinity of the lower edge of the stern. This means that an interceptor arrangement as described in EP 1 075 415 would be difficult to use, since such an arrangement may require that the interceptor unit would have to be positioned such that its centre part will interfere with the components forming part of a waterjet unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide an arrangement for dynamic control of running trim and list of a boat or a vessel, which arrangement overcomes the above mentioned problems according to the appended claims, and which provides a stable and reliable unit which runs smoothly and which can be installed separately and after the actual manufacturing of a boat or vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above-mentioned object will be solved by means of an arrangement as defined in the appended claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to an arrangement for dynamic control of running trim and list of a boat, said boat having at least one hull with a stern, which arrangement has a housing member, an interceptor member, an actuating means, a power supply means and a guiding means.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an embodiment, said guiding means of the arrangement can be arranged to guide said interceptor member between a first end position and a second end position. Said guiding means has a first guiding member and a second guiding member, which are arranged to interact with each other and said first guiding member is a rotatable element arranged to extend transverse to the direction of displacement of said interceptor member, and said second guiding member is a guiding surface against which said first guiding member runs.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an embodiment, said actuating means can be arranged to displace said interceptor member, preferably in a continuous linear movement, between said first and second end positions in relation to said housing member. Furthermore, said actuating means is driven by said drive unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an embodiment, said housing member can be arranged so as to fully enclose said interceptor member in said first end position and so as to partially enclose said interceptor member in said end position.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the description below, reference will be made to directions such as rear, front, up and down, if not otherwise stated. These directions are given with reference to the stem and stern of the boat at operation in a forward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the following, an arrangement according to the invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-7</figref>. Furthermore, a preferred embodiment and alternative embodiments will be disclosed. The arrangement <b>1</b> according to the invention is intended for dynamic control of running trim and list of a boat or a vessel and dampening of boat motion. The arrangement <b>1</b> according to the invention is intended to generate an increase in pressure on a hull bottom directly ahead of a transom edge <b>4</b> by intercepting the flow with an interceptor blade <b>5</b> below the transom edge <b>4</b> to substantially raise the pressure over a large area. This results in a high hydrodynamic lift while the relatively small area of the projected interceptor blade <b>5</b> results in a low hydrodynamic drag.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In most applications, the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is arranged so as to extend (i.e. so as to be displaced in relation to a fully retracted position) up to approximately 50 mm. This would assume that the length of the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is of the magnitude 1000 mm. Consequently, the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is arranged for extending approximately 5% of its length. However, it should be noted that the invention is not limited to such dimensions only. Generally, the interceptor blade <b>5</b> may be for example of a length which is between approximately 500 mm and 2000 mm. In the case of an interceptor blade which is approximately 500 mm, it may extend approximately 9-10% of its length. In the case of an interceptor blade which is approximately 2000 mm, it may extend approximately 2-3% of its length. Variations from such dimensions may occur and generally it can be said that the interceptor preferably is arranged so that it may extend a distance which is of the magnitude 2-10% of the interceptor length.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic isometric view of several interceptor assemblies <b>1</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the invention arranged to the hull <b>2</b> on a stern <b>3</b> of the boat or the vessel. The arrangement <b>1</b> is attached to a substantially vertical surface of the stern <b>3</b> and extends along a limited portion of the horizontal width of the vertical surface along the transom edge <b>4</b> of the stern <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Even though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows four different arrangements <b>1</b> according to the embodiment, it should be noted that the invention is not limited to such a number only. In other words, the invention can be implemented with one, two or more arrangements <b>1</b> depending on the actual need in each application.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The arrangement <b>1</b> according to the invention is connected to a control unit <b>6</b> with a control panel provided on a bridge of the boat. The operator of the boat can manoeuvre the trim and list of the boat via the control panel. This is done simultaneously as the driver regulates the speed and the course of the boat, which is done via a throttle control and a steering wheel (not shown), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each arrangement <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a drive unit <b>7</b>, which is connected to and regulated by the control unit <b>6</b>. The drive unit <b>7</b> (or servo unit) is further connected to a power supply means <b>8</b> and a housing <b>9</b> of the arrangement <b>1</b>. The housing <b>9</b> is only shown partially in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. More precisely, only a front part of the housing <b>9</b> is shown, whereras a rear part is not shown. However, it should be made clear that the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is arranged between such a front part <b>9</b><i>a </i>and a rear part <b>9</b><i>b. </i><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows that the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is arranged between a front part and a rear part of a housing <b>9</b>. Also, the power supply means <b>8</b> is constituted by an electrical power supply of a conventional type for marine applications.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The interceptor blade <b>5</b> and the housing <b>9</b> are suitably made of a material which is persistent to marine influence. Such materials might be fibre reinforced polymer resin, non-reinforced or reinforced plastic or composite materials, metals e.g. stainless steel or aluminium, rubber or other suitable materials.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the arrangement <b>1</b> according to the invention further comprises an actuating means <b>10</b>. The actuating means <b>10</b> is arranged for displacing the interceptor blade <b>5</b>, preferably in a continuous linear movement, between a first end position and a second end position or vice versa in relation to the housing <b>9</b>. This linear movement is generally in the vertical direction, provided that the surface of the stern <b>3</b> is oriented along a generally vertical plane. In other words, the movement of the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is suitably along the same direction as the plane along which the stern <b>3</b> is arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The arrangement according to the invention is fixedly attached to the hull <b>2</b> of the boat with attachment means (not shown). The attachment means are preferably constituted of a number of through-holes in the housing <b>9</b> and fixing means, for example screws, which are attached to the hull <b>2</b> of the boat.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exploded view of the arrangement <b>1</b> with the housing <b>9</b>, viewed from rear. The housing <b>9</b> is elongated and comprises a front section <b>9</b><i>a </i>and a rear section <b>9</b><i>b </i>(not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).

The attachment means <b>13</b> are preferably arranged in a zig-zag pattern to create an evenly distributed clamping force along the elongated housing member <b>9</b> against the stern <b>3</b> surface.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Between the front section <b>9</b><i>a </i>and the rear section <b>9</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>9</b>, the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is arranged. The interceptor blade <b>5</b> is displaceable inside the housing <b>9</b> so as to move between a first end position and a second end position, and vice versa. In the first end position the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is fully contained inside the housing <b>9</b>, and in the second end position the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is partially contained inside the housing <b>9</b>. The interceptor blade <b>5</b> is provided with a number of through holes <b>16</b>, through which the attachment means <b>13</b> of the housing <b>9</b> extend. Some of the through holes <b>16</b> are elongated and some of the through holes <b>16</b> are shaped like U-shaped recesses provided along an upper edge <b>29</b> of the interceptor blade <b>5</b>. These through holes <b>16</b> allow the interceptor blade <b>5</b> to be displaced between the first and second end positions even if the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is arranged between the front and rear sections of the housing <b>9</b> and perforated by the attachment devices <b>15</b>. As mentioned above, the displacement of the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is suitably along a generally vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, the interceptor blade <b>5</b> is provided with one or more transverse guiding means <b>17</b> which are arranged to guide the interceptor blade <b>5</b> in a linear movement.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The transverse guiding means <b>17</b> are preferably arranged on one side of the actuating means <b>10</b>. Also, the transverse guiding means <b>17</b> extend in the direction of displacement of the interceptor blade <b>5</b>. The transverse guiding means <b>17</b> are preferably constituted by a straight recess <b>18</b> provided on a backwards oriented surface <b>20</b> of the front section <b>9</b><i>a. </i>The recess <b>18</b> cooperates with a projecting strip <b>19</b> arranged on a inner and forward oriented surface <b>21</b> of the interceptor blade <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, the arrangement <b>1</b> is provided with guiding means <b>22</b> to guide the interceptor blade <b>5</b> at application of a displacement force. The guiding means <b>22</b> help to prevent jamming of the elongated interceptor blade <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The guiding means <b>22</b> comprises a first guiding member <b>23</b> and a second guiding member <b>24</b>, which are arranged to interact with each other. The first guiding member <b>23</b> is a rotatable element arranged to extend transverse to the direction of displacement of the interceptor blade <b>5</b>, and the second guiding member <b>24</b> is a guiding surface against which said first guiding member <b>23</b> runs.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the first guiding member <b>23</b> is fixedly and rotatably arranged in cavity <b>25</b> in the backwards oriented surface of the front section. The cavity <b>25</b> is preferably H-shaped. The second guiding member <b>24</b> is arranged on the forward oriented surface <b>21</b> of the interceptor blade <b>5</b>. According to the embodiment, the first guiding member <b>23</b> is an elongated rod <b>27</b> which is provided with one or more fixedly attached spur gears <b>26</b>. The spur gears <b>26</b> are preferably arranged on the ends of the rod <b>27</b>. The spur gears <b>26</b> mesh with the second guiding member <b>24</b>, which according to the embodiment is constituted by one or more gear racks <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one end section of the elongated housing <b>9</b>, the actuating means <b>10</b> is arranged to act on the interceptor blade <b>5</b>. The actuating means <b>10</b> is preferably transversely arranged to the extension length of the interceptor blade <b>5</b> and arranged on the front section <b>9</b><i>a. </i>The actuating means <b>10</b> is arranged to act on an upper edge <b>29</b> of the interceptor blade <b>5</b> to displace the interceptor blade <b>5</b> in its continuous linear movement between the first and second end positions, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the shown embodiment, the actuating means <b>10</b> is connected to the drive unit <b>7</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which has an electrical motor connected to the power supply means <b>8</b>. The electrical motor is arranged to provide a movement of the interceptor blade <b>5</b> (by acting on the actuating means <b>10</b>) in order to transfer the rotational movement of the electrical motor to a linear movement of the interceptor blade <b>5</b>.
