<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At a lower end of bolt <b>31</b>, an expanded section <b>35</b> is formed. Expanded section <b>35</b> is made larger than the shaft portion of bolt <b>31</b> and serves as a retention, and formed to have a rectangular shape when viewed two-dimensionally. Though expanded section <b>35</b> is formed to have a rectangular shape when viewed two-dimensionally here, it may have other polygonal shape such as a hexagon, or other shape having a recess or protrusion to be engaged with an abutting portion. Expanded section <b>35</b> has a bottom surface and a side surface. At the bottom surface of expanded section <b>35</b>, a horizontally extending trench <b>36</b> is formed. The trench on the bottom surface of expanded section <b>35</b> may be omitted, and the bottom may be formed flat.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Between fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>of metal terminal <b>41</b> and lid <b>13</b><i>b</i>, an insulator <b>43</b> is provided. Insulator <b>43</b> insulates metal terminal <b>41</b> from lid <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and functions as a gasket sealing the through hole of lid <b>13</b><i>b</i>. Insulator <b>43</b> includes a base plate portion <b>44</b> extending along an upper surface of lid <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and a drop preventing section <b>45</b> protruding upward from base plate portion <b>44</b> for temporarily fixing bolt <b>31</b>. Insulator <b>43</b> may be formed of any insulating material and, by way of example, it is formed of synthetic resin. Here, polyphelylene sulfide (PPS) resin or nylon is used.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">On the lower surface of base plate portion <b>44</b> of insulator <b>43</b>, a ring-shaped protrusion <b>44</b><i>a </i>is provided, which is inserted to the through hole of lid <b>13</b><i>b</i>.

At an outer periphery of base plate portion <b>44</b>, a peripheral wall <b>44</b><i>b </i>is formed, surrounding outer periphery of fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>of metal terminal <b>41</b>. As the fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>of metal terminal <b>41</b> is surrounded by peripheral wall <b>44</b><i>b</i>, more reliable insulation between metal terminal <b>41</b> and lid <b>13</b><i>b </i>is realized.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Insulator <b>43</b> has drop preventing section <b>45</b> provided below terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c</i>. Drop preventing section <b>45</b> is integrally molded with base plate portion <b>44</b>. Drop preventing section <b>45</b> protrudes toward a portion of a lower surface of expanded section <b>35</b> of bolt <b>31</b>. Drop preventing section <b>45</b> has a horizontal abutting surface <b>45</b><i>a </i>that abuts on the lower surface of expanded section <b>35</b> and a vertical abutting surface <b>45</b><i>b </i>that abuts on a side surface of expanded section <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Since the lower surface of expanded section <b>35</b> abuts on the horizontal abutting surface <b>45</b><i>a</i>, dropping of expanded section <b>35</b> from terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>of metal terminal <b>41</b> can be prevented. Further, since the side surface of expanded section <b>35</b> abuts on vertical abutting surface <b>45</b><i>b</i>, large inclination of bolt <b>31</b> can be prevented. Vertical abutting surface <b>45</b><i>b </i>may be omitted. Further, it is not absolutely necessary that the horizontal abutting surface <b>45</b><i>a </i>is horizontal. It may have various shapes in accordance with the shape of expanded section <b>35</b> of bolt <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At a lower end of rivet <b>51</b>, a seat <b>52</b> of rectangular metal plate is provided.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Between the upper surface of seat <b>52</b> and lid <b>13</b><i>b</i>, an insulating member <b>58</b> is arranged. Outer peripheral portion of insulating member <b>58</b> is suspended downward, surrounding outer periphery of seat <b>52</b>. For the insulating member <b>58</b>, a material hard to degrade in an environment in battery case <b>13</b> should be used. Here, PPS resin is used.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A ring-shaped gasket <b>59</b> is provided to be in tight-contact with an outer circumference of a shaft of rivet <b>51</b>. Gasket <b>59</b> is positioned inside the through hole of insulating member <b>58</b>, and an upper surface of gasket <b>59</b> is in contact with the circumference of through hole in lid <b>13</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When electrode <b>21</b> is fixed on lid <b>13</b><i>b</i>, bolt <b>31</b> is inserted beforehand to terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>of metal terminal <b>41</b>, and rivet <b>51</b> is inserted in such an order as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this state, the tip end of rivet is crimped and enlarged, so that electrode <b>21</b> is fixed on lid <b>13</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At this time, bolt <b>31</b> is simply inserted to metal terminal <b>41</b> and not yet fixed. The lower surface of expanded section <b>35</b> of bolt <b>31</b>, however, abuts on horizontal abutting surface <b>45</b><i>a </i>of drop preventing section <b>45</b>. Therefore, dropping of bolt <b>31</b> from metal terminal <b>41</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Therefore, it is possible to maintain a state in which bolt <b>31</b> is held by metal terminal <b>41</b> from the completion of battery module <b>11</b> to the next process step, without the necessity of adding any special step such as insertion of bolt <b>31</b> with pressure to metal terminal <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When battery device <b>1</b> is manufactured, first, a plurality of battery modules <b>11</b> are arranged. Thereafter, a bus bar <b>81</b> for electrically connecting electrodes of battery modules <b>11</b> is attached by inserting bolt <b>31</b> to the through hole provided in bus bar <b>81</b>, and by fastening nut <b>39</b> to bolt <b>31</b>, bus bar <b>81</b> is fixed. During these process steps, bolt <b>31</b> is held by drop preventing section <b>45</b> and, therefore, it will not drop from metal terminal <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Since drop preventing section <b>45</b> is formed integrally with base plate portion <b>44</b> for insulation and tight-sealing, the number of process steps is not increased for attaching drop preventing section <b>45</b>. Further, the number of components is not increased, either. In this manner, bolt <b>31</b> can easily be held by metal terminal <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, the step of inserting bolt <b>31</b> with presser to metal terminal <b>41</b> can be eliminated and, therefore, deformation of metal terminal <b>41</b> in the pressure-insertion step can be prevented. This leads to improved positional accuracy of bolt <b>31</b>, and hence, to smoother attachment of bus bar <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the present embodiment, metal terminal <b>41</b> is formed to include fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>fixed to lid <b>13</b><i>b</i>, connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>bent at a right angle from fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>and extending in a direction away from lid <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>continuous to connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>and parallel to the fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a</i>. Bolt <b>31</b> is inserted to terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c</i>, and nut <b>39</b> is fastened to bolt <b>31</b> to fix bus bar <b>81</b>. In the present embodiment, fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>and terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>are off-set and connected by connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>and, therefore, in this step of fastening nut <b>39</b>, moment exerted on terminal <b>41</b><i>c </i>is absorbed by deformation of connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>and not much transmitted to fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a</i>. Fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>is fixed to lid <b>13</b><i>b </i>by rivet <b>51</b>, and undesirable influence to this fixing structure can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Effects attained by adopting metal terminal <b>41</b> of such a shape will be described in greater detail. In a battery module, the fixing portion of electrode <b>21</b> to the body of battery module is a very important portion in order to ensure the following functions. First, rivet <b>51</b> used for fixing functions as an electrical conduction member between metal terminal <b>41</b> and battery cell <b>12</b>. Second, insulator <b>43</b> crimped and fixed simultaneously by rivet <b>51</b> ensures insulation of battery case <b>13</b> from electrode <b>21</b> and rivet <b>51</b>. Third, insulator <b>43</b> fixed by rivet <b>51</b> also functions to ensure tight-sealing at the fixing portion. In order to reliably attain these functions, it is preferred that as small stress as possible is transmitted through metal terminal <b>41</b> to rivet <b>51</b> and insulator <b>43</b> positioned at the fixing portion.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Such being the case, if the electrode were formed of a flat metal plate, the stress of fastening the nut would be directly transmitted through the electrode to the fixing portion. In that case, if a high stress were applied to the rivet, for example, the rivet would possibly be loosened, or the insulator would possibly be deformed. This possibly leads to a failure of electrical conduction at the rivet, or insufficient insulation or insufficient tight-sealing by the insulator.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In contrast, according to the present embodiment, since the fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>and terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>are connected by connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>and thereby fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>and terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>are off-set, even when a high stress is applied to terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c</i>, connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>deforms and alleviates the stress applied to the fixing portion. As a result, possibility of the above-described problems can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Here, in the present embodiment, the distance D in the direction along the connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>between fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>and terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> is set to be at least 50% of the width W of connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>and at least 5 times the thickness T of connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, stiffness of connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>is sufficiently small. Accordingly, if a high stress is applied to terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c</i>, connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>deforms sufficiently to reliably reduce the stress to be applied to the fixing portion. If the distance D in the direction along the connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>between fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>and terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> is smaller than 50% of the width W of connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>or smaller than 5 times the thickness T of connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b</i>, connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>has high stiffness and does not deform sufficiently. Thus, the effect of alleviating the stress applied to the fixing portion becomes weak.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, since terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>and fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>are connected by connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b</i>, a space is formed below terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c</i>, which space can be utilized as a space for accommodating the expanded section <b>35</b> of bolt <b>31</b> and for drop preventing section <b>45</b>.</p>

A holding member <b>61</b> is arranged in a space between each of the battery modules <b>11</b>. Holding member <b>61</b> includes a plurality of ribs <b>63</b> extending in the horizontal direction. A space between ribs <b>63</b> forms an air passage <b>62</b>, and cooling air is supplied to air passage <b>62</b>. Cooling air cools surfaces of battery modules <b>11</b>, and reduces heat of battery modules <b>11</b>. Namely, holding member <b>61</b> has a function of cooling battery modules <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">One surface of holding member <b>61</b> and a tip end of each rib <b>63</b> are in contact with the surface of battery module <b>11</b>.

Holding member <b>61</b> is formed of molded resin. Since the holding member <b>61</b> is formed of an insulator such as resin, insulation between neighboring battery modules can be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">At an upper end of holding member <b>61</b>, an abutting portion <b>64</b> is provided, which abuts on expanded section <b>35</b> of bolt <b>31</b>. Abutting portion <b>64</b> abuts on expanded section <b>35</b> of bolt <b>31</b>, to prevent rotation of bolt <b>31</b> when nut <b>39</b> is fastened.</p>

At this time, expanded section <b>35</b> comes to abut on one or both of the vertical wall portion <b>64</b><i>a </i>and horizontal projection <b>64</b><i>b </i>of abutting portion <b>64</b> and, as a result, co-rotation can be prevented. Expanded section <b>35</b> of bolt <b>31</b> has a rectangular shape when viewed two-dimensionally and, hence, it has a pair of sides extending in parallel. These sides abut opposite vertical wall portions <b>64</b><i>a </i>of adjacent holding member <b>61</b>. As the two sides of expanded section <b>35</b> abut, larger torque can be accommodated.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In order to more effectively prevent co-rotation of bolt <b>31</b>, friction stabilizing agent may be applied to increase coefficient of friction between metal terminal <b>41</b> and expanded section <b>35</b> of bolt <b>31</b>.</p>

When torque is applied to nut <b>39</b> and expanded section <b>35</b> co-rotates, inner side surface of trench <b>36</b> comes to abut on the side surface of horizontal projection <b>64</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the present embodiment, vertical wall portion <b>64</b><i>a </i>is adapted to abut on the side surface of expanded section <b>35</b> and horizontal projection <b>64</b><i>b </i>is adapted to abut on the inner side surface of trench <b>36</b> at the bottom surface of expanded section <b>35</b> and, therefore, even when a high torque is applied, co-rotation of bolt <b>31</b> can surely be prevented.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, since the torque applied to nut <b>39</b> is received by abutting portion <b>64</b> provided at holding member <b>61</b>, the force applied to metal terminal <b>41</b> can be reduced.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the present embodiment, the structure of insulator <b>43</b> is changed such that insulator <b>43</b> serves to prevent dropping and co-rotation of bolt <b>31</b>.

Further, at a lower surface of insulator <b>43</b> and lower side of drop preventing section <b>45</b>, an engaging projection <b>46</b> is formed, protruded downward.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Expanded section <b>35</b> of bolt <b>31</b> abuts on drop preventing section <b>45</b> and, therefore, dropping from metal terminal <b>41</b> is prevented. Further, as the expanded section <b>35</b> of bolt <b>31</b> is surrounded by wall portion <b>47</b> provided in drop preventing section <b>45</b>, rotation of expanded section <b>35</b> is prevented by drop preventing section <b>45</b> when torque is applied to nut <b>39</b>, and hence, co-rotation can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">At this time, as the engaging projection <b>46</b> is provided at the bottom surface of insulator <b>43</b> and engaging projection <b>46</b> is inserted to recessed portion <b>13</b><i>c </i>of lid <b>13</b><i>b</i>, positional deviation of insulator <b>43</b> can be prevented, and co-rotation of bolt <b>31</b> can more reliably be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Further, metal terminal <b>41</b> in accordance with the present embodiment has the same shape as that of Embodiment 1. Therefore, as in Embodiment 1, even when large stress is applied to the terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c</i>, connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>deforms and, therefore, the stress applied to the fixing portion between metal terminal <b>41</b> and case <b>13</b> can be alleviated.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Further, an upper end of wall portion <b>47</b> abuts on flange <b>35</b><i>a </i>from below, and therefore, bolt <b>31</b> is prevented from dropping down.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Metal terminal <b>41</b> has, as in Embodiment 1 and Embodiment 2, fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a</i>, connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>continuous to fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>in a bending direction, and terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>continuous to connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>in the bending direction.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, as in Embodiment 1, connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>may not necessarily have a plate shape, and may have a bent shape. For instance, connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>may have two bent portions and have an approximately Z shape when viewed from the side.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">At a bent portion <b>41</b><i>t </i>positioned at a boundary between fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>and connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>and a bent portion <b>41</b><i>u </i>positioned at a boundary between connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>and terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>of metal terminal <b>41</b>, inside corner (inner angle side of bent portion) is depressed in a dent to draw a curve, to form stiffness reduced portions. Inner surface of dents at bent portions <b>41</b><i>t </i>and <b>41</b><i>u </i>forming the stiffness reduced portions do not necessarily have a curved surface.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Consequently, in the step of fastening bus bar <b>81</b> by applying torque to nut <b>39</b>, bent portions <b>41</b><i>t </i>and <b>41</b><i>u </i>forming the stiffness reduced portions deform, and therefore, transmission of the fastening force applied to nut <b>39</b> to fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>can be reduced. Thus, possibility of loosening of rivet <b>51</b> and deformation of insulator <b>43</b> or gasket <b>59</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Particularly, if any force is applied in a direction of moving terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>upward/downward, it is transmitted as the force moving fixing piece <b>41</b><i>a </i>upward/downward. Therefore, such force is problematic as it leads to loosening of rivet <b>51</b>. In the structure of the present embodiment, bent portions <b>41</b><i>t </i>and <b>41</b><i>u </i>are depressed to have dents and, therefore, stiffness can be lowered particularly with respect to the force in the direction of moving terminal piece <b>41</b><i>c </i>upward/downward. Consequently, the problematic loosening of rivet <b>51</b> can effectively be prevented. As a result, degradation of sealing effect attained by insulator <b>43</b> or gasket <b>59</b> can effectively be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, in the present embodiment, dents are formed to draw a curve at the inside corners of bent portions <b>41</b><i>t </i>and <b>41</b><i>u </i>and, as a result, radius of curvature at the inside corner becomes larger. This alleviates stress concentration at the inside corners of bent portions <b>41</b><i>t </i>and <b>41</b><i>u</i>. As a result, decrease in strength of bent portions <b>41</b><i>t </i>and <b>41</b><i>u </i>can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In addition, in the present embodiment, the stiffness reduced portions are provided only in the bent portions <b>41</b><i>t </i>and <b>41</b><i>u</i>. If the stiffness is simply to be reduced, plate thickness of metal terminal <b>41</b> may be reduced for the entire length. If the plate thickness is reduced for the entire length of metal terminal <b>41</b>, the ratio of cross sectional area/surface area of metal terminal <b>41</b> decreases, resulting in a problem of heat build-up caused by self-heating. By reducing plate thickness locally as in the present embodiment, decrease in the ratio of cross sectional area/surface area can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Though the stiffness reduced portions are formed by providing dents on the inside corners of bent portions <b>41</b><i>t </i>and <b>41</b><i>u </i>in the present embodiment, it is also possible to form the stiffness reduced portion by grinding down the outside corner (outer angle side of bent portion).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Only one of the bent portions <b>41</b><i>t </i>and <b>41</b><i>u </i>may be processed to be the stiffness reduced portion.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As described above, a bent portion may be provided in connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>so that connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>has a bent shape. In that case, the bent portion inside connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>may also be formed as a stiffness reduced portion. Further, bent portions <b>41</b><i>t </i>and <b>41</b><i>u </i>may not be formed as the stiffness reduced portions and only one or more of the bent portions inside the connecting piece <b>41</b><i>b </i>may be formed as the stiffness reduced portions.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Further, it is also possible to form the stiffness reduced portion by making narrower the width of metal terminal <b>41</b> only at bent portions <b>41</b><i>t </i>and <b>41</b><i>u</i>. The stiffness reduced portion may be formed by the combination of these methods.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The stiffness reduced portion at the bent portion of metal terminal <b>41</b> as described with reference to Embodiment 3 may also be formed in the structures of Embodiment 1 and Embodiment 2.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows how easily the metal terminals deform to load, comparing the metal terminal provided with the stiffness reduced portion in accordance with the present invention and a metal terminal not provided with the stiffness reduced portion.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, when the stiffness reduced portion is provided, deformation is 1.5 times higher to the same load, than when the stiffness reduce portion is not provided. Specifically, transmission of external force can be reduced to &#x2154;. As a result, even if a force sufficient to cause compressed gasket <b>59</b> to expand 0.03 mm when the stiffness reduced portion is not provided, the expansion can be reduced to 0.02 mm when the stiffness reduced portion is provided. This secures squeeze of the sealing rubber and, typically, its life can be made longer by about 5 to about 10 years.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows results of calculation when a metal plate having the plate thickness of 1.0 mm was used and the minimum thickness at the stiffness reduced portion was set to 0.7 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a reference example of a metal terminal <b>141</b> provided with the stiffness reduced portion. Metal terminal <b>141</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is bent only once. Specifically, it has an L-shape, with only one bent portion <b>141</b><i>t</i>. An inside corner of bent portion <b>141</b><i>t </i>is depressed to form a dent, so that the stiffness reduced portion thinner than other portions is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">If there is one or more bent portions, it is possible to form the stiffness reduced portion at the bent portion. Therefore, the effect of alleviating the force applied to terminal piece <b>141</b><i>c </i>of metal terminal <b>141</b> at the stiffness reduced portion and reducing transmission to fixed piece <b>141</b><i>a </i>can be attained.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the scope of the present invention being interpreted by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The electrode structure and the method of manufacturing battery device in accordance with the present invention allow temporary fixing with an insulator. Therefore, temporary fixing of a bolt to a metal terminal can be done easily. Further, using the temporarily fixed bolt, a bus bar can easily be attached to the electrode.</p>
