<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This nonprovisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) on Patent Application No. 10-2007-0141967 filed in Republic of Korea on Dec. 31, 2007, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display (LCD) including a back light unit, and more particularly, to a liquid crystal display (LCD) in which an infrared rays (IR) source is used as a back light unit and a multi-touch system using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, as development is rapidly made to an information-oriented society, flat panel displays (FPD) having excellent characteristics that are made thin and light and that consume a small amount of power are required. Among the FPDs, liquid crystal displays (LCD) have high resolution, picture quality, and color display characteristics so that the LCDs are actively applied to the monitors of notebooks or desktops.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, in an LCD, two substrates in which electric field generating electrodes are formed, respectively, are provided so that the surfaces on which the two electrodes are formed face each other, liquid crystal is implanted between the two substrates, and a voltage is applied to the two electrodes so that liquid crystal molecules are moved by a generated electric field to display an image by the transmittance of light that varies with the movement of the liquid crystal molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since a common LCD does not emit light by itself but controls the transmittance of light, an additional light source is required.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, a back light is provided on the rear surface of an LCD panel and the light emitted from the back light is incident on the LCD panel to control the amount of light in accordance with the arrangement of liquid crystal and to display an image.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The back light is divided into a direct light type back light provided under the LCD panel to directly illuminate the entire surfaces of the substrates and a side light type back light provided on one side or on both sides of the LCD panel to reflect light by a light guide plate and a reflection plate to diffuse the reflected light.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Here, in the direct light type back light, since the light emitted from a lamp is emitted to the front of the LCD panel, the light guide plate is not required and a plurality of lamps can be used. Therefore, since the light use efficiency of the direct light type back light is high, the direct light type back light can be easily managed, and the size of a display surface is not limited, the direct light type back light is used for a large screen LCD.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) in which the light emitted from a cold cathode fluorescent tube is reflected by the reflection plate and a milk-white scatter plate is provided on the reflection channel of the light so that the light locally having uniform illumination illuminates the LCD has been used for the LCD.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, since the thickness of such a back light cannot be made small so that the LCD becomes complicated and enlarged, recently, a technology, in which a light emitting diode (LED) that consumes a small amount of power and that has high response speed and a semi-permanent life is used as a bipolar electrode device that emits light only when current flows for a surface light source so that the back light is made thin and brightness is improved, is suggested.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The conventional back light unit using the LED light source and the LCD to which the back light unit is applied will be schematically described as follow with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view of a conventional back light unit consisting of a plurality of R, G, and B LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic sectional view of an LCD including the conventional back light unit consisting of the plurality of R, G, and B LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional back light unit <b>61</b> includes LED light sources <b>63</b> each consisting of a plurality of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) LEDs <b>63</b>R, <b>63</b>G, and <b>63</b>B, which are repeatedly arranged under the back light unit <b>61</b> in column and row directions.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The LCD to which the back light unit having such a structure is applied will be described as follows with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the LCD to which the conventional back light unit is applied includes the back light unit <b>61</b> in which the LED light sources <b>63</b> each consisting of the plurality of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) LEDs <b>63</b>R, <b>63</b>G, and <b>63</b>B are arranged and a diffusion sheet <b>11</b>, a prism sheet <b>13</b>, and an LCD panel <b>30</b> provided on the back light unit <b>61</b> to secure a desired view angle.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Here, a reflection plate (not shown) for preventing light from leaking is provided under the LED light source <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, the LCD panel <b>30</b> includes a lower array substrate <b>311</b> on which a switching device for driving the LCD panel is formed, a color filter array substrate <b>41</b> on which an image is displayed by driving the switching device, and a liquid crystal layer (not shown) provided between the lower array substrate <b>31</b> and the color filter array substrate <b>41</b> to control the transmittance of light while moving in a certain direction in accordance with an electric field direction.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">On the other hand, a touch panel <b>51</b> is attached onto the LCD panel <b>30</b> so that a display to which the touch panel <b>51</b> is applied is realized.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic view illustrating the conventional multi-touch system in which infrared (IR) rays LED modules and cameras are arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view illustrating the touch sense image seen from a first camera when the multi-touch system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> operates.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic view illustrating the intensity of an IR light source when the IR light source on the side of the conventional multi-touch system is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the conventional multi-touch system includes the LCD to which the touch panel <b>51</b> is attached, the plurality of first to fourth cameras <b>71</b>A, <b>71</b>B, <b>71</b>C, and <b>71</b>D provided at the edges, the first to fourth IR light source modules <b>73</b>A, <b>73</b>B, <b>73</b>C, and <b>73</b>D provided between the two adjacent cameras.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the conventional multi-touch system having the above structure, the IR LED modules operate as the back light so that the first to fourth cameras <b>71</b>A, <b>71</b>B, <b>71</b>C, and <b>71</b>D sense a touch object <b>75</b><i>a </i>in a dark environment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At this time, for the first camera <b>71</b>A to sense touch, among the first to fourth IR LED modules <b>73</b>A, <b>73</b>B, <b>73</b>C, and <b>73</b>D, only the first and second IR LED modules <b>73</b>A and <b>73</b>B are to be turned on and the third and fourth IR LED modules <b>73</b>C and <b>73</b>D are to be turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the above structure, when the first camera <b>71</b> senses the touch object <b>75</b><i>a</i>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, since the first and second IR LED modules <b>73</b>A and <b>73</b>B operate to the first camera <b>71</b>A as the back light, the first camera <b>71</b>A displays the touch object <b>75</b><i>a </i>where IR reflection is generated to be black and displays the remaining part <b>75</b><i>b </i>directly incident on the first camera <b>71</b>A without reflecting IR to be white to sense the touch object <b>75</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The conventional LCD and the multi-touch system to which the conventional LCD is applied have the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the conventional LCD and the multi-touch system to which the conventional LCD is applied, the first camera <b>71</b>A and the first IR light source <b>73</b>A are all positioned on the sides so that the directional vector components of the first camera <b>71</b>A and the first IR light source <b>73</b>A are not the same horizontal line but are close to similar horizontal lines through the control of the positions of the first camera <b>71</b>A and the first IR light source <b>73</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Due to such a structural defect, the light of the IR light source positioned on the side is directly incident on the camera on the side or is reflected and incident, which severely deteriorates the operation of the touch system.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Therefore, the image of the camera can be distorted by an extremely small error to cause an erroneous operation. In addition, when a product is actually manufactured, it is difficult to correctly set the product.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, like in the conventional art, in the technology of providing the IR light source on the side, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the intensity of IR light is reduced away from the IR light source module <b>73</b>A. Therefore, the intensity of the reflected light of the touch object is not uniform so that the efficiency of the system deteriorates.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the back light unit according to the present invention includes a plurality of light emitting diode (LED) light sources <b>163</b> each consisting of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) LEDs <b>163</b>R, <b>163</b>G, and <b>163</b>B and IR light sources <b>165</b> and the LED light sources <b>163</b> and the IR light sources <b>165</b> are repeatedly arranged in column and row directions in units of the three LED light sources <b>163</b> and IR light sources <b>165</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Here, the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) LEDs <b>163</b>R, <b>163</b>G, and <b>163</b>B and the IR light sources <b>165</b> are arranged on a uniform regulation, however, if necessary, can be differently arranged. Here, the materials of the IR light sources <b>165</b> such as IR LED or IR electroluminescence (EL) are not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">On the other hand, according to another embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, one of the plurality of LEDs <b>263</b>R, <b>263</b>G, and <b>263</b>B and IR light sources <b>265</b> are alternately and repeatedly arranged in the bottom cover (not shown) of the back light unit <b>261</b> in column and row directions. Here, the materials of the IR light sources <b>265</b> such as IR LED or IR EL are not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">On the other hand, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, fluorescent lamps <b>363</b> formed of CCFLs or EEFLs and the plurality of IR light sources <b>365</b> are alternately and repeatedly arranged in the bottom cover (not shown) of the back light unit <b>361</b> in a row direction.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Here, the materials of the IR light sources <b>365</b> such as IR LED or IR EL are not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition, the basic back light to which the IR light sources are added is a fluorescent lamp unlike in a conventional art. However, the structure of the back light is not limited but an RGB LED and a white LED can be used for the back light.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The number of IR light sources can vary in accordance with the intensity of required IR light.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, the arrangement of the IR light sources is not limited but the arrangement and positions of the IR light sources can be controlled in accordance with the brightness, the radiation angle, and the operation characteristics of the IR light sources.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">On the other hand, the LCD to which the back light unit having such a structure is applied will be described as follows with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic sectional view of an LCD including the back light unit consisting of the plurality of R, G, and B LEDs and IR light sources according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the LCD to which the back light unit according to the present invention is applied includes a back light unit <b>161</b> consisting of the LED light sources <b>163</b> each consisting of the plurality of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) LEDs <b>163</b>R, <b>163</b>G, and <b>163</b>B and the IR light sources <b>165</b> and a diffusion sheet <b>111</b>, a prism sheet <b>113</b>, and an LCD panel <b>130</b> provided on the back light unit <b>161</b> to secure a desired view angle.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Here, a reflection plate (not shown) for preventing light from leaking is provided under the LED light source <b>163</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In addition, the LCD panel <b>130</b> includes a lower array substrate <b>141</b> on which a switching device for driving the LCD panel is formed, a color filter array substrate <b>131</b> on which an image is displayed by driving the switching device, and a liquid crystal layer (not shown) provided between the lower array substrate <b>141</b> and the color filter array substrate <b>131</b> to control the transmittance of light while moving in a certain direction in accordance with an electric field direction.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">On the other hand, a touch panel <b>151</b> is attached onto the LCD panel <b>130</b> so that an LCD to which the touch panel <b>151</b> is applied is realized.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At this time, although not shown in the drawing, the touch panel <b>151</b> includes an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate (not shown) attached onto the upper surface of the LCD panel <b>130</b> and a position sensor film (not shown) and an ITO film (not shown) attached onto the ITO substrate (not shown) to sense the X and Y position coordinates of an object.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">An IR light transmission filter <b>177</b> for using only the IR light is provided in a camera <b>171</b> provided on the upper side of the LCD <b>100</b> having the above structure.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Therefore, the LCD <b>100</b> senses touch using a principle in which the image incident on the camera <b>171</b> varies as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The IR light transmitted from the IR light sources <b>165</b> added to the back light unit <b>161</b> onto the surface of the LCD <b>100</b> is reflected by a touch object <b>181</b> to be incident on the camera <b>171</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Then, only the touch object <b>181</b> region is extracted from the entire image so that the touch object <b>181</b> region undergoes a signal processing process and that a clear touch sense image is created.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">On the other hand, the multi-touch system to which the LCD having the above structure is applied will be described as follows with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a schematic plan view illustrating a multi-touch system using the LCD to which the back light unit according to the present invention is applied according to still another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a view schematically illustrating the traveling channel of reflected light from the IR light sources of the multi-touch system using the LCD to which the back light unit according to the present invention is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic view illustrating a touch point sensing image after the image in a touch surface region is signal processed among camera images in the multi-touch system according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the multi-touch system to which the LCD according to the present invention is applied includes an LCD <b>400</b> to which the touch panel <b>151</b> is attached and on whose entire surface an image display region <b>403</b> is provided and a plurality of first to fourth cameras <b>471</b>A, <b>471</b>B, <b>471</b>C, and <b>471</b>D provided at the edges.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Here, the entire surface of the LCD <b>400</b> forms IR illumination no less than a certain level by the IR light sources of the back light modules and the number of IR light sources varies in accordance with the required intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, the IR light sources are not limited if the IR light sources do not affect the picture quality observed by naked eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The range of the image incident on the cameras <b>471</b>A, <b>471</b>B, <b>471</b>C, and <b>471</b>D is determined so that a user can secure the region corresponding to the range in which the user touches the touch surface. In particular, the cameras can photograph all of the ranges of the LCD only when an image angle is close to 90 degrees. However, the image angle is not necessarily fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, like in the relationship between the second camera <b>471</b>B and a fifth camera <b>471</b>E, when the fifth camera <b>471</b>E is remote from the LCD <b>400</b>, the image angle formed by the camera and a lens can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an IR light transmission filter <b>477</b> for using only the IR light is provided in the first camera <b>471</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Therefore, the LCD <b>400</b> senses touch using a principle in which the image incident on the camera <b>471</b>A varies as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The IR light transmitted from a back light (not shown) to the surface of the LCD <b>400</b> is reflected by a touch object <b>421</b> to be incident on the camera <b>471</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, only a touch surface <b>475</b><i>a </i>region is extracted from the entire image so that the touch surface <b>475</b><i>a </i>region undergoes a signal processing process and that a clear touch sense image is created. That is, since the upper and lower images in the entire image of the camera are unnecessary parts that reduce the speed of the system, only a necessary part is extracted. That is, since the IR light incident from the IR light sources is reflected from the touch surface <b>475</b><i>a </i>to be incident on the camera <b>471</b>A, the touch surface <b>475</b><i>a </i>is displayed white. Since the IR light is transmitted to the front surface of the LCD and is not incident on the camera <b>471</b>A in the remaining background <b>475</b><i>b</i>, the remaining background <b>475</b><i>b </i>is displayed black. However, in the image illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the light and shade of the background <b>475</b><i>b </i>and the light and shade of the touch surface <b>475</b><i>a </i>can be reversed in accordance with a method of processing the image.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The LCD to which the IR light sources according to the present invention are applied and the multi-touch system using the same have the following effects.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the LCD to which the IR light sources according to the present invention are applied and the multi-touch system using the same, since the IR light sources are added to the back light to increase the intensity of the IR light of the LCD and to provide an effective use environment to the system in which an IR light receiving sensor and the cameras are used, the utilization region of the LCD can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition, according to the present invention, although the IR light sources are added to the back light, since the IR is not sensed by human eyes, the picture quality is not affected.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">According to the present invention, the display having a multi-touch function can be manufactured using the IR.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Furthermore, according to the present invention, since the IR light sources are attached to the LCD, it is not necessary to realize the sensor system by mounting the IR light sources in the outside like in the conventional art.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In addition, according to the present invention, the mechanical size of the sensor system in which the external IR light sources are used like in the conventional art can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be comprised within the scope of the following claims.</p>
