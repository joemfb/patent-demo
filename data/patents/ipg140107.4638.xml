<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of this disclosure generally relate to a communication system, and more particularly, to a low power radio frequency to digital receiver which may perform arbitrary bandpass filtering in the radio frequency (RF) domain and may down convert the filtered RF signals in a digital domain.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A radio receiver may convert signals from a radio antenna to a useable form. Design architectures for converting signals, received from an antenna, may include a low noise amplifier (LNA), down conversion mixers, voltage controller oscillator (VCO), low pass filters (LPFs), synthesizer loop, reference generator, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital signal processor (DSP) which may have a demodulator. These blocks of RF units and analog baseband and mixed signal circuits in the architecture may consume a significant portion of design efforts and implementation cost for an integrated receiver design. The use of non-digital circuits may also raise an issue of limited voltage (amplitude) headroom as the process technology advances and supply voltage decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one architecture, designed to reduce complexity and alleviate headroom issues by eliminating most RF and analog baseband circuits, input signals from the antenna may be amplified by an LNA and directly sampled by an ADC. Most of the analog signal processing may be deferred into the DSP. This architecture may introduce stringent requirements on the ADC. The sampling frequency of the ADC may be the Nyquist rate of RF carrier frequency, which may be higher than the signal bandwidth. It may result in an overhead of design complexity and power consumption of the synchronous sampling clock for the ADC. Even though the under sampling strategy may be adopted, extra noise may be folded into the baseband that may degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a system and method that overcomes the above problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A radio frequency to digital receiver has a modulator sampling a signal at a first rate. The receiver has at least one processing unit. The processing unit has a plurality of digital bandpass filters separating the signal and recombining the signal at a rate less than the first rate. The processing unit has a digital down converter adjusting frequency offset or centering the signal at the rate less than the first rate. The receiver has at least one rate control buffer coupled to adjacent processing units when two or more processing units are within the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A multi-tone up converter has a digital up converter configured for receiving a signal. A plurality of digital bandpass filters is coupled to the digital up converter configured for separating the signal. A digital router is coupled to the plurality of bandpass filters for combining the signal. A digital-to-analog converter is coupled to the digital router for transforming the signal into an analog signal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method for reducing power consumption on a radio frequency receiver comprising: receiving a signal; filtering the signal; sampling the signal at a first rate; and, in at least one processing unit: separating the signal into sub-bands at a processing rate less than the first rate; recombining the signal from the sub-bands at the processing rate; and correcting a frequency offset or centering the signal at the processing rate.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram of a generalized architecture of a receiver <b>100</b> having homogeneous processing may be shown. The receiver <b>100</b> may have a low power radio frequency (RF) to digital baseband design. The receiver <b>100</b> may be described below in regards to a mobile platform. The receiver <b>100</b> may be placed within a smartphone, cellphone or the like that processes incoming RF communications. The receiver <b>100</b> may also be used in software-defined radios (SDRs), smart radios, in-vehicle communications, infotainment for vehicles, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The receiver <b>100</b> may perform the process of bandpass filtering, sampling, down-converting and decimating in a low complexity and power efficient manner. Unlike existing approaches, which may consist of several building blocks across RF, analog and digital domains and run at very high speed clock rates in digital circuits, the receiver <b>100</b> may utilize a combination of multirate digital signal processing (MDSP) and a bandpass continuous time delta sigma analog-to-digital converter (BP-CT-&#x394;&#x3a3;-ADC) to execute the above processes in a streamline and transparent mechanism running at the clock rate of interesting signal bandwidth. This may provide shorter latency from input signals to output data, smaller number of required building blocks and less power consumption than previous architectures. Furthermore, the design may remove stringent requirements placed on analog-to-digital converters (ADC). The receiver <b>100</b> may have building blocks that are either analog or digital circuits reducing the RF circuits making the receiver <b>100</b> resistant to the process variation in modern very large scale integration (VLSI) technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The receiver <b>100</b> may perform arbitrary bandpass filtering (BPF) in an RF domain. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the receiver <b>100</b> may down convert the filtered RF signals in the digital domain. The receiver <b>100</b> may employ a mixed-signal circuit design strategy and process the signals at the Nyquist rate. The receiver <b>100</b> may provide significant advantages of low power consumption and low complexity design. The receiver <b>100</b> may be based on the techniques of a MDSP and a BP-CT-&#x394;&#x3a3;-ADC <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Instead of processing the signals at a rate that is a multiple of the carrier frequency, receiver <b>100</b> may deal with the signals at a rate that covers the signal bandwidth. This decrease in processing rate may save the processing bandwidth and reduce the overall power consumption. The low power RF to digital baseband receiver <b>100</b> may also have building blocks that may be programmed and adjusted to the desired input frequency region and the output data rate through software defined modules. The MDSP portion of the receiver <b>100</b> may be reconfigured to become a multi-tone up-converter, which may serve as a tone generator for the calibration process in the beginning of the receiver <b>100</b> operation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the embodiment provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, incoming RF signals may be introduced through an antenna, not shown. The antenna may receive radio waves and convert them into electric current. The antenna may be coupled to an amplifier <b>102</b>. The amplifier <b>102</b> may be a low noise amplifier (LNA) <b>102</b> and may increase the power of a signal received by the antenna of the receiver <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The LNA <b>102</b> may be coupled to a modulator <b>104</b>. The modulator <b>104</b> may receive the signal from the amplifier <b>102</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the modulator <b>104</b> may be a BP-CT-&#x394;&#x3a3;-ADC <b>104</b>A and may process the signal by filtering and sampling it. By bringing the signal into a digital domain, the BP-CT-&#x394;&#x3a3;-ADC <b>104</b>A may provide noise immunity, robustness and flexibility and may introduce potential improvements in performance, power consumption and cost reduction. The BP-CT-&#x394;&#x3a3;-ADC <b>104</b>A may allow high speed operation while keeping power consumption and chip area low. The samples of the filtered signal may be generated at the BP-CT-&#x394;&#x3a3;-ADC <b>104</b>A output at the rate of F<sub>in</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>k </sub>as shown as X<sub>k</sub>(n). The output may offer a high degree of programmability and may be ideal for multi-standard RF receivers <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The BP-CT-&#x394;&#x3a3;-ADC <b>104</b>A may down convert the incoming signal received by the LNA <b>102</b> into baseband. The modulator <b>104</b> may be suited to perform bandpass ADC on narrow band signals. The filtered signal may be digitized by a continuous-time delta sigma (CT-&#x394;&#x3a3;) portion of the modulator <b>104</b>. The BP-CT-&#x394;&#x3a3;-ADC <b>104</b>A may mix the input signal and digitize it, which may require amplification by the LNA <b>102</b>. The BP-CT-&#x394;&#x3a3;-ADC <b>104</b>A may make use of an integer number of sinusoidal pulses for feedback. The feedback basis function may be inherently bandpass. This may considerably improve the performance of the modulator <b>104</b> in the presence of time delay jitter and pulse-width jitter. Also, the sampling frequency of the modulator <b>104</b> may be less than the center frequency to which the modulator <b>104</b> is tuned.</p>
