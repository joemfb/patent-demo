<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure relates to debulking of composite layups. More particularly, the disclosure relates to a circumferential pressure debulking system and method for debulking composite layups.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">During the course of various fabrication processes, including the aerospace industry for example and without limitation, it may be necessary to debulk composite layups. Conventionally, this may be accomplished by applying layers of protective film, breather material and vacuum film over the layup at the fabrication stage which requires debulking. Sealant tape may be applied around the periphery of the part, allowing the vacuum film to be completely sealed. A vacuum port may be installed through the vacuum film. Shop vacuum may be applied to the assembly, allowing vacuum pressure to squeeze and compact the layup. Other devices known as vacuum debulk boxes may apply vacuum pressure from above the layup only.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional methods of debulking composite layups may be time-consuming and laborious. Furthermore, the methods may be required many times throughout the layup process and the materials used in the methods may not be re-used. This may contribute to the overall time and cost of the fabrication process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, a circumferential pressure debulking system and method for debulking composite layups which is expeditious and cost-effective is needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure is generally directed to a pressure debulking system. An illustrative embodiment of the pressure debulking system includes a debulking chamber having a debulking chamber interior, a pressure bladder having a bladder interior provided in the debulking chamber interior, a vacuum port disposed in fluid communication with the debulking chamber interior and a pressure port disposed in fluid communication with the debulking chamber interior.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure is further generally directed to a pressure debulking method. An illustrative embodiment of the method includes providing a composite layup, providing a chamber having a pressure bladder in the chamber, expanding the pressure bladder by inducing a vacuum in the chamber, placing the composite layup in the chamber and applying the pressure bladder against the composite layup by applying pressure against the pressure bladder.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The disclosure is generally directed to a circumferential pressure debulking system and method suitable for debulking composite layups in composite fabrication processes. The system and method may be applicable to any of a variety of industries including the aerospace industry, for example and without limitation. The system and method may facilitate the application of circumferential pressure to a composite layup to debulk the composite layup in a manner which is expeditious and cost-effective.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an illustrative embodiment of the pressure debulking system, hereinafter system, is generally indicated by reference numeral <b>1</b>. The system <b>1</b> may include a debulking chamber <b>2</b> having a debulking chamber interior <b>3</b>. A chamber opening <b>5</b> (one of which is shown) may be provided at each end of the debulking chamber <b>2</b>. A circumferential chamber end flange <b>2</b><i>a </i>may extend outwardly from the debulking chamber <b>2</b> at each chamber opening <b>5</b>. A vacuum port <b>10</b> and a pressure port and regulator <b>12</b> having a pressure gauge <b>13</b> may be disposed in fluid communication with the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b>. A pressure safety valve <b>16</b> may also communicate with the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A resilient or elastomeric pressure bladder <b>6</b> may be provided in the chamber interior <b>3</b> of the debulking chamber <b>2</b>. The pressure bladder <b>6</b> may have a bladder interior <b>7</b> which is disposed in a fluid-tight seal with respect to the chamber interior <b>3</b>. The pressure bladder <b>6</b> may also include an exterior bladder surface <b>6</b><i>a </i>which faces the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b> of the debulking chamber <b>2</b> and an interior bladder surface <b>6</b><i>b </i>which faces the bladder interior <b>7</b> of the pressure bladder <b>6</b>. Each end of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> may have a bladder mouth <b>8</b> (one of which is shown) which communicates with the bladder interior <b>7</b>. Each bladder mouth <b>8</b> of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> may correspond in orientation and position to the corresponding chamber opening <b>5</b> at each end of the debulking chamber <b>2</b>. The pressure bladder <b>6</b> may be attached to the debulking chamber <b>2</b> in a fluid-tight seal according to any suitable technique which is known to those skilled in the art. For example and without limitation, a bladder anchor slot <b>4</b> may be provided in each chamber end flange <b>2</b><i>a</i>. Each end of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> may be anchored in the corresponding bladder anchor slot <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, in typical application of the system <b>1</b>, a vacuum may be induced in the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b> of the debulking chamber <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This may be accomplished by releasing gas <b>34</b> such as air, for example and without limitation, from the debulking chamber <b>2</b> through the vacuum port <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The vacuum induced in the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b> may expand the pressure bladder <b>6</b> and draw the exterior surface <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> against the interior surface of the debulking chamber <b>2</b>. This may provide optimum clearance for insertion of a composite layup <b>22</b> into the bladder interior <b>7</b> of the pressure bladder <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The composite layup <b>22</b> may be inserted into the bladder interior <b>7</b> of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> through the chamber opening <b>5</b> of the debulking chamber <b>2</b> and the bladder mouth <b>8</b> of the pressure bladder <b>6</b>. The composite layup <b>22</b> may be wound in generally cylindrical form around a mandrel <b>20</b>. The composite layup <b>22</b> may be a composite part such as a hat-shaped layup or a round or otherwise-shaped composite tube, for example and without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a breather string or strip <b>26</b> may be applied to the composite layup <b>22</b>. The breather string/strip <b>26</b> may extend from the bladder interior <b>7</b> of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> through the bladder mouth <b>8</b> and from the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b> through the chamber opening <b>5</b> of the debulking chamber <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the vacuum in the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b> of the debulking chamber <b>2</b> may be released by terminating flow of the gas <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) from the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b> through the vacuum port <b>10</b>. This may cause the pressure bladder <b>6</b> to relax and the exterior bladder surface <b>6</b><i>a </i>to disengage the interior surface of the debulking chamber <b>2</b>. A chamber end plate <b>30</b> may be placed over each chamber opening <b>5</b> of the debulking chamber <b>2</b>. A central plate opening <b>31</b> may extend through the chamber end plate <b>30</b>. The breather string/strip <b>26</b> may extend through the plate opening <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, pressure may be applied to the exterior bladder surface <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> for a selected period of time. Application of pressure to the pressure bladder <b>6</b> may be accomplished by introducing a pressurized gas <b>36</b>, such as air for example and without limitation, into the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b> of the debulking chamber <b>2</b> through the pressure port and regulator <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the pressurized gas <b>36</b> may substantially fill the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b> and impinge against the exterior surface <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> such that the interior bladder surface <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> exerts pressure of corresponding magnitude against the composite layup <b>22</b>. Therefore, the pressure bladder <b>6</b> may compress and debulk the composite layup <b>22</b>. The magnitude of pressure which is exerted by the pressure bladder <b>6</b> against the composite layup <b>22</b> may correspond to the magnitude of pressure of the pressurized gas <b>36</b>. This pressure may be selected by operation of the pressure port and regulator <b>12</b> and indicated by the pressure gauge <b>13</b> of the pressure port and regulator <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">After a period of time which may be selected according to the debulking requirements of the composite layup <b>22</b>, flow of the pressurized gas <b>36</b> into the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b> may be terminated to release the interior bladder surface <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> from the exterior surface of the composite layup <b>22</b>. The debulking process may be repeated as often as necessary based on the particular debulking requirements of the composite layup <b>22</b>. Furthermore, the magnitude of pressure of the pressurized gas <b>36</b>, and thus the magnitude of pressure of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> against the composite layup <b>22</b>, may be adjusted throughout a range of possible pressures by operation of the pressure port and regulator <b>12</b>. The pressure bladder <b>6</b> may be sized to eliminate wrinkling when expanded against the surface of the composite layup <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At the end of the debulking process, the composite layup <b>22</b> may be removed from the bladder interior <b>7</b> of the pressure bladder <b>6</b>. Accordingly, a vacuum may again be induced in the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b> to expand and draw the pressure bladder <b>6</b> against the interior surface of the debulking chamber <b>2</b> by flowing gas <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) from the debulking chamber interior <b>3</b>; the chamber end plate <b>30</b> may be removed from the chamber end flange <b>2</b><i>a</i>; and the mandrel <b>20</b> and debulked composite layup <b>22</b> thereon may be removed from the bladder interior <b>7</b> of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> through the bladder mouth <b>8</b> of the pressure bladder <b>6</b> and the chamber opening <b>5</b> of the debulking chamber <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in some applications it may be necessary to debulk an elongated composite layup <b>22</b> the length of which may be incapable of being positioned entirely within the confines of the bladder interior <b>7</b> of the pressure bladder <b>6</b>. Accordingly, a chamber end plate <b>30</b> having a plate opening <b>31</b> which is sized to accommodate the diameter or width of the composite layup <b>22</b> may be placed on the chamber end flange <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the debulking chamber <b>2</b>. During the debulking process, which may be carried out as was heretofore described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, both the composite layup <b>22</b> and the breather string <b>26</b> may protrude from the debulking chamber <b>2</b> through the plate opening <b>31</b> of the chamber end plate <b>30</b>.</p>
