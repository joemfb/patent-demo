<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Example embodiments relate to methods of inspecting structures, and more particularly, to methods of optically inspecting layer or pattern structures.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With an increase in the degree of integration of semiconductor devices the critical dimensions of structures may be reduced to tens of nanometers (nm). The critical dimensions of the structures may be measured by optical critical dimension (OCD) measurement. In OCD measurement, an approximate model may be formed and various intervening variables may be continuously changed to cancel differences in measurement between the model and structures to be inspected. In this process, a complex tool referred to as rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) may be required. Conventional OCD measurement may be problematic in that a model must be approximately formed and it is difficult to cancel a difference in measurement between the model and measurement structures.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It should be noted that these Figures are intended to illustrate the general characteristics of methods, structure and/or materials utilized in certain example embodiments and to supplement the written description provided below. These drawings are not, however, to scale and may not precisely reflect the precise structural or performance characteristics of any given embodiment, and should not be interpreted as defining or limiting the range of values or properties encompassed by example embodiments. For example, the relative thicknesses and positioning of molecules, layers, regions and/or structural elements may be reduced or exaggerated for clarity. The use of similar or identical reference numbers in the various drawings is intended to indicate the presence of a similar or identical element or feature.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Example embodiments of the inventive concepts will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which example embodiments are shown. Example embodiments of the inventive concepts may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the concept of example embodiments to those of ordinary skill in the art. In the drawings, the thicknesses of layers and regions are exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements, and thus their description will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled&#x201d; to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Like numbers indicate like elements throughout. As used herein the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements or layers should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; &#x201c;on&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly on&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will be understood that, although the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of example embodiments of the inventive concepts. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including,&#x201d; if used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Example embodiments of the inventive concepts may be described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of example embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example embodiments should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle may have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of example embodiments of the inventive concepts.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which example embodiments belong. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly-used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should also be noted that in some alternative implementations, the functions/acts noted may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two figures shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently and/or may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality/acts involved.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic illustrating an optical critical dimension (OCD) measurement apparatus <b>10</b> according to example embodiments of the inventive concepts. The OCD measurement apparatus <b>10</b> may measure the critical dimensions, thicknesses, and the like, of structures in a nondestructive method using light of a specific wavelength range. The OCD measurement apparatus <b>10</b> may be used, for example, to monitor process variation after preventive maintenance (PM).

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Techniques used in the OCD measurement apparatus <b>10</b> may be classified, for example, into scatterometry, ellipsometry, normal incidence reflectance spectrometry, normal incidence ellipsometry, and the like. Scatterometry may include, for example, two techniques. One technique may be spectroscopic scatterometry that uses a broad-band light source and measures properties of light scattered at a fixed angle. The light scattered at the fixed angle may be normally or diagonally incident on the surface of a substrate. The other technique may be angle-resolved scatterometry. The angle-resolved scatterometry may measure properties of light scattered at a wavelength fixed as a function of an incident angle using a laser, which may be a single-wavelength and/or narrow-band light source.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The OCD measurement apparatus <b>10</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the OCD measurement apparatus <b>10</b> may include a light source <b>100</b>, a projector <b>110</b>, a substrate support <b>120</b>, a first detector <b>130</b>, and a second detector <b>140</b>. The light source <b>100</b> may generate light. The light generated from the light source <b>100</b> may be normally or diagonally incident on the upper surface of a substrate S. The light generated from the light source <b>100</b> may have a single wavelength or multiple wavelengths. Light incident on the substrate S may have, for example, a single wavelength. The wavelength of the light incident on the substrate S may vary according to time or a purpose of an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to example embodiments, the light source <b>100</b> may be a broad-band wavelength light source. The broad-band wavelength light source may generate light of multiple wavelengths and may selectively generate light of a desired wavelength. The broad-band wavelength light source may generate light of a specific wavelength, for example, according to time or a purpose of an operator. According to example embodiments of the inventive concepts, the light source <b>100</b> may be a tunable laser. The tunable laser may generate light of multiple wavelengths and may selectively generate a laser beam of a desired wavelength. The tunable laser may generate light of a specific wavelength, for example, according to time or a purpose of an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to example embodiments of the inventive concepts, the light source <b>100</b> may generate light of multiple wavelengths. The light source <b>100</b> generating light of multiple wavelengths may be, for example, an incandescent bulb and the OCD measurement apparatus <b>10</b> may include a filter. The filter may select light of a desired wavelength from the light of multiple wavelengths. For example, the filter may be disposed adjacent to the light source <b>100</b> between the substrate support <b>120</b> and the light source <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The light source <b>100</b> may be included in the OCD measurement apparatus <b>10</b> or spaced apart from the OCD measurement apparatus <b>10</b>. When the light source <b>100</b> is spaced apart from the OCD measurement apparatus <b>10</b>, the OCD measurement apparatus <b>10</b> may further include a light guide so that light generated from the light source <b>100</b> can be guided to the substrate S.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first detector <b>130</b> may detect properties of light generated from the light source <b>100</b>. For example, by measuring the wavelength and polarization mode of light generated from the light source <b>100</b>, the first detector <b>130</b> may detect properties of the light. The first detector <b>130</b> may detect the properties of light from part of the light generated from the light source <b>100</b>. For example, a beam splitter <b>112</b> may redirect a portion of the light. A part of the light generated from the light source <b>100</b> may be radiated to the substrate S, a part may be radiated to the first detector <b>130</b>, and/or a part may be radiated to a blazed grating <b>114</b>. The blazed grating <b>114</b> may include a series of grooves and may change the incident angle of the light generated from the light source <b>100</b> using the grooves. The generated light may be directly radiated to the substrate S, the first detector <b>130</b>, the blazed grating <b>114</b> and/or radiated by a plurality of reflectors. Although not illustrated in the drawing, the first detector <b>130</b> may be connected with the second detector <b>140</b> and transfer light properties to the second detector <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The projector <b>110</b> may function to guide and radiate light generated from the light source <b>100</b> to the substrate S disposed on the substrate support <b>120</b>. The projector <b>110</b> may include a lens array including a condensing lens and various types of reflecting mirrors. The projector <b>110</b> may radiate light generated from the light source <b>100</b> to be normally incident on the upper surface of the substrate S. The projector <b>110</b> may radiate light generated from the light source <b>100</b> to be incident on the upper surface of the substrate S at a predetermined angle &#x2296;. Light incident on the substrate S may be radiated onto a measurement region of the substrate S or the entire region of the substrate S. When the incident light is radiated onto the measurement region of the substrate S, a process of scanning the entire substrate S may be additionally performed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A polarizing plate <b>116</b> may be between the light source <b>100</b> and the substrate support <b>120</b>. For example, the polarizing plate <b>116</b> may be adjacent to the substrate support <b>120</b>. Light generated from the light source <b>100</b> may have a random polarization, but may be specifically polarized by the polarizing plate <b>116</b>. The travel mode of the polarized light may include a transverse electric field (TE) mode and a transverse magnetic field (TM) mode. Properties of light radiated to the substrate S may be important factors for obtaining characteristics of structures. The properties of the light may be, for example, the wavelength and/or polarization mode of the light. Characteristics of structures may be, for example, the critical dimensions and/or thicknesses of the structures.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The substrate support <b>120</b> may support the substrate S. The substrate support <b>120</b> may be disposed to face the light source <b>100</b>. For example, the light source <b>100</b> may be disposed in a direction perpendicular or diagonal to the upper surface of the substrate support <b>120</b>. The substrate support <b>120</b> may include a body, multiple lift fingers, a fixing unit, and/or a driving unit (not shown). The multiple lift fingers may move up or down from the inside of the body to the upper surface of the body. The multiple lift fingers may move up and/or down to load and/or unload the substrate S on or from the body. The multiple lift fingers may be spaced apart from each other, for example, by the same distance. There may be, for example, three lift fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The fixing unit may function to fix the substrate S on the body of the substrate support <b>120</b> while structures formed on the substrate S are measured using the OCD measurement apparatus <b>10</b>. For example, the fixing unit may include a vacuum pump and vacuum lines. Multiple vacuum holes leading to the vacuum lines may be formed in the body and connect the vacuum holes with the vacuum pump. The fixing unit may fix the lower surface of the substrate S on the upper surface of the body using vacuum. The fixing unit may include an electrostatic generator. The fixing unit may fix the lower surface of the substrate S on the upper surface of the body using static electricity. The fixing unit may use vacuum and/or static electricity, but the type or fixing method of the fixing unit is not limited herein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The driving unit may be electrically connected with the body and may move the substrate S, fixed and supported on the body, in X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis directions. The driving unit may be electrically connected with the lift fingers and/or move the lift fingers up and/or down. By the driving unit, the substrate S may be moved to a desired position and the surface of the substrate S may also be scanned. The driving unit may be electrically connected with a control unit and, for example, control the position of the substrate S and/or movement of the lift fingers. The control unit may, for example, control the movement path, movement speed, and/or movement time of the substrate S. The control unit may control, for example, the movement direction of the lift fingers to load and/or unload the substrate S.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The substrate S may include a cell area and a peripheral area. Measurement structures may be formed in the cell area. Reference structures may be formed in the peripheral area, and/or on a substrate different from the substrate S on which the measurement structures are formed. The substrate S may be, for example, a silicon (Si) substrate, a germanium (Ge) substrate, or a substrate including Si and Ge. The substrate S may include a chromium (Cr) layer. A photoresist pattern may be on the substrate S including the Cr layer.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The structures may include layer structures and pattern structures. The measurement structures may have unknown critical dimensions and/or thicknesses. Although a process may be performed for a desired critical dimension and/or thickness, some of the completed measurement structures may have a critical dimension and/or thickness different from the desired critical dimension and/or thickness. For example, when the critical dimension and/or thickness of the completed measurement structure are different from the desired critical dimension and/or thickness by more than, for example, about &#xb1;10%, the measurement structures may be determined as defective. When the critical dimension and thickness of the completed measurement structure are different from the desired critical dimension and/or thickness by, for example, about &#xb1;10% or less, the measurement structures may not be determined as defective. Ranges within about &#xb1;10% of the desired critical dimension and/or thickness for the completed measurement structures may be referred to as a set critical dimension range and/or set thickness range.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, when the desired critical dimension of the measurement structures is about 35 nm, the set critical dimension range may be from about 30 nm to 40 nm. The set critical dimension range may include the desired critical dimension, and/or the set thickness range may include the desired thickness. When the measurement structures include pattern structures the pattern structures may constitute an array and may not be isolated. The critical dimension may include a space critical dimension and/or a bar critical dimension. The space critical dimension may be a distance between adjacent pattern structures among the pattern structures and the bar critical dimension may be the width of the pattern structures. When the space critical dimension is substantially the same as the bar critical dimension, the pattern structures may be referred to as line and space pattern structures.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, when the measurement structures are pattern structures, the space critical dimension may be substantially the same as the bar critical dimension. The measurement structures may be line and space pattern structures. The space critical dimension may be substantially different from the bar critical dimension. A ratio of the space critical dimension of the pattern structures (e.g., a ratio of the measurement structures to the bar critical dimension) is not limited. The reference structures may be used as a reference for measuring the critical dimension and/or thickness of the measurement structures. Because the critical dimension and/or thickness of the reference structures may be already known values, the critical dimension and/or thickness of the measurement structures may be obtained by measuring the diffraction intensities of the reference structures according to the critical dimension and/or thickness of the reference structures.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The reference structures may be on substantially the same substrate S as the measurement structures and/or a different substrate S than the measurement structures. According to example embodiments of the inventive concepts, the reference structures may be photoresist pattern structures. A photoresist layer may be on the substrate S. When the reference structures are formed on the same substrate S as the measurement structures, the photoresist layer may be formed in the peripheral area or cell area of the substrate S. The substrate S on which the photoresist layer is formed may be moved to a lithographic apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The lithographic apparatus may include a source, a support that supports the substrate S, and/or a reticle disposed between the source and the support. The reticle may include a pattern having a set critical dimension. The set critical dimension of the reticle may be referred to as a reticle critical dimension. Light may be generated from the source, passed through the reticle and radiated to the photoresist layer, thereby performing a lithography process. During the lithography process, the intensity of the source may be adjusted, so that a photoresist pattern may have a critical dimension substantially different from the reticle critical dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A distance between the support and the source may be adjusted so that a photoresist pattern may have a critical dimension substantially different from the reticle critical dimension. The critical dimension of the photoresist pattern may be substantially smaller or larger than the reticle critical dimension. The critical dimension of the photoresist pattern may be in the set critical dimension range. Through a development process and baking process, photoresist patterns may be formed from the exposed photoresist layer. The critical dimension and/or thickness of the photoresist patterns may be measured in a method using, for example, a scanning electron microscope (SEM).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to example embodiments of the inventive concepts, the reference structures may be an oxide, a nitride, a carbide, and/or a conductive material. A reference structure layer including an oxide, a nitride, a carbide, and/or a conductive material may be on the substrate S. The reference structure layer may have a multi-layer structure including the oxide, nitride, carbide, and/or conductive material. A photoresist layer may be on the reference structure layer. By performing lithography, development and baking processes on the photoresist layer, photoresist patterns may be formed on the reference structure layer. During the lithography process, the intensity of the source or a distance between the support and the source may be adjusted, so that the photoresist patterns may have a critical dimension substantially different from the reticle critical dimension. The critical dimensions of the photoresist patterns may be in the set critical dimension range.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The reference structures may be formed by etching the reference structure layer using the photoresist patterns as an etch mask. For example, the reference structures may have substantially the same critical dimension as the photoresist patterns. The reference structures may have, for example, substantially different critical dimension than the photoresist patterns. The critical dimensions of the reference structures may be in the set critical dimension range. After the reference structures are formed, the photoresist patterns may be removed. The photoresist patterns may be removed, for example, through an ashing process and/or a chemical cleaning process. The critical dimension and/or thickness of the reference structures may be measured according to a method using, for example, a SEM.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The second detector <b>140</b> may detect the intensity of light that is radiated onto the substrate S and diffracted by the reference structures and/or the measurement structures. The intensity of light diffracted by the reference structures may be referred to as a reference diffraction intensity and the intensity of light diffracted by the measurement structures may be referred to as a measurement diffraction intensity. The second detector <b>140</b> may measure reference diffraction intensities and obtain preliminary spectrums of the reference diffraction intensities according to the critical dimension of the reference structures. The second detector <b>140</b> may obtain preliminary spectrums of the reference diffraction intensities according to the thickness of the reference structures.

The reference structures may be oxide structures, nitride structures, and/or metal structures. The reference structures may have substantially different critical dimensions and/or thicknesses, which may be known values.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Light may be radiated onto the reference structures. The first detector <b>130</b> may detect properties of the radiated light. The properties of the radiated light may be, for example, the wavelength and/or polarization mode of the light. The properties of the light may be required in order to obtain a linear spectrum. The radiated light may be diffracted by the reference structures and the intensity of light diffracted by the reference structures may be detected by the second detector <b>140</b>. The intensities of light diffracted by the reference structures may be referred to as reference diffraction intensities. The diffracted light may have various diffraction orders. The diffracted light may include a zeroth order to &#xb1;N<sup>th </sup>orders (N is an integer). The diffracted light may be mostly zeroth order.

Measurement structures having a critical dimension exceeding the set critical dimension range may be determined as defective and may not have a measurement diffraction intensity value.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The method of obtaining a linear spectrum from the preliminary spectrums may be a linear fitting method, for example, linear regression analysis. When multiple linear spectrums are in the set critical dimension range a linear spectrum having the steepest slope may be selected from among the multiple linear spectrums. A linear spectrum having the largest ratio of an increase in the reference diffraction intensity of the reference structures (increase in the Y-axis) to an increase in the critical dimension of the reference structures (increase in the X-axis) may be selected. A preliminary spectrum including the selected linear spectrum may be checked. The wavelength and polarization mode of the radiated light radiated when the preliminary spectrum is obtained may be checked. The wavelength and polarization mode of the light may be referred to as a reference wavelength and reference polarization mode. The reference wavelength and reference polarization mode may be important factors for determining properties of light radiated to the measurement structures.</p>
