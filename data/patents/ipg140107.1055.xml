The invention may also have applications to travel situations where the risk of spillage is high. The invention may also lend itself to use by the elderly, disabled or infirm. The invention also relates to drinking containers for fully able members of the population.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Assisted-drinking cups, which do not require the user to lift an open cup to his mouth can generally take two different forms. One particular type, referred to as a training cup, includes a liquid container with a lid that has a spout. The spout has a liquid outlet which can be opened by a mechanical manipulation or by suction from the user. Such cups are generally referred to as training cups because they assist in a child's development of being able to lift the cup and coordinate movement to position the spout in the infant's mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an alternative type of cup, a straw extends into the vessel through the lid. This enables the contents of the vessel to be consumed without having to tip the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">These two different types of vessels have their particular uses depending upon the position and abilities of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide a drinking vessel which has increased functionality or at least provides the public with a useful choice over known drinking vessels. Alternative objects of the invention include the provision of a lid for a drinking vessel and/or the provision of a drinking conduit which provides increased functionality or at least provides the public with a useful choice over known products.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The foregoing prior art discussion is not to be taken as an admission of common general knowledge.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a lid portion for a drinking vessel, the lid portion including:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">a mouthpiece portion;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">a conduit portion fluidly connected to the mouthpiece portion, the conduit portion having a distal opening through which fluid may be drawn to the mouthpiece portion;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">an intermediate inlet fluidly connected to the mouthpiece portion, the intermediate inlet disposed intermediate the distal opening and the mouthpiece portion; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0012">a flow controller operable to control flow to the mouthpiece portion from the intermediate inlet, according to the orientation of the vessel.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0013">In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, a drinking vessel is provided which includes the lid portion above. Thus, the lid portion and the drinking vessel of the invention may include any of the optional features discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">Preferably, the vessel can be used in a number of different orientations while still allowing fluid to be drawn through the mouthpiece portion. With the vessel seated on its base, fluid within the vessel will be disposed towards the base such that fluid may be drawn from the distal opening by suction applied to the mouthpiece portion. A squeeze action may also force liquid through the conduit portion. Suitably, the conduit portion and the distal opening are such that fluid can be drawn to effectively empty the vessel. The vessel may also be inclined whereupon the flow controller operates to enable fluid flow from the intermediate inlet instead of the distal opening.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">The intermediate inlet may be disposed in the conduit portion, preferably closer to the mouthpiece than the distal opening. Alternatively, the intermediate inlet may be formed in a mouthpiece member which also incorporates the mouthpiece portion. In yet another form of the invention, a subsidiary conduit portion may be provided which is fluidly connected to the mouthpiece portion and the intermediate inlet may be disposed in the subsidiary conduit portion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">The conduit portion is typically in the form of a tube or straw. The distal opening may be disposed at the bottom of the straw. Preferably, the straw extends to the base of the vessel. The bottom of the straw may have a spoon-shaped end to effectively act as a &#x201c;slurpee&#x201d; straw for drinks containing small ice particles. Further, the straw may be arcuate, especially towards the base to optimise its function at low drink levels. The conduit portion may comprise two or more tubular parts which are separable to facilitate manufacture or cleaning. The conduit portion may also include a flavouring portion. In one known form of flavoured straws sold under the trade name SIPAHH, flavoured beads are held within by plastic filters at each end.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0017">Various configurations are possible for the vessel, the mouthpiece portion and the conduit portion. Various parts may be formed or moulded together. For example, the vessel may be a unitary vessel which includes integrally moulded side walls, lid portion and mouthpiece. However, in a more preferred form of the invention, the vessel comprises a container portion with an upper opening and the lid portion closes the upper opening. Suitably, the mouthpiece portion is incorporated into the lid portion and is integral therewith. Alternatively, the mouthpiece portion may be formed separately from the lid portion and inserted there into. The mouthpiece portion and the lid portion may be separable for cleaning. The lid portion and the container may be completely separate. Alternatively, the lid may be joined by means of a hinged connection such as an integral flexible hinge.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0018">The conduit portion need not be in the form of a discrete tube. The conduit portion may be integrally formed into the side wall of the vessel or the container portion.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">The conduit portion may be integrally formed with the mouthpiece portion. For example, the mouthpiece portion and the conduit portion may be simply a straw with the mouthpiece portion being merely defined at the upper end of the straw as the portion able to be inserted into the user's mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">In this form of the invention, there is preferably an annular seal provided to seal between the outside of the straw and the surrounding portion of the vessel to prevent spillage therebetween when the vessel is inverted.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021">The vessel may be in the form of a container with a lid portion and the straw may project through the lid portion.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022">Such drinking vessels described above may also include folding straw systems whereby the straws can be closed off by folding. Such folding straw systems may include a silicone or resilient mouthpiece portion which is closed off by folding or rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">The normally exposed end of the straw may be provided with a closure to prevent inadvertent spilling of the contents of the vessel. The closure may be in the form of a simple cap covering the end or a portion thereof. Alternatively, the end may incorporate a self-closing valve. The valve may be in the form of a slit valve which is integral with the end. Such an exposed end might be referred to as a &#x201c;bite-activated mouthpiece&#x201d;. Alternatively, the whole upper end of the vessel may be provided with an overcap. The overcap may be separate from the remainder of the vessel. Alternatively, the overcap may be hingedly connected. An integral plastic hinge may be provided to interconnect the vessel and the overcap. The conduit portion, mouthpiece portion and lid portion could be integrally formed or at least of unitary form (one piece). Alternatively, the conduit portion may matingly engage with an underside of the mouthpiece portion and be separable therefrom. The mouthpiece portion may incorporate a recess to receive an upper end of the conduit portion. Alternatively, the mouthpiece portion may incorporate a dependent tubular portion which defines a recess into which the upper end of the conduit portion may be fitted.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">The mouthpiece portion suitably includes a liquid outlet and is preferably of the self-closing type to prevent inadvertent spillage. The mouthpiece portion may be in the form of a spout which is deformable under mechanical action. Such mechanical action might include biting on the exterior of the spout or applying lip pressure so as to squeeze together the side walls of the spout (bite-activated mouthpiece). Such mechanical action preferably results in opening of a liquid outlet in the spout. In a preferred form of the invention, the spout is such that the liquid outlet is not able to be opened by suction alone and requires mechanical deformation in order to open the liquid outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">Whether the conduit portion is integral with the mouthpiece portion or fitted into it, preferably the location of the top end of the conduit portion is such that deformation of the mouthpiece portion is still permitted. For example, there may be a gap between the upper end of the conduit portion and the top of the mouthpiece portion.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">In an alternative form of the invention, the mouthpiece portion or spout, instead of being deformable may be a substantially rigid plastic mouthpiece portion. The rigid plastic mouthpiece portion may incorporate a liquid outlet and may also include a liquid outlet valve to prevent inadvertent spillage from the mouthpiece when the vessel is knocked over.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">In the soft form of the mouthpiece portion or spout, the liquid outlet may comprise one or more openings formed in a membrane. The membrane may be formed of different material to the remainder of the spout and thus may have different properties. The membrane may be overmoulded into the spout. Preferably, the membrane is the same material as the remainder of the spout but is thinner than the remainder of the spout. In a preferred form, the membrane is a flat planar structure at the top of the spout. The one or more openings may be in the form of a plurality of slits. Preferably the slits have a long dimension aligned with the usual direction of force applied during deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028">The flow controller operates according to the orientation of the vessel. Preferably, the flow controller closes the intermediate inlet when the vessel is seated on its base, thus enabling fluid to be drawn from the lower opening of the conduit portion when the user applies suction to the mouthpiece portion. Conversely, when the vessel is sufficiently tilted or in an upturned orientation, the flow controller operates to open the intermediate inlet so that liquid may flow from the intermediate inlet to the mouthpiece portion. Preferably, the flow controller is in the form of a valve member which is disposed at the intermediate inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">Preferably, the position of the valve member is dependent on the orientation of the vessel. Accordingly, the valve member may be movable under the action of gravity. Additionally or alternatively, the valve member may be responsive to a change in orientation of the vessel. More specifically, the valve member may be moved under the action of fluid flow in the vessel. For example, the action of fluid flowing towards the mouthpiece portion when the vessel is tilted may serve to open the valve member. Thus the arrangement of the valve member being at least partly or wholly exterior of the valve arrangement and/or the intermediate inlet enables the valve closure portion to be acted on by fluid in the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">The valve member may be cooperable with the intermediate inlet to close off the inlet in the upright orientation. Preferably, the valve member is heavier than fluid within the container (a specific gravity significantly greater than 1). Accordingly, the valve member will sink to move away from the intermediate inlet when in the inverted position. The heavy valve member will also assist with seating on the valve seat. The disposition of the intermediate inlet and the valve member may thus be arranged accordingly. Alternatively, the valve member may be lighter than the liquid within the vessel, i.e. the valve member may operate as a float. In this case, preferably the float moves away from the inlet when in the inverted position. The arrangement of the float and the intermediate inlet may be designed accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">An upper stop may be provided for the valve member to abut in the open position. This may be provided on the conduit portion.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">The intermediate opening may take the form of a curved or substantially annular opening surrounding the main portion of the conduit portion. There may be a plurality of intermediate openings arranged in an arc or ring. An appropriate form for the valve member would thus be curved or ring-shaped. In an alternative configuration, the intermediate inlet may be formed at the end of a branch portion from the main portion, in which case, the valve member may take the form of a flap which seats on the intermediate inlet. The valve member may be separable from the conduit portion. The valve member may be separately formed from the conduit portion and assembled together. In one form of the invention, the valve member may be incorporated into a valve component which includes a ring which locates around the main portion and doubly serves to provide a seal within an opening of the lid in which the ring is fitted. The valve component may be integrally formed from elastomeric material constructed to utilise the spring memory characteristics to aid in returning to the seated (sealed) position.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">The valve member, particularly in the above described form of a flap, may instead be integrally moulded with one or other of the components of the vessel which include the mouthpiece portion, the conduit portion, the lid portion or the container wall.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">An air inlet or &#x201c;breather valve&#x201d; may be provided to allow air to enter the vessel as liquid is removed. Preferably the air inlet is self-closing to prevent inadvertent spillage. The air inlet may be incorporated into the lid portion. Preferably, the air inlet is integrally moulded as part of the mouthpiece portion or spout. The air inlet may comprise a valve having one or more openings formed in a membrane. The membrane may merely be thinner than the surrounding material of the mouthpiece portion or spout. The air inlet may be disposed at the base of the side wall of the spout.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">In a preferred construction, the mouthpiece portion/spout, the air inlet and liquid outlet are all integrally moulded into a dispensing portion of resilient material. Deformation of the spout may cause opening of both the air inlet and the liquid outlet. The dispensing portion is overmoulded into a surrounding portion of harder material which together may form the lid portion. The harder surrounding portion is suitably provided with engagement means to secure to the container portion, e.g. mutually cooperable threads or a snap fit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">Preferably, the mouthpiece portion or spout is disposed on an upper portion of the vessel in a forward position and the container portion has a base and a container wall which leans in a forwards direction when the container is seated on its base on a level surface.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">The spout may be in the form of a tubular protrusion from the upper portion. The tubular protrusion may be angled such that its upper end extends forwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">The drinking vessel may be provided with handle portions which lie at an angle substantially aligned with the leaning angle of the container portion. The combination of the angled spout, container and handles assists the infant in co-ordinating the action of gripping the handles and tipping the vessel to orientate the vessel into the infant's own mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">A base portion may be provided to seat the leaning container portion. The base portion may be separable from the leaning container portion. Alternatively, the base portion and the container portion may be integrally formed. In a most preferred form of the invention, the container portion and the base portion are made of different materials with the container portion being transparent so that the contents are visible.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">In accordance with a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a drinking vessel for use in an upright orientation and an upturned orientation, the vessel including:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0041">a mouthpiece portion;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0042">a conduit portion fluidly connected to the mouthpiece portion, the conduit portion having a lower opening through which fluid may be drawn to the mouthpiece portion when the vessel is oriented in a substantially upright orientation;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0043">an intermediate inlet fluidly connected to the mouthpiece portion, the intermediate inlet disposed intermediate the lower opening and the mouthpiece portion;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0044">a flow controller operable to control flow to the mouthpiece portion from the intermediate inlet, according to the orientation of the vessel.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0045">In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present invention there is provided a drinking conduit having two ends including a first end for uptake of fluids and a second end to serve as a mouthpiece, the drinking conduit also provided with an intermediate inlet disposed intermediate the first end and the second end, and a flow controller operable to control flow to the second end from the intermediate inlet, according to the orientation of the conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0046">The drinking conduit may have any of the features described in connection with the conduit portion of the first and second aspects described above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0047">The drinking conduit may be employed in a unitary vessel without a lid. For example, the vessel may be in the form of a package such as a pre-packaged beverage. In such a product, the straw may be provided externally of the package and the package may have a frangible opening for insertion of the straw.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0048">In the case of pre-packaged beverages, the straw may instead reside within the vessel prior to opening, the straw being extensible on opening to provide an exposed end outside the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0049">It will be understood that the invention disclosed and defined in this specification extends to all alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features mentioned or evident from the text or drawings. All of these different combinations constitute various alternative aspects of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0050">It will also be understood that the term &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; (or its grammatical variants) as used in this specification is equivalent to the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and should not be taken as excluding the presence of other elements or features.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the training cup <b>10</b> includes a cover portion <b>12</b> and a container portion <b>14</b> which is supported by base portion <b>16</b>. The cover portion <b>12</b> extends over the top of a lid portion <b>18</b> as can be most clearly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0085">The lid portion includes a dispensing portion <b>17</b> surrounded by a peripheral flange portion <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0086">The dispensing portion <b>17</b> of the lid portion <b>18</b> is constructed of a relatively flexible material such as rubber or a thermoplastic elastomer. The dispensing portion <b>17</b> incorporates a mouthpiece or spout <b>20</b> and surrounds an air inlet <b>22</b> provided on an upper surface of the lid portion, behind the spout <b>20</b>, substantially at the base thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0087">The peripheral flange portion <b>24</b> is constructed of a less flexible material than the dispensing portion <b>17</b> to enable the lid <b>18</b> to be securely attached to the container portion <b>14</b>. The peripheral flange portion <b>24</b> is thus provided with internal screw threads <b>26</b> which are complementary to external screw threads <b>28</b> provided on the container portion <b>14</b>. The dispensing portion <b>17</b> and the peripheral flange portion <b>24</b> may be united in an overmoulding process so as to form a unitary lid <b>18</b>. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it can be seen that an outer periphery <b>19</b> of the dispensing portion <b>17</b> overlaps an inner periphery <b>23</b> of the peripheral flange portion <b>24</b>. The air inlet <b>22</b> is disposed adjacent these overlapping portions <b>19</b>, <b>23</b>, inside the inner periphery <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0088">In an overmoulding process, the two parts may be moulded together by injecting two different types of plastics material from separate barrels, i.e. twin barrels. Alternatively, in a process which is also referred to as insert moulding, a part may be inserted into a mould and another part moulded around it. Thus, the flexible dispensing portion <b>17</b> may be preformed and then inserted into a mould, enabling the surrounding flange portion <b>24</b> to be moulded around the dispensing portion <b>17</b>. Alternatively, the surrounding flange portion <b>24</b> may be moulded first and the flexible dispensing portion <b>17</b> moulded into the surrounding flange portion <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0089">It can be seen that the cover portion <b>12</b> has a shape which is generally complementary to the external shape of the lid <b>18</b>. The cover <b>13</b> may be secured to the lid <b>18</b> by purely a frictional fit. A rearward projecting tab <b>30</b> is provided on the cover portion <b>12</b> to assist removal.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0090">The container portion <b>14</b> is received in a base portion <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The external periphery of a lower portion of the container portion <b>14</b> is complementary to the internal periphery of the base portion <b>16</b>. In particular, the container portion may have an externally projecting annular rib <b>32</b> which mates with an annular groove <b>34</b> provided in the base portion <b>16</b>. The container portion <b>14</b> and the base portion <b>16</b> may be united in the moulding process. Alternatively, they may be separable to allow separate cleaning. The base portion <b>16</b> may be moulded of a plastics material which is more flexible than the container portion <b>14</b> to provide grip onto the surface onto which the cup <b>10</b> is placed. The base portion <b>16</b> may be constructed of the same material as the dispensing portion <b>17</b> of the lid <b>18</b>. The base portion <b>16</b> and the container portion <b>14</b> may be united by an overmoulding process or adhered together.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a rear view of the training cup <b>10</b>. The container portion <b>14</b> may be transparent so the contents are visible from the outside. The rear <b>36</b> of the container wall is provided with level indicia so that the volume of the liquid can be easily ascertained. Handles <b>40</b> are integrally moulded on opposite sides of the container wall.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0092">Considering <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it can be seen that the forward part of the lid contains a spout <b>20</b> which is inclined so that its tip is foremost. The container wall is then shaped so that the front and rearward portions of the container wall are inclined forwardly. Put another way, the container has a cylindrical wall with a central longitudinal axis. When the cup <b>10</b> is seated on its base portion <b>16</b> on a level surface, the central longitudinal axis extends at a leaning angle (acute) to true vertical. Furthermore, the handles <b>40</b> are also inclined in the same or similar orientation to the central longitudinal axis. This inclination assists the child in orienting the spout towards the child's lips and assists in the co-ordination of grabbing the handles <b>40</b>, lifting and tipping the cup <b>10</b> and inserting the spout <b>20</b> into the child's mouth. The spout <b>20</b> might be arranged at the same or similar angle to the central longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0093">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the upper end of the spout <b>20</b> is provided with a flat, planar membrane <b>44</b>. The membrane <b>44</b> is thinner and thus more flexible than the remainder of the dispensing portion <b>17</b>. The membrane <b>44</b> includes a slit <b>46</b> providing a liquid opening. Normally, the facing walls of the slit <b>46</b> abut each other providing a liquid seal. However, when the side walls of the spout at opposite ends of the slit <b>46</b> are pressed together in the child's mouth, the slit <b>46</b> is opened thereby providing a liquid outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0094">The air inlet <b>22</b> comprises a similar type of self-closing slit valve. In a similar fashion to membrane <b>44</b>, an air valve membrane <b>50</b> is provided, which is thinner and thus more flexible than the surrounding dispensing portion <b>17</b>. The membrane <b>50</b> has a slit <b>51</b> which has its length direction oriented transversely to the length direction of slit <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0095">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it can be seen that the spout <b>20</b> incorporates a recess <b>52</b> in which is received a conduit portion <b>54</b> in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The conduit portion <b>54</b> is in the form of a two-part straw or tube having a first lower portion <b>57</b> having first lower end <b>56</b> and a second upper portion <b>59</b> having second upper end <b>58</b>. The second upper end is received in the recess <b>52</b>. The two parts <b>57</b>, <b>59</b> of the straw may be separable along with the valve member <b>64</b> and the whole assembly may be separable from the lid portion <b>18</b>. This facilitates cleaning especially in regard to milk based drinks and pulpy juices. The upper end <b>53</b> of the conduit portion <b>54</b> does not extend to the top of the recess <b>52</b> (as per schematic <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). This provides an upper zone <b>60</b> which is free of the conduit portion <b>54</b> so that the spout <b>20</b> may still be mechanically deformed in order to open the liquid outlet valve <b>46</b>. The recess <b>52</b> may be defined by a dependent cylindrical wall <b>62</b>. The conduit portion <b>54</b> may be removably received in the recess <b>52</b>. This enables the conduit portion <b>54</b> to be removed for separate cleaning. Alternatively, the conduit portion <b>54</b> could be affixed or integrally moulded to the spout <b>20</b>. Preferably the conduit portion has a large inner bore size for ease of cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that the conduit portion may be arcuate and the first lower end extends forwardly of the cup <b>10</b>. This maximises the range of drinking angles at which the cup may be oriented, in order that liquid may still be drawn through the lower end <b>56</b> of the conduit portion <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> show the conduit portion <b>54</b> in greater detail with a flow controlling valve member <b>64</b>. The conduit portion <b>54</b> comprises a two-part blow moulded straw wherein the second upper portion <b>59</b> has a valve seat <b>66</b> between the first lower end <b>56</b> and the second upper end <b>58</b>. The valve seat <b>66</b> is disposed about one quarter along the length of the conduit portion from the second upper end <b>58</b>. The upper one of these faces against which the valve member <b>64</b> seats is provided with an intermediate inlet <b>68</b> (or a number of intermediate inlets). In the seated orientation of the cup <b>10</b> shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the intermediate inlet <b>68</b> is closed off by the annular valve member <b>64</b>. The annular valve member <b>64</b> has a significantly higher specific gravity than water and is preferably of moulded acetal. The underside of the valve member <b>64</b> is commensurate in shape with the upper face of the valve seat <b>66</b> so as to close off the intermediate inlet <b>68</b> when the valve member <b>64</b> is seated on the intermediate portion <b>36</b> (as per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0098">Thus, when the cup <b>10</b> is oriented in the seated position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the valve member <b>64</b> will be seated against the valve seat <b>66</b> by gravity. With liquid in the cup, when the user applies suction to the spout <b>20</b>, this will tend to draw the valve member <b>64</b> further closed against the intermediate inlet <b>68</b>, thereby creating a vacuum seal and enabling the drawing of liquid through the lower end <b>56</b> of the conduit portion <b>54</b>. Thus, in this orientation, the conduit portion <b>54</b> will function as a normal straw.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0099">However, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if the cup <b>10</b> is inverted, the valve member <b>64</b> will tend to sink under the action of gravity, moving towards the second end <b>58</b> of the conduit portion <b>54</b>, thereby opening the intermediate inlet <b>68</b>. The action of the liquid in the cup flowing from the base of the cup towards the mouthpiece will also serve to dislodge the valve member <b>64</b> thereby breaking the vacuum seal or surface tension seal. Accordingly, with the intermediate inlet opened, the liquid will flow through the intermediate inlet <b>68</b> and can be drawn by the user out the spout <b>20</b> by applying suction and light mechanical pressure to the spout <b>20</b>. In both the actions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, mechanical deformation of the spout will effect opening of the air inlet <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0100">Having regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it can be seen that the intermediate inlet <b>68</b> is open towards the forward side of the vessel. Thus, this vessel works best when the drinking vessel is rotated about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the forward/rearward plane. When rotated in this manner, the intermediate inlet <b>68</b> is submerged in any liquid contained in the drinking vessel. This provides optimal liquid flow since the intake of air through non-submerged inlets is avoided. Thus, this drinking vessel is optimally used by being tipped in the aforesaid direction.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0101">The annular valve member <b>64</b> preferably has a specific gravity which is significantly higher than 1.0 such that when in the upright orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, gravity will assist the sealing of the valve member <b>64</b> to its valve seat <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0102">Likewise, when using the drinking vessel in an inclined or upturned orientation, the specific gravity of the valve member <b>64</b> assists the opening operation on account of being significantly heavier than the liquid in which it is or will become partially or wholly submerged. A higher specific gravity can also help break any surface tension seal created by liquid present between the valve member <b>64</b> and its valve seat.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the upper end <b>58</b> of the conduit portion <b>54</b> may be of non-circular shape, such as a D section with a complementary recess <b>52</b> provided in the spout <b>20</b>, in order to orientate the conduit portion <b>54</b> with the intermediate inlet <b>68</b> facing forwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0104">Furthermore, it can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> that the valve member <b>64</b> extends laterally beyond the outer periphery of the intermediate portion <b>66</b>. Thus, when the drinking vessel is inverted, the liquid flow can act against the valve member <b>64</b> to help break any vacuum seal or surface tension seal between the valve member <b>64</b> and its valve seat <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0105">Preferably the container <b>10</b>, conduit portion <b>54</b> and the associated valve member <b>64</b> are constructed from dishwasher safe, food grade material, e.g. appropriate plastics, metals, ceramics. The materials used are preferably also suitable for hot and cold beverages.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0106">A first alternative embodiment of the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2032; is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>. This is similar in many respects and like numerals thus represent like parts with the addition of a prime symbol (&#x2032;) to show where parts have been adapted for the new embodiment. The valve seal <b>66</b> is provided with a plurality of arcuate inlets <b>68</b>&#x2032;. Additionally, the upper end <b>58</b> is circular such that the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2032; may be assembled with the spout <b>20</b> in any orientation. In this embodiment, the drinking vessel may be inclined in any orientation and flow will occur through some or all of the intermediate inlets <b>68</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8D to 8F</figref> illustrate a second alternative embodiment of the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2033;. This conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2033; is similar in many respects to the previous two embodiments and accordingly like numerals represent like parts, except with the addition of prime symbol (&#x2032;) to show where parts have been adapted for the new embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0108">Like the previous embodiments, the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2033; is in the form of a two part straw or tube having a lower portion <b>57</b>&#x2033; and an upper portion <b>59</b>&#x2033;. The upper portion and the lower portion are separable for separate cleaning. The upper portion <b>59</b>&#x2033; is provided with a valve seat <b>66</b>&#x2033; having an upper surface which is frusto-conical in form. The upper surface of the valve seat <b>66</b>&#x2033; is provided with a plurality of evenly spaced, circumferentially arranged inlets <b>68</b>&#x2033;. The inlets <b>68</b>&#x2033; communicate with the conduit within the upper portion <b>59</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0109">The valve member <b>64</b>&#x2033; is in the form of a frusto-conical shell having a lower face which is complementary to the shape of the valve seat <b>66</b>&#x2033; so that the valve member <b>64</b>&#x2033; can seat against the upper surface of the valve seat <b>66</b>&#x2033; and thereby close the inlets <b>68</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0110">The upper portion also includes an upper stop <b>67</b> in the form of a circular rib on the outer surface of the upper portion <b>59</b>&#x2033;. The upper stop <b>67</b> defines the upper limit of movement for the valve member <b>64</b>&#x2033; so that the valve member <b>64</b>&#x2033; will not become separated from the upper portion <b>59</b>&#x2033; and lost.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0111">The upper portion <b>59</b>&#x2033; also includes a gripping portion <b>69</b> in the form of a boss. The gripping portion <b>69</b> assists with insertion of the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2033; into the spout <b>20</b> and removal therefrom as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a more detailed view of the dispensing portion <b>17</b> which incorporates the spout <b>20</b> and surrounds the air inlet <b>22</b>. The spout <b>20</b> defines a lip seat <b>70</b> to guide the position of the user's lips. When the user applies light mechanical pressure at this location, then the upper end of the spout <b>20</b> will deform in order to open the liquid outlet valve <b>46</b>. The liquid outlet valve <b>46</b> may be linked by means of an internal rib <b>47</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to the air inlet <b>22</b> such that when the upper end of the spout <b>20</b> is deformed, the air inlet <b>22</b> also opens. However, the air inlet <b>22</b> is optional since it has been found that semi rigid and flexible bottles/containers work best without the air inlet <b>22</b> (because the deformed bottle sucks in air to equalise the pressure). Rigid bottles and containers work best with the air inlet <b>22</b>, because air cannot get in quickly enough to relieve the vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 17</figref> show a second embodiment of the infant cup <b>10</b>&#x2032;. The form of the cup <b>10</b>&#x2032; is similar in many respects to the training cup illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref>. Accordingly, the same reference numerals will be used to represent parts which are the same. Where parts have undergone modification to adapt to the new embodiment, such parts will be represented by the same number accompanied by a prime symbol (&#x2032;).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0114">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the spout <b>20</b>&#x2032; in this embodiment has been modified somewhat. Firstly, the spout portion <b>20</b>&#x2032; now includes a flexible rear portion <b>72</b> and a rigid front portion <b>74</b>. This ensures that the deformation of the spout <b>20</b>&#x2032; takes place at the rear <b>72</b> which ensures opening of the air inlet <b>22</b> on deformation of the spout <b>20</b>&#x2032; as with the previous embodiment, Secondly, in this embodiment, the valve member <b>64</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; is integrally moulded with the dispensing portion <b>17</b>&#x2032; which can be seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0115">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the form of the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2032; has been modified so that the valve seat <b>66</b>&#x2032; is no longer arranged with its central axis coincident with the central axis of the main conduit. Instead, the valve seat <b>66</b>&#x2032; in the form of bulbous portion is formed like a branch extending from the main conduit. At the upper end of the, the intermediate inlet <b>68</b>&#x2032; is formed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates how the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2032; may be formed by blow moulding with the top of the valve seat <b>66</b>&#x2032; intact. In a subsequent step, the top of the valve seat <b>66</b>&#x2032; is trimmed off to form the intermediate inlet <b>68</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0116">The conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2032; is removably received within the recess <b>52</b>&#x2032; defined within the spout <b>20</b>&#x2032;. The upper end <b>58</b>&#x2032; of the conduit portion and the recess <b>52</b>&#x2032; may have complementary cross-sections which are non-circular to ensure that the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2032; is inserted into the spout <b>20</b>&#x2032; in the correct orientation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an appropriate D section for this purpose. Further, the lip seat <b>70</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> may have a correspondingly shaped internal seat to provide a seat for the upper end <b>58</b>&#x2032; of the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0117">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2032; is inserted into the spout <b>20</b>&#x2032; in the correct orientation, the valve member <b>64</b>&#x2032; will be flexed away from its dependent orientation so as to cover the intermediate inlet <b>68</b>&#x2032;. This closes off the intermediate inlet <b>68</b>&#x2032; and enables liquid to be drawn from the first lower end <b>56</b>&#x2032; to the spout <b>20</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0118">On the other hand, when the cup <b>10</b>&#x2032; is inverted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the valve member <b>64</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; will tend to sink under the action of gravity and the urging of the liquid as it flows towards the mouthpiece <b>20</b>&#x2032;. By applying a light mechanical pressure to the mouthpiece <b>20</b>&#x2032; combined with suction, the user can open the liquid outlet <b>46</b> to draw liquid through the intermediate inlet <b>68</b>&#x2032;. The invention thus enables the cup <b>10</b>&#x2032; to be used at a range of different orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0119">Certainly, the flap valve member <b>64</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;, along with the spout portion <b>20</b>&#x2032; is constructed of an elastomeric material. The flap valve member <b>64</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; takes advantage of the spring memory characteristics of this material to aid in the valve operation by biasing the valve member <b>64</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; to return to the sealing position in the upright orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows an alternative form of a conduit portion <b>80</b>, which like the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> has a flap <b>82</b> functioning as a valve member. The conduit portion <b>80</b> comprises a first lower portion <b>84</b> and a second upper portion <b>86</b>. The lower portion <b>84</b> has a first lower end <b>88</b> through which liquid may be drawn into the conduit portion <b>80</b> in the upright orientation as per previous embodiments. The second portion <b>86</b> has an upper end <b>90</b> which is inserted into the recess <b>52</b> as per previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0121">Like the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the second portion <b>86</b> may be formed as a branch <b>92</b> extending from the main conduit to form the intermediate inlet <b>94</b>. The second portion is also provided with a location rib <b>96</b> above the branch <b>92</b> as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. The location rib <b>96</b> serves to locate an annulus <b>98</b> which forms part of an integral valve component <b>100</b> which incorporates the flap valve member <b>82</b>. The integral valve component <b>100</b> may be constructed of elastomeric material such as rubber to enable it to be fitted over the location rib <b>96</b>. The flap valve member <b>82</b> may be provided with a bulbous lower edge <b>102</b> to function as a weight. Thus, when the conduit portion <b>80</b> is in the upturned configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the weighted edge <b>102</b> will assist with opening of the flap valve member <b>82</b>. The lower portion <b>84</b>, upper portion <b>86</b> and valve component <b>100</b> may be separable for cleaning as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0122">The following embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 to 27</figref> show various different types of bottles which use either the annular valve member <b>64</b> of the type from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref> or the flap type valve of the type from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 20</figref>. Each container type could be used with either the annular valve type or the flap valve type. Additionally, the valves could be scaled up to suit larger capacity applications.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a &#x201c;pop top&#x201d; disposable or reusable drink bottle <b>105</b> which incorporates the conduit portion <b>54</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The drink bottle has a screw closure <b>106</b> which threadingly engages with the top of the bottle. The screw closure <b>106</b> incorporates a popup closure <b>108</b>, the form of which will be familiar to those skilled in the art. When the popup closure is in the lowered configuration, the bottle <b>105</b> is closed. When the user wishes to drink from the bottle, he lifts the popup closure <b>108</b>. By sucking on the popup closure <b>108</b>, the user can draw liquid through the lower opening <b>56</b> of the conduit portion <b>54</b>. As with other embodiments, if the user then inverts the bottle <b>105</b>, he can draw liquid through the intermediate opening <b>68</b>. The bottle can also function as a squeeze bottle. When the user squeezes the side walls of the bottle <b>105</b>, this assists in expressing the contents from the bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows another drink bottle which incorporates the conduit portion <b>54</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This drink bottle <b>110</b> is provided with a screw closure <b>112</b> at the upper end as with the previous embodiment. This screw closure <b>112</b> is threadingly engaged with the upper end of the bottle <b>110</b>. The screw closure <b>112</b> includes a pivotable flap <b>114</b> which when closed, conforms to the external contour of the closure <b>112</b>. When open, as shown, the flap <b>114</b> reveals a flexible mouthpiece portion <b>116</b>. The flexible mouthpiece portion <b>116</b> is in fluid communication with the conduit portion <b>54</b>. The flexible mouthpiece portion <b>116</b> is able to be bent over and encapsulated within the screw closure <b>112</b> when the flap <b>114</b> is closed. When the flexible mouthpiece portion <b>116</b> is bent over, a seal is created by virtue of the kink in the flexible mouthpiece portion <b>116</b>. This bottle <b>110</b> can also function as a squeeze bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates a takeaway cup <b>118</b> with a snap-fitting lid <b>120</b> and incorporates the conduit portion <b>80</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 to 20</figref>. The resilient annulus <b>98</b> of the integral valve component <b>100</b> functions as a grommet to provide a seal with an opening <b>122</b> formed in the lid <b>120</b>. Additionally, the conduit portion <b>80</b> employs a mouthpiece <b>124</b> received within the second portion <b>86</b>. The mouthpiece <b>124</b> may be formed of a resilient material.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is similar in many respects to the disposable cup <b>118</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> except being an insulated mug <b>126</b> with lid <b>128</b>. The conduit portion <b>80</b> is received in the lid <b>128</b> in the same fashion as the previous embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0127">It will be understood that the containers of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 to 24</figref> do not possess an outlet valve like the slit <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 17</figref>. Instead, the conduit portions are essentially open-ended during normal use. Therefore, air inlet valves such as air inlet <b>22</b> of the former embodiments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 17</figref>) are not required because air can easily enter the container once sucking has ceased.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows an alternative form of the insulated mug <b>126</b>. In this embodiment, the lid <b>130</b> is formed with an integral spout <b>132</b>. The underside of the spout <b>132</b> defines a cylindrical recess <b>133</b>.

<p id="p-0122" num="0129">In this embodiment the conduit portion <b>80</b>&#x2032; takes a different form from the previous embodiments in that the valve component <b>100</b> is omitted because the flap valve member <b>135</b> is integral with the lid <b>130</b> instead. The conduit portion <b>80</b>&#x2032; includes a first lower portion <b>84</b> with a first lower opening <b>88</b> and a second upper portion <b>86</b>&#x2032; having an upper end <b>90</b>. The upper end <b>90</b> is received in the cylindrical recess <b>133</b> of the spout <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0130">The spout <b>132</b> is provided with a self-closing slit valve <b>138</b> at its upper end. The self-closing slit valve is in the form of a planar membrane <b>134</b> at the top of the spout <b>132</b>. The planar membrane <b>134</b> is provided with slit <b>136</b>, the side walls of which are normally in abutting relationship to seal the spout but can be opened with light mechanical pressure applied to the side walls of the spout <b>132</b>. While not shown, this embodiment may also include an air valve to permit entry of air into the mug <b>126</b> as liquid is being withdrawn. The benefit of this configuration over the previous embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 to 24</figref> is that the valve <b>138</b> automatically closes and thus prevents spills if the mug <b>126</b> is advertently knocked over.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0131">The planar membrane <b>134</b> may be integrally formed with the spout <b>132</b> as a homogenous moulding. Alternatively, the planar membrane <b>134</b> may be over-moulded into the spout <b>132</b>. Preferably the lid <b>130</b> is constructed of thermoplastic elastomer.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows an alternative form of drinking vessel <b>140</b> which is similar in many respects to the previous embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. In this embodiment, the lid <b>130</b> has a central spout portion <b>132</b>&#x2032; formed of a thermoplastic elastomer which is integrally moulded into a surround portion <b>142</b> which is a more rigid material than the spout portion <b>132</b>&#x2032;. The spout portion <b>132</b>&#x2032; may be over-moulded with the surround portion <b>142</b> to form the lid <b>130</b>&#x2032;. The spout portion <b>132</b>&#x2032; is provided with a self-closing slit valve <b>138</b>&#x2032; in a similar form to the previous embodiment except that the planar membrane <b>134</b>&#x2032; is oval in shape. If the vessel <b>140</b> is rigid then an air valve (not shown) may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> illustrates a baby bottle <b>150</b> having a bottle portion <b>152</b>, a closure portion <b>154</b> and a flexible rear portion <b>156</b>, as is known in the art of baby bottles. The baby bottle <b>150</b> also includes an insert <b>158</b> which provides a seat for a conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2033; similar in many respects to the conduit portion <b>54</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 22</figref>. The conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2033; has a lower first portion <b>162</b> with a first lower end <b>164</b> and an upper second portion <b>166</b> into which the first portion <b>162</b> is received. The second portion <b>166</b> includes the valve seat <b>66</b> providing the intermediate inlet <b>68</b>. The valve member <b>64</b> resides on the valve seat <b>66</b> when the valve is in the closed position. The second portion <b>166</b> is different from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> because it includes two longitudinally spaced locating rings <b>160</b> which locate the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2033; relative to the insert <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0134">Thus, the baby bottle may be used in the upright configuration by sucking on the rear portion <b>156</b> so that liquid may be drawn through the lower end <b>164</b> of the conduit portion <b>54</b>&#x2033;. Alternatively, the baby bottle <b>150</b> may be upended so that liquid will enter through the intermediate inlet <b>68</b> as explained in previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0135">Additionally, an air inlet valve may be provided to enable entry of air as liquid is withdrawn. The air inlet may be separate from the liquid outlet slit (not shown) in the rear portion <b>156</b>. Alternatively, the air may enter through the outlet slit provided in the rear <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0136">The foregoing describes only one embodiment of the present invention and modifications may be made thereto with departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the conduit portion <b>54</b> could be adapted to be retrofitted onto an existing sports bottle or other type of disposable drink bottle. Alternatively, an adaptor could be provided to fit the current design of conduit portion <b>54</b> onto a known drink bottle.</p>
