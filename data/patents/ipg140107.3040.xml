<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to playback of media items and, more particularly, to management of playback of media items on a client computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, jukeboxes have been installed at restaurants or entertainment venues to provide music to patrons. Patrons typically insert money into a slot on a jukebox and then are entitled to select one or a few songs to be played by the jukebox. The songs are play back by the jukebox in the order they are selected.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Today, music management and playback programs, such as iTunes&#x2122; from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., allow users to make playlists of songs. Thereafter, users can select a playlist for playback and have the music management and playback program play back the songs from the selected playlist. However, once a playlist is playing, if a user selects a particular song to be played, the currently played song of the playlist is stopped and the new song is played. After the song has played, the playback stops until the user selects another song or playlist for playback.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While the music management and playback programs operate on personal computers (such as desktop computers, portable computers, or netbooks), portable media players, such as MP3 players (e.g., iPod&#x2122; from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif.), can operate to playback songs in a similar manner. Portable media players storage many songs or movies that users can select for playback by the portable media players. However, portable media players operate through graphical user interfaces to permit users to select a song or movie for playback. Once the song or movie is selected, playback of the selected song or movie is initiated. However, while the selected song or movie is being played, users are not able to select subsequent songs or movies to be played. Specifically, if users select another song or movie to be played, the currently played song or movies is stopped and then playback of the newly selected song or movies is initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, there is a need for improved approaches to manage or coordinate playback of digital media assets.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The invention relates to management or coordination of playback of digital media assets by an electronic device, such as a computing device, that supports media playback. According to one embodiment, a computing device can be controlled such that a user is able to schedule playback of distinct digital media assets.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, a computing device can provide a playback queue that can facilitate scheduling playback of distinct digital media assets. Digital media assets to be played subsequently can be listed in the playback queue to thereby manage playback of various digital media assets.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another embodiment, multiple users can contribute digital media assets for playback to a media playback queue being utilized by a designated playback device. Different rules or policies can govern contributions of digital media assets to the media playback queue. In one embodiment, multiple users can rate, vote or request addition, removal, placement or position of digital media assets within a media playback queue. The multiple users can be users of a single computing device or multiple computing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The computing devices can, for example, be client computing devices that provide playback of digital media assets. Examples of client computing devices include: personal computers, mobile telephones, portable media players, personal digital assistants (PDAs). Often client computing devices, such as multi-function electronic devices, will support other functionality besides media playback.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Embodiments of various aspects of the invention are discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a client computing device <b>100</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The client computing device <b>100</b> is configured to support storage and playback of digital media assets. A user of the client computing device <b>100</b> can also interact with the client computing device <b>100</b> to manage storage and playback of select digital media assets.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The client computing device <b>100</b> includes a processor <b>102</b> that controls management and playback of digital media assets by the client computing device <b>100</b>. The processor <b>102</b> can interact with a playback module <b>104</b>, a user interface (UI) module <b>106</b>, a speaker <b>108</b>, a display screen <b>110</b>, a media asset storage device <b>112</b>, a playback queue <b>114</b>, and a user input device <b>116</b>. The playback module <b>104</b> can operate to cause a digital media asset to be played back by the client computing device <b>100</b>. The UI module <b>106</b> can operate to cause one or more graphical user interfaces to be presented on the display screen <b>110</b> by the client computing device <b>100</b>. A user of the client computing device <b>100</b> can interact with the client computing device via the user input device <b>116</b> to provide input selections with respect to the graphical user interfaces. The speaker <b>108</b> can provide audio output (i.e., sound) in accordance with the digital media asset being played back. The media asset storage device <b>112</b> can store a plurality of digital media assets.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The graphical user interfaces presented on the display screen <b>110</b> and the user input device <b>116</b> enable the user of the client computing device <b>100</b> to browse or navigate the digital media assets and to select those one or more digital media assets to be played back by the processor <b>102</b> and managed by the playback module <b>104</b>. If the user selects multiple ones of the digital media assets, then those digital media assets not immediately played can be maintained in the playback queue <b>114</b>. As one digital media asset completes its playback, another digital media asset to be then played back can be obtained from the playback queue <b>110</b>, unless such is empty.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The user input device <b>116</b> for the client computing device <b>100</b> can pertain to one or more input device. Examples of input devices include a touch surface, a pointing device (e.g., mouse), a microphone, a button, a rotary input device, etc. The nature of the user input being provided to the client computing device <b>100</b> via the user input device <b>116</b> can also vary. In one example, if a touch surface is used, the user input can be user touch gestures, either single-touch or multi-touch gestures. In another example, if a microphone is used, the user input can be voice inputs (e.g., voice commands).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although the client computing device <b>100</b> can play back digital media assets and present audio and/or video output to users via the speaker <b>108</b> and/or the display screen <b>110</b>, in one embodiment, the client computing device <b>100</b> can wirelessly transmit (e.g., stream) digital content for the digital media assets to another device that provides audio and/or video output. Here, for example, the another device having audio or video output capability can be used to present a digital media asset that has been designated at the client computing device for playback at the another device.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also, if digital content for a digital media asset to be played is not available from the media asset storage device <b>112</b>, in one embodiment, the digital content can be received from another device that wirelessly transmits (e.g., streams) the digital content to the client computing device <b>100</b>. The digital content could be streams when needed or could be streamed in advance of playback and temporarily stored at the client computing device <b>100</b> for use during playback.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow diagram of a playback scheduling process <b>200</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The playback scheduling process <b>200</b> can, for example, be performed by a client computing device, such as the client computing device <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The playback scheduling process <b>200</b> can select <b>202</b> a playlist for playback. Next, playback of one or more digital media assets in the selected playlist can be initiated <b>204</b>. In the case in which the selected playlist includes more than one digital media asset, the digital media assets are playback sequentially. After playback is initiated <b>204</b>, a decision <b>206</b> can determine whether selection of a digital media asset for playback has been received. Here, while the playback of the one or more of digital media assets in the selected playlist is ongoing, the client computing device can receive a selection of another digital media asset for playback.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the decision <b>206</b> determines that a selection of another digital media asset for playback has not been received, a decision <b>208</b> can determine whether playback of the one and more digital media assets in the selected playlist has completed. When the decision <b>208</b> determines that playback has completed, then the playback scheduling process <b>200</b> can end. Alternatively, when the decision <b>208</b> determines that playback of the one or more digital media assets in the selected playlist has not been completed, the playback scheduling process <b>200</b> can return to repeat the decision <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">On the other hand, when the decision <b>206</b> determines that a selection of another digital media asset for playback has been received, a decision <b>210</b> can determine whether playback is currently in process. In other words, when the client computing device is still playing back digital media assets, such as the one or more digital media assets in the selected playlist, the playback of the selected digital media asset can be scheduled <b>212</b>. Here, as one example, the selected digital media asset can be scheduled <b>212</b> to begin its playback after the digital media asset currently being played completes. As another example, the selected digital media asset can be scheduled <b>212</b> to begin its playback after all the one or more digital media assets in the selected playlist have been played. Alternatively, when the decision <b>210</b> determines that playback is not currently in process, playback of the selected digital media asset can be initiated <b>214</b>. Following the block <b>212</b> or the block <b>214</b>, the playback scheduling process <b>200</b> can return to repeat the decision <b>206</b> and subsequent blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram of a playback management process <b>300</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The playback management process <b>300</b> can, for example, be performed by a client computing device, such as the client computing device <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The playback management process <b>300</b> can navigate <b>302</b> through available media items. A decision <b>304</b> can then determine whether a playback request has been received. While navigating through the available media items, the user will at some point cause the client computing device to receive a playback request. Hence, when the decision <b>304</b> determines that a playback request has not yet been received, the playback management process <b>300</b> can return to repeat the block <b>302</b> so that navigation through the available media items can continue. Alternatively, when the decision <b>304</b> determines that a playback request has been received, a decision <b>306</b> can determine whether playback is in process. Here, the decision <b>306</b> determines whether the client computing device is currently playing back some other media item. When the decision <b>306</b> determines that playback is not in process, then playback of a specified media item can be initiated <b>308</b>. The specified media item is specified by the playback request that has been received.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">On the other hand, when the decision <b>306</b> determines that playback is currently in process, a decision <b>310</b> can determine whether the specified media item is to be immediately played (i.e., play back now). In one implementation, the user performing the navigation through the available media items can select the specified media item and can also provide an indication of whether the user desires the specified media item to be played back now or to have its playback scheduled. When the decision <b>310</b> determines that the specified media item is to be played back now, the playback currently in the process can be stopped <b>312</b>, and playback of the specified media item can be initiated <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Alternatively, when the decision <b>310</b> determines that the specified media item is not to be immediately played, a decision <b>316</b> can determine whether the specified media item is to be played back next <b>316</b>. Here, the decision <b>316</b> determines whether the specified media item is to be played back immediately following the playback of the currently played media item. When the decision <b>316</b> determines that the specified media item is to be played back next, the specified media item can be added <b>318</b> to a top of a playback queue. Alternatively, when the decision <b>316</b> determines that the specified media item is not to be played back next, the specified media item can be added <b>320</b> to a bottom of the playback queue.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Following the blocks <b>308</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>318</b> and <b>320</b>, the playback management process <b>300</b> can return to repeat the block <b>302</b> so that additional media items, if desired, can be selected for playback. As noted above, the playback can be immediate, the playback can be as a next item, or the playback can be after playing one or more other previously scheduled media items.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4F</figref> are representative screens that can be presented according to one embodiment. The representative screens can be associated with a hierarchical graphical user interface that can be provided on a display screen of a client computing device. The client computing device is, for example, a portable electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a songs screen <b>400</b> that presents a plurality of songs available for selection. A highlight bar <b>402</b> can indicate that &#x201c;Song d&#x201d; has been highlighted. The highlighted song (&#x201c;Song d&#x201d;) can then be selected by a user input action with respect to the client computing device. If the highlighted song is selected, a now playing screen <b>404</b> can be illustrated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The now playing screen <b>404</b> can present a name and image pertaining to the highlighted song (&#x201c;Song d&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While the highlighted song (&#x201c;Song d&#x201d;) is playing, through user interaction with the client computing device, a playlist screen <b>406</b> can be illustrated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. The user can interact with the client computing device to highlight a song. A highlight bar <b>408</b> can indicate that the highlighted song (&#x201c;Song <b>3</b>&#x201d;) has been highlighted. If the highlighted song (&#x201c;Song <b>3</b>&#x201d;) is selected, an updated playlist screen <b>406</b>&#x2032; can be illustrated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. The updated playlist screen <b>406</b>&#x2032; is generally similar to the playlist screen <b>406</b> except that the updated playlist screen <b>406</b>&#x2032; includes a scheduling menu <b>410</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. The scheduling menu <b>410</b> can be displayed over a part of the list of songs within the playlist. The scheduling menu <b>410</b> can include a plurality of user-selectable options. The user-selectable options can be used to control how the playback of the selected song (&#x201c;Song <b>3</b>&#x201d;) is scheduled. A user can operate to select one of the user-selectable options. For example, the user-selectable options can, for example, include &#x201c;Play Now&#x201d;, &#x201c;Play Next&#x201d; or &#x201c;Add to Queue&#x201d;. The &#x201c;Play Now&#x201d; option requests that the selected song be played immediately (even if it requires that a currently playing song to be interrupted). The &#x201c;Play Next&#x201d; option requests that the selected song be played after a currently playing song completes its playback. The &#x201c;Add to Queue&#x201d; option requests that the selected song be placed in a playback queue (e.g., at end of playback queue).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> illustrates a queue screen <b>412</b> that presents a list of songs that are queued in a playback queue for playback. For example, if the selected song identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> is to be added to the playback queue, the queue screen <b>412</b> includes the selected song (e.g., &#x201c;Song <b>3</b>&#x201d;). After the currently playing song (&#x201c;Song d&#x201d;) from the now playing screen <b>404</b> has completed its playback, a next song (e.g., &#x201c;Song <b>3</b>&#x201d;) for playback can be obtained from the playback queue. Once playback of the next song is initiated, a now playing screen <b>414</b> can be illustrated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>. The now playing screen <b>414</b> can present a name and image pertaining to the next song (&#x201c;Song <b>3</b>&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In another embodiment, the scheduling menu <b>410</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> can include different or additional user-selectable options. The user-selectable options can be used to control how the playback of the selected song (&#x201c;Song <b>3</b>&#x201d;) is scheduled or played back. For example, the user-selectable options can, for example, include &#x201c;Fade In Next&#x201d;, &#x201c;Mix Into Next&#x201d;, &#x201c;Play Next and Return&#x201d;, &#x201c;Play Next and Others like it&#x201d;, or &#x201c;Play Artist Next&#x201d;. The &#x201c;Fade In Next&#x201d; option can request that the selected song be played next with a fade in from the currently playing song which fades out. The &#x201c;Mix Into Next&#x201d; option can request that the selected song be played next with tempo being adjusted based on tempo of the currently playing song (possibly also with a fade in). The &#x201c;Play Next and Return&#x201d; option can request that the selected song be played next and then return to play whatever would have played had the selected song not been played. The &#x201c;Play Next and Others like it&#x201d; option can request that the selected song be played next and then play other songs that are deemed similar to the selected song. The Genius tool used in iTunes&#x2122; can, for example, be used to determine similar songs. The &#x201c;Play Artist Next&#x201d; option can request that the selected song be played next and then play other songs from the same artist.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, if the screens shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4F</figref> are provided on a touch sensitive screen, then user selections can be made with user selections. In some cases, the user selection can pertains to gestures. The gestures can be single-touch or multi-touch gestures. For example, the user selectable options associated with the scheduling menu <b>410</b> could be supported by user touch inputs, with or without displaying the scheduling menu.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It should be noted that in one embodiment, a user can interact with the client computing device to alter the playback queue. As discussed above, a user can add media items to the playback queue. As another example, a user could reorder any of the media items within the playback queue. As another example, a user can delete one or media items from the playback queue. Still further, based on events or circumstances, the client computing device can itself operate (i.e., without user request) to add media items, delete media items or reorder media items with respect to the playback queue.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> are diagrams illustrating management of a playback queue according to one embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a representation of a playback queue <b>500</b> in which media items of a first playlist (PL<b>1</b>) have previously been queued for playback.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a flow diagram of a playlist queuing process <b>700</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The playlist queuing process <b>700</b> concerns processing associated with placing a selected media item within a playback queue.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The playlist queuing process <b>700</b> can begin with a decision <b>702</b> that determines whether the specified media item is a playlist. When the decision <b>702</b> determines that the specified media item is a playlist, the playlist can be added <b>704</b> to the playback queue. Here, the entire playlist can be added <b>704</b> to the playback queue.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Alternatively, when the decision <b>702</b> determines that the specified media item is not a playlist, a decision <b>706</b> can determine whether the specified media item is selected from a playlist. When the decision <b>706</b> determines that the specified media item is selected from a playlist, a decision <b>708</b> can determine whether a balance of the playlist is to be added to the playback queue. When the decision <b>708</b> determines that the balance of the playlist is to be played back, the specified media item as well as subsequent media items of the playlist can be added <b>710</b> to the playback queue.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the other hand, when the decision <b>706</b> determines that the specified media item is not selected from a playlist, or when the decision <b>708</b> determines that the balance of the playlist is not to be played back, the specified media item can be added <b>712</b> to the playback queue. Following the blocks <b>704</b>, <b>710</b> and <b>712</b>, the playlist queuing process <b>700</b> can conclude.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref> are diagrams illustrating management of a playback queue according to one embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a representation of a playback queue <b>800</b> in which media items of a first playlist (PL<b>1</b>) have previously been queued for playback. The media items of the first playlist (PL<b>1</b>) in the playback queue <b>800</b> include a sequence of songs, namely, PL<b>1</b>-S<b>1</b>, PL<b>1</b>-S<b>2</b>, PL<b>1</b>-S<b>3</b>, . . . , PL<b>1</b>-Sj. In addition, a selected song Sd has been inserted into the playback queue <b>800</b> such that it is played next (i.e., played after the currently playing song completes). Further, assume that while the song PL<b>1</b>-S<b>1</b> is currently being played, a second playlist (PL<b>2</b>) is selected for playback. Also assume that the second playlist (PL<b>2</b>) is to be inserted into the playback queue <b>800</b> such that it is played next. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates the playback queue <b>800</b> after the second playlist (PL<b>2</b>) has been inserted. Note that although the song PL<b>1</b>-S<b>1</b> is still currently being played, the songs of the second playlist (PL<b>2</b>) are inserted into the playback queue <b>800</b> after the song Sd (and before the remaining songs of the first playlist (PL<b>1</b>)). The song Sd can this be considered at the top of the playback queue <b>800</b>. Following the song Sd in the playback queue <b>800</b>, the remaining previously queued songs from the first playlist PL<b>1</b> remain. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> illustrates the playback queue <b>800</b> after the song PL<b>1</b>-S<b>1</b> has completed its playback and playback of the song Sd has begun. Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the song PL<b>1</b>-S<b>1</b> has been removed from the playback queue <b>800</b> since it has already been played back. In the playback queue <b>800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>, the currently playing song can remain in the playback queue <b>800</b> until it has been completely played. However, in another embodiment, the currently playing song can be removed from the playback queue <b>800</b> once its playback is initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow diagram of a playback continue process <b>900</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The playback continue process <b>900</b> can be performed when the client computing device completes the playback of a currently playing media item. According to the playback continue process <b>900</b>, a decision <b>902</b> can determine whether there are any media items in a playback queue. When the decision <b>902</b> determines that there are no media items in the playback queue, then playback of media items by the client computing device can be stopped <b>904</b>. Alternatively, when the decision <b>902</b> determines that there are one or more media items in the playback queue, a next media item in the playback queue can be identified <b>906</b>. Then, the playback of the next media item in the playback queue can be initiated <b>908</b>. In one embodiment, one or more transition effect can be provided to improve the transition between ending of playback of the currently playing media items and starting of playback of the next media item. The transition can be audio, such as fading and/or mixing, or can be visual, such as animations. Following the block <b>904</b> or the block <b>908</b>, the playback continue process <b>900</b> can end. However, it should be noted that the playback continue process <b>900</b> can be activated each time the client computing device completes (or is about to complete) the playback of a currently played media item.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It should be noted that the playback queue can but need not contain digital content for any of the media items in the playback queue. Instead, the playback queue need only include a reference or pointer to the digital content for the particular media item.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In another embodiment, multiple users can schedule playback of digital media assets. For example, multiple users can contribute digital media assets for playback to a media playback queue being utilized by a master playback device. The master playback device can be associated with another user or an establishment. Users, such as visitors or friends, can thus contribute digital media assets to a media playback queue. The master playback device can managed the media playback queue and thus select subsequent digital media assets to be played back. Different rules or policies can govern placement of contributed digital media assets to the media playback queue. Typically, users with compatible electronic devices can contribute selections of digital media assets wirelessly and/or via a wired network. If desired, a password can be used to control those others that are allowed to contribute digital media assets. Contributing users can also be allowed to rate or vote on digital media assets to be played, or on audio characteristics, such as volume of playback. Contributing users can also be allowed to rate or vote on request adding, removing or positioning digital media assets within the media playback queue.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The digital media assets (i.e., media items) can pertain to video items (e.g., videos, movies or television shows), audio items (e.g., audio files or audio tracks, such as for songs (music) or audiobooks or podcasts or electronic books or voice recordings), image items (e.g., photos), or multimedia presentations. The digital media assets being scheduled for playback on a particular device can by of the same type or different types. In one example, the scheduled digital media assets can be all audio items. In another example, the scheduled digital media assets can be a mixture of audio items and a mixture of video items.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, digital media assets being scheduled as discussed above can be generated as needed. For example, a user of a computing device could record a new digital media asset and then schedule its playback. In one example, a video segment could be recorded by a computing device and then placed in a media playback queue for playback. In another example, a voice recording could be recorded by a computing device and then placed in a media playback queue for playback. For example, the voice recording could be used as an introduction, a message, a promotion, or an announcement. As a particular example, the voice recording could serve to announce a next or subsequent digital media asset to be played.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The various aspects, features, embodiments or implementations of the invention described above can be used alone or in various combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Embodiments of the invention can, for example, be implemented by software, hardware, or a combination of hardware and software. Embodiments of the invention can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium is any data storage device that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer system. Examples of the computer readable medium generally include read-only memory and random-access memory. More specific examples of computer readable medium are tangible and include Flash memory, EEPROM memory, memory card, CD-ROM, DVD, hard drive, magnetic tape, and optical data storage device. The computer readable medium can also be distributed over network-coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The advantages of the invention are numerous. Different embodiments or implementations may, but need not, yield one or more of the following advantages. One advantage of certain embodiments is that digital media assets can be scheduled to play next even while another digital media asset is being concurrently played. Another advantage of certain embodiments is that a playback queue can be provided and maintained to enable a user to queue multiple digital media assets. Still another advantage of certain embodiments is that multiple users can contribute to a playback queue at a location (e.g., venue) that is playing media for patrons.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The many features and advantages of the present invention are apparent from the written description. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, the invention should not be limited to the exact construction and operation as illustrated and described. Hence, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to as falling within the scope of the invention.</p>
