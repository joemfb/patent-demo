<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO A RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/356,748, entitled FIBER OPTIC CONNECTOR WITH STABLE ALIGNMENT, which was filed on Jun. 21, 2010, and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A fiber optic connector enables two optical fibers to be connected to one another so that an optical signal can travel between the two optical fibers. For example, an optoelectronic device may include a fiber optic connector with internal and external ports. The internal port can be configured to receive an internal optical fiber that connects to internal optical or optoelectronic components of the optoelectronic device. The external port can be configured to receive an external optical fiber that connects the optoelectronic device to a distant optoelectronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The characteristics of the internal and external ports of a fiber optic connector of an optoelectronic device are typically dictated by an industry standard for the particular fiber optic connector type. Some example industry standards are the TIA/EIA 604-3a and FOCIS standards. One characteristic that is specified in various industry standards is the allowable optical power change while a side load (also known as side pull) is applied to the external optical fiber. During a side load, a strain is placed on the external optical fiber, which can result in the external optical fiber and the internal optical fiber becoming misaligned. Another characteristic that can be specified is the allowable optical power change while the fiber optic connector is agitated. For example, the external optical fiber may be plugged into a horizontally positioned fiber optic connector and a defined weight may be applied to the external optical fiber. Then the whole fiber optic connector can be rotated 360 degrees back and forth along its longitudinal axis, which can result in the external optical fiber and the internal optical fiber becoming misaligned.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there is a need for fiber optic connectors designed to handle a side load and agitation without misalignment between the external and internal optical fibers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, example embodiments relate to fiber optic connectors for use in connecting and aligning two optical fibers. The example fiber optic connectors disclosed herein can be employed in connection with an optoelectronic device, such as an optoelectronic transceiver. The example fiber optic connectors disclosed herein maintain a stable alignment between an internal optical fiber plugged into an internal port and an external optical fiber plugged into an external port, even where a side load is applied to the external optical fiber or the example fiber optic connector is agitated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one example embodiment, a fiber optic connector includes a body, a cylindrical split sleeve at least partially positioned within the body, and a shell at least partially positioned within the body and surrounding the split sleeve. The body defines an internal port and an external port. The split sleeve defines a slot along the length of the split sleeve and has first and second open ends. The first end is configured to receive and grip a ferrule of an internal optical fiber and the second end is configured to receive and grip a ferrule of an external optical fiber. The portion of the shell surrounding the first end has a greater inside clearance than the portion of the shell surrounding the second end.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example embodiment, a fiber optic connector includes a body, a cylindrical split sleeve at least partially positioned within the body, and two or more shells at least partially positioned within the body and surrounding the split sleeve. The body defines an internal port and an external port. The split sleeve defines a slot along the length of the split sleeve and has first and second open ends. The first end is configured to receive and grip a ferrule of an internal optical fiber and the second end is configured to receive and grip a ferrule of an external optical fiber. The portion of the two or more shells surrounding the first end having a greater inside clearance than the portion of the two or more shells surrounding the second end.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> discloses a chart <b>170</b> with the results of various side load tests. As disclosed in the chart <b>170</b>, side load tests on a standard fiber optic connector with a fixed split sleeve resulted in between 1.03 dB and 2.0 dB of power change in the standard fiber optic connector. Side load tests on a standard fiber optic connector with a floating split sleeve resulted in between 0.52 dB and 2.2 dB of power change in the standard fiber optic connector. In contrast, side load tests on the example fiber optic connector <b>100</b> with the shell <b>108</b> and the split sleeve <b>110</b> resulted in only between 0.08 dB and 0.67 dB of power change in the connector <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Also disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the portion <b>818</b> of the shell <b>808</b> that surround the first end <b>814</b> of the split sleeve <b>810</b> have greater inside clearance than other portions of the shell <b>808</b>. The greater inside clearance in the portion <b>818</b> of the shell <b>808</b> enables the first end <b>814</b> of the split sleeve <b>810</b> to shift/float/tilt when a side load is applied to the external optical fiber (not shown) or the connector <b>800</b> is agitated. In addition, a flange <b>822</b> attached to the ferrule <b>852</b> of the optical fiber <b>850</b>, together with a ring <b>824</b>, allow the first end <b>814</b> of the split sleeve <b>810</b> to shift/float/tilt within the portion <b>818</b> of the shell <b>808</b> while maintaining the first end <b>814</b> of the split sleeve <b>810</b> in the proper z-position within the fiber optic connector <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, the connector <b>800</b> includes a washer <b>826</b>. During a side load on the external optical fiber (not shown) or the connector <b>800</b> is agitated, the flange <b>822</b> tilts on the washer <b>826</b> with one side of the flange <b>822</b> digging into the washer <b>826</b> and creating higher friction. At the same time, the washer <b>826</b> is able to glide with low friction against the ring <b>824</b> even with the flange <b>822</b> being tilted. Thus, the washer <b>826</b> is configured to reduce the friction between the flange <b>822</b> and the ring <b>824</b>. The washer <b>826</b> and the flange <b>822</b> can have various shapes, as discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A-7D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Enabling the first end <b>814</b> of the split sleeve <b>810</b> to shift/float/tilt during a side load or agitation allows the split sleeve <b>810</b> to maintain a stable alignment between the internal optical fiber <b>850</b> and the external optical fiber (not shown). This stable alignment contributes to low levels of power change when a side load is applied to the external optical fiber (not shown) or the connector <b>800</b> is agitated.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although each slot defined by each split sleeve disclosed herein is generally perpendicular to the ends of the split sleeve, it is understood that at least a portion of one or more of the slots disclosed herein may instead run at some other angle with respect to the ends of the split sleeve. Further, although the example fiber optic connectors disclosed herein are SC or LC connections, it is understood that aspects of the example fiber optic connectors disclosed herein can also be employed in other types of fiber optic connectors including, but not limited to, FC, MU, ST, FDDI, ESCON, E2000, MT-RJ, SMA 905/906, and D4 fiber optic connectors.</p>
