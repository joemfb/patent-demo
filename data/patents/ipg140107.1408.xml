<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An LED lamp scattering heat by exchanging currents has a current guider disposed on a seat body. The current guider divides an accommodating chamber of the seat body into at least one first current channel and at least one second current channel. On a periphery of the seat body defines at least one first opening corresponding to the second current channel and at least one second opening defined near a fan of a cooling device. By guiding exterior currents out of the first opening via the second current channel, the exterior currents further enter the second opening of the seat body for being expelled out of the first current channel via the fan to complete an air flow circulation by exchanging currents, which increases the heat radiating efficiency and the using life of the LED lamp and remedies restrictions on installations of the lamp for expanding the lamp application.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a design of an LED lamp, particularly to an LED lamp preferably scattering heat by exchanging currents.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional LED lamp <b>1</b> comprises a seat body <b>11</b> including an accommodating chamber <b>111</b>, a protective cover <b>10</b> connected to a rim of the seat body <b>11</b>, a light module <b>12</b> installed within the accommodating chamber <b>111</b>, and a cooling device <b>13</b>. Wherein, the light module <b>12</b> has an electrically-connected circuit board <b>121</b>, an optical reflector <b>122</b> disposed on the circuit board <b>121</b>, and at least one LED unit <b>123</b> disposed on the circuit board <b>121</b>. Moreover, the cooling device <b>13</b> has a fin set <b>131</b> disposed around the optical reflector <b>122</b>, and a fan <b>132</b> disposed under the circuit board <b>121</b>. In using, the LED unit <b>123</b> and the circuit board <b>121</b> are electrified for emitting light through the optical reflector <b>122</b>, and heat generated at the time is released via the fan <b>132</b> and the fin set <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In practice, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the heat in the LED lamp <b>1</b> generated during lighting may be released via the fan <b>132</b> and the fin set <b>131</b>. However, the effect of heat dispersion depends on materials adopted on the fin set <b>131</b>. Namely, if the fin set <b>131</b> is made of appropriate materials, the effect of heat dispersion in the LED lamp <b>1</b> favorably advances. Oppositely, if the fin set <b>131</b> is made of inappropriate materials, the heat in the LED lamp <b>1</b> can not be timely released, which adversely incurs an overheated LED lamp <b>1</b>. As a result, either the lighting effect or the using life of the LED lamp <b>1</b> is influenced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In fact, where the LED lamp <b>1</b> is placed is also one of the factors that influence the effect of heat dispersion. Namely, if the seat body <b>11</b> of the LED lamp <b>1</b> is uncovered and attached to ceilings, plywood, or any other decorative rails, a favorable effect of heat dispersion could be provided. Oppositely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the seat body <b>11</b> of the LED lamp <b>1</b> may be also embedded in a ground G. A large quantity of wasted heat is similarly generated after the LED unit <b>123</b> and the optical reflector <b>122</b> continuingly providing light. Herein, since the seat body <b>11</b> of the LED lamp <b>1</b> is wrapped in the compact ground material G, and the protective cover <b>10</b> is designed solid, there is only the narrow and small accommodating chamber <b>111</b> left between the fin set <b>131</b> and the seat body <b>11</b> for wasted heat to be removed out (as shown by dotted-line arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) . Herein, cooling air out of the LED lamp <b>1</b> can not get in. Thus, the wasted heat generated in time of lighting is difficultly to be dispersed out of the accommodating chamber <b>111</b> of the LED lamp <b>1</b>. Obviously, the LED lamp <b>1</b> is thence overheated. Therefore, the lighting effect and the using life of the LED lamp <b>1</b> are both affected.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore the purpose of this invention to provide an LED lamp scattering heat by exchanging currents. Namely, when the currents are exchanged, circulation of air is constructed for promoting the heat dispersion of the LED lamp and expanding the application of the LED lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The LED lamp scattering heat by exchanging currents in accordance with the present invention comprises a seat body including an accommodating chamber, a light module installed within the accommodating chamber, and a cooling device connected to the light module. Wherein, the light module has an electrically-connected circuit board, an optical reflector disposed on the circuit board, and at least one LED unit disposed on the circuit board. The cooling device has a fan installed under the circuit beard, and a fin set disposed between the circuit board and the fan for enveloping the optical reflector. Heat generated by the LED lamp is scattered by the fan and guided out by the fin set. Wherein, a current guider is installed inside the seat body for dividing the accommodating chamber into at least one first current channel and at least one second current channel. The first current channel accommodates the light module. On a periphery of the seat body defines at least one first opening that is disposed correspondingly to the second current channel, and at least one second opening that is disposed near the fan. The second current channel is able to communicate with an exterior of the seat body via the first opening. The second opening is disposed direct to communicate with the fan, thereby introducing external currents into the second current channel, then guiding the external currents out of the first opening, and thence allowing the external currents to enter the second opening of the seat body and meet the fan by which the external air hence emanates from the first current channel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the current guider includes a main body and a plurality of fin units extended from the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, a protective cover is connected to a rim of the seat body, and the protective cover provides a plurality of openings formed thereon for communicating with the first current channel and the second current channel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the current guider can be installed on the protective cover.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the current guider is integrally attached to the protective cover, facilitating a division of the first current channel and the second current channel in the accommodating chamber when the protective cover is connected to the seat body.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, exterior currents are introduced for forming current circulation to effectively cool the heat generated in the LED lamp. As a result, the heat can be favorably scattered, so the installing location of the LED lamp is unlimited. Accordingly, the LED lamp can be more expansively installed and used.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown. An LED lamp <b>2</b> scattering heat by exchanging currents comprises a seat body <b>21</b> including an accommodating chamber <b>211</b>, a protective cover <b>20</b> connected to a rim of the seat body <b>21</b>, a light module <b>22</b> installed within the accommodating chamber <b>211</b>, a cooling device <b>23</b> correspondingly disposed to the light module <b>22</b>, and a current guider <b>24</b> installed inside the seat body <b>21</b> for adaptively accommodating the light module <b>22</b> . Further, the light module <b>22</b> has an electrically-connected circuit board <b>221</b>, an optical reflector <b>222</b> disposed on the circuit board <b>221</b>, and at least one LED unit <b>223</b> disposed on the circuit board <b>221</b>. Herein, the LED unit <b>223</b> provides light through the optical reflector <b>222</b>. Moreover, the cooling device <b>23</b> has a fan <b>231</b> installed under the circuit board <b>221</b>, and a fin set <b>232</b> disposed between the circuit board <b>221</b> and the fan <b>231</b> for enveloping the optical reflector <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Continuingly, the current guider <b>24</b> divides the accommodating chamber <b>211</b> into at least one first current channel a and at least one second current channel a&#x2032;. In this embodiment, the current guider <b>24</b> has a main body <b>241</b> that separates the first current channel a from the second current channel a&#x2032;, and a plurality of fin units <b>242</b> outward extended from the main body <b>241</b>. Concurrently, the first current channel a can adaptively accommodate the light module <b>22</b>. Further, on a periphery of the seat body <b>21</b> defines at least one first opening <b>212</b> that is disposed correspondingly to the second current channel a&#x2032; and at least one second opening <b>213</b> that is disposed near the fan <b>231</b>. The second current channel a&#x2032; is able to communicate with an exterior of the seat body <b>21</b> via the first opening <b>212</b>. The second opening <b>213</b> is disposed direct to the fan <b>231</b>, thereby introducing external currents into the second current channel a&#x2032;, then guiding the external currents out of the first opening <b>212</b>, and thence allowing the external currents to enter the second opening <b>213</b> of the seat body <b>21</b> and meet the fan <b>231</b> by which the external air hence emanates from the first current channel a. Obviously, a current exchanging mode is achieved by the fan <b>231</b> helping currents of air to be exchanged between the first current channel a and the second current channel a&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, the protective cover <b>20</b> can be freely adopted for preferably preventing foreign objects from intrusion in the seat body <b>21</b>, and openings <b>201</b> defined thereon can further communicate with the first current channel a and the second current channel a&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, in using, the LED unit <b>223</b> and the circuit board <b>221</b> are electrified to emit light. Namely, the light goes through the optical reflector <b>222</b> and then illuminates any desired places. Concurrently, the fan <b>231</b> under the circuit board <b>221</b> is driven during the illumination. When the LED unit <b>223</b> keeps lighting, the seat body <b>21</b> is full of wasted heat. Herein, besides the fin set <b>232</b>, the fan <b>231</b> also timely operates and the current guider <b>24</b> executes the heat dispersion to guide the wasted heat. At the same time, exterior currents enter the accommodating chamber <b>211</b> through the openings <b>201</b> and the second current channel a&#x2032;. Accordingly, the fin units <b>242</b> are firstly cooled by the entry of exterior currents of air. The exterior currents of air in the second current channel a&#x2032; thence go out of the seat body <b>21</b> via the first opening <b>212</b> and then get in the seat body <b>21</b> again via the second opening <b>213</b>. Accordingly, the currents of air are mixed with the wasted heat in the fin set <b>232</b> and expelled via the first current channel a and the openings <b>201</b> by the blowing from the fan <b>231</b> (as shown by dotted-line arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Accordingly, the current guider <b>24</b>, the first opening <b>212</b>, and the second opening <b>213</b> are able to guide the exterior currents of air into the seat body <b>21</b> and thence bring about circulation of air in the LED lamp <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Whereby, no matter the LED lamp <b>2</b> is placed in an exposed manner or a hidden manner, the current guider <b>24</b>, the first opening <b>212</b>, and the second opening <b>213</b> cooperatively promote the effect of heat scattering on the LED lamp. Namely, the wasted heat can be scattered by the fin set <b>232</b>, mixed with external currents of air, and blown by the fan <b>231</b> for introducing the circulation of currents to enhance the heat dispersing effect. Further, the LED lamp <b>2</b> does not overheat, and the using life of the LED unit <b>222</b> can be prolonged. Favorably, the installing location of the LED lamp <b>2</b> becomes free and more expansive now since the heat dispersing problem is resolved.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a second preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown. A protective cover <b>20</b>, a seat body <b>21</b>, a light module <b>22</b>, a cooling device <b>23</b>, a current guider <b>24</b>, and other components are similarly included by an LED lamp <b>2</b> for achieving the same function as that of previous embodiment. Differently, the current guider <b>24</b> is integrally attached to the protective cover <b>20</b>. Whereby, when the protective cover <b>20</b> is disposed onto the seat body <b>21</b>, the current guider <b>24</b> similarly divides the accommodating chamber <b>211</b> into the first current channel a and the second current channel a&#x2032;. Accordingly, the effect of current circulation can be also introduced as that of the previous preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To sum up, the present invention particularly utilizes the current guider and the first opening as well as the second opening defined on the periphery of the seat body to scatter wasted heat generated in the LED lamp via the circulation of currents. Namely, the current guider introduces exterior currents of air to cool and exchange with the wasted heat in the LED lamp. Accordingly, the fan preferably expels the wasted heat, which enhances the effect of heat dispersion. As a result, the installing location of the LED lamp is not limited anymore, and the using scope of the LED lamp is promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While we have shown and described the embodiment in accordance with the present invention, it should be clear to those skilled in the art that further embodiments may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
