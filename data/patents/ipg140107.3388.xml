<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a permanent-magnet synchronous motor of draining pump, in particular to a permanent-magnet synchronous motor of a draining pump in which an enameled aluminum wire is applied to a stator coil.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Research for use of an enameled aluminum wire to a motor started in the 1970s in China. The enameled aluminum wire, in particular to its welding point or part, is inclined to be oxidized when it meets oxygen in air. In addition, the enameled aluminum wire and its welding point are corroded readily by acid and alkaline matter in moist air. Since the enameled aluminum wire, especially one with diameter less than 0.03937 inches or 1 mm, lacking the ability to resist oxidization and corrosion, there is always a technical barrier for applying it on the motor. Up to now, no practical application for enameled aluminum wire to permanent-magnet synchronous motor of draining pump is presented.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides a permanent-magnet synchronous motor of a draining pump which has ability to prevent its enameled aluminum wire winding and a welding point of the winding from oxidization and corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The permanent-magnet synchronous motor of draining pump comprises a permanent-magnet rotor for driving an impeller to rotate, a pump body for supporting the permanent-magnet rotor, a stator core and a stator coil, in which the stator coil has an enameled aluminum wire winding which is constructed by coiling an enameled aluminum wire. The enameled aluminum wire winding is sealed in a container.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the enameled aluminum wire winding of the invention is sealed in the container so as to be isolated from air, in particular acidic and alkaline mist in the moist environment, it prevents the enameled aluminum wire winding from being oxidized and corroded.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, a welding part of a lead-out wire for the enameled aluminum wire winding is covered or coated with insulating material which isolate it from the outside, so that the present invention brings a technical effect of avoiding the welding part being oxidized and corroded.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Wherein, the container for sealing and packaging the enameled aluminum wire is a plastic-seal plastic container or an epoxy resin container. It not only has improved sealing effect, but also is easier to be produced and manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the plastic-seal plastic container takes the shape of coil bobbin of the enameled aluminum wire. In another embodiment, the epoxy resin container is formed by pouring epoxy resin onto the enameled aluminum wire placed in a cavity body and solidifying it.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Wherein, the enameled aluminum wire and the welding part of its lead-out wire are insulated or isolated from the outside by the way of covering and sealing them with epoxy resin being poured onto them.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">During implementing sealing operation, the outside surface of the enameled aluminum wire winding may be firstly covered by insulating paper tape, and then sealed by plastic or epoxy resin.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the invention, the welding part of the lead-out wire for the enameled aluminum wire winding is treated on its surface with tin plating or tin immersion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The diameter of the enameled aluminum wire is less than or equal to 0.03937 inches or 1.0 mm and the thickness of the stator core is between 0.03937 inches or 10 mm and 1.9685 inches or 50 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention has the technical effects as below:</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Since the winding of the stator coil, especially its lead-out wire welding part, is sealed with plastic or epoxy resin, it is isolated from acidic and alkaline mist in a humid environment. It effectively prevent the winding of the stator coil from being corroded and prevent a welding point of the aluminum wire, which is generally welded with a copper terminal, from conducting oxidation reaction of copper and aluminum by the influence of oxygen in air.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The winding of the stator coil is sealed with plastic. Plastic keep it and the coil lead-out wire of it separate from the outside which effectively prevents them from being corroded by salty mist.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Such a configuration of the invention allows it to be quickly and efficiently produced in mass or batches with low cost and reliable quality.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the overall structure for the permanent-magnet synchronous motor of a draining pump. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the permanent-magnet synchronous motor of a draining pump according to the present invention includes a permanent-magnet rotor <b>2</b> for driving an impeller to rotate, a pump body <b>3</b> for supporting the permanent-magnet rotor, a stator core <b>5</b> and a stator coil <b>4</b>. Wherein, the stator coil <b>4</b> has an enameled aluminum wire winding which is constructed by coiling an enameled aluminum wire <b>7</b> and is sealed in a container <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In particular, the outside surface of a welding part <b>9</b> of a lead-out wire for the enameled aluminum wire winding (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is covered or coated with insulating materials which isolates it from the outside. Therefore it avoids effectively the welding part being oxidized and corroded. The insulating materials include insulating glue, insulating varnish, epoxy resin and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates a draining pump applied to the present invention. The draining pump can drain off water by means of rotation of an impeller <b>1</b> which is driven by the permanent-magnet rotor <b>2</b> of the permanent-magnet synchronous motor. The permanent-magnet rotor <b>2</b> is supported by the pump body <b>3</b>. The stator coil <b>4</b> is arranged on the stator core <b>5</b> which is fixed on the pump body <b>3</b>. When the current flows through the stator coil <b>4</b>, the permanent-magnet rotor <b>2</b> rotates to drive the impeller <b>1</b> for draining off water.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the stator coil <b>4</b> which is not sealed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the enameled aluminum wire winding is formed by winding or coiling the enameled aluminum wire <b>7</b> around the coil bobbin <b>6</b>. Before the stator coil <b>4</b> is sealed, the outside surface of the enameled aluminum wire winding is covered with one layer or layers of insulating paper tape <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, before the stator coil <b>4</b> is sealed, the outside surface for the welding part of the lead-out wire of the enameled aluminum wire is subject to insulating treatment. For example, the welding part of the lead-out wire of the enameled aluminum wire is coated with insulating substance such as insulating varnish and so on, so that it is insulated from the outside. The welding part of the lead-out wire <b>9</b> of the enameled aluminum wire winding is the one that is welded, and suffers surface treatment with tinning or tin immersion.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the stator coil which is sealed. The enameled aluminum wire <b>7</b> wound on the coil bobbin <b>6</b> is sealed in the container <b>10</b> after it is covered with the insulating paper <b>8</b>. The container <b>10</b> can be a plastic-encapsulation container and it takes the shape of the coil bobbin <b>6</b> wound with the enameled aluminum wire <b>7</b>. In other words, the plastic-encapsulation container is formed by sealing and packaging the coil bobbin <b>6</b> wound with the enameled aluminum wire <b>7</b> with plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, the welding part <b>9</b> of the lead-out wire for the enameled aluminum wire winding is also sealed in the container <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the stator coil which is sealed with epoxy resin. The stator coil <b>4</b> wound with the enameled aluminum wire is first placed into a pump body having annular thin-wall cavity and then it is poured with epoxy resin. The enameled aluminum wire winding, especially its welding point of the lead-out wire, is coated and sealed with epoxy resin.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the invention, the diameter of the enameled aluminum wire <b>7</b> is less than or equal to 0.03937 inches or 1.0 mm and the thickness of the stator core <b>5</b> is between 0.03937 inches or 10 mm and 1.9685 inches or 50 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The invention has technical effects as below:</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Since the stator coil winding, especially its lead-out wire welding part, is sealed with plastic or epoxy resin, it is isolated from acidic and alkaline mist in a humid environment. It effectively prevents the stator coil winding from being corroded and the aluminum wire welding point, which is generally welded with copper terminal, from occurring oxidation reaction of copper and aluminum under the action of oxygen in air.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The stator coil is sealed with plastic and plastic can separate the stator coil winding and the coil lead-out wire isolated from the outside, which effectively prevents the stator coil winding from being corroded by salt mist.</p>
