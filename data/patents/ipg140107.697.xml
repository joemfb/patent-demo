<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention generally relates to integrated detector cooler assemblies (IDCA) and more specifically to IDCA modified to withstand external loads applied to the IDCA or the cryogenic coolers/infrared sensors that incorporate the inventive IDCA.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Infrared cameras play an important role in the surveillance, law enforcement and military applications. Infrared cameras provide thermal images of objects in a thermal scene without illumination. Infrared cameras contain infrared (IR) sensors or focal plane array (FPA), which should be cooled to function properly. In some applications, infrared sensors are cooled to cryogenic temperature range. For these applications, a Stirling Cycle Rotary Cooling Engines are used to provide the cooling power.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional Stirling engines generally have a compressor and an expander connected to a crank mechanism driven by an electrical motor. The compressor, also known as a pressure wave generator, is attached to the warm end of the expander and delivers acoustic power (compressor PV work) into the expander warm end inlet. Compressor PV work is the integration of the pressure-volume curve over one thermodynamic cycle or one complete revolution of the crank shaft. Compressor PV work has a unit of energy, and when derived over time, it is defined as acoustic power. The expander recovers this work at the cold end by causing the gas to expand and thus absorb heat from external power source such as an IR sensor. The gas expansion is achieved mechanically by placing the expander piston and compression piston at 90&#xb0; mechanical phase to each other relative to the crank shaft. A working fluid, typically a noble gas, is compressed at the warm end and is expanded at the cold end. At the distal tip of the expander coldwell, when the expander piston is being pulled backward to iso-thermally expand the working gas, heat is absorbed from the load and very low temperatures are achieved due to efficient thermal isolation between the warm and cold end of the expander unit. Temperature can reach down to the cryogenic range, e.g., about 77&#xb0; K. The IR sensor or FPA is attached to the coldwell to be cooled. A conventional Stirling engine is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,555,908 and 7,587,896 and references cited therein, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the field, infrared cameras are often mounted on law enforcement and military vehicles, including helicopter, drones, naval vessels, military all-terrain vehicles, etc. These vehicles often experience shocks, such as recoils from a discharging weapon. For example, recoils from cannon fires can send damaging vibrations to equipments installed in the vicinity. These vibrations can damage the expander in the Stirling engine, and more specifically the weld between the cold finger and the Dewar body, which can cause the loss of vacuum within the Dewar. This load can also apply a bending stress on the cold finger, which can cause a displacement of the IR sensor or the FPA, which is mounted on the distal end of the cold finger. The vibrations can also break the wires that connect the IR sensor to the central processing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hence, there remains a need for rugged integrated IR detector and cooler assembly that can withstand damaging vibrations encountered in the field.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hence, the invention is directed to a ruggedized integrated detector cooler assembly where the expander or expander cylinder is supported to reduce the effects of a load being applied to the integrated assembly during use. The assembly is incorporated into a cooler, preferably a cryogenic cooler and preferably a Stirling engine. The cooler is used to keep an infrared sensor cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the expander is supported by a support member, preferably a support tube. The support member has a larger proximal end and a smaller distal end. In a preferred embodiment, the support member is connected to the expander at the smaller distal end and is connected to the cooler at the larger proximal end. The support member provides additional stiffness to the expander to reduce movements at the distal end of the expander. The support member also increases the natural frequency of the expander. In one embodiment, the support member increases the natural frequency of the expander at least about two (2) times in the bending and/or twisting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, the bending natural frequency of the expander and support sub-assembly is at least about two times greater or lower than the natural frequency of the electrical wires that connect the infrared sensor to a control processing unit to reduce the maximum stress applied to the electrical wires.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, additional or redundant electrical pathways are provided for the connection between the infrared sensor and the CPU. Furthermore, shock absorber and/or shock diverters are provided on the rigid pins that connect the electrical wires to the CPU.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A first embodiment of integrated detector cooler assembly (hereinafter &#x201c;IDCA&#x201d;) <b>1</b> present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>2</b>A. IDCA <b>1</b> comprises expander <b>10</b> and detector <b>12</b>. Expander <b>10</b> is supported by and is at least partially covered by expander support tube <b>14</b>. Support tube <b>14</b> increases the stiffness of expander <b>10</b> to reduce the effects of a shock and/or vibrations applied on expander <b>10</b> from a load caused, for example, by a firing of a weapon attached to the same platform as IDCA <b>1</b> or from an external source impacting expander <b>10</b>. An expansion piston and a regenerator matrix within the expansion piston for exchanging heat with the working fluid are provided for reciprocal motions within expander <b>10</b>. These two elements are omitted in the figures of the present patent application for clarity. An expansion space is provided between the distal end of the expansion piston and the distal end of expander <b>10</b> to provide cooling power to an IR sensor or a FPA (hereinafter &#x201c;sensor&#x201d;) <b>15</b> mounted within detector <b>12</b> of IDCA <b>1</b> as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">IDCA <b>1</b> and a compressor are housed in a housing or outer shell. The compressor and expander <b>10</b> are parts of a cooler or a cryogenic cooler, preferably a Stirling engine. The space within the housing, which is shown in part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is a vacuum or partial vacuum space.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, support tube <b>14</b> has a hollow truncated conical shape with larger proximal end <b>16</b> and smaller distal end <b>18</b>, and is connected at proximal end <b>16</b> to the interface between Dewar flange <b>20</b>, which forms a part of the housing, and expander <b>10</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Preferably, this connection is accomplished by welding, laser welding and preferably by electron beam welding. At distal end <b>18</b>, support tube <b>14</b> is connected to expander <b>10</b> via upper flange <b>22</b>. Preferably, upper flange <b>22</b> has a star-shaped configuration as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In this embodiment, the connection between upper flange <b>22</b> and expander <b>10</b> is preferably continuous and the connection between upper flange <b>22</b> and support tube <b>14</b> is preferably intermittent to minimize the conductive heat transfer through support tube <b>14</b>, which thermally connects the warm end of the Stirling engine at or proximate to Dewar flange <b>20</b> to expander <b>10</b> proximate to the cold expansion space. Such heat transfer is considered a heat leakage or loss and is minimized by the intermittent contacts between upper flange <b>22</b> and support tube <b>14</b> and by minimizing the thickness of support tube <b>14</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the intermittent contacts may be deployed at the interface of upper flange <b>22</b> and expander <b>10</b>. In yet another embodiment, the intermittent contacts can be deployed at proximal end <b>16</b> between support tube <b>14</b> and Dewar flange <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another advantage of upper flange <b>22</b> is that it is flexible to allow relative movement caused by differential thermal expansion or contraction between expander <b>10</b> and support tube <b>14</b>. Advantageously, upper flange <b>22</b> is positioned substantially orthogonal to expander <b>10</b> and to support tube <b>14</b> to allow optimal flexibility. Alternatively, upper flange <b>22</b> is allowed to slide relative to expander <b>10</b> while being connected to support tube <b>14</b> or vice versa to handle the thermal expansion or contraction between expander <b>10</b> and support tube <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, support tube <b>14</b> is made from a strong and light weight material to support expander <b>10</b>. Additionally, support tube <b>14</b> has a relatively thin thickness in order to further reduce the heat leakage or loss described above. In one embodiment, support tube <b>14</b> is made from titanium (Ti) and has a thickness from about 1.5 to about 4 mils, preferably from about 2 mils to about 3 mils, and more preferably about 2.5 mils. Titanium is preferred due to its strength and relatively low conductive thermal conductivity. Other suitable materials also include, but are not limited to, Ti6AL-4V.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An advantage of support tube <b>14</b> is that it can increase the natural frequency of expander <b>10</b>. The natural frequency, f, of a simple mechanical system can be expressed as</p>

where k is the effective spring constant of the system and M is the mass of the system. Higher natural frequency of a mechanical system, also known as resonance frequency, is beneficial because the vibration caused by a load experienced by expander <b>10</b> in the field generally has a low frequency. Moving the natural frequency of expander <b>10</b> away from the load vibration reduces the effects or impacts that the load vibration would have on expander <b>10</b>. A modal analysis, e.g., finite element analysis (FEA) or finite difference (FD), shows that support tube <b>14</b> doubles the natural frequency of expander <b>10</b> in a bending mode as well as a twisting mode. A bending mode is a vibration tending to bend expander <b>10</b> along arrows A, and a twisting mode is a vibration twisting expander about its longitudinal axis along arrow B. The results of the modal analysis are shown below.

As shown, the natural frequency due to the bending moment can be reduced further by shortening the length of expander <b>10</b>. In one example, expander <b>10</b> can be shortened from about 0.25 inch to about 0.31 inch. Additionally, the maximum displacement of support plate <b>24</b>, where an IR sensor <b>15</b> is mounted, is less due to the lower bending natural frequency by a factor of about six (0.0336/0.0050) in the example shown above. This also lowers any load on sensor <b>15</b> applied.
</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Displacement of expander <b>10</b> at sensor <b>15</b> can also place a load on the electrical wires that connect the sensor <b>15</b> mounted on support plate <b>24</b> to a control processor unit (CPU) that receives IR information from sensor <b>15</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, sensor <b>15</b> is mounted on support plate <b>24</b> and a plurality of pins <b>26</b> is placed around sensor <b>15</b>/plate <b>24</b> outside the IR radiation shield of detector unit <b>12</b>. IR radiation shields are discussed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,144,031, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Pins <b>26</b> extend from the Dewar vacuum space <b>30</b> inside IDCA <b>1</b> to outside of IDCA <b>1</b>. The portions of pins <b>26</b> within Dewar vacuum space <b>30</b> are designated as <b>26</b><sub>vacuum</sub>. Electrical wires <b>28</b> connect each pin <b>26</b> to sensor <b>15</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to transmit the IR information received by sensor <b>15</b> through pins <b>26</b> to the CPU. The present invention further improves the connection of these wires to better withstand the vibrations encountered by IDCA <b>1</b> in the field. Such vibrations can sever the wires and cause IDCA <b>1</b> to fail to function, and can shear pins <b>26</b> which may cause a loss of vacuum inside IDCA <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance to another aspect of the present invention, the natural frequency(ies) of wires <b>28</b> are designed to be different than that of expander <b>10</b>, so that in the event that expander <b>10</b> is excited by vibrations proximate to its natural frequency, which would resulted in large physical loads on expander <b>10</b>, the impact on wires <b>28</b> is minimized. Preferably, the natural frequency of wires <b>28</b> is different than both the bending and twisting natural frequencies of expander <b>10</b>. More preferably, the natural frequency of wires <b>28</b> is at least about 2 times under or above both the bending and twisting natural frequencies of expander <b>10</b>. In one preferred embodiment the natural frequency of wires <b>28</b> is at least different than the bending natural frequency of expander <b>10</b>, or at least about 2 times under or above the bending natural frequency of expander <b>10</b>, since the bending natural frequency has a higher tendency to displace sensor <b>15</b> and wires <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The natural frequency of electrical wires depends on the material, the diameter and the length of the wires. A modal analysis of electrical wires <b>28</b> made from a metal alloy, for example Manganin&#xae; alloys, which typically comprises 86% copper, 12% manganese, and 2% nickel, was conducted. The results are as follows.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The results show that in cases <b>1</b> and <b>4</b> by reducing the movement of expander <b>10</b> and by moving the natural frequency of expander <b>10</b> with the addition of support tube <b>14</b>, the maximum stress encountered by wires <b>28</b> reduces from about 142,000 psi to about 7,010 psi for a 20+ folds reduction. The results also show that increasing the diameter of wires may not be as beneficial. A two-fold increase (case 2) actually increases the wire's natural frequency and matching it with the expander's natural frequency. A four-fold increase (case 3) brings the wire's natural frequency above and beyond the expander's natural frequency and reduces the maximum stress encountered by wires <b>28</b>; however, larger diameter wires would increase conduction heat loss from sensor <b>15</b>, which is kept at cryogenic temperatures, through wires <b>28</b> and pins <b>26</b>. Hence, in a preferred embodiment, the natural frequency of expander <b>10</b> is increased by using support tube <b>14</b>, while the natural frequency of wires <b>18</b> is maintained to be lower than that of expander <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance to another aspect of the present invention, the pin portion <b>26</b><sub>vacuum</sub>, of pins <b>26</b> that is within Dewar vacuum space and connected wires <b>28</b> is modified as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The vibration load represented as elements <b>31</b> generally enters pins <b>26</b> where they are connected to base <b>32</b> of detector unit <b>12</b>. As vibration <b>31</b> travels through pins <b>26</b>, it may sever the connection with wire <b>28</b> at the top of portion <b>26</b><sub>vacuum</sub>. In this embodiment, a number of shallow slots <b>34</b> are carved or formed on the shaft of portion <b>26</b><sub>vacuum</sub>. In one example, pins <b>26</b> have a diameter of about 0.030 inch and slots <b>34</b> have depths of about 0.015 inch or less. Slots <b>34</b> are preferably filled with an electrically conductive gel or epoxy. Suitable conductive epoxies include, but are not limited to, EPO-TEK-E4110 conductive epoxy for vacuum vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Filled slots <b>34</b> can block elastic wave front path along pins <b>26</b> and may direct these waves, which are caused by vibrations <b>31</b>, away from the top of pins <b>26</b><sub>vacuum</sub>, where wires <b>28</b> are attached. Filled slots <b>34</b> can also provide vibration damping to absorb some of the vibration. Preferably, slots <b>34</b> are arranged in an overlapping fashion along pins <b>26</b><sub>vacuum </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to eliminate clear, direct path for the elastic wave front to reach the top of pins <b>26</b><sub>vacuum</sub>. In other words, slots <b>34</b> divert at least some of the vibrations away from the connections to wires <b>28</b>. Although two slots <b>34</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, any number of slots <b>34</b> can be provided. Vibration <b>31</b> also travels along pins <b>26</b> in the opposite direction, and if necessary or desired filled slots <b>34</b> can be provided on the portions of pins <b>26</b> that are outside of Dewar vacuum space <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance to another aspect of the present invention, looped wires <b>36</b> can be employed to provide additional electrical paths, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Unlike wires <b>28</b>, which are direct electrical connections between sensor <b>15</b> and pins <b>26</b>, looped wires <b>36</b> are generally longer and loop around pins <b>26</b><sub>vacuum </sub>before being attached at the top of pins <b>26</b><sub>vacuum</sub>. Looped wires <b>36</b> provides two additional electrical paths: a path along the entire length of wires <b>36</b> shown by arrows C, and a path along part of wires <b>36</b> and through slot(s) <b>34</b> and along portions of pins <b>26</b><sub>vacuum </sub>shown by arrows D. In this embodiment, if wires <b>28</b> are severed, wires <b>36</b> can still provide electrical connection. Even if both wires <b>28</b> and <b>36</b> are severed from the top of pins <b>26</b><sub>vacuum </sub>electrical connection along arrows D is still available.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As As shown, looped wires <b>36</b> can wrap around slots <b>34</b>, and the latter can be anchors for looped wires <b>36</b>. Wires <b>36</b> may have at least one loop or one bend to absorb vibration or shock. The electrical conductive gel or epoxy assures an electrical connected at slots <b>34</b>. These anchors are located further from the tip of pins <b>26</b><sub>vacuum</sub>, where the vibration is less and the pin movement is smaller. Furthermore, looped wires <b>36</b> are longer than wires <b>28</b> and preferably have an amount of slacks in the wires. These slacks can also absorb some of the vibrations without putting stress or strain on wires <b>36</b>. Additionally, slacks can be provided in wire <b>28</b> as shown as element <b>29</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to absorb vibration. Preferably, slacks <b>29</b> comprise one or more coils as shown.</p>
