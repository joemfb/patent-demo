<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage application of international patent application PCT/US09/54466, filed Aug. 20, 2009, entitled &#x201c;ONLINE TRANSACTION METHOD AND SYSTEM USING A PAYMENT PLATFORM AND A LOGISTICS COMPANY&#x201d;, which claims priority from Chinese patent application, Application No. 200810210077.6, filed Aug. 20, 2008, entitled &#x201c;ONLINE TRANSACTION METHOD AND SYSTEM&#x201d;, which applications are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of networking, and particularly relates to methods and systems for conducting online transactions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Along with the development of the Internet and maturity of encryption technologies such as digital signature, electronic commerce has been expanding globally at a tremendous pace. Many successful companies have grown up using electronic commerce as the primary method of business operation. The new business methods developed in context of e-commerce have completely revolutionized the existing business mode.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic structural diagram of a generic example of an existing online transaction system <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> includes merchant <b>11</b>, intermediary transaction platform <b>12</b>, payment platform <b>13</b>, and user <b>14</b>. User <b>14</b> purchases a product of merchant <b>11</b>, and makes an online payment using payment platform <b>13</b>. Merchant <b>11</b> ships the product to user <b>14</b>. Merchant <b>11</b> and payment platform <b>13</b> conduct account reconciliation and account remittance on a regular basis. Functions that are achieved by payment platform <b>13</b> may be integrated into intermediary transaction platform <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">AliPay is an example of payment platform <b>13</b>. User <b>14</b> may open an account with AliPay, and deposit a certain amount of fund into the account through direct deposit or recharging method. If user <b>14</b> purchases a product of merchant <b>11</b>, a deduction from the account is processed through AliPay. This method only requires merchant <b>11</b> to complete account reconciliation and account remittance with AliPay on a regular basis.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Intermediary transaction platform <b>12</b> may have a server center <b>121</b> and a database <b>122</b>. The server center <b>121</b> is used for processing transaction requests, while the database <b>122</b> is used for recording each transaction in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As illustrated from the above online transaction, because merchant <b>11</b> and user <b>14</b> conduct trading through intermediary transaction platform <b>12</b>, the security of the transaction is improved. From user <b>14</b>'s perspective, making a payment through intermediary transaction platform <b>12</b> removes concerns of the authenticity of the online virtual merchant <b>11</b> and the uncertainty about quality of a product to be purchased. From merchant <b>11</b>'s perspective, the sales volume is improved because intermediary transaction platform <b>12</b> establishes the confidence of buyers (user <b>14</b>). This type of business mode achieves a win-win mode among merchant <b>11</b>, user <b>14</b> and intermediary transaction platform <b>12</b>, and has seen rapid development.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This type of business mode has deficiencies. First, the current business model does not satisfy the shopping needs of buyers who are not able to use the payment method provided by a payment platform, and also fails to satisfy users who feel insecure to commit a large amount of money to make an online purchase. Second, often a dispute arises because of inconsistency between what is actually purchased and what a user has seen in an image online when purchasing a product. Third, in online shopping, some merchants still sell products using direct home delivery and payment collection at the door through a logistics company. If a logistics company is entrusted to collect payments, merchant may face cash flow pressure if the logistics company is slow to return the payments. Fourth, if a logistics company is entrusted to collect payments, various transaction issues may arise because different merchants may entrust different logistics companies, and no uniform standard exists among logistics companies. This is especially true if payment by a logistics company is delayed.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosed online transaction method and system uses payment platform acting as an intermediary agent between the merchant and the shipping company to handle the payment. While the payment platform receives payment from the shipping company, the merchant receives payment from the payment platform. The method and system do not require buyers to use the payment method provided by an intermediary transaction platform to make a payment. Instead, the buyer may pay directly to the shipping company. Unlike conventional transaction method based on COD, however, the disclosed online transaction method and system centrally manage a logistics platform or multiple logistics operations run by logistics companies. The merchant does not receive the payment from the logistics company, but rather receive the payment from a centralized payment platform to ensure secure and fast payment.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The payment platform and the intermediary transaction platform may either be two separate platforms or integrated into a single intermediary platform.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The fund settlement between the payment platform and the logistics company may be conducted through a logistics platform on behalf of the logistics company. The logistics platform may either be a centralized logistics platform shared by multiple logistics companies, or separate logistics operations run by different logistics companies. In one embodiment, the method allows the merchant to select the logistics company from a plurality of logistics companies contracted with the intermediary transaction platform. The logistics company may be selected by the merchant as a default logistics company for all transactions involving the merchant. Alternatively, the logistics company may be designated by the intermediary transaction platform.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The fund settlement between the payment platform and the logistics company may include paying a service fee to the logistics company. The fund settlement between the payment platform and the merchant may include charging a service fee on the merchant. Both these fund settlements may be either separately conducted for each transaction or collectively conducted for multiple transactions on a periodic basis.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The online transaction system for conducting a merchandise transaction between a merchant and a user includes an intermediary transaction platform and a payment platform. The intermediary transaction platform and the payment platform are programmed to perform the acts of the method disclosed herein. The intermediary transaction platform is accessible by the user, the merchant, and the logistics company through the Internet. The payment platform is accessible by the merchant and the logistics company through a designated line or the Internet. The intermediary transaction platform and the payment platform may be connected through any one or more of a designated line, a local area network, and the Internet. In one embodiment, the intermediary transaction platform and the payment platform are integrated into a single intermediary platform.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Compared with existing technologies, the disclosed method and system have several potential benefits. First, using a payment platform acting between the merchant and the logistics company, payment delay that may be caused by the logistics company is avoided, and the security of a transaction is improved. With the existing COD method, the merchant suffers financial pressure due to slow return of payments by the logistics company which is entrusted to collect the payments on behalf of the merchant. With the disclosed method, the payment return by be logistics companies are centrally handled by the payment platform. This shifts the burden of payment collection from the logistics companies to the payment platform to be handled more efficiently. At the same time, the logistics company may receive service fees from the payment platform in a more uniform and reliable manner. Second, the buyer and the merchant can inquire conditions of the present transaction through a network in real time worth the benefit of convenience, swiftness and information transparency.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The online transaction method and system are described in details using the companying figures.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the presence disclosure, a &#x201c;module&#x201d; or a &#x201c;unit&#x201d; in general refers to a functionality designed to perform a particular task or function. A module or a unit can be a piece of hardware, software, a plan or scheme, or a combination thereof, for effectuating a purpose associated with the particular task or function. In addition, delineation of separate units does not necessarily suggest that physically separate devices are used. Instead, the delineation may be only functional, not structural, and the functions of several units may be performed by a single combined device or component. When used in a computer-based system, regular computer components such as a processor, a storage and memory may be programmed to function as one or more units or devices to perform the various respective functions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exemplary structural diagram of an online transaction system <b>200</b> in accordance with the present disclosure. The system <b>200</b> together with its application environment includes user <b>24</b> (e.g., a buyer), merchant <b>21</b>, intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b>, payment platform <b>23</b>, and logistics platform <b>25</b> of a contracted logistics company. User <b>24</b>, merchant <b>21</b>, and logistics platform <b>25</b> connect with intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> through the Internet. Merchant <b>21</b> and logistics platform <b>25</b> of the logistics company connect with payment platform <b>23</b> through the Internet. Alternatively, merchant <b>21</b> and logistics platform <b>25</b> may connect with payment platform <b>23</b> through designated lines. Intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> and payment platform <b>23</b> are connected to each other through a designated line, or a local area network, or the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The core of the online transaction system for conducting a merchandise transaction includes intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> and payment platform <b>23</b>, which are programmed to perform the acts of the method disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the present disclosure, intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> is primarily established for conducting a transaction between merchant <b>21</b> and user <b>24</b>. Intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> stores contract information of each merchant, registration information of user <b>24</b>, and contract information of each logistics company. Intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> is used for processing and storing transaction data of each transaction. Payment platform <b>23</b> is primarily used for completing financial tasks of accounting and account settlement with merchant <b>21</b> and the logistics company.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Logical differentiation between intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> and payment platform <b>23</b> is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> includes a first server <b>221</b> and a first database <b>222</b>. Intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> further includes a network interfacing device connecting with the Internet, and a network security device used for improving its security (a firewall, for example). These devices are general and common devices for an online transaction platform, and therefore are not described here.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first server <b>221</b> is programmed to perform various functions. These functions are described below in terms of functional modules or units.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A user processing sub-unit <b>223</b> is used for receiving and processing various requests submitted by user <b>24</b>. The requests may include registration, transaction request. The user processing sub-unit <b>222</b> is also used for establishing and saving interactive actions of user <b>24</b>. It is appreciated that user <b>24</b> is a generic representation of any user. In practice, multiple users may be accessing the first server <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Upon registration on intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b>, user <b>24</b> is allowed to conduct online transaction. While registering with a username and a password, user <b>24</b> may further specify a payment method upon delivery. With such registration information, intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> knows the customary payment method used by user <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A merchant processing sub-unit <b>224</b> is used for receiving and processing various interactive actions with merchant <b>21</b>. For example, the merchant processing sub-unit <b>224</b> is used for receiving and processing a registration request from merchant <b>21</b>. If registration of merchant <b>21</b> satisfies registration requirements required by the present platform, registration is granted, and information of merchant <b>21</b> is saved. In each merchandise transaction, a transaction result is returned to merchant <b>21</b> through the merchant processing sub-unit <b>224</b>. In one embodiment, merchant <b>21</b> may also log into intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> through the merchant processing sub-unit <b>224</b> to inquire current transaction status of each transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A logistics platform processing sub-unit <b>225</b> is used for receiving and storing contract information of the logistics company, and for receiving and processing various transaction information sent from logistics platform <b>25</b> in each transaction. For example, the logistics platform processing sub-unit <b>225</b> may send a result of pickup service and a user confirmation to payment platform <b>23</b> upon receiving such information.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A transaction processing unit <b>226</b> is used for processing each transaction, and saving a processing result to the first database <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first database <b>222</b> may be divided into several regions for various storage functions. For example, a user storage region <b>227</b> is used for storing user information. A merchant storage region <b>228</b> is used for storing merchant information. A logistics platform storage region <b>229</b> is used for storing logistics company information. A transaction data storage region <b>230</b> is used for storing conditions of each transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Payment platform <b>23</b> is used for conducting fund settlement with each merchant and each logistics company. In one embodiment, payment platform <b>23</b> handles fund settlement with merchant and fund settlement with logistics company separately. Payment platform <b>23</b> may conduct a first payment settlement with a logistics company (through logistics platform <b>25</b>), and a second payment settlement with merchant <b>21</b>. The first payment settlement may include receiving funds from the logistics company into payment platform <b>23</b>. The second payment settlement may include transferring funds from payment platform <b>23</b> to merchant <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Based on different connection methods between payment platform <b>23</b> and intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b>, slightly different hardware combinations may be installed in payment platform <b>23</b>. For example, a network security device (e.g., a firewall) may be installed in payment platform <b>23</b> if payment platform <b>23</b> and intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> are connected through the Internet. If payment platform <b>23</b> and intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b> are connected through a designated line, a network security device may not be needed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Payment platform <b>23</b> further includes a second server <b>231</b> and a second database <b>232</b>. The second server <b>231</b> includes various functional units. For example, an interaction processing unit <b>233</b> is used for processing interactions with intermediary transaction platform <b>22</b>. An accounting processing unit <b>234</b> is used for performing accounting operations with each logistics platform <b>25</b> on a regular basis or in real time according to a predetermined setting. If logistics platform <b>25</b> is set to complete accounting work in regular periods, all charges which include costs of products, shipping costs, and service charges within a present period are sent to payment platform <b>23</b> from the logistics company in advance. Payment platform <b>23</b> then distributes shared charges logistics companies based on an income-sharing scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An account settlement processing unit <b>235</b> is used for completing account settlement operations with each merchant on a regular basis or in real time according to a predetermined setting. Each merchant may select a method for account settlement based on its characteristics and transactional characteristics of the product. For example, upon completion of each transaction, merchant <b>21</b> may select that payment platform <b>23</b> to send a payment including cost of the product and shipping charge in the present successful transaction to an account designated by merchant <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The second database <b>232</b> may include various units for different storage purposes. A merchant account storage unit <b>236</b> is used for storing rules of account settlement with merchant <b>21</b>, and for storing conditions of account settlement of each transaction with merchant <b>21</b>. A logistics platform storage unit <b>237</b> is used for storing rules of account settlement with logistics companies, and for storing conditions of account settlement of each transaction with the respective logistics company.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The user processing sub-unit <b>223</b>, the merchant processing sub-unit <b>224</b>, the logistics platform processing sub-unit <b>225</b>, and the transaction processing unit <b>226</b> are logical units, and may be integrated in a processor of the first server <b>221</b>. Likewise, they accounting processing unit <b>234</b> and the account settlement processing unit <b>235</b> are logical units, and may be integrated in a processor of the second server <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The fund settlement between payment platform <b>22</b> and the logistics company may be conducted through logistics platform <b>25</b> on behalf of the logistics company. Logistics platform <b>25</b> may either be a centralized logistics platform shared by multiple logistics companies, or separate logistics operations run by different logistics companies.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fund settlement between payment platform <b>23</b> and the logistics company may include paying a service fee to the logistics company. The fund settlement between payment platform <b>23</b> and merchant <b>21</b> may include charging a service fee on merchant <b>21</b>. Both these fund settlements may be either separately conducted for each transaction or collectively conducted for multiple transactions on a periodic basis.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an exemplary method <b>300</b> of online transaction using the system of the present disclosure. The method <b>300</b> is used for conducting a merchandise transaction between merchant <b>31</b> and user <b>34</b> through logistics platform <b>35</b> of a logistics company. The method includes the procedures described as follows. In this description, the order in which a process is described is not intended to be construed as a limitation, and any number of the described process blocks may be combined in any order to implement the method, or an alternate method.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">S<b>310</b>: User <b>34</b> purchases a product of merchant <b>31</b> through intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b>, and submits to intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> a transaction request including a payment mode such as cash-on-delivery selected by user <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Merchant <b>31</b> posts products to be sold (e.g., auctioned) with prices onto intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b>. Upon logging onto intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b>, registered user <b>34</b> can see a total cost (which includes product price, shipping charge and service charge) and a payment method required for purchasing a product. User <b>34</b> submits a transaction request to intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> upon deciding to purchase the product. The transaction request includes product information, required payment amount and payment mode. If user <b>34</b> selects a payment method of cash-on-delivery (COD), the transaction request may further include a user address for delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">S<b>320</b>: Intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> sends transaction information which includes the mode of payment to payment platform <b>33</b>. Upon receiving the transaction request from the user <b>34</b>, intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> creates a record of the transaction, and sends the transaction information (especially the payment method) to payment platform <b>33</b> to facilitate the creation of the transaction by payment platform <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">S<b>330</b>: Intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> sends a request for pickup service to logistics platform <b>35</b> of a contracted logistics company which is either selected by merchant <b>31</b> or designated by intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, step S<b>330</b> may include the following procedure. Intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> sends information of the transaction request to merchant <b>31</b>. This allows merchant <b>31</b> to timely learn about the conditions of the present transaction, and helps merchant <b>31</b> quickly prepare the product for shipping. Merchant <b>31</b> submits to intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> information of a contracted logistics company designated by merchant <b>31</b>. Thereafter, intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> sends to the logistics company a request for pickup service. The request may include the information of the product to be picked up, the total cost for purchasing the product, and the address of user <b>34</b>. Logistics platform <b>35</b> may optionally log onto intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> to find the address of merchant <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Alternatively, the step S<b>330</b> may include the following procedures. Intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> directly sends the request for pickup service to logistics platform <b>35</b> corresponding to a contracted logistics company which has been designated by merchant <b>31</b> in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Logistics companies sign a contract in advance with intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> to become contracted logistics companies. In each transaction, merchant <b>31</b> may select one contracted logistics company from the available contracted logistics companies to complete the present transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Alternatively, merchant <b>31</b> may select in advance one contracted logistics company from these contracted logistics companies to be merchant <b>31</b>'s designated logistics company, and complete all transactions using the designated logistics company.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">S<b>340</b>: Upon receiving a result of pickup service indicating that &#x201c;goods has been successfully picked up&#x201d; from logistics platform <b>35</b>, intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> sends to payment platform <b>33</b> a transaction status indicating that merchant <b>31</b> has shipped the product.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The outcome of a logistics company's attempt to pick up goods is usually either a &#x201c;successful pick-up of goods&#x201d; or an &#x201c;unsuccessful pick-up of goods&#x201d;. If the outcome is a &#x201c;successful pick-up of goods&#x201d;, the logistics company sends the result of pickup service to payment platform <b>33</b> through its logistics platform <b>35</b>. Intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> stores the result of pickup service to allow inquiring from merchant <b>31</b> and user <b>34</b>, and sends a transaction status indicating &#x201c;successful pick-up of goods&#x201d; to payment platform <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If the outcome is &#x201c;unsuccessful pick-up of goods&#x201d;, the logistics company also sends the result of pickup service to intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> through its logistics platform. A cause for the &#x201c;unsuccessful pick-up of goods&#x201d; may be included in the result of pickup service. For example, merchant <b>31</b> may have failed to complete the transaction because it has not prepared the product.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> may track occasions wherein a result of pickup service indicating &#x201c;unsuccessful pick-up of goods&#x201d; is received from logistics platform, and apply a punitive measure on a merchant according to a pre-determined rule if an accumulative number of such failure occasions of the particular merchant is greater than a threshold. For example, upon receiving the result of pickup service indicating &#x201c;unsuccessful pick-up of goods&#x201d; from logistics platform <b>35</b>, intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> sends the result of pickup service to the payment platform <b>33</b>, and determines whether the total number of &#x201c;unsuccessful pick-up of goods&#x201d; this particular merchant has accumulated is greater than a threshold. If yes, merchant <b>31</b> may be dealt with according to a pre-determined rule. For instance, intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> may exclude merchant <b>31</b> from trading on intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">S<b>350</b>: Upon receiving a user confirmation indicating &#x201c;user has confirmed the receipt of goods&#x201d; from logistics platform <b>35</b>, intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> sends to payment platform <b>33</b> a transaction status indicating that the buyer (i.e., user <b>34</b>) has confirmed receiving the product.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, after the logistics company delivers a product to user <b>34</b>, the user <b>34</b> may usually make a payment upon verification of the receiving unit. The logistics company then sends information of a user confirmation to intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> through its logistics platform <b>35</b>. Intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> in turn sends a corresponding transaction status to payment platform <b>33</b>. However, sometimes the user may refuse to pay for the product. In this case, the logistics company needs to send information indicating the user rejection to intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> through its logistics platform <b>35</b>. Intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> then not only sends a corresponding transaction status to payment platform <b>33</b>, but also needs to perform the several additional operations. For example, intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> may send to logistics platform <b>35</b> a processing instruction indicating a return of the product to merchant <b>31</b>. Logistics platform <b>35</b> sends to intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> a processing result indicating that the product has been returned to merchant <b>31</b>. Intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> then sends the processing result to payment platform <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">S<b>360</b>: Payment platform <b>33</b> and merchant <b>31</b> settle a transaction payment in real time or on a regular basis.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one exemplary embodiment, if merchant <b>31</b> wants to receive the payment faster, payment platform <b>33</b> may transfer the cost of the product and the shipping charge to merchant <b>31</b> quickly upon receiving &#x201c;user confirmation of receipt of goods&#x201d; in each transaction. However, payment platform <b>33</b> and merchant <b>31</b> may agree to settle payments on a periodic basis. Payment platform <b>33</b> may transfer all payments of successful transactions within the present period to merchant <b>31</b> in each settlement.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">S<b>370</b>: Payment platform <b>33</b> and logistics platform <b>35</b> complete accounting and profit sharing (or revenue distribution) operations in real time or on a regular basis.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a typical arrangement, the logistics company transfers each payment received from user <b>34</b> to payment platform <b>33</b>. The payment by user <b>34</b> covers all charges of products, shipping charges, and service fees. Payment platform <b>33</b> subsequently pays a service fee to the logistics company as part of the profit sharing (or revenue distribution). If intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> and payment platform <b>33</b> belong to different companies, service charges are shared among three parties. How payment platform <b>33</b> and logistics platform <b>35</b> conduct account settlement may depend on a rule of account settlement agreed upon by both parties in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It is noted that logistics platform <b>35</b> may either be a centralized platform or simply individual logistics operations run by merchant companies. In either case, the centralized logistics platform <b>35</b> or separate logistics platforms (operations) <b>35</b> are centrally managed by payment platform <b>33</b>. As illustrated from the above transaction process, logistics companies sign contracts with payment platform <b>33</b> in advance, and payment platform <b>33</b> conducts centralized management of the logistics companies. From a merchant's perspective, the problem of delayed payments can be solved. From a user's (buyer's) perspective, the transaction has a more secure safeguard.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As will be shown below, in one embodiment, the payment platform may be set up in the intermediary transaction platform.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a schematic structural diagram of a second exemplary online transaction system <b>400</b> in accordance with the present disclosure. The system <b>400</b> includes user <b>44</b>, merchant <b>41</b>, intermediary platform <b>40</b>, and logistics platform <b>45</b> of a contracted logistics company. User <b>44</b>, merchant <b>41</b>, and logistics platform <b>45</b> of the logistics company connect with intermediary platform <b>40</b> through the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Intermediary platform <b>40</b> is a platform primarily established for conducting a transaction between merchant <b>41</b> and user <b>44</b>. Intermediary platform <b>40</b> stores contract information of each merchant <b>41</b>, registration information of user <b>44</b>, and contract information of each logistics company. Intermediary platform <b>40</b> is used for processing and storing transaction conditions of each transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Intermediary platform <b>40</b> is a combination of intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> and payment platform <b>33</b>, which are integrated into a single platform in this embodiment. Functions of intermediary transaction platform <b>32</b> and payment platform <b>33</b> are integrally performed by intermediary platform <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Intermediary platform <b>40</b> includes a first server <b>401</b> and a first database <b>402</b>. Intermediary platform <b>40</b> further includes a network interfacing device connecting with the Internet, and a network security device used for improving its security (a firewall, for example). These devices are general and common devices for an online transaction platform, and therefore are not described.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The first server <b>401</b> includes several units to perform various functions. A user processing sub-unit <b>403</b> is used for receiving and processing various requests submitted by user <b>44</b>. Such requests may include registration and transaction request of user <b>44</b>. The user processing sub-unit <b>402</b> is also used for establishing and saving interactive actions of user <b>44</b>. A merchant processing sub-unit <b>404</b> is used for receiving and processing various interactive actions with merchant <b>41</b>. A logistics platform processing sub-unit <b>405</b> is used for receiving and saving contract information of the logistics company, and for receiving and processing various transaction information sent from logistics platform <b>45</b> in each transaction process. A transaction processing unit <b>406</b> is used for processing each transaction and saving a processing result to the first database <b>402</b>. An accounting processing unit <b>434</b> is used for completing accounting operations with each logistics platform <b>45</b> on a regular basis or in real time according to a predetermined setting. An account settlement processing unit <b>435</b> is used for completing account settlement operations with each merchant <b>41</b> on a regular basis or in real time according to a predetermined setting.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Each merchant may select, based on characteristics thereof and transaction characteristics of product, a method for account settlement. For example, merchant <b>41</b> may elect that intermediary platform <b>40</b> send a payment including the cost of product and shipping charges an account designated by merchant <b>41</b> upon completion of each transaction in order to speed up the payment cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The first database <b>402</b> is divided into several regions for different storage purposes. For example, a user storage region <b>407</b> is used for storing user information. A merchant storage region <b>408</b> is used for storing merchant information. A logistics platform storage region <b>409</b> is used for storing logistics company information. A transaction data storage region <b>430</b> is used for storing conditions of each transaction. A merchant account storage unit <b>436</b> is used for storing rules of account settlement with merchant <b>41</b>, and for storing conditions of account settlement of each transaction with merchant <b>41</b>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a flow chart of a second exemplary online transaction method <b>500</b> in accordance with the present disclosure. The method <b>500</b> can be implemented using the system <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Like the method <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method in this embodiment is used for conducting a merchandise transaction between a merchant and a user through a logistics company. The method <b>500</b> is described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">S<b>510</b>: User <b>54</b> purchases a product of merchant <b>51</b> through intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b>, and submits to intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b> a transaction request including a mode of payment (e.g., COD) selected by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">S<b>520</b>: Intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b> sends a request for pickup service to logistics platform <b>55</b> of a contracted logistics company which is either selected by the merchant or designated by intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">S<b>530</b>: Logistics platform <b>55</b> sends a result of pickup service indicating &#x201c;successful pick-up of goods&#x201d; to intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">S<b>540</b>: Logistics platform <b>55</b> sends a user confirmation indicating &#x201c;user has confirmed the receipt of goods&#x201d; to intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">S<b>550</b>: Intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b> conducts operations of transaction settlement with merchant <b>51</b> and logistics platform <b>55</b> in real time or on a regular basis. The settlement with merchant <b>51</b> and the settlement with logistics platform <b>55</b> may be conducted separately.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">If a result of pickup service indicating &#x201c;unsuccessful pick-up of goods&#x201d; is received from logistics platform <b>55</b>, intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b> determines whether the number of &#x201c;unsuccessful pick-up of goods&#x201d; accumulated by this particular merchant is greater than a threshold. If yes, the merchant is dealt with according to a pre-determined rule.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">If logistics platform <b>55</b> sends to intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b> a user confirmation indicating &#x201c;user rejection of goods&#x201d;, intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b> sends to logistics platform <b>55</b> a processing instruction indicating a return of the product to merchant <b>51</b>. Subsequently, logistics platform <b>55</b> sends to intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b> a processing result indicating that the product has been returned to merchant <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Step S<b>550</b> may further include the following exemplary procedure. Intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b> advances to the merchant a payment including cost of the product and a shipping charge in advance. Logistics platform <b>55</b> regularly clears the account by transferring to intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b> payments including the cost of the product, the shipping charge, and a service charge received. Intermediary transaction platform <b>52</b> regularly distributes to logistics platform <b>55</b> a service fee based on a profit-sharing (or revenue distribution) agreement.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The disclosed online transaction method and system do not require buyers to use the payment method provided by an intermediary transaction platform to make a payment. Instead, the buyer may pay directly to a logistics company such as a shipping company. Unlike conventional transaction method based on COD, however, the disclosed online transaction method and system centrally manage the logistics platform or multiple logistics operations run by logistics companies. The merchant does not receive the payment from the logistics company, but rather receive the payment from a centralized payment platform, which is either a separate platform or a part of an intermediary transaction platform supporting online transactions. The payment platform acts as an intermediary agent to handle the payment. While the payment platform receives payment from the logistics company, the merchant receives payment from the payment platform.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The payment may be settled sequentially in that order for each individual transaction, but may also be handled collectively on a periodical basis to further increase the cash flow efficiency for the merchants. The method and the system also benefit the buyer because the buyer has an option to pay on delivery only and is not required to either directly pay the merchant in advance or pay an intermediary transaction platform in advance. This helps to avoid disputes that arise because of inconsistency between what is actually purchased and what a user has seen in an image online when purchasing a product.</p>
