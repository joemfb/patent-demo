<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0009">This description relates to revenue adjustment processes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0010">Electronic exchanges, including online auctions, have proliferated along with the Internet. These electronic exchanges aim to provide a high degree of trading efficiency by bringing together a large number of buyers and sellers. Such centralized exchanges are focused on directly matching the bids/offers of buyers and sellers, and do not recognize or account for pre-existing relationships or agreements with other exchanges or between parties to the transaction, such as between (i) buyers and sellers, (ii) intermediaries (e.g., brokers, which may be a buyer or seller), or (iii) buyers or sellers and intermediaries.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0011">The proliferation of Internet activity has also generated tremendous growth for advertising on the Internet. Typically, advertisers (i.e., buyers of ad space) and online publishers (sellers of ad space) have agreements with one or more advertising networks (ad networks), which provide for serving an advertiser's banner or ad across multiple publishers, and concomitantly provide for each publisher having access to a large number of advertisers. Ad networks (which may also manage payment and reporting) may also attempt to target certain Internet users with particular advertisements to increase the likelihood that the user will take an action with respect to the ad. From an advertiser's perspective, effective targeting is important for achieving a high return on investment (ROI).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0012">Online advertising markets display inefficiencies when buyers and sellers are unable to transact. For instance, although a publisher may be subscribed to many ad networks, and one or more of those ad networks may transact inventory with other ad networks, only one of the ad networks to which the publisher is subscribed will be involved in selling (e.g., auctioning) a given ad space for the publisher. The publisher, or a gatekeeper used by the publisher, selects or prioritizes which ad network (or advertiser having a direct agreement with the publisher) will serve the impression for a given ad request. Thus, the number of buyers for a given ad request is limited and, similarly, advertisers have limited access to ad requests.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0013">In a system that provides an open exchange environment to connect business entities through a network, in one aspect, the invention features a computer-implemented method that includes performing a revenue adjustment process to distribute one of a revenue surplus or a revenue deficit amongst business entities involved in one or more transactions from which the one of the revenue surplus or the revenue deficit originates over a predefined time interval. Performing the revenue adjustment process includes identifying a set of business entities involved in the one or more transactions to which the one of the revenue surplus or the revenue deficit is to be distributed; and determining a proportion of the one of the revenue surplus or the revenue deficit to which each business entity of the set is distributed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0014">Implementations of the invention may include one or more of the following.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0015">Each of the one or more transactions may involve an online advertisement creative to be displayed on a web page associated with one of the business entities of the set. The business entities involved in the one or more transactions may include an advertiser, one or more advertisement networks, and one or more publishers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0016">The advertiser may have a relationship with a first of the one or more advertisement networks, the relationship being defined in part by a line item related to an online advertisement creative being offered for display on a web page. The line item may include a unit price for the online advertisement creative, the unit price being adjusted based on one of the following units: impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0017">At least one of the one or more publishers may have a relationship with the first of the one or more advertisement networks. The relationship may be defined in part by a line item related to an online advertisement space of a web page.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0018">At least one of the one or more publishers may have a relationship with a second of the one or more advertisement networks. The relationship may be defined in part by a line item related to an online advertisement space of a web page.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0019">The method of identifying the set of business entities may include excluding, from the set of business entities to which the one of the revenue surplus or the revenue deficit is to be distributed, any publisher that has an exclusive relationship with the second of the one or more advertisement networks.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0020">The method may further include measuring, by the system, an amount of activity related to the online advertisement creative during the predefined time interval. The system-measured amount of activity may be expressed as a value with a unit identifier, the unit identifier being based on one of the following: impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0021">The method may include receiving a request for a revenue adjustment from an advertiser associated with the online advertisement creative. The revenue adjustment request may provide an advertiser-measured amount of activity, associated with the online advertisement creative over the predefined time interval, expressed as a value with a unit identifier, the unit identifier being based on one of the following: impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">Each of the one or more transactions involves a particular product, commodity or service that is being offered for purchase or sale by a first of the business entities. The method may include identifying a system-measured aggregate amount of activity associated with the particular product, commodity or service over the predefined time interval. The method may include measuring, by the system, the amount of activity associated with the particular product, commodity or service for each of the business entities of the set over each of one or more portions of the predefined time interval. The method may include receiving a request for a revenue adjustment from the first of the business entities, the revenue adjustment request identifying a first-entity-measured aggregate amount of activity associated with the particular product, commodity or service over the predefined time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023">The method for determining a proportion of the one of the revenue surplus or the revenue deficit to which each business entity of the set is distributed may include calculating a weighted adjustment; and for each business entity, generating an interval-based activity amount disparity by applying the weighted adjustment to a system-measured amount of activity associated with the particular product, commodity or service for that business entity during each of the one or more portions of the predefined time interval; and determining the proportion of the one of the revenue surplus or the revenue deficit to which the business entity is distributed based on the interval-based activity amount disparity generated for each of the one or more portions of the predefined time interval. The weighed adjustment may be calculated according to the formula (x&#x2212;y)/y, where x is a value that represents a first-entity-measured aggregate amount of activity associated with the particular product, commodity or service over the predefined time interval, and y is a value that represent a system-measured aggregate amount of activity associated with the particular product, commodity or service over the predefined time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0024">Other general aspects include other combinations of the aspects and features described above and other aspects and features expressed as methods, apparatus, systems, computer program products, and in other ways.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0025">Other features and advantages will become apparent from the description and the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a transaction management system <b>100</b> provides an open exchange environment that connects business entities <b>102</b><sub>1 . . . n </sub>through a network. Although the network is depicted as the Internet <b>104</b>, the network may include any configuration of public and/or private networks.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">The transaction management system <b>100</b> is implemented as a multi-server system having a server computer <b>112</b> that runs a computer program application (&#x201c;manager application <b>106</b>&#x201d;) to facilitate commercial transactions between the business entities <b>102</b><sub>1 . . . n</sub>, a server computer <b>114</b> that runs a computer program application (&#x201c;accounting application&#x201d; <b>118</b>) to track and manage accounting activity associated with the commercial transactions, and a server computer <b>116</b> that runs a computer program application (&#x201c;prediction engine&#x201d; <b>120</b>) to generate one or more predictive metrics for use by the manager application in facilitating a commercial transaction. Other server computers and/or applications may also be included in the transaction management system <b>100</b>. Further, although depicted as separate server computers, in some implementations, one or more of the applications run on a single server computer.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">Each commercial transaction involves a first business entity (referred to as &#x201c;end buyer&#x201d;) that has been selected by the transaction management system <b>100</b> to acquire a product (e.g., goods and/or services) that is being offered for acquisition by a second business entity (referred to as &#x201c;end seller&#x201d;). The end buyer is selected from amongst a set of business entities eligible to participate in the commercial transaction involving the given product. In some instances, the end seller and the end buyer are the only two business entities involved in the commercial transaction, and are said to be directly linked. In some instances, one or more other business entities (referred to as &#x201c;intermediaries&#x201d;) are involved in the commercial transaction, and the end seller and the end buyer are said to be indirectly linked by way of the one or more intermediaries. Each intermediary functions as both a buyer (with respect to the end seller or another intermediary) and a seller (with respect to the end buyer or another intermediary) in the commercial transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">Typically, the compensation afforded to the end seller by the end buyer for the acquisition of the product comes in the form of a monetary payment. Where there is a direct link between the end buyer and the end seller, the entirety of the monetary payment may be provided to the end seller. In those instances in which one or more intermediaries are involved in the commercial transaction, revenue sharing agreements or flat fee arrangements between the various business entities may result in the end seller only being provided with a fraction of the monetary payment. In some implementations, the transaction management system <b>100</b> itself takes a portion of the monetary payment as a commission for facilitating the transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">In the examples to follow, the transaction management system <b>100</b> is described in the context of an advertisement (&#x201c;ad&#x201d;) exchange in which the product being offered for acquisition is an ad space on a web page, the end seller is a publisher of the web page, and the end seller is an advertiser having an ad campaign with at least on ad creative dimensioned to fit the ad space on the web page.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0035">In other examples, the end seller may be an ad broker/network aggregating publisher sites of which one includes the ad space that is being offered for acquisition, and the end buyer may be an ad broker/network aggregating advertisers of which one has an ad campaign with at least one ad creative dimensioned to fit the ad space being offered for acquisition. In those instances in which the end buyer is an ad broker/network, the end seller may have no knowledge of the identity of the advertiser with whom it is to engage in a commercial transaction with. The end seller simply transacts with the ad broker/network in its capacity as a representative of an advertiser. Likewise, in those instances in which the end seller is an ad broker/network, the end buyer transacts with the ad broker/network acting in its capacity as a representative of a publisher.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0036">An ad broker/network may have exclusive relationships, non-exclusive relationships, or some combination of both with publishers and/or advertisers. Generally, the publisher and/or advertiser with whom the ad broker/network has an exclusive relationship participates in the ad marketplace only by way of the ad broker/network.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0037">An ad broker/network may also have exclusive relationships, non-exclusive relationships, or some combination of both with other ad brokers/networks. In those instances in which an ad broker/network (e.g., &#x201c;ad broker/network <b>102</b><sub>13</sub>&#x201d;) has an exclusive relationship with another ad broker/network (e.g., &#x201c;ad broker/network <b>102</b><sub>11</sub>&#x201d;), ad broker/network <b>102</b><sub>13 </sub>may participate in the ad exchange only by way of ad broker/network <b>102</b><sub>11</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038">To participate in the ad exchange, each business entity <b>102</b><sub>1 . . . n</sub>, may be required to register/subscribe with the transaction management system <b>100</b>. As part of the registration/subscription process, a business entity may be requested to provide profile information introducing itself to other entities with a brief description of the business entity, letting others know of their targeting or partnering preferences and/or needs (e.g., channels for publishers, offer types for advertisers), and contact information. Information may also include payment terms, payment types, content types, channels, creative types, offer types, and cancellation policies. The profile information may define the entity's primary and/or secondary profile(s).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0039">In addition to the profile information, the business entity may be requested to provide information about the business relationships it has established with one or more other entities. Generally, a business relationship is defined by a contractual agreement that has been negotiated and agreed upon by the two entities. The agreement may take the form of a series of line items, where each line item is related to an agreement that has been negotiated between two business entities with regards to a given product that is being offered for acquisition or that the entity is interested in acquiring.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040">A line item may include product-related information such as attribute information, price information, and constraint information. Generally, the attribute information relates to qualitative and/or quantitative characteristics of the product. As an example, the attribute information of a line item negotiated between a publisher and an ad broker/network may include the physical dimensions of an ad space being offered for acquisition and the uniform resource locator (URL) of the web page on which the ad space is located, while the attribute information of a line item negotiated between an advertiser and an ad broker/network may include the physical dimensions of an ad space that the advertiser is interested in acquiring given the physical dimensions of at least one ad creative of the advertiser's ad campaign.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">The price information generally represents a utility function for the product. For instance, the utility function may assign value with respect to the product's attributes and/or other actions that may be taken with respect to the item. Returning to the advertisement space example, different values may be assigned to a consumer viewing the ad, clicking through on the ad, or taking some other specifically defined action (e.g., making a purchase) in response to an ad beyond simply clicking on it. Such values are commonly referred to in the online advertising context as cost-per-action (CPA), cost-per-impression (CPI), cost-per-click (CPC), cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM), and return-on-investment (ROI). In some instances, business relationships between entities may include pre-negotiated discounts to be applied, reporting requirements, and penalties or stipulations relative to the failure to deliver an ad creative. The price information may also specify the terms of revenue sharing agreements between entities.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">The constraint information generally relates to information that includes or excludes eligibility for a transaction. For instance, these constraints may involve hard limits on geography, time and location of delivery, minimum quantity, minimum acceptable price, etc. In the case of a memory chip market, for example, characteristics such as access times, capacity, operating voltage, power consumption, temperature limits, expected life, and/or other quality characteristics may be attributes, while some of these may alternatively or additionally be constraints. In the advertisement space example, constraint information may include information related to the language of the text displayed on the web page, nature of the content being displayed on the web page, minimum hit count of the web page, geographical focus of the web page content, beginning and ending dates, to name a few. The entity may establish different constraints for different business entities or sets of entities based on the business relationships that exist between the entities. In some instances, the quantity or measure of a product may be specified by the business entity offering the product for acquisition and possibly also by the business entity interested in acquiring the product. In some instances, however, the quantity or measure of the product is implicit in the transaction, being known a priori by sellers, buyers, and intermediaries.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043">If desired, a business entity may provide to the transaction management system <b>100</b> global constraint information that serves to override any line item-based constraint information. In one example, a publisher may set a global constraint that bars all advertisers of adult content or foreign-based content from acquiring ad space on any of the publisher's web pages. In another example, an advertiser may set a global constraint that requires all of its ad creatives to be displayed only in ad spaces of web pages having English language text. By enabling a business entity to enter such global constraint information, various advantages may be achieved. For example, time is saved in that the business entity does not have to repeatedly enter the same constraint information each time a new line item is added. Furthermore, there is no concern that any constraint that the entity would like to have in place may be accidentally left out of one or more line items. In some instances, an entity may desire to provide specific exceptions to a global constraint based on targeting or partnering requirements and/or needs. Returning to the publisher example, a global constraint that bars all advertisers of adult content from acquiring ad space on any of the publisher's web pages may be placed in the publisher's primary profile, and a global constraint exception allowing all advertisers of adult content from acquiring ad space on a specified set of the publisher's web pages may be placed in the publisher's secondary profile.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">The information provided by the business entities may be stored in a data store <b>108</b> (e.g., a database) coupled to the transaction management system <b>100</b> or accessible by the transaction management system <b>100</b> via a network (e.g., the Internet <b>104</b>, a local area network, or a wide area network).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a process <b>200</b> suitable for implementation by a web-based application (e.g., &#x201c;manager application <b>106</b>&#x201d;) of the transaction management system <b>100</b>. First, the manager application <b>106</b> receives (<b>202</b>) a request for one or more ad creatives to be displayed on a web page. In one example, when a consumer at a client computer <b>110</b> navigates to a web page of a publisher that is registered with the transaction management system <b>100</b>, the publisher transmits web page information, such as a compilation of hypertext markup language (HTML) code, JavaScript, Java applets, graphic image files (e.g., GIF, JPEG), etc., that is used by a web browser on the client computer <b>110</b> to render the requested web page. As part of this compilation of web page information, the publisher sends a tag (e.g., applet tag) that identifies, depending on the implementation, either an intermediary or the manager application <b>106</b> for providing the ad creative. Using the received tag, the client computer <b>110</b> either sends a message to the intermediary or the manager application <b>106</b> to request the insertion of one or more ad creatives in the web page. In those instances in which the message is sent to an intermediary, that intermediary redirects the request to the manager application <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0046">Generally, the ad request includes a URL identifier that identifies the web page to which the consumer has navigated. The manager application <b>106</b> may use the URL identifier to search its data store for information related to that web page, including the number of ad spaces available on the web page and the product-related information for each of those ad spaces. In some implementations, if the client computer <b>110</b> had previously interacted with the manager application <b>106</b>, the client computer <b>110</b> may also send (as part of the ad request) a previously-stored cookie, which provides some historical data related to the consumer's actions with respect to ad creatives. As an example, the manager application <b>106</b> may use such historical data to calculate the probability that the consumer will take an action with respect to a particular type of ad creative. If no cookie was received along with the ad request, a prediction engine <b>120</b> of the transaction management system <b>100</b> may perform such a probability calculation using external statistical data. As an example, the prediction engine <b>120</b> may generate a predictive metric relating to one or more attributes relating to the product being offered for acquisition. For instance, in the sale of metals, a predictive metric of quality may be generated based on historical data for the supplier. In the online advertising context, one example predictive metric (discussed further below) is the probability that a website consumer will take an action with respect to an ad impression. Such predictive metrics may be used in establishing pricing with respect to eligible buyers. Such predictive metrics may facilitate commoditizing an item at least inasmuch as the prediction may provide buyers with information as to an unknown parameter associated with item differentiation, thus providing buyers with sufficient information describing the product for making a buying decision.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047">For each ad space that is available on the web page, the manager application <b>106</b> uses information stored in the data store <b>108</b> related to all of the business entities registered with the transaction management system <b>100</b> to identify (<b>204</b>) a set of business entities (&#x201c;eligible set&#x201d;) eligible to participate in a transaction with the end seller involving that ad space. Constraints defined by line-item based constraint information, global constraint information and/or global constraint exception information, for example, may be used to exclude or include particular business entities. As an example, the manager application <b>106</b> may use the physical dimensions of the ad space to exclude from the eligible set all business entities that do not have at least one ad creative dimensioned to fit that ad space. The manager application <b>106</b> may also use the minimum acceptable price for the ad space to exclude all business entities that are unwilling to submit or are otherwise unwilling to participate in a transaction involving a bid price that meets or exceeds that minimum acceptable price. In the description to follow referencing the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>, it will be apparent that instances of a &#x201c;minimum acceptable price&#x201d; may be estimated effective CPM prices.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">The manager application <b>106</b> then uses the information stored in the data store <b>108</b> defining business relationships between the entities of the eligible set to generate (<b>206</b>) a graph of the eligible set. One example of such a graph <b>300</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Each business entity of the eligible set is represented in the graph <b>300</b> by a node, and each relationship between a pair of business entities of the eligible set is represented by an edge (visually depicted by a solid line) of the graph <b>300</b>. One of the nodes of the graph <b>300</b>, designated as a source node, represents the end seller. One or more of the nodes of the graph <b>300</b>, each designated as a sink node, represents a potential end buyer. Disposed between a sink node and the source node may be one or more interior nodes (or &#x201c;int. node&#x201d;), each representative of an intermediary.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">Once the graph <b>300</b> of the eligible set is generated, the manager application <b>106</b> performs a series of decision processes to identify one of the business entities in the eligible set represented by a sink node to execute the transaction with the business entity represented by the source node. In one implementation, the manager application <b>106</b> first applies (<b>208</b>) a pathing algorithm (e.g., a shortest path algorithm) to each sink node of the graph <b>300</b> to determine a path between that sink node and the source node.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0050">The manager application <b>106</b> then recursively performs (<b>210</b>) a series of decision processes at the non-sink nodes (i.e., interior nodes and source node) of the graph <b>300</b> to identify (<b>212</b>), from amongst all of the paths, the path (&#x201c;winning path&#x201d;) that provides the end seller with the best price for the ad space under the pricing rules that are employed by the manager application <b>106</b>. Examples of different ways in which the manager application <b>106</b> may recursively perform a series of decision processes are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>. Generally, at each non-sink node of the graph <b>300</b> at which a decision process is performed, the manager application <b>106</b> takes the bids associated with the child nodes of the given non-sink node (&#x201c;below&#x201d; referring to a direction moving away from the source node towards the sink node(s) along a path), normalizes them or otherwise makes them comparable with one another on a common scale, and compares them to identify a winning bid. In some instances, if the comparison yields a tie result, one or more additional comparisons may be performed based on one or more of the following metrics: a priority metric, an advertiser value metric, and a percentage delivered metric, until a tie-breaking result is obtained. In some instances, if the comparison yields a tie result, the manager application <b>106</b> randomly selects one of the bids to yield a result and moves on. Although in most instances, the &#x201c;winning bid&#x201d; is the bid which is associated with the highest dollar value and the &#x201c;best price&#x201d; for the ad space is the price which yields the highest revenue for the end seller, there are instances in which the &#x201c;winning bid&#x201d; and the &#x201c;best price&#x201d; are based on other metrics (e.g., ad frequency or queue).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">The recursive nature of the manner in which the manager application <b>106</b> performs the series of decision processes means that the manager application <b>106</b> may traverse up and down any given path of the graph <b>300</b> from a sink node to the source node before the winning path is identified. In identifying the winning path, the manager application <b>106</b> not only identifies the ad creative which is to be delivered to the consumer for overlay onto the ad space of the web page, the manager application <b>106</b> also identifies how revenue (if any) is to be divided between the various business entities involved in the transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">The manager application <b>106</b> may take any action (<b>214</b>) to facilitate the execution of the transaction. In some instances, a content server <b>126</b> of the transaction management system <b>100</b> serves the ad creative directly. In some instances, the manager application <b>106</b> redirects the ad creative serving to an ad server/broker or advertiser represented by the sink node of the winning path. The manager application <b>106</b> typically notifies the end buyer, end seller, intermediary that is represented by a node of the winning path that it is to participate in the transaction. In certain cases, the manager application <b>106</b> may need to notify or communicate information to one or more third parties that are required for effecting the transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">The accounting application <b>118</b> may include a logging module that logs the results of the execution of the transaction. Such results may include the amount of revenue that each business entity involved in the transaction receives, the identities of the ads sent to the consumer, the consumer's responses to those ads (e.g., after the ad creative for a given ad space is delivered and displayed, the consumer may connect to the advertiser's website by clicking through or otherwise selecting the advertisement (e.g., image, icon, etc.), though the consumer may not be able to connect to an advertiser website if the advertisements are not selectable), and data specific to the consumer (e.g., demographic, psychographic, and behavioral data). Any actions (e.g., clickthroughs, conversions) taken by the consumer may be captured and logged by the transaction management system <b>100</b> (e.g., by using 1&#xd7;1 GIF pixels in the ad creatives, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">In some implementations, the transaction management system <b>100</b> may also include components (not shown) for providing reporting, traffic management, optimization tools, and campaign management, with these components being accessible to subscribing advertisers, publishers, and ad networks via a web based application interface.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref> schematically depict illustrative series of decision processes (sometimes referred to as an &#x201c;auction process&#x201d; or a series of &#x201c;auction processes&#x201d;) that may be executed by the manager application <b>106</b> with respect to an advertising network (graph of which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for determining the end buyer from among the eligible buyers and, more particularly, for determining which of all eligible ad creatives will be displayed to a consumer <b>10</b>, the price paid by the end buyer (i.e., the advertiser of the selected creative), and the winning path from the end buyer to the end seller (i.e., the publisher of the webpage on which the selected creative is displayed), in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">Although each end buyer (e.g., advertiser) represented by a sink node of the graph <b>300</b> may, in fact, have more than one campaign (and associated creative) that qualifies for consideration in the transaction, for purposes of clarity of exposition only, the examples presented in these illustrative embodiments assume that each end buyer has one campaign that qualifies for the transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">Pricing may be provided according to any of one or more pricing models, including cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM), cost-per-click (CPC), cost-per-action (CPA), and may be based on dynamic pricing, pricing based on soft targets, auction-based pricing, ROI goals, and other models. It will be understood that the pricing models presented below are merely for purposes of illustration. Additionally, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, transaction management system <b>100</b> may provide for subscribers to automatically upload and update their own pricing models (e.g., proprietary pricing models representing the subscriber's utility function with respect to ad space, and which may also depend on information about the consumer <b>10</b>), which transaction management system <b>100</b> calls upon (e.g., a function call) during the auction process. Further, while transaction management system <b>100</b> is described as calculating the probability that a consumer <b>10</b> will take some action (e.g., click probability), transaction management system <b>100</b> may be adapted so that such a probability may be calculated according to a subscriber's own function (e.g., which may be embodied in the subscriber's own pricing function).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">As schematically represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>, the relationships between publisher, brokers/networks, and advertisers may be represented in a hierarchical, tree-like configuration. Simply for convenience in exposition, as used herein with respect to the illustrative embodiments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>, a given tier in the hierarchical structure refers to nodes (e.g., a publisher, broker/network, advertiser) that are removed from (or coupled to) the publisher via the same number of links, and the tier may be referred to by an ordinal number corresponding to that number of links. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first tier includes only Ad Broker/Network <b>20</b>; the second tier includes Ad Broker/Network <b>22</b>, Advertiser <b>32</b> and Advertiser <b>34</b>; and the third tier includes Advertisers <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">Also for ease of reference, as used herein, a branching point refers to any given node (e.g., a publisher, broker/network, advertiser) in the hierarchical structure from which two or more branches (i.e., links representing contractual terms) emanate to connect to respective nodes that are in the tier below the given node (&#x201c;below&#x201d; referring to the direction of increasing ordinal number of the tiers, corresponding to further downward on the drawing sheets when viewing the figures). Further, the overall auction process may be viewed logically as comprising a series of auctions conducted at each branching point among the nodes connected to and in the tier below the given common branching point, and such auctions within the overall hierarchy are sometimes referred to hereinbelow more concisely as being auctions at a branching point and tier (or, similarly, at a tier and branching point), where the tier is intended to refer to the tier of the bidding nodes connected to an below the common branching point. An auction at a branching point and tier may be referred to by an ordinal number (e.g., &#x201c;first auction&#x201d;), and for reference purposes only, as used herein, the first auction refers to the auction at the lowest numbered tier at which auctions occur (it is noted that the ordinal number of the auction is not necessarily equal to the ordinal number of the tier at which the auction occurs). For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first auction refers to the auction among the second tier nodes (i.e., Ad Broker/Network <b>22</b> and Advertisers <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, which are connected to a branching point anchored by the node representing Ad Broker/Network <b>20</b>), and the second auction refers to the auction among the third tier nodes (i.e. Advertisers <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0060">As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the hierarchical auction configuration is well suited for representation by various data structures, and for processing by working from the outermost branches/tiers up to the root. Also, pipelined processing (e.g., for successive tiers) as well as parallel processing (e.g., across branching points (nodes) of the hierarchical auction) may be employed in executing the auction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0061">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as shown, Advertiser <b>36</b> and Advertiser <b>38</b> have a $3.50 CPC and $5.00 CPA price agreement with Ad Broker/Network <b>22</b>. Advertiser <b>36</b> has creative <b>3</b> of campaign A for which the predictive engine <b>120</b> calculates a click probability of 0.1% with respect to consumer <b>10</b>. Advertiser <b>36</b> has creative <b>1</b> of campaign B for which Predictive Engine <b>75</b> calculates a conversion probability of 0.01% with respect to consumer <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the third tier auction (i.e., the auction among the third tier entities, which is the second auction in this example) results in an effective CPM (eCPM) of $3.50 for advertiser <b>36</b> and $0.50 for advertiser <b>38</b>, indicating that advertiser <b>36</b> is the winner of that tier of the auction. Accounting for the 50% revenue share between ad broker/network <b>22</b> and ad broker/network <b>20</b>, this $3.50 eCPM value becomes $1.75 eCPM when passed up to the second tier where, in the first auction, it is compared to the $1.65 CPM and $1.25 CPM bid prices for advertiser <b>32</b> and advertiser <b>34</b>, respectively. Accordingly, advertiser <b>36</b> is the winner of the auction, and creative <b>3</b> will be the served impression. Thus, if consumer <b>10</b> clicks through on creative <b>3</b>, ad broker/network <b>22</b> will realize $1.75, and the $1.75 passed up to the first tier will be evenly split between Ad Broker/Network <b>20</b> and publisher <b>26</b>. More specifically, advertiser <b>36</b> would be subject to paying $3.50 to ad broker/network <b>22</b>, which would keep $1.75 and be subject to paying $1.75 to ad network <b>20</b>, which would keep $0.875 and be subject to paying $0.875 to publisher <b>26</b>. The accounting application <b>118</b> will log these amounts into the appropriate accounts stored in data store <b>108</b>, and actual billing and payment may subsequently occur by any online or offline payment method that have been established.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0062">It may be appreciated by way of this illustrative embodiment that transaction management system <b>100</b> provides for more advertisers to partake in such an auction process, thus providing a more efficient market. For instance, in this example, every advertiser is directly involved in the auction. Absent the process and functionality implemented by transaction management system <b>100</b>, advertisers <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> would not have been involved in the auction. As may also be appreciated, if publisher <b>26</b> were also subscribed with ad broker/network <b>22</b>, then even if ad brokers/networks <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> were not linked (e.g., did not have an agreement to transact ad impressions therebetween), transaction management system <b>100</b> also would provide the possibility for all advertisers <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> to partake in the auction process, as all branches between publisher <b>26</b> and eligible advertisers are considered (e.g., rather than selecting only one of a plurality of ad brokers/networks with which publisher <b>26</b> may have an agreement).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> schematically depict additional illustrative auction processes that may be executed by transaction management system <b>100</b> in the advertising network depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and, more particularly, these examples illustrate hierarchical auction processes involving dynamic CPM pricing with CPC targeting, CPM capping, and dynamic CPM pricing reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, publisher <b>26</b> has a 50% revenue sharing agreement with Ad Broker/Network <b>20</b>, and a $1.25 CPM agreement with Advertiser <b>39</b>, which has campaign C with creative <b>3</b>. Ad Broker/Network <b>20</b> has (i) a $3.00 CPM agreement with Advertiser <b>34</b> for campaign B with creative <b>2</b>, and (ii) a dynamic CPM agreement with Advertiser <b>32</b> for campaign A with creative <b>1</b>, for which advertiser <b>32</b> has set a $3.00 CPC target and a $2.50 CPM cap. In accordance with the foregoing, these relationships and underlying terms of agreement are stored by transaction management system <b>100</b> as insertion orders and corresponding line items.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">In this example, the prediction engine <b>120</b> calculates that creative <b>1</b> of campaign A has a click probability of 0.1% with respect to consumer <b>10</b>. Thus, based on the click probability and the $3.00 target CPC, campaign A creative <b>1</b> should have an effective CPM (eCPM) of $3.00; however, because there is a $2.50 CPM cap, the eCPM is set at $2.50. Accordingly, this $2.50 eCPM for advertiser <b>32</b> loses to the $3.00 CPM of campaign B creative <b>2</b> for advertiser <b>34</b> at this tier and branching point of the auction. Accounting for the 50% revenue share between ad broker/network <b>20</b> and publisher <b>26</b>, this $3.00 CPM value becomes $1.50 CPM when passed up to the first tier where it is compared to the $1.25 CPM for advertiser <b>39</b>. Accordingly, advertiser <b>34</b> is the winner of the auction, and creative <b>2</b> will be the served impression. Thus, for 1000 impressions on campaign B creative <b>2</b>, advertiser <b>34</b> pays $3.00 to ad broker/network <b>20</b>, which pays $1.50 to publisher <b>26</b>. The accounting application <b>118</b> will log these amounts into the appropriate accounts stored in data store <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically depicts a scenario similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, except that for the dynamic pricing agreement between Ad Broker/Network <b>20</b> and Advertiser <b>34</b> (for campaign B with creative <b>2</b>) advertiser <b>32</b> has set a $4.00 CPC target and a $5.00 CPM cap. In this example, transaction management system <b>100</b> determines that creative <b>1</b> of campaign A has a click probability of 0.1% with respect to consumer <b>10</b>, and thus the $4.00 target CPC corresponds to a $4.00 eCPM, which is not affected by the $5.00 CPM cap. At the second auction (which, in this case is among the second tier entities), this $4.00 eCPM wins against the $3.00 CPM of advertiser <b>34</b> for campaign B creative <b>2</b> (which, in this example, is the only other bid price available from other advertisers or networks having a common branching point/node at that tier of the auction). Accounting for the 50% revenue share between ad broker/network <b>20</b> and publisher <b>26</b>, this $4.00 eCPM value becomes $2.00 eCPM when passed up to the first tier where it is compared to the $1.25 CPM for advertiser <b>29</b>. Accordingly, advertiser <b>32</b> is the winner of the auction, and creative <b>1</b> will be the served impression.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067">In this embodiment of the invention, however, a dynamic CPM pricing reduction rule applies wherein the eCPM price actually paid by an auction winner that offers a dynamic CPM price is the lesser of (i) the winning dynamic price and (ii) the amount that the auction winner would have to pay such that the publisher's revenue will equal the publisher revenue that would result from some amount greater (5% in this illustrative implementation) than the second best bid price across the entire auction (i.e., considering all tiers and branching points; considering all line items in the auction). In this regard, the second best bid price means the price bid by a second buyer (i.e., other than the auction winner) in the auction that would result (e.g., accounting for revenue sharing along the path between the second buyer and publisher) in the publisher receiving the second highest revenue compared to the winning bid. It is the bid that would have won the auction but for the winning bid. The amount that the auction winner would have to pay such that the publisher's revenue will equal the publisher revenue that would result from some amount (e.g., 5%) greater than the second best bid price being bid by the second buyer depends on the pricing paths of the auction winner and the second best bidder with respect to the publisher and/or each other.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0068">As may be understood, various methods and algorithms may be implemented by transaction management system <b>100</b> for determining the second best bid and applying a dynamic CPM price reduction rule. In one illustrative implementation, for the auctions executed at each tier and branching point, transaction management system <b>100</b> not only determines the winner at that tier and branching point, but also the runner up (i.e., next best bid) that may qualify as the basis for the price reduction assuming the winner at that tier and branching point were the overall winner. Various techniques can be employed in the event of a tie for first or second place, such as random selection of the winner(s). transaction management system <b>100</b> then includes the winner and any such runner up (accounting for any revenue sharing) in the auction at the next higher branching point and tier (which tier includes the branching point associated with the auction that provided the winner and any such runner up).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0069">More specifically, for the auction at a given tier and branching point, transaction management system <b>100</b> does not need to store (or otherwise identify and include in a subsequent auction) the second best bid if the second best bid could not form the basis for a price reduction relative to the winner (best bid) at that tier and branching point. As may be understood, therefore, the second best bid will only qualify as such if its value incremented by the price reduction margin (e.g., 5%) is less than the best bid at that tier and branching point.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">Upon completing this auction process over all tiers and branching points, transaction management system <b>100</b> thus identifies an overall auction winner (i.e., the buyer/entity whose bid provides the highest revenue to the seller) and runner up (i.e., the buyer/entity whose bid provides the second highest revenue to the seller). Then, based on information stored by transaction management system <b>100</b> for the pricing paths for the auction winner and runner up, transaction management system <b>100</b> calculates the price that would have to be paid by the auction winner to provide the publisher with the revenue that would be received by the publisher if the runner up's bid were incremented by the margin (i.e., 5% in these examples). If that calculated price is less than the winning bid price, then that calculated price is the reduced price to be paid by the auction winner. Otherwise, the auction winner pays the winning bid price.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0071">It is understood that the foregoing outline of a hierarchical auction process with price reduction according to some embodiments of the present invention is intended to illustrate a basic overall procedure for determining price reduction, and that such auction and sorting type processes for dynamic CPM price reduction may be implemented according to a variety of algorithms which may be subject to myriad possible variations, modifications, and simplifications (e.g., simplifications that apply in certain cases).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0072">Referring now back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is understood that the $3.00 CPM of advertiser <b>34</b> is the second best bid over the entire auction because under the 50% revenue share agreement between publisher <b>26</b> and Ad Broker/Network <b>20</b>, at the first auction level this $3.00 becomes $1.50 CPM, which is greater than the $1.25 CPM of advertiser <b>39</b>. Accordingly, because 5% over this second best price (i.e. $3.15 CPM) is less than the winning $4.00 eCPM bid by advertiser <b>32</b>, the dynamic CPM price reduction is invoked and advertiser <b>32</b> actually pays $3.15 CPM rather than $4.00 CPM. Thus, for 1000 impressions on campaign A creative <b>1</b>, advertiser <b>32</b> pays $3.15 to ad broker/network <b>20</b> which pays $1.575 to publisher <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0073">It is noted that because in this example the second best bid ($3.00 CPM of advertiser <b>34</b>) is at the same tier and branching point as the winning bid, there are no intervening links (e.g., revenue shares) to account for in calculating the reduced price to be paid by the auction winner. Further, in implementations where a second best bid at a given tier and branching point will only be considered (and passed upwards) if it qualifies for reducing the price of the winning bid at that tier/branching point (e.g., if the second best bid augmented by the margin is less than the winning bid), then if the overall auction results in the winning bid and second best bid originating from the same tier and branching point, then transaction management system <b>100</b> knows that the price reduction will be applied without having to compare the winning price with the reduced price. Thus, determining and calculating the price to be paid by the auction winner is simplified for cases in which in the winning bid and second best bid originate from the same tier and branching point.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, publisher <b>26</b> has a 50% revenue sharing agreement with Ad Broker/Network <b>20</b>, and a $1.25 CPM agreement with Advertiser <b>39</b>, which has campaigns D and E with respective creatives <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. Ad Broker/Network <b>20</b> has (i) a $3.00 CPM agreement with Advertiser <b>32</b> for campaign C with creative <b>3</b>, and (ii) a 50% revenue sharing agreement with Ad Broker/Network <b>22</b>, which has (i) a $10.00 CPM agreement with Advertiser <b>38</b> for campaign B with creative <b>2</b>, and (ii) a dynamic CPM agreement with Advertiser <b>36</b> for campaign A with creative <b>1</b>, for which advertiser <b>36</b> has set a $12.00 CPC target and a $15.00 CPM cap. In accordance with the foregoing, these relationships and underlying terms of agreement are stored by transaction management system <b>100</b> as insertion orders and corresponding line items.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0075">In this example, transaction management system <b>100</b> determines that creative <b>1</b> of campaign A has a click probability of 0.1% with respect to consumer <b>10</b>, and thus the $12.00 target CPC corresponds to a $12.00 eCPM, which is not affected by the $15.00 CPM cap. This $12.00 eCPM wins against the $10.00 CPM of advertiser <b>38</b> for campaign B creative <b>2</b>, which qualifies as a possible second best bid for price reduction relative to the winning $12.00 eCPM at that level, as 5% over the $10.00 CPM (i.e., $10.50) is less than the winning $12.00 eCPM. Accounting for the 50% revenue share between ad broker/network <b>20</b> and ad broker/network <b>22</b>, when passed up to the second tier, the $12.00 eCPM value of advertiser <b>36</b> and the $10.00 CPM value of advertiser <b>38</b> become $6.00 eCPM and the $5.00 CPM, respectively, both of which are greater than the competing $3.00 CPM for advertiser <b>32</b>. Accordingly, the $6.00 eCPM (of advertiser <b>36</b>) and the $5.00 CPM (of advertiser <b>38</b>) are passed up to the first tier, competing against the $1.25 CPM of advertiser <b>39</b> at $3.00 eCPM and $2.50 CPM, respectively, based on the 50% revenue share between ad broker/network <b>20</b> and publisher <b>26</b>. Thus, advertiser <b>36</b> and advertiser <b>38</b> are the winning and second place bidders for the overall auction, respectively. As noted above in connection with the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if the second winning and second place bidders originated from the same tier and branching point, then it is known that the winner will pay the reduced price and the price reduction calculation is simplified. In this example, therefore, advertiser <b>36</b> actually pays $10.50 CPM rather than $12.00 CPM. Thus, for 1000 impressions on campaign A creative <b>1</b>, advertiser <b>36</b> pays $10.50 to ad broker/network <b>22</b>, which pays $5.25 to ad broker/network <b>20</b>, which pays $2.625 to publisher <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> schematically depicts a scenario similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, except that Ad Broker/Network <b>22</b> has a $2.50 CPM agreement with Advertiser <b>38</b> for campaign B with creative <b>2</b>. In this example, transaction management system <b>100</b> determines that creative <b>1</b> of campaign A has a click probability of 0.1% with respect to consumer <b>10</b>, and thus the $12.00 target CPC corresponds to a $12.00 eCPM, which is not affected by the $15.00 CPM cap. This $12.00 eCPM wins against the $2.50 CPM of advertiser <b>38</b> for campaign B creative <b>2</b>, which qualifies as a possible second best bid for price reduction relative to the winning $12.00 eCPM at that level, as 5% over the $2.50 CPM (i.e., $2.625) is less than the winning $12.00 eCPM.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0077">Accounting for the 50% revenue share between ad broker/network <b>20</b> and ad broker/network <b>22</b>, when passed up to the second tier, the $12.00 eCPM value of advertiser <b>36</b> and the $2.50 CPM value of advertiser <b>38</b> compete with $3.00 CPM for advertiser <b>32</b> at $6.00 eCPM and the $1.25 CPM, respectively. Thus, at this auction level, the $6.00 eCPM of advertiser <b>36</b> wins and the $3.00 CPM of advertiser <b>32</b> is the second place winner (beating the $1.25 CPM of advertiser <b>38</b>) while qualifying as a possible second best bid for price reduction relative to the winning $6.00 eCPM at that level, as 5% over the $3.00 CPM (i.e., $3.15) is less than the winning $6.00 eCPM. Accordingly, the $6.00 eCPM (of advertiser <b>36</b>) and the $3.00 CPM (of advertiser <b>32</b>) are passed up to the first tier, competing against the $1.25 CPM of advertiser <b>39</b> at $3.00 eCPM and $1.50 CPM, respectively, based on the 50% revenue share between ad broker/network <b>20</b> and publisher <b>26</b>. Thus, advertiser <b>36</b> and advertiser <b>32</b> are the winning and second place bidders for the overall auction, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0078">It is noted that in such an implementation where a second best bid at a given tier and branching point will only be considered (and passed upwards) if it qualifies for reducing the price of the winning bid at that tier/branching point (e.g., if the second best bid augmented by the margin is less than the winning bid), then if the overall auction results in the winning bid and second best bid originating from nodes having a common root branch to the publisher, then transaction management system <b>100</b> knows that the price reduction will be applied without having to compare the winning price with the reduced price. Thus, in this case, because advertiser <b>32</b> (the second place bidder) and advertiser <b>36</b> (the winner) are both located on the branch defined by the link between publisher <b>26</b> and ad broker/network <b>20</b>, it is known prior to any further calculation that advertiser <b>36</b> will pay a reduced price based on the second place bid.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0079">As noted above, the price to be paid by advertiser <b>36</b> is the price that yields publisher <b>26</b> the same revenue as if the second best bidder (advertiser <b>32</b> in this case) paid the second best bid price augmented according to the price reduction rule (5% in this example), and thus the calculation involves accounting for the respective pricing paths of the winner and second best bidder relative to each other and/or to the publisher. If the overall auction results in the winning bid and second best bid originating from nodes having a common root branch to the publisher, this calculation may be simplified (e.g., compared to cases where the winning bid and second best bid originate from nodes having separate root branches to the publisher). For instance, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the calculation may consider the shortest pricing path from the second place bidder to the winner (e.g., rather than tracing from the second place bidder to the publisher and then from the publisher to the winner). Thus, accounting for the 50% revenue share between ad broker/network <b>20</b> and ad broker/network <b>22</b>, if advertiser paid $3.15 CPM (i.e., $3.00 CPM plus 5%), then winning advertiser <b>36</b> will have to pay $6.30 eCPM for publisher <b>26</b> to obtain the same revenue.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0080">In this example, therefore, advertiser <b>36</b> actually pays $6.30 CPM rather than $12.00 CPM. Thus, for 1000 impressions on campaign A creative <b>1</b>, advertiser <b>36</b> pays $6.30 to ad broker/network <b>22</b>, which pays $3.15 to ad broker/network <b>20</b>, which pays $1.575 to publisher <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0081">In some implementations, the transaction management system <b>100</b> includes a server computer <b>122</b> that runs a linking application <b>124</b>, which enables business entities to establish links with other business entities that have registered/subscribed with the transaction management system <b>100</b>. Generally, the linking application <b>124</b> enables a first entity to establish links with select other entities thereby building a personalized set of entities with which the first entity will transact through the system <b>100</b>. In so doing, the first entity may retain control of the entities to which its inventory is directed, while increasing/maximizing the exposure of its inventory to a select set of entities, each of which may compete on equal footing for each item of the first entity's inventory.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0082">The linking application <b>124</b> may be implemented as a web-based interface through which a business entity (&#x201c;initiating entity) may identify another business entity (&#x201c;target entity&#x201d;) with which the initiating entity desires to partner with.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0083">In one example, the linking application <b>124</b> displays a list of business entities that have registered/subscribed with the transaction management system <b>100</b>. Each entity in the displayed list may be represented by a selectable hyperlink. A person (&#x201c;entity representative&#x201d;) affiliated with a given initiating entity and authorized by that entity to conduct business on its behalf may view the list of target entities and click on a selectable hyperlink to view profile information for a particular target entity. The entity representative may also search for and/or browse through the profile information of the various registered entities of the list to identify and research target entities with whom a link is to be established.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0084">The linking application <b>124</b> displays an icon that the entity representative may click on to send a link request notification to a target entity. Such a notification may be a general invitation expressing an interest to link or a more specific invitation proposing or offering specific terms of line items that will form the basis of a business relationship. Such a notification may be, for example, an e-mail directed to an address identified in the target entity's profile, and/or a message posted to the target entity's online account on transaction management system <b>100</b>. Such a notification may be initiated by the entity representative based in whole or in part on research conducted through transaction management system <b>100</b>, though it need not be based on such research (e.g., the entity representative may send such an notification based entirely on his/her own knowledge about and/or desire to work with a particular business entity).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0085">Once a link request notification is sent to the target entity, the linking application <b>124</b> creates a pending link in the sending entity's online account. Thus, for example, after an advertiser (publisher) sends such a notification to a publisher (advertiser), the advertiser (publisher) would see the publisher (advertiser) listed on its Publisher (Advertiser) list as a pending link. Until the target entity approves the link, this link will remain inactive.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0086">Upon receiving the notification, the target entity may similarly reply to the message electronically to, for example, accept or decline the invitation, offer a counterproposal, or to further discuss or inquire as to the invitation. Prior to replying, the target entity may research information about the sending entity by browsing profile information available on transaction management system <b>100</b>. An electronic reply accepting the invitation may constitute a &#x201c;virtual&#x201d; handshake to establish a link between the entities.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0087">Once a link is established, the entities may exchange communications by way of the transaction management system <b>100</b> or otherwise communicate with each other offline to negotiate and agree upon the terms of the one or more line items that will form the basis of a business relationship between the entities. Such negotiation may involve a series of offers and counteroffers by the parties, though as previously discussed, it is possible that the initial link request notification includes all pertinent details, with the virtual handshake accepting both the establishment of the link as well as the business relationship. Generally, the link between two entities is established only once unless explicitly terminated by one or both of the entities. The link serves as a conduit through which the terms of a business relationship may be defined or continually redefined through the addition, deletion, or modification of line items. The linking application <b>124</b> may be implemented to overwrite an entry of the data store <b>108</b> that stores the information defining the business relationship each time it is redefined by one or both of the entities.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0088">At any point after a business relationship has been established between two entities and the information defining the business relationship is stored in the data store <b>108</b>, that business relationship may be used by the manager application <b>106</b> when generating a graph of a set of entities eligible to participate in a particular transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0089">This linking application <b>124</b> enables ad networks/brokers, publishers and advertisers to partner more easily with each other, and thereby contributes to further enhance the scale and associated efficiency of the exchange provided by transaction management system <b>100</b>. It is understood that while the transaction management system <b>100</b> may advantageously provide an online platform for identifying, researching, and notifying clients with whom a link may be established, alternatively parties may perform one or more of these functions entirely offline, and once an agreement has been reached with regards to the details of a business relationship, line items may be entered into transaction management system <b>100</b> by the parties to establish the link.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0090">For ad networks/brokers, linking effectively increases access to both advertisers and publishers otherwise not in their own network. Similarly, advertisers and publishers that are on a given ad network/broker also realize such increased access to advertisers and publishers that are affiliated with a distinct ad network/broker or that are not affiliated with an ad network but are directly subscribed to the transaction management system <b>100</b>. Concomitantly, advertisers and publishers that are subscribed to the transaction management system platform but not affiliated with an ad network/broker, also realize such increased access to advertisers and publishers that are affiliated with an ad network/broker. This effectively increased access provides for more links to be established, thus creating more competition each time the transaction management system <b>100</b> performs a series of decision processes for a given product being offered for acquisition.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0091">As may be appreciated from the foregoing, linking between entities provides many advantages. For instance, for advertisers, linking through the transaction management system <b>100</b> eliminates the need to send creatives and link tags for each campaign to media partners and require them to traffic creatives into other ad serving solutions. Once a subscribing advertiser has trafficked its creatives into the transaction management system <b>100</b>, the same pool of creatives can be used for any publisher that wants to link with that advertiser. Thus, the linking process is greatly simplified, decreasing the time for establishing links by eliminating creative trafficking, and thus also eliminating the possibilities for errors in trafficking creatives.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0092">Consonant with advantages provided to advertisers, publishers similarly benefit from linking with advertisers (and/or other ad networks) by eliminating campaign trafficking from the advertiser and into an ad serving system as well as eliminating click tracking code entry, thus eliminating potential errors, and also allowing campaigns to be set up rapidly (e.g., hours instead of days), thereby decreasing overhead costs while also realizing advertising revenue more quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0093">In the examples described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>, there is an assumption that there is no disparity in terms of the fulfillment of a transaction from the perspectives of the transaction management system <b>100</b> and the end buyer. Accordingly, any revenue generated from the fulfillment of a particular transaction may be distributed between the various business entities involved in that transaction in accordance with the revenue sharing and/or flat fee arrangements that exist between the business entities. No revenue surplus or a revenue deficit is ever experienced by the business entities involved in the transaction because the revenue generated is the same as the revenue distributed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0094">There are, however, instances in which such an assumption would be in error. As an example, the transaction management system <b>100</b> may count a redirection of an ad creative serving to its content server <b>126</b> as fulfilling a transaction, while the advertiser represented by the sink node of the winning path may only count the actual serving of the ad creative as fulfilling the transaction. If the consumer views the publisher's web page but leaves before allowing the browser to serve the redirect, the ad creative that is being served by the content server may not actually be served to the consumer and will not be counted as such by the advertiser. In other cases, for instance click tracking, the content server may track before the transaction management system. In this case, if the consumer leaves before the click has been executed on both systems, the content server will count more clicks than the transaction management system.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0095">The accounting application <b>118</b> may implement revenue adjustment processes to account for such disparities and distribute the revenue surplus/deficit amongst some/all of the business entities involved in the transaction. Examples of revenue adjustment processes will be described with reference to the following scenarios: (1) one-day adjustment with click units; (2) five-day adjustment with click units; (3) one-day adjustment with conversion units; and (4) five-day adjustment with conversion units. Revenue adjustment processes may also be applied in other scenarios involving adjustments with revenue units and adjustments with impression units, as well as scenarios involving different time periods (e.g., month-long).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0096">(1) One-Day Adjustment with Click Units</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0097">An advertiser called HeadClick (id <b>1</b>), within an ad network called HeadNet (id <b>2</b>), has a line_item (id <b>3</b>) with the transaction management system <b>100</b> that is a cost-per-click (CPC) deal for a particular ad creative (&#x201c;ad creative M&#x201d;). According to the CPC deal, each time a consumer clicks on the ad creative M, HeadClick pays $0.50 to the transaction management system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0098">On May 1, 2006, the ad creative M was served on two different websites: a publisher called BigNews (id <b>5</b>, line_item id <b>6</b>) within the HeadNet ad network, and a publisher called EasySearch (id <b>7</b>, line_item <b>8</b>) within an ad network called Hambone (id <b>9</b>). There is a line_item (id <b>10</b>) allowing the HeadNet ad network to send traffic to the Hambone ad network. The accounting application <b>118</b> recorded a total of 20 clicks on the ad creative M for May 1, 2006. Specifically, the accounting application tracked the number of times consumers clicked on the ad creative M and generated a network table as shown below (N=Ad network; B=Buyer; S=Seller):</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0100">Note that the 5 clicks recorded on May 1 involving the Hambone ad network represent the 5 times the HeadNet ad network directed traffic to the Hambone ad network in accordance with the line_item (id <b>10</b>), which resulted in clicks on the ad creative M that was served by the EasySearch publisher in accordance with the line_item (id <b>8</b>). The revenue ($2.50) resulting from the 5 clicks on the ad creative M that was served by the EasySearch publisher is counted only once in the table. This table shows that on May 1, 2006, $7.50 that was received by the transaction management system <b>100</b> from the HeadClick advertiser was passed on to the BigNews publisher, and $2.50 that was received by the transaction management system <b>100</b> from the HeadClick advertiser was passed on to the Hambone ad network.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0101">Even though the accounting application <b>118</b> recorded a total of 20 clicks for May 1, the HeadClick advertiser recorded 30 clicks for this date. A user (e.g., an employee associated with the HeadClick advertiser or the transaction management system <b>100</b>) enters a request for an adjustment with click units and a value of 30 through a user interface provided by the accounting application <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0102">Once the adjustment request is entered, the accounting application <b>118</b> performs a series of computations to determine how the surplus of $5.00 ($15.00&#x2212;$10.00) is to be distributed amongst the various business entities that functioned as buyers with respect to the HeadNet ad network during the various transactions involving the ad creative M. In this example, the transaction management system <b>100</b> only distributes the surplus amongst the business entities that belong to the HeadNet ad network, that is, BigNews publisher and Hambone ad network. The surplus is not distributed to the EasySearch publisher that belongs to the Hambone ad network.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0103">The accounting application <b>118</b> first computes the weighted adjustment as follows: weighted adjustment=(# of HeadClick-recorded clicks&#x2212;# of TMS-recorded clicks)/(# of TMS-recorded clicks)=(30&#x2212;20)/20=10/20=0.5</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0104">The accounting application <b>118</b> then computes the adjustments to be made per business entity within the HeadNet ad network on a given day using the weighted adjustment and rounds each result up or down as follows: if the fraction of the result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an odd number, round down; if the fraction of the result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an even number, round up; if the fraction of the result is less than 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an odd number, round down; if the fraction of the result is less than 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an even number, round up. After the adjustments and rounding, the accounting application generates an adjusted network table as shown below:</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0122">Even though the accounting application <b>118</b> recorded a total of 50 conversions for May 1, the HeadClick advertiser recorded <b>40</b> conversions for this date. A user (e.g., an employee associated with the HeadClick advertiser or the transaction management system <b>100</b>) enters a request for an adjustment with click units and a value of 40 through a user interface provided by the accounting application <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0123">Once the adjustment request is entered, the accounting application <b>118</b> performs a series of computations to determine how the deficit of $20.00 ($80.00&#x2212;$100.00) is to be distributed amongst the various business entities that functioned as buyers with respect to the HeadNet ad network during the various transactions involving the ad creative P. In this example, the transaction management system <b>100</b> only distributes the deficit amongst the business entities that belong to the HeadNet ad network, that is, BigNews publisher and Hambone ad network. The deficit is not distributed to the EasySearch publisher that belongs to the Hambone ad network.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0124">The accounting application <b>118</b> first computes the weighted adjustment as follows: weighted adjustment=(# of HeadClick-recorded conversions&#x2212;# of TMS-recorded conversions)/(# of TMS-recorded conversions)=(40&#x2212;50)/50=&#x2212;10/50=&#x2212;0.2</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0125">The accounting application <b>118</b> then computes the adjustments to be made per business entity within the HeadNet ad network on a given day using the weighted adjustment and rounds each result up or down as follows: if the fraction of the result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an odd number, round down; if the fraction of the result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an even number, round up; if the fraction of the result is less than 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an odd number, round down; if the fraction of the result is less than 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an even number, round up.

<p id="p-0127" num="0132">Even though the accounting application <b>118</b> recorded a total of 100 conversions for May 1, the HeadClick advertiser recorded <b>80</b> conversions for this date. A user (e.g., an employee associated with the HeadClick advertiser or the transaction management system <b>100</b>) enters a request for an adjustment with click units and a value of 80 through a user interface provided by the accounting application <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0133">Once the adjustment request is entered, the accounting application <b>118</b> performs a series of computations to determine how the deficit of $40.00 ($160.00&#x2212;$200.00) is to be distributed amongst the various business entities that functioned as buyers with respect to the HeadNet ad network during the various transactions involving the ad creative P. In this example, the transaction management system <b>100</b> only distributes the deficit amongst the business entities that belong to the HeadNet ad network, that is, BigNews publisher and Hambone ad network. The deficit is not distributed to the EasySearch publisher that belongs to the Hambone ad network.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0134">The accounting application <b>118</b> first computes the weighted adjustment as follows: weighted adjustment=(# of HeadClick-recorded conversions&#x2212;# of TMS-recorded conversions)/(# of TMS-recorded conversions)=(80&#x2212;100)/100=&#x2212;20/100=&#x2212;0.2</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0135">The accounting application <b>118</b> then computes the adjustments to be made per business entity within the HeadNet ad network on a given day using the weighted adjustment and rounds each result up or down as follows: if the fraction of the result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an odd number, round down; if the fraction of the result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an even number, round up; if the fraction of the result is less than 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an odd number, round down; if the fraction of the result is less than 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an even number, round up. After the adjustments and rounding, the accounting application generates an adjusted network table as shown below:</p>

<p id="p-0137" num="0142">Even though the accounting application <b>118</b> recorded a total of 100 conversions for May 1, the HeadClick advertiser recorded <b>80</b> conversions for this date. A user (e.g., an employee associated with the HeadClick advertiser or the transaction management system <b>100</b>) enters a request for an adjustment with click units and a value of 80 through a user interface provided by the accounting application <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0143">Once the adjustment request is entered, the accounting application <b>118</b> performs a series of computations to determine how the deficit of $40.00 ($160.00&#x2212;$200.00) is to be distributed amongst the various business entities that functioned as buyers with respect to the HeadNet ad network during the various transactions involving the ad creative P. In this example, the transaction management system <b>100</b> only distributes the deficit amongst the business entities that belong to the HeadNet ad network, that is, BigNews publisher and Hambone ad network. The deficit is not distributed to the EasySearch publisher that belongs to the Hambone ad network.</p>

<p id="p-0146" num="0151">Although the examples provided above describe certain rounding techniques (e.g., if the fraction of the result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an odd number, round down; if the fraction of the result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an even number, round up; if the fraction of the result is less than 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an odd number, round down; if the fraction of the result is less than 0.5 and the whole number of the fraction is an even number, round up), other rounding techniques may also be applied. One example rounding technique that may be used in a multi-day adjustment process involves rounding the values down until the sum of the remainders is more than 1, then rounding up. On the last day of the multi-day adjustment process, the rounding technique involves adding the remainders to the current number and rounding down. The remainder is then added to a &#x201c;slough&#x201d; account so that the overall number ties out at the end of the day.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0152">Although the transaction management system <b>100</b> is described as adjusting revenue based on units of impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue, the system may be implemented to adjust revenue based on any arbitrary unit, and in some discretionary pricing models, independent of any unit.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0153">In addition to the revenue adjustment process, the transaction management system <b>100</b> may also implement a delivery mechanism that accounts for any revenue adjustments. As an example, if a 5% positive adjustment is made to a $1.00 CPM campaign, the transaction management system <b>100</b> will optimize the campaign as if it would get $1.05 CPM. The transaction management system <b>100</b> pays the ad networks as if it were a $1.05 CPM deal, but book it for itself and its managed publishers at $1.00 so that the manual adjustment flows through properly.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0154">Although the techniques are described above in the online advertising context, the techniques are also applicable in any number of different electronic exchanges in which products, commodities or services are offered for purchase or sale.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0155">The techniques described herein can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them. The techniques can be implemented as a computer program product, i.e., a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable storage device or in a propagated signal, for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus, e.g., a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple computers. A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0156">Method steps of the techniques described herein can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions of the invention by operating on input data and generating output.
