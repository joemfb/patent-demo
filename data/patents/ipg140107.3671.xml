No. 8,269,627, which application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/991,459, filed Nov. 30, 2007, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Building security systems can vary in complexity from simple burglar alarms triggered by breakage of windows or other fenestration members, to comprehensive intrusion detection systems that collect data from video cameras, laser beams, infrared sensors, microphones, etc., analyze the data, and communicate information to a variety of destinations, such as security stations and automated building control centers. While complex and relatively expensive security systems are useful, applications such as residential housing need a simpler, lower cost monitoring system capable of collecting multiple types of security related data and transmitting data to one or more locations for analysis and/or action. The system's data collecting and transmitting components should also be self contained and self powered, possess wireless communication capability, and be relatively simple to install in both new and existing structures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one embodiment, a fenestration unit is provided that includes a frame, at least one panel disposed in the frame with the panel being movable between a closed position and an open position, and a locking member having a locked position, for locking the panel in the closed position, and an unlocked position for allowing the panel to be opened. A first sensor is included to detect when the panel is in the closed position and when the panel is in the open position and a second sensor is included to detect when the latch is in the locked position and when the latch is in the unlocked position. A processor coupled to the first sensor and the second sensor is also included, with the processor being programmed to determine a status of the fenestration unit based at least on the detections of the sensors. Optionally, this embodiment can include a transmitter for transmitting the status of the fenestration unit to a remote location. Further, either the first sensor or the second sensor can include a reed switch and an associated magnet, or can include a mechanical switch. The fenestration unit in this embodiment can be a window, or can be a door. Further still, an indicator can be included on the fenestration unit that indicates the status of the fenestration unit, and the indicator can be an audible signal generator or can be a light source.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another embodiment, a status monitoring device for a fenestration unit is provided that includes at least a first panel and a second panel movable with respect to the first panel. The device in this embodiment includes a switch on the first panel, and a switch triggering component on the second panel.

Optionally still, the device can include a visible light signal output device that indicates whether the switch is in the first position or the second position. Further, the device can include an audible output device that provides an audible alarm when the switch is moved from the first position. Further still, the device can include a position sensor that triggers an alarm when the switch is moved from the first position. In this embodiment, the fenestration unit can be a window and the device can be integral the window. Alternatively, the fenestration unit can be a door adjacent a wall and the device can be part of a slide bar lock moveable between the door and the wall. The switch can be a magnetically operated reed switch, and the triggering component can be a magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment, a status monitoring device is installed adjacent a lock that includes a latch and a keeper. The device in this embodiment includes a first housing disposed adjacent the latch, a second housing disposed adjacent the keeper, a switch disposed in the first housing or in the second housing, a switch triggering component disposed in the first housing or in the second housing, and a transmitter for communicating the position of the latch with respect to the keeper to a remote location. Optionally, the switch triggering component can be a magnet. Optionally still, the device can include a visible light signal output indicating whether the switch is in the first position or the second position. Further, the device can include an audible output device capable of providing an audible alarm when the latch is moved with respect to the keeper or when other predetermined events occur. Further still, the device can include a position sensor that triggers an alarm when the latch is moved from the keeper. The device of this embodiment can be installed under the lock, and a reed switch can be installed adjacent the lock.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, a status monitoring system for a closure assembly is provided. The system includes a locking member position sensor, a closure panel position sensor, a status code generator, and a status code transmitter. In this embodiment, the locking member position sensor, the closure panel position sensor, the status code generator, and the status code transmitter are integrated into a single unitary device, which is positioned to sense the position of a locking member and the position of a closure panel. The status code generator in this embodiment generates a status code based upon both locking member position and closure panel position. Further, a status code receiver and an output device can be provided. Further still, the locking member position sensor can be a magnetically operated reed switch, a mechanically operated switch, an acoustical sensor, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) device, or an optical sensor. Optionally, the closure position sensor can be a magnetically operated reed switch, a mechanically operated switch, an acoustical sensor, an RFID device, or an optical sensor. In this embodiment, a battery can be contained within the unit, with the battery being held in a battery carrier movable from a position interior the unit to a position exterior the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, a status monitoring system for a closure assembly is provided. The closure assembly includes a fixed frame holding a panel moveable from a closed position to an open position, and a locking member for holding the panel in the closed position. The system includes a monitoring device that includes a locking member position sensor, a closure panel position sensor, a microprocessor, and a status code transmitter. The locking member position sensor, the closure panel position sensor, the microprocessor, and the status code transmitter operate in an electronically integrated manner. The monitoring device is positioned to sense both the position of the locking member and the position of the closure panel. The microprocessor generates a status code that integrates the locking member status with closure panel position. Generally, the system includes a status code receiver. Optionally, the system includes an output device. The locking member position sensor generally is a magnetically operated reed switch, a mechanically operated switch, an acoustical sensor, RFID device, or an optical sensor. Further, the closure position sensor is a magnetically operated reed switch, a mechanically operated switch, an acoustical sensor, an RFID device, or an optical sensor. The system can also include a battery contained within the monitoring device. The battery can be held in a battery carrier movable from a position interior the unit to a position exterior the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The device of this invention generally provides a status monitoring that is coupled to or interfaces with a fenestration unit, its components, and its surrounding environs. Such a device may be incorporated, for example, in the latch mechanism of a double hung window unit or the strike plate of a door. The information collected or received by the device can include various status reports of the fenestration unit itself such as whether the fenestration unit is open or closed. The device can gather information from the fenestration units components such as locks to detect whether the lock is locked or unlocked, or can collect information about the environment surrounding the fenestration unit, such as outside or inside temperature, humidity, moisture, light, motion, etc. Also, the device can gather information such as the time of a change in the position of the fenestration unit, the position of the lock, or an interior or exterior environment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The information gathered can be recorded or processed locally by the device, can be locally output via a light, alarm, or other visual or audible source, and/or can be exported to another unit, such as via a wired or wireless link to a central information unit with storage or command capabilities, where further processing can be performed. Such further processing can include transmitting a message to an alarm monitoring system or notifying authorities and/or the occupants of a building of a triggering event. The central information unit can collect and store information either from a single status monitoring device, or can collect information from multiple monitoring devices.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The status monitoring device can communicate a condition of the fenestration unit or its surroundings to the occupant of the room via light, sound, or the like. Based on information sensed by the device or information provided to the device (from another source), the device can communicate to the occupant, such as through a series of light flashes or audible beeps. For example, if a smoke detector in a building senses a fire or smoke, a signal can be sent to status monitoring devices on the windows and/or doors. The devices can then trigger flashing lights, audible beeps, or the like, which can act as a beacon, indicating an exit route out of the building. The device lights or beepers can also flash or sound to indicate a tripped security alarm in the building or a weather alert in the area where the building is located.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the status monitoring device can either be installed on an existing fenestration unit, such as under existing hardware, such as a latch assembly, or can be installed during manufacture of a new fenestration unit. The device can be utilized on all types of fenestration units (windows and doors), for example, including casement, awning, roof window, double hung, single hung, gliding, hinged patio doors, sliding patio doors, entry doors, and garage doors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The device can interface with a fenestration unit as well as its hardware and surroundings, can detect the condition of the hardware as well as the venting status of the fenestration unit, and can, for example, enable a builder or contractor to monitor the windows and doors during construction to provide a level of security or awareness on the jobsite during building construction.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For a more complete understanding of the present invention, reference will be made to the following detailed description and accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts throughout the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To facilitate an understanding and explanation of the invention, the elements and numerals as described herein may be referred to with the terms &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; &#x201c;front,&#x201d; and &#x201c;back&#x201d; to distinguish portions of the device. These conventions are merely included for ease of explanation and understanding and should not be construed as limiting in any manner. The descriptions of the parts detailed herein as &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; etc. also can be referred to as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a first embodiment of a status monitoring device under a traditional latch on a fenestration unit, with status monitoring device <b>10</b> having a first housing <b>20</b> under latch element base <b>40</b> and second housing <b>30</b> under keeper element base <b>50</b>. The first housing <b>20</b> is affixed under latch element base <b>40</b> by screws <b>5</b> to the top rail or check rail <b>12</b> of lower sash of fenestration unit <b>15</b> (such as a single or double hung window), while second housing <b>30</b> is affixed under keeper <b>50</b> by screws <b>5</b> to the bottom rail <b>14</b> of upper sash of fenestration unit <b>15</b>. A latch <b>45</b> generally is affixed atop latch element base <b>40</b> and is capable of being selectively engaged with keeper <b>50</b>. The status monitoring device <b>10</b> is capable of detecting whether the latch <b>45</b> is engaged within keeper <b>50</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, status monitoring device <b>10</b> can optionally include an indicator light (or lights) <b>60</b> and can optionally include an audible output <b>70</b>, such as a speaker, beeper, or alarm. If a status monitoring device according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is to be installed on an existing fenestration unit, the lock is first removed from the rails by removing the screws and then reinstalled atop the housings <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a part view of the first embodiment of the device <b>10</b> including the status monitoring device's first housing <b>20</b>, second housing <b>30</b>, and circuit board <b>80</b>. The circuit board <b>80</b> can include a battery, a microprocessor, a transmitting unit, receiving unit, circuitry, sensors, and/or other sensors that collect information.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The status monitoring system discussed herein is not limited to any particular mechanical configuration, but can be utilized to integrate any reliable indication of lock engagement with any reliable indication of panel closure to produce a status code that is wirelessly transmitted to a status code receiver. Further, other types of information, in addition to lock position status and panel position status, can also be sensed and transmitted to status code receiver <b>110</b>. Installation of monitor unit <b>50</b> and spacer <b>56</b> can be performed during factory assembly or as a retrofit at any later time.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a cut-away view of the status monitoring device of the first embodiment in an exemplary configuration. The status monitoring device <b>10</b> can be placed outside the sash to allow retrofitting to an existing sash. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, second housing <b>30</b> contains a magnet <b>35</b> that triggers an indication that trips a reed switch <b>96</b> in housing <b>20</b> when the window is closed as an indication of a closed window condition. Latch <b>45</b> is suitably configured to allow space for a monitor unit <b>90</b> with portion <b>92</b> for operating lock position switch <b>94</b> and magnetically operated reed switch <b>96</b>. The term lock position switch is used herein in the broad sense of any device, such as an optical or an RFID device, that provides a signal indicative of when lock <b>45</b> is moved from the unlocked to the locked position, or from the locked to the unlocked position. The magnetically operated reed switch <b>96</b> and magnet <b>35</b> cooperate to provide information about the device <b>10</b>, such as whether the window sashes are separated and thus the window is open.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In place of the described switch <b>96</b> and magnet <b>35</b>, which sense the proximity of first housing <b>20</b> to second housing <b>30</b>, other embodiments can use alternative proximity sensors, which can be based on optical, mechanical, RFID, or other proximity sensitive phenomena.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Another common fenestration configuration is that in which one panel slides past another panel. Examples of this configuration include vertically sliding windows, such as single hung or double hung windows, and horizontally sliding windows and doors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a cut-away view of a status monitoring device of a second embodiment built into the rail of the fenestration unit beneath a traditional latch mechanism. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, vertically sliding top rail of lower sash <b>112</b>, sometimes referred to as the check rail, overlaps or aligns with the lower rail of upper sash <b>114</b> when the window is closed, as shown, and the rails moves apart when the window is opened. The upper sash may also be slidable, in which case the overall window unit is called a double hung unit, or it may be fixed, in which case the overall window unit is called a single hung unit. When both sashes are in the closed position, latch <b>145</b> can be rotated into engagement with keeper <b>150</b> to lock the two sashes together, thereby preventing the opening of either sash.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Monitor unit <b>190</b>, located in check rail <b>112</b>, is equipped with magnetically operated reed switch <b>196</b> and a mechanical switch <b>192</b>. Rail <b>114</b> is equipped with magnet <b>135</b>. When both sashes are in the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, magnet <b>135</b> is in close proximity to reed switch <b>196</b>, thereby activating it to produce a signal indicative that the sashes are in the closed position. Latch <b>145</b> is equipped with projecting finger <b>193</b>, attached to a shaft <b>191</b>, which engages or disengages activation portion <b>194</b> of switch <b>192</b> to activate or deactivate the switch as an indication that the latch has been engaged or disengaged. Activation portion <b>194</b> is typically a spring biased lever or button coupled to an electrical switch. Monitor <b>190</b> electronically integrates the indications of lock status and sash closure status into an integrated status code or information I that is transmitted to a status code receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a partially deconstructed view of a status monitoring device of a third embodiment in a rail of a fenestration unit adjacent a sliding-type latch with an integrated magnet. Such sliding-type latches are common in casement windows. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the third embodiment of the status monitoring device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> with the latch in position on the rail. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, rail <b>212</b> is routed or otherwise formed with latch base receiving space <b>211</b> and with latch receiving space <b>213</b>, which are sized to receive latch base <b>240</b> and latch <b>245</b>. Latch <b>245</b>, when operated to latch or unlatch a window, moves magnet <b>296</b> toward or away form reed switch <b>235</b> within cover <b>232</b>, activating or deactivating the reed switch as an indication that latch <b>245</b> is properly seated, indicating the fenestration unit is secured in a locked position, or is not properly seated, indicating the fenestration unit is not secured in a locked position. Circuit board <b>280</b> detects activation or deactivation of reed switch <b>235</b>, determines the condition of the latch based thereon and transmits the condition to a remote receiver that cooperates with magnetically operated reed switch <b>235</b> to transmit the position of latch <b>245</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, circuit board <b>280</b> is contained within a cover <b>232</b> disposed adjacent the latch base <b>240</b> in space <b>211</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the third embodiment installed in position in a fenestration unit. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the rail <b>212</b> is turned over from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, which results in the lock <b>240</b> and the cover <b>232</b> housing the circuit board being disposed on the outermost side of the rail <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A status monitoring device can also be used with other types of locks and latches, such as a slide bar as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, slide bar <b>300</b> is slidably attached to jamb <b>330</b>, so that it is able to slide longitudinally upwardly in direction <b>301</b>, and downwardly in direction <b>302</b>. Slide bar <b>300</b> is equipped with coupling features for coupling to one or more locking devices and for coupling to a central operator which enables the user to slide the slide bar up and down. In the particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, moving bar <b>300</b> upward moves the locks coupled to it to the locked position, and sliding it downward unlocks the locks. The slide bar can be used to operate only one lock, or it can operate two or more locks simultaneously, depending upon how many locks are coupled to the slide bar. Several methods of coupling locks and operating mechanisms to the slide bar are known. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example, openings <b>304</b> are provided for engaging the teeth of gear that operates a lock, in a rack and pinion manner. Peg <b>306</b>, which may provide a coupling to a lock or to an operating mechanism, is adapted to engage a cam or a pivoting lever. Slide bar locking mechanisms are commonly used to operate more than one lock simultaneously. Such locking systems are commonly called multipoint locks, and can be found in casement and other hinged windows, as well as in patio and storm doors.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, monitor <b>390</b> is located adjacent to edge <b>332</b> of jamb <b>330</b>. Monitor <b>390</b> is equipped with magnetic reed switches <b>396</b> and <b>397</b>. Slide bar <b>300</b> is equipped with magnet <b>334</b>. When slide bar <b>300</b> is moved upwardly, to the locking position, magnet <b>334</b> is brought into close proximity to magnetically operated reed switch <b>397</b>, thereby activating it to produce an indication that the slide bar is in the locking position. In a similar manner, panel <b>320</b>, which may be a door or window panel, is equipped with magnet <b>335</b>. When panel <b>320</b> is moved to the closed position, magnet <b>335</b> is brought into close proximity to magnetically operated reed switch <b>396</b>, thereby activating it as an indication that panel <b>320</b> is in the closed position. Monitor <b>390</b> electronically integrates the indications of lock status and panel closure status into an integrated status code I that is transmitted to a remote status code receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an alternative embodiment, magnetic reed switch <b>397</b> is replaced by a mechanical switch operated by the end of slide bar <b>300</b> making physical contact with it, thereby depressing an actuator portion and closing an associated switch.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a partial cut-away view of a status monitoring device of a fifth embodiment for a deadbolt latch. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a portion of a hinged closure panel <b>430</b>, which may be a door panel, is shown in a closed position adjacent to vertical frame member, or jamb, <b>420</b>. As used herein, the term closure panel will include doors, windows, and other like panels used in fenestration units. The panels may be hinged, sliding, or otherwise moveable. Closure panel <b>430</b> may be hinged to pivot about a vertical axis parallel to the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Lock <b>440</b> is provided in panel <b>430</b> for holding and locking panel <b>430</b> in its closed position relative to jamb <b>420</b>. In this embodiment, lock <b>440</b> includes two locking members, latch <b>445</b>, typically operated by a doorknob, handle, or other direct operating device, and deadbolt <b>446</b>, which typically requires a key to operate. The key could be a conventional mechanical key or could be a card or other like device that operates locks by, for example, activating an electronic circuit or electromechanical device. Locking members <b>445</b> and <b>446</b> perform their locking function by engaging with apertures <b>454</b> and <b>456</b>, respectively, in receiver plate <b>451</b>, which is fixedly attached to jamb <b>420</b>. Mortise <b>452</b> is provided in jamb <b>420</b> to provide space for locking members <b>445</b> and <b>446</b> to pass through receiver plate <b>451</b>, in the conventional manner.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the embodiment portrayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, closure status monitoring unit <b>490</b> is contained within mortise <b>452</b>. In this embodiment, device <b>490</b> is held in place by a tab on receiver plate <b>451</b>. Monitor device <b>490</b> is positioned proximate to deadbolt <b>446</b>, as well as to edge <b>432</b> of panel <b>430</b>. Unit <b>490</b> contains a position sensor that senses whether deadbolt <b>446</b> is in the extended, or locked, position, or whether it is in the retracted, or unlocked, position. One useful position sensor is a mechanical switch, having actuator <b>496</b>, which is moved from an open circuit position to a closed circuit position or vice versa when deadbolt <b>446</b> is extended through aperture <b>456</b> in receiver plate <b>451</b>. Also contained within unit <b>490</b> is a second sensor, for sensing the proximity of panel <b>430</b> to unit <b>490</b>, which indicates whether panel <b>430</b> is open or closed. In this fifth embodiment, the second sensor is a magnetically actuated reed switch that moves from an open circuit position to a closed circuit position or vice versa when magnet <b>435</b> is brought into sufficiently close proximity to it, as would occur when panel <b>430</b> is in the closed position. As latch <b>445</b> extends its locked position with respect to receiver space <b>452</b>, the deadbolt <b>446</b> engages switch <b>496</b> on monitor <b>490</b> to indicate a locked condition, which can be transmitted to an external source receiver via antennae <b>495</b>. Alternatively though not shown, the mechanical switch <b>496</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> can be replaced with an electronic switch not requiring physical contact with the latch <b>445</b> to indicate a locked condition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> show close-up views of the status monitoring device of the fifth embodiment, showing circuit board <b>480</b> within monitor <b>490</b>, and showing mechanical switch <b>496</b> extending from monitor <b>490</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Alternative embodiments can be formed in several variations. In particular, a lock position sensor can also be used to sense the position of latch <b>445</b>. If the position of both latch <b>445</b> and deadbolt <b>446</b> are sensed, the lock status code would need to be expanded to describe the status of the locking members fully. Further, the physical configuration of unit <b>490</b> need not be limited to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The unit could, for example, be shaped to snap into the mortise without the use of a tab, could be configured to attach to plate <b>451</b> prior to installation of plate <b>451</b>, or could be made up of two or more units that plug into one another to form a single unit. Further still, the monitoring unit can be made up of physically separate subunits, provided the subunits function in an electronically integrated manner. Also, sensors other than reed switches can be used, and when this is done, the circuitry for receiving the status signals and generating and transmitting the status codes will change accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The monitoring system can also be adapted to monitor the status of fenestration units having more than one lock. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a sixth embodiment of a status monitoring device for a multiple lock system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows cut-away view of the sixth embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, window unit <b>500</b>, viewed from the interior of a building structure, includes vertically sliding sashes <b>512</b> and <b>514</b>. Sashes <b>512</b> and <b>514</b> can be secured by locking them together using latches <b>540</b> and <b>640</b>, in the conventional manner. Latches <b>540</b> and <b>640</b> may further include tilt latches that engage jamb liners <b>516</b> and <b>518</b> and can be retracted to allow sash <b>512</b> to be tilted inward for cleaning or other maintenance purposes. A lock monitoring unit, as disclosed hereinabove, may be incorporated into latch <b>540</b> or <b>640</b>, to monitor its status as being locked or unlocked. While monitoring of the status of lock <b>640</b> can be done by the use of a second monitoring unit, having its own code transmission capability, an alternative, and perhaps more cost effective, system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, lock <b>640</b> is provided with a lock position sensor, which is connected, through transmission line <b>515</b> to the status monitoring device in lock <b>540</b>, which then combines the status of lock <b>640</b> with that of lock <b>540</b> to produce an integrated signal portraying the overall status of both locks. Transmission line <b>515</b> can, for example, be simply a pair of wires connected to a position sensing switch in lock <b>640</b>. Alternatively, transmission line <b>515</b> can be a pair of optical fibers, connected to a shutter, which is controlled by the position of lock <b>640</b>. In yet another embodiment, the monitoring device in lock <b>540</b> can contain a light source directed toward lock <b>640</b>, along with a light sensor, and lock <b>640</b> can be equipped with a reflective device that is moveable from a reflecting position to a non-reflecting position, wherein light from the light source is reflected back to the light sensor when lock <b>640</b> is in one position and not reflected when lock <b>640</b> is in another position. In this case, transmission line <b>515</b> may not be a solid transmission medium, but rather an open or transparent space through which light can be transmitted. Other modes of communication between locks <b>540</b> and <b>640</b> will be apparent to one skilled in the art. The open or closed position of sash <b>512</b> relative to <b>514</b> can be sensed by a magnet and a magnetic reed switch, in a manner similar to that portrayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>. An expanded code can be calculated to portray the complete status of window <b>500</b>, as shown in Table 1, in which a locked condition is represented by 1, an unlocked condition by 0, a closed position by 1, and an open position by 0. The code in Table 1 may be embedded in any suitable protocol, and may be encrypted for security or other purposes.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a flow chart of information able to be collected by the status monitoring device of the invention and transmitted to a remote command unit. The device provides an interface to monitor the fenestration unit, or its environs, to which the device is attached or associated. The interface generally collects information and then either (1) stores such information, (2) triggers an alarm, light, or other display on the device itself, (3) transmits, either constantly or periodically, such information to a remote information receiving unit, or (4) a combination of these or other features. In one embodiment, the status monitoring device transmits information periodically to conserve battery life.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, box <b>700</b> encompasses a functional diagram of electronic circuitry that may be contained within the monitor unit. Components performing the functions shown within box <b>700</b> may conveniently be located on a single circuit board, though other configurations are also possible. Generally, while the components performing the functions portrayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> may not be physically integrated into a single unit, the components will be located in close proximity to one another and will function electronically as a single unit, transmitting a status code signal that integrates the information from all of the associated sensors into a single signal. A device that operates in this manner will be said to function in an electronically integrated manner. Alternative sensing devices that provide other optional inputs <b>703</b> may be provided, for example, as plug-in units that plug into a primary circuit board. Alternative sensing units may require that additional signal processing be provided in order for the overall device to function in an electronically integrated manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is exemplary of operation of a deadbolt latch, such as the one detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref> above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Lock position sensor <b>702</b>, which senses the position of deadbolt <b>62</b>, can, as portrayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref>, be a mechanical switch actuated by contact with deadbolt <b>62</b>. Alternatively, deadbolt position could be sensed by optical devices, sonic devices, RFID devices, or other suitable position sensing devices. Deadbolt <b>62</b> can be adapted for particular methods of sensing by providing it with reflective surfaces, RFID capability, or other suitable adaptations. Further, sensors for sensing lock conditions other than deadbolt position may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Panel position sensor <b>704</b> can be a magnetically activated reed switch that is activated by magnet <b>435</b>, contained in edge <b>432</b> of panel <b>430</b>, as portrayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Plate <b>451</b> contains a third aperture to allow a portion of unit <b>490</b> to extend through it, thereby enhancing the magnetic coupling of magnet <b>435</b> with switch <b>704</b>. The extension of unit <b>490</b> through plate <b>451</b> also allows access to unit <b>490</b> that may be needed, for example, for battery replacement. Other devices for sensing the position of panel <b>430</b> relative to jamb <b>420</b> may include binary devices that sense when panel <b>430</b> is sufficiently near to be considered closed, or sufficiently far to be considered open.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Microprocessor <b>706</b> is programmed to combine the signals from lock position sensor <b>702</b> and panel position sensor <b>704</b> to generate a code that describes or encodes the status of panel <b>430</b> and lock <b>440</b>. The type of code used is not particularly limited, provided it fully describes the status of the panel and lock, and is understood by the code receiver. An example of a suitable code for a binary system, wherein the lock is either locked or unlocked, and the door is either open or closed, is shown in Table 2.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The code generated by code generator <b>706</b> is sent, possibly in encrypted form, to RF amplifier <b>711</b>, which generates, in cooperation with oscillator <b>709</b>, a signal that is sent to antenna <b>713</b> for transmission of the status code to the status code receiver <b>710</b>. The receiver <b>710</b> can be located some distance from antenna <b>713</b>, for example in another room of a house, or perhaps even in an adjacent building, such as a garage or other structure. If necessary, the status code receiver <b>710</b> can decrypt the transmission received from antenna <b>713</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an alternative embodiment, rather than being programmed to integrate lock status and panel position status into a single code, code generator <b>706</b> generates and transmits separate codes for lock status and panel position, and sends each, along with codes to identify them as lock status or panel position, to the status code receiver <b>710</b>, which integrates the codes into an appropriate overall status code.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It will be appreciated that the code shown in Table 2 can be further encoded to simplify the information presented to the user by sending a single open door code, namely 00, to the system to indicate that the door is open, whether locked or unlocked.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Status code receiver <b>710</b> receives the status code signal from antenna <b>713</b> and provides one or more suitable responses to the status code signals. Possible responses include outputs, such as an action <b>721</b> or display <b>723</b>, to video displays, audio alarms, lighting devices, and other components of a security system. The status code shown in Table 2 need not be the exact protocol used in transmission. The code may be embedded in any suitable data transmission protocol, and can further be encrypted, for security or other reasons. Information beyond that shown in Table 2 may need to be transmitted, for example when a sensor is capable of sensing the specific degree to which a fenestration panel is open. When this is the case, an expanded code, along with the necessary electronic capability, can be created. Further, status code receiver <b>710</b> may be a stand alone unit or may be incorporated into a comprehensive security system.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The functions contained within box <b>700</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> generally will not require an outside power source, but will instead rely on an internal power source <b>701</b> such as a battery. In order to fit monitor <b>490</b> into a smaller space, it is useful for the battery to be as small as possible, thereby limiting the amount of power that such a battery would be able to deliver over an extended period of time. Several power saving features can be incorporated into the electronic functions of monitor <b>490</b>. In particular, monitor <b>490</b> can be set only to transmit information when information needs to be transmitted. Generally, information is transmitted in packets, with three different types of information packets sent, namely registration packets, event packets, and supervisory packets. A battery may last months or years under such conditions. Additionally, other power sources, such as piezoelectric devices and other energy harvesting systems may be incorporated into the monitoring device, either alone or in combination with more conventional sources, such as batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A registration data packet is transmitted upon installation of a battery in monitor <b>490</b>. The registration data packet contains a code identifying the source of the registration data packet as being monitor <b>490</b>. When monitor <b>490</b> is first installed, the programming interface can be used to enter information concerning the location of monitor <b>490</b>, a description of the window or door in which it is installed, and other like information, in a manner that matches the entered information with the identification code for monitor <b>490</b>. Upon replacement of a battery, the registration information is retransmitted. Optionally, other information, such as the date and time of battery replacement, may be recorded by the status code receiver, for convenience in maintaining maintenance records.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A second type of packet is an event packet, which is sent when an event such as locking or unlocking a lock, or opening or closing a panel, occurs. Inconsistencies between the lock status and panel status can be interpreted by the status code receiver as events requiring attention. Depending on the types of sensors installed in monitor <b>490</b>, other event codes representing, for example, glass breakage, sudden acceleration of the panel, temperature, or other evidence of an event requiring attention, can also be contained in the packet. Battery power is conserved by transmitting an event packet only when an event occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Another type of packet is the supervisory information packet, which is sent at set time periods to inform the status code receiver that monitor <b>490</b> is still operating. Failure to receive a supervisory packet within a prescribed time causes the receiver to generate an alarm signal. Possible causes for failure to receive a supervisory signal might include such things as broken electrical connections, a dead battery, and obstruction of the signal coming from antenna <b>713</b>. Other battery saving strategies can also be employed, such as choosing an optimal voltage ramp-up profile just prior to beginning transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Despite all efforts at power conservation, batteries will eventually approach failure, whether due to power consumption or simply due to the battery shelf life being exceeded. Useful features in circuitry include reverse polarity protection <b>705</b> to protect against incorrect battery insertion, an LED indicator <b>715</b> for diagnostics and installation troubleshooting purposes, and an accessible programming interface <b>717</b> to upgrade the code or software on transmitter post installation. In order to avoid loss of the monitoring function, it is useful to be able to detect deteriorating battery performance before actual failure. One measure of battery condition is the drop in output voltage when output current increases. Since a significant amount of current is drawn when a signal is being transmitted, one measure of battery condition is the voltage supplied to the signal transmitting function, in particular oscillator <b>709</b>. Low battery detection device <b>707</b> monitors this voltage during transmission and compares it to the voltage between transmissions to determine the condition of the battery on an ongoing basis. If the battery is approaching failure, detection device <b>707</b> sends a signal to microprocessor <b>706</b>, which creates an appropriate code to send to the status code receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The device can display information on the device itself, such as by displaying time or temperature, can include a light, such as a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) that switches from green, e.g. when a lock is unlocked, to red when fully locked, or can provide an alarm to indicate a triggering event, such as the unlocking of a locked window. The device can monitor, collect, and display internal information inside a building and/or can monitor, collect, and display external information, such as external temperature, humidity, light, moisture, ultraviolet light, wind speed, etc. Further, the device can monitor, collect, and display hardware information, such as whether a lock is being or has been tampered with, or whether a lock is in a locked or unlocked condition. Further still, the present device can provide information about the fenestration unit to which it is attached or associated, such as whether a window or door is open or closed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Once information is collected by the device, generally by or through the status code receiver, the information can be transferred to an information collection unit, which generally is remote from the device. In one embodiment, the device transmits the information wirelessly, such as via radio waves, microwave, Bluetooth, or other wireless transmission protocol, to the information collection unit (status code receiver). In another embodiment, the device may be directly or hard wired to the information collection unit. Additionally, the device can receive externally provided information, such as from the information collection unit or other unit, which can transmit information to the device in an embodiment which allows the device to receive information, such as severe weather alerts. The device in such embodiment can then respond accordingly, such as by displaying a warning light or an audible sound to apprise building occupants of such severe weather alerts or other condition.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The information collection unit can receive information from more than one status monitoring device. Generally, once information is transferred from a device to the information collection unit, the information collection unit can further manipulate or otherwise utilize the information, such as store information from the monitoring device(s), display warnings identifying which information collection devices are signaling or have signaled a specified event to warn a building occupant that an event has occurred. Information such as movement of a window or door from a set position as detected with an accelerometer, that the external humidity has increased or decreased, that it is raining outside, etc. can be relayed from the monitoring device to the information collection unit. The information from the monitoring device can be transmitted and displayed by the information collection device to an internet website, a cell phone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), remote control, or some other system capable of displaying such information. The information collection device can be controlled externally by a switch, remote, computer, cell phone, PDA, internet, or any external manipulation device that can be used to control, display, notify, store, or otherwise use information. Additionally, such information can be transmitted to a monitoring company, such as an alarm company, to protect a building or building's occupants, such as by contacting the police, fire, or other authorities, or the building's occupants of a triggering event.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">There are at least four general scenarios for providing information wirelessly from the present status monitoring device. In scenario 1, the status monitoring device provides local awareness via an alarm, visual light indicator, or other local device to inform building occupants about the lock, fenestration unit, or their environs. For example, the status monitoring device can indicate whether the window is open or closed, whether the lock is locked or unlocked, information about the internal or external environment, and transmit information to a central information receiving unit. The status monitoring device will allow monitoring of several events and trigger an alarm or light to warn that such event has occurred, such as activating an alarm if a lock or window is forced open, the indicator light can glow green if the lock is unlocked and glow red if the lock is locked, or the indicator light can blink if an alarm is armed. The sensor can be mounted into the strike of the lock to monitor proximity of the lock and enable a user to identify by immediate visual inspection of the light on the front of the lock whether the lock is fully engaged, locked, or unlocked. Further still, scenario 1 shows that the status monitoring device can include a built-in transmitter to transmit the lock status or information about the fenestration unit or its environs to a remote receiver, such as a tabletop or wall mounted receiver device. In scenario 2, a window monitor can receive a signal from at least one status monitoring device to show the window or lock status or information collected by the device's sensors. In scenario 3, a security system can receive the signal from the device(s); such security system can be a brand name security system that can then use the information to notify a building occupant or authorities of a triggering event. In scenario 4, the ability to monitor the device(s) anywhere via cell phone, interne connection, PDA, or the like is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The status monitoring device can include additional features, such as an accelerometer or displacement or position sensor (hereinafter &#x201c;accelerometer&#x201d;). Such accelerometer or displacement or position sensor can capture or detect whether a window sash or door panel has changed position, such as from a sudden movement of the window or door. For example, a window can be set in a venting position and an alarm armed (this would provide secure venting). If the sash is then moved from the set venting position, an accelerometer can detect such sash movement and provide information of the occurrence of such event. An accelerometer can also detect impact or jarring of a window or door, which can be the result of a forced entry, an extreme weather condition, or a child trying to open the window. An accelerometer can also detect rotation of a window sash or a door panel. The position change or displacement of a window or a door can also be detected using several other sensing devices in lieu of an accelerometer, such as optical sensors, capacitance sensors, pressure sensors, Hall Effect sensors, encoder wheels, and potentiometers (resistors) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The device of this invention utilizes the hardware components of a window or door as an interface to obtain information. Some examples of hardware components that correspond to specific window types and examples of information that such hardware components can provide include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
