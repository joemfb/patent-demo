<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application 61/006,185, which was filed on 28 Dec. 2007, and which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to lithographic systems, and more particularly to interferometric lithography.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A lithographic apparatus is a machine that applies a desired pattern onto a substrate or part of a substrate. A lithographic apparatus can be used, for example, in the manufacture of flat panel displays, integrated circuits (ICs) and other devices involving fine structures. In a conventional apparatus, a patterning device, which is commonly referred to as a mask or a reticle, can be used to generate a circuit pattern corresponding to an individual layer of a flat panel display (or other device). This pattern can be transferred onto all or part of the substrate (e.g., a glass plate), by imaging onto a layer of radiation-sensitive material (e.g., photoresist) provided on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Instead of a circuit pattern, the patterning means can be used to generate other patterns, for example a color filter pattern or a matrix of dots. Instead of a mask, the patterning device can comprise a patterning array that comprises an array of individually controllable elements. The pattern can be changed more quickly and for less cost in such a system compared to a mask-based system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A flat panel display substrate is typically rectangular in shape. Lithographic apparatus designed to expose a substrate of this type can provide an exposure region that covers a full width of the rectangular substrate, or covers a portion of the width (for example half of the width). The substrate can be scanned underneath the exposure region, while the mask or reticle is synchronously scanned through a beam. In this way, the pattern is transferred to the substrate. If the exposure region covers the full width of the substrate then exposure can be completed with a single scan. If the exposure region covers, for example, half of the width of the substrate, then the substrate can be moved transversely after the first scan, and a further scan is typically performed to expose the remainder of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Resolution achieved by the overall semiconductor manufacturing process depends not only on the optics involved, but also on the chemical processes employed (e.g., interactions between the photoresist and the etching chemicals, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When resolutions reach nanometer scale, such as 30-100 nm, it is very difficult to use conventional masks, reticles, and patterning arrays to accomplish this. The current resolution limit of lens-based systems is approximately 45 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the wavelength of light used in a lithographic system decreases, the resolution typically improves. For example, some lithographic systems are implemented using light in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range. However, many of these systems suffer from poor numerical apertures, for example on the order of 0.25, that limit the resolution of these systems, for example, on the order of 26 nm line/space (L/S).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, what is needed is an EUV lithography system and method that does not have a limited numerical aperture and allows for high resolution patterning.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a first embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method to write patterns onto a substrate comprising the following steps. First and second beams of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation are produced. An exposure unit is used to project the first and second beams of EUV radiation onto a substrate. The first and second beams of radiation interfere with each other to expose a first set of parallel lines at an exposure field of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In alternative examples, the substrate is moved relative to the first and second beams during writing of the image onto the substrate or remains stationary during writing.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another embodiment of the present invention provides first and second exposure systems. The first exposure system is used for writing a pattern onto a substrate and is configured to receive a first beam of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation and direct the first beam onto an exposure field on a substrate. The second exposure system is configured to receive a second beam of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation and direct the second beam onto the exposure field on the substrate. The first exposure system includes a first beam width adjusting system and the second exposure system includes a second beam width adjusting system. The first and second beam width adjusting systems are configured to adjust widths of the first and second beams, respectively, such that respective path lengths of the first and second beams are substantially matched when they reach the exposure field to ensure the first and second beams are substantially mutually spatially and temporally coherent across a full width of the exposure field.</p>

Exemplary conventional Talbot interferometers include U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An interference pattern <b>112</b> is formed at a top surface of substrate <b>110</b>. For example, when used for lithography, interference pattern <b>112</b> exposes a photoresist layer (not labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) with a writing image. For example, first and second beams <b>106</b>A and <b>106</b>B can be projected onto substrate <b>110</b> to interfere to exposure a plurality of lines on substrate <b>110</b>, corresponding to lines of maxima caused by constructive interference between the beams of radiation <b>106</b>A and <b>106</b>B, separated by minima caused by destructive interference between the two beams of radiation <b>106</b>A and <b>106</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is to be appreciated that substrate <b>110</b> can be located on a stage or table (not shown) that allows for movement of substrate <b>110</b> with respect to the writing image, e.g., scanning, stepping, or the like, to allow for patterning of an entire surface of substrate <b>110</b>. In another example, substrate <b>110</b> can be stationary during imaging of substrate <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one example, beam splitter <b>104</b> produces only first diffraction order beams as beams <b>106</b>A and <b>106</b>B. In various examples, beam splitter <b>104</b> can be a phase shifting, alternating phase shifting, binary phase shifting, or another type of beam splitter, as would apparent to a skilled artisan upon reading this description.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one example, beam <b>106</b>A has a path length a between beam splitter <b>104</b> and reflecting surface <b>108</b>A, while beam <b>106</b>B has a path length b between beam splitter <b>104</b> and reflecting surface <b>108</b>B. Similarly, beam <b>106</b>A has a path length c between reflecting surface <b>108</b>A and substrate <b>110</b>, while beam <b>106</b>B has a path length d between reflecting surface <b>108</b>B and substrate <b>110</b>. In the example shown, Talbot interferometer <b>100</b> is generally referred to as a substantially symmetrical system because a+c=b+d, which produces substantially uniform fringes <b>112</b> across an exposure field <b>114</b>, which is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one example, coherent radiation <b>102</b> is produced by an illuminator (not shown) that receives a radiation beam from a radiation source (not shown). In one example, the radiation source can provide radiation having a wavelength of at least 5 nm, e.g., at least 10 nm, at least 13 nm, at least 50 nm, at least 100 nm, at least 150 nm, at least 175 nm, at least 200 nm, at least 250 nm, at least 275 nm, at least 300 nm, at least 325 nm, at least 350 nm, or at least 360 nm. In one example, the radiation provided by the radiation source has a wavelength of at most 450 nm, e.g., at most 425 nm, at most 375 nm, at most 360 nm, at most 325 nm, at most 275 nm, at most 250 nm, at most 225 nm, at most 200 nm, or at most 175 nm. In one example, the radiation has a wavelength including 436 nm, 405 nm, 365 nm, 355 nm, 248 nm, 193 nm, 157 nm, and/or 126 nm. In one example, the radiation includes a wavelength of around 365 nm or around 355 nm. In one example, the radiation includes a broad band of wavelengths, for example encompassing 365, 405, and 436 nm. A 355 nm laser source could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The source and the lithographic apparatus can be separate units or subsystems, for example when the source is an excimer laser. In such cases, the source is not considered to form part of the lithographic apparatus and the radiation beam is passed from the source to an illuminator with the aid of a beam delivery system comprising, for example, suitable directing mirrors and/or a beam expander.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another interferometric lithographic system <b>200</b>. A spatially and temporally coherent light beam <b>202</b> is incident on a beam splitter <b>204</b>. In one example, beam <b>202</b> can be formed from a similar illumination and/or radiation system as described above for beam <b>102</b>. Beam splitter <b>204</b> separates the beam <b>202</b> into first and second beams <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B. In one example, beam splitter <b>204</b> produces only first diffraction order beams as beams <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B. The two beams <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B are then redirected by first and second reflecting surfaces <b>208</b>A and <b>208</b>B, respectively, towards a substrate <b>210</b>. An interference pattern <b>212</b> is formed at a top surface of substrate <b>210</b>. Again, in a lithographic example, the interference pattern <b>212</b> exposes a photoresist layer (not labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) across an exposure field <b>214</b>. Beams <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B and substrate <b>210</b> can be moved with respect to each other, as described above, or remain stationary.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Reflecting surfaces <b>208</b>A and <b>208</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are oriented in positions that allow for a larger angle of incidence on substrate <b>210</b>, as compared to the orientation of reflecting surfaces <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The larger angle of incidence allows for an increased resolution in patterns formed on substrate <b>210</b> by fringes <b>212</b> as compared to patterns formed on substrate <b>110</b> by fringes <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one example, beam <b>206</b>A has a path length a between beam splitter <b>204</b> and reflecting surface <b>208</b>A, while beam <b>206</b>B has a path length b between beam splitter <b>204</b> and reflecting surface <b>208</b>B. Similarly, beam <b>206</b>A has a path length c between reflecting surface <b>208</b>A and substrate <b>210</b>, while beam <b>206</b>B has a path length d between reflecting surface <b>208</b>B and substrate <b>210</b>. In the example shown, the interferometer <b>200</b> may be referred to as a non-symmetrical system because a+c&#x2260;b+d, which may produce substantially non-uniform fringe pattern <b>212</b> across an exposure field <b>214</b>, which is undesirable. For example, although interference fringes are well formed and high contrast at a center position <b>216</b>, moving away from center position <b>216</b> in either direction causes a differential in beam path length and an image contrast value due to loss of temporal coherence in beams <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B. Beams <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B do not properly interfere across their entire width, only at the center <b>216</b> of the exposure field <b>214</b>. Thus, at high resolutions in an interference fringes <b>212</b> across field <b>214</b> producing the image may not be of consistent contrast, i.e., there is a maximum contrast ratio at center <b>216</b> of exposure field <b>214</b>. Therefore, only part of fringes <b>212</b> may produce an optimum image.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Since the interferometer <b>200</b> is a non-symmetrical system, there can be a problem with coherency matching over the full width of exposure field <b>214</b>. There are two types of coherence that are typically of concern for this type of imaging: (1) spatial coherence (i.e., space/position based) and (2) temporal coherence (i.e., time based), which are discussed in more detail below. In general, the concept of coherence is related to the stability, or predictability, of phase. Rays at substrate position emulate from the same position on the beam splitter <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Spatial coherence describes the correlation between light beams at different points in space. Spatial coherence is described as a function of distance, i.e., spatial coherence is the maintenance of a fixed-phase relationship across the full diameter of a cross section of a beam.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Temporal coherence describes the correlation or predictable relationship between light beams observed at different moments in time. In optics, temporal coherence is measured by combining beams from the same source, but having a known path length difference, and observing the interference pattern produced. In one example, a temporal coherence length is calculated by dividing a wavelength squared by the bandwidth of the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one example, coherency matching (temporal coherence) can become mismatched because the beam angles at beam splitter <b>204</b> are not the same as at the angles at substrate <b>210</b>, which results in the non-symmetrical path lengths (e.g., a+c&#x2260;b+d). For example, the angles are the same for Talbot interferometer <b>100</b> based on the fact it has fully symmetric path lengths. This results in fringes <b>112</b> from the two interfering laser beams <b>106</b>A and <b>106</b>B being equal at all points across the exposure field <b>114</b>. However, the angles are not the same for Talbot interferometer <b>200</b> based on the fact Talbot interferometer <b>200</b> does not have fully symmetric path lengths for the two interfering beams <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B. This can result in fringe contrasts differing by an increasing amount as beams <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B are displaced from center <b>216</b> of field <b>214</b>. In one example, cases of very high resolution imaging may only be able to utilize the central band in the middle <b>216</b> of field <b>214</b> for imaging, which decreases the size of an allowable portion of field <b>214</b> for imaging, decreasing throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To equalize path lengths in interferometric lithographic system <b>200</b>, beam width adjusting systems <b>218</b>A and <b>218</b>B may be inserted in paths a and b, respectively. Beam width adjusting systems <b>218</b>A and <b>218</b>B are configured to adjust the beam widths of beams <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B, respectively, such that the path lengths of the beams <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B are matched when they reach exposure field <b>214</b> to ensure that beams <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B are mutually spatially and temporally coherent across a full width of exposure field <b>214</b>. For more information regarding beam width adjusting systems <b>218</b>A and <b>218</b>B, please see, for example, U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2007/0153250, entitled &#x201c;Interferometric Lithography System and Method Used To Generate Equal Path Lengths Of Interfering Beams,&#x201d; filed Dec. 29, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Interferometric lithographic systems <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> are primarily lens based systems and therefore may not be optimal for printing patterns on substrate when extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation is used to expose a substrate or workpiece. Furthermore, lithographic systems that do use EUV radiation have limited numerical apertures (e.g., approximately between 0.25-0.4 without suffering from obscuration effects) that limit their resolution (e.g., approximately 26 nm lines/space (L/S)). Moreover, these EUV systems are also limited by the number of mirrors used. Since mirrors are often not highly efficient (e.g., efficiencies of approximately 66%), as the number of mirrors in the system increases, performance decreases severely.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an interferometer <b>300</b> that includes a beam splitter <b>304</b>, concave mirrors <b>308</b>A and <b>308</b>B, convex mirrors <b>310</b>A and <b>310</b>B, and flat mirrors <b>312</b>A and <b>312</b>B. For example, optical elements <b>308</b>A, <b>310</b>A, and <b>312</b>A can be a first exposure system, and optical elements <b>308</b>B, <b>310</b>B, and <b>312</b>B can be a second exposure system. Mirrors <b>308</b>A-<b>312</b>A and <b>308</b>B-<b>312</b>B may be formed on a low-expansion glass that prevents expansion due to heat generated by incident radiation and may be formed out of alternating layers of molybdenum and silicon. In an embodiment, such mirrors have an efficiency of approximately 66%. A coherent beam of EUV <b>302</b> radiation is incident on a beam splitter <b>304</b>. Beam <b>302</b> may be generated by a synchratron or conventional plasma source, such as laser oblation or High Energy Electrical Discharge. Beam splitter <b>304</b> splits beam of EUV radiation <b>302</b> into first beam <b>306</b>A and second beam <b>306</b>B. First beam <b>306</b>A is reflected by concave mirror <b>308</b>A and convex mirror <b>310</b>A onto flat mirror <b>312</b>A, which directs beam <b>306</b>A onto a substrate <b>301</b>. Similarly, second beam <b>306</b>B is reflected by concave mirror <b>308</b>B and convex mirror <b>310</b>B onto flat mirror <b>312</b>B, which directs beam <b>306</b>B onto substrate <b>301</b>. In an embodiment, substrate <b>301</b> is substantially similar to substrate <b>110</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or substrate <b>210</b> discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Substrate <b>301</b> is normally positioned in a focal plane of interferometer <b>300</b>, and an interference pattern <b>303</b> is formed at a top surface of substrate <b>301</b>. In a lithographic example, interference pattern <b>303</b> exposes a photoresist layer (not labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) across an exposure field <b>305</b>. Again, it is to be appreciated that substrate <b>301</b> can be located on a stage, table, or the like (not shown) that allows for movement of substrate <b>301</b> with respect to the writing image to allow for patterning of an entire surface of substrate <b>301</b> using different techniques, as would be apparent to a skilled artisan upon reading and understanding this description. Alternatively, substrate <b>301</b> can remain stationary.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, interferometer <b>300</b> is a reflection based or mirror based system.

Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, beam <b>302</b> is incident on a surface <b>304</b><i>a </i>of beam splitter <b>304</b> that faces substrate <b>301</b> instead of the surface that faces away from substrate <b>301</b>, as in systems <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>. To allow for beam <b>302</b> to be incident on surface <b>304</b><i>a </i>of beam splitter <b>304</b> without interfering with substrate <b>301</b> and/or elements of interferometer <b>300</b>, beam <b>302</b> is incident on beam splitter <b>304</b> at an angle not parallel to a plane that includes a normal vector of substrate <b>301</b> (not shown). In other words, beam <b>302</b> is not parallel to the plane of the sheet of paper that shows <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This allows beam <b>302</b> to avoid interaction with substrate <b>301</b> and elements of interferometer <b>300</b>, while still being incident on surface <b>304</b><i>a </i>of beam splitter <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an embodiment, beam <b>302</b> is incident on the plane that includes the normal vector of substrate <b>301</b> at an angle of approximately 6 degrees.</p>

However, in contrast to beam width adjusting systems <b>218</b>A and <b>218</b>B that are lens based systems, the beam width adjusting systems formed by mirrors <b>308</b>A, <b>308</b>B, <b>310</b>A, <b>310</b>B are mirror based systems so that they can accommodate EUV radiation. Thus, interferometer <b>300</b> includes first and second exposure systems that include the first and second beam width adjusting systems, respectively, and flat mirrors <b>312</b>A and <b>312</b>B, respectively.</p>

The value of M is determined by the respective curvatures of mirrors <b>308</b>A, <b>308</b>B, <b>310</b>A, <b>310</b>B. In an embodiment, the curvatures of mirrors <b>308</b>A, <b>308</b>B, <b>310</b>A, and <b>310</b>B are chosen such that respective path lengths of beams <b>306</b>A and <b>306</b>B are substantially equal when they reach exposure field <b>305</b> to ensure beams <b>306</b>A and <b>306</b>B are mutually spatially and temporally coherent across a full width of exposure field <b>305</b>. Beam <b>306</b>A has a length a between beam splitter <b>304</b> and concave mirror <b>308</b>A, a length a&#x2032; from concave mirror <b>308</b>A to convex mirror <b>310</b>A, a length a&#x2033; between convex mirror <b>310</b>A and flat mirror <b>312</b>A, and a length c between flat mirror <b>312</b>A and substrate <b>301</b>.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, interferometer <b>300</b> may optionally include a dynamic beam width adjustment through use of actuators <b>318</b>, <b>320</b>, and <b>322</b> coupled to concave mirror <b>308</b>A, convex mirror <b>310</b>A, and flat mirror <b>312</b>A, respectively, and a controller <b>316</b>. Controller <b>316</b> is coupled to a detector <b>314</b>. Detector <b>314</b> is configured to sense the contrast of the fringes of interference pattern <b>303</b> formed on substrate <b>301</b>, and produce a signal indicative of the sensed contrast. Controller <b>316</b> receives signal generated by detector <b>314</b> and generates a control signal indicative of an adjustment of a position and/or orientation of concave mirror <b>308</b>A and/or convex mirror <b>310</b>A that will increase the contrast of the fringes of interference pattern <b>303</b>. Actuators <b>318</b> and <b>320</b> receive control signal and adjust the position, shape, and/or orientation of concave mirror <b>308</b>A and/or convex mirror <b>310</b>A, respectively. For example, concave mirror <b>308</b>A and/or convex mirror <b>310</b>A can be deformable mirrors, as is known in the art. For example, controller <b>316</b> may determine that the contrast of the fringes of interference pattern <b>303</b> can be increased by moving concave mirror <b>308</b>A by a determined distance or deforming concave mirror <b>308</b>A by a predetermined amount. In such an embodiment, controller <b>316</b> generates a corresponding control signal that is received by actuator <b>318</b>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A pitch of features (e.g., lines) formed on substrate <b>301</b> at least partially depends on an angle &#x3b8; of flat mirror <b>312</b>A.

Specifically, controller <b>316</b> may be configured to generate a third control signal that is received by actuators <b>318</b> and <b>320</b>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Interferometer <b>300</b> also optionally includes a trimming aperture <b>326</b>. Trimming aperture <b>326</b> is configured to block a portion of beams <b>306</b>A and <b>306</b>B from exposing substrate <b>301</b>. In a further embodiment, trimming aperture <b>326</b> is configured block scattered radiation from exposing substrate <b>301</b>. Scattered radiation, if not blocked, may expose generally random portions of substrate <b>301</b> and degrade the resolution of the image formed by interferometer <b>300</b> on substrate <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Additionally, or alternatively, interferometer <b>300</b> can be used to perform grid based lithography, discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C. In grid based lithography, once a first set of parallel lines are exposed, substrate <b>301</b> can then be rotated by 90 degrees and a second set of parallel lines can be exposed. The second set of lines are substantially perpendicular to the first set of parallel lines. Thus, by printing two sets of parallel lines perpendicular to each other, a grid can be formed. The grid can then be trimmed into a desired pattern through additional exposures. Grid based lithography, then, allows for utilization of a device (e.g., interferometer <b>300</b>) that has a relatively high numerical aperture (e.g., approximately 0.9 compared to approximately 0.4 for other EUV systems) and that can form very fine parallel lines (e.g., 4 nm (L/S) with EUV radiation that has a wavelength of approximately 13 nm) to be used as the basis for creating fine patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, interferometer <b>300</b> can increase illumination efficiency by only having three mirrors in each beam path, as opposed to other EUV lithography systems that may include six or more mirrors in each beam path. The increase in illumination efficiency is because, as described above, mirrors typically are inefficient, thus using only three mirrors represents a substantial improvement over existing EUV systems.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a top view of slit <b>324</b> configured to receive beams <b>306</b>A and <b>306</b>B, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Beams <b>306</b>A and <b>306</b>B pass through slit <b>324</b> so that they are used to expose parallel lines on substrate <b>301</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, slit <b>324</b> is substantially rectangular. Thus, by exposing slit <b>324</b>, one or more rectangles are formed on substrate <b>301</b>. An actuator <b>402</b> coupled to a stage <b>404</b> is configured to move substrate <b>301</b> relative to interfering beams <b>306</b>A and <b>306</b>B so that one or more lines are formed. In such a manner, a group of parallel lines can be exposed on substrate <b>301</b>. Moreover, actuator <b>402</b> and stage <b>404</b> may also be configured to rotate substrate <b>301</b> so that another set of parallel lines can be exposed that are substantially perpendicular to an initial set of parallel lines, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref> discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Additionally, or alternatively, double patterning can be performed using the systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Through double patterning, actuator <b>402</b> and stage <b>404</b> may also be configured to move substrate <b>301</b> such that a second group of parallel lines are formed after the originally formed parallel lines. The second group of parallel lines may be formed between the first group of parallel lines. In an embodiment, such a double patterning may double the resolution of an exposure apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another embodiment, a group of parallel lines may be trimmed to form a set of desired features on a substrate (not shown). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</figref>, B, and C illustrate example processing steps to form a trimmed exposure, according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, parallel lines <b>500</b> are formed on the substrate. In an embodiment, interferometer <b>300</b>, described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, can be used to form parallel lines <b>500</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, regions <b>502</b><i>a </i>and <b>502</b><i>b </i>are selected as being the features desired in a final pattern. Regions <b>502</b><i>a </i>and <b>502</b><i>b </i>are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> to be substantially rectangular. However, as would be apparent to the skilled artisan, regions of different types of shapes can be selected. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, regions outside of selected regions <b>502</b><i>a </i>and <b>502</b><i>b </i>are then exposed, leaving only selected regions <b>502</b><i>a </i>and <b>502</b><i>b </i>remaining in a final pattern <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In grid-based lithography, a grid is formed on a substrate (not shown) and specific patterns are then formed from the grid. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, B, and C show exemplary processing steps for grid based lithography, according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows parallel lines <b>500</b> formed on the substrate. As described above, parallel lines <b>500</b> may be formed by interferometer <b>300</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the substrate is then rotated 90 degrees relative to the exposure apparatus and a second set of parallel lines <b>602</b> are formed to form a grid <b>604</b>. The lines of the second set of parallel lines are substantially perpendicular to parallel lines <b>500</b>. A region is then selected from grid <b>604</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, similar to the trimming described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, regions outside of selected region are then exposed. Moreover, regions within the selected region may also exposed. For example, the selected region may include portions of adjacent columns <b>606</b><i>a </i>and <b>606</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). To form a pattern <b>610</b> that includes columns <b>608</b><i>a </i>and <b>608</b><i>b </i>separated by spaces, column <b>606</b><i>a </i>and other similar columns (e.g., alternating columns) may also be exposed. Such a procedure is applied to the rest of the columns of the selected region to finally form pattern <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an embodiment, pattern <b>610</b> can be used to form a memory cell. In alternate embodiments, similar design steps, i.e., creating a grid by exposing perpendicular sets of lines and trimming the resulting grid, can also be used to implement other structures such as NAND and other logic components as well as Stacked Memory technology.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Exemplary Operation</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a flowchart depicting a method <b>700</b>. For example, a method of writing patterns onto a substrate using an interference lithography tool in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In block <b>702</b>, first and second beams of EUV radiation are produced. In block <b>704</b>, the first and second beams are projected on to a substrate. The first and second beams interfere such that a set of parallel lines are exposed at an exposure field of the substrate. In optional block <b>706</b>, the substrate is moved with respect to the exposure unit. In optional block <b>708</b>, third and fourth beams of EUV radiation are projected onto the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an embodiment, optional blocks <b>706</b> and <b>708</b> represent a second exposure of the substrate. For example, after a set of parallel lines is formed from the first and second beams, the substrate may be moved and exposed again such that a second set of parallel lines is formed. For example, the substrate may be moved such that the second set of parallel lines are formed between respective ones of the first set of parallel lines. Additionally or alternatively, the substrate may be rotated such that another set of parallel lines are formed that are substantially perpendicular to the first set of parallel lines (e.g., by rotating the substrate by substantially 90 degrees).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In optional block <b>710</b>, the exposed pattern is further trimmed to form a desired pattern. In a further embodiment, intersecting first and second sets of parallel lines may be used, through further trimming, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to form a grid that can be used as the basis for features formed on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the embodiments described above, the substrate is moved relative to the exposure apparatus. As would be apparent to a skilled artisan, the exposure apparatus can be additionally or alternatively moved relative to the substrate to create the patterns described above, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although embodiments described above have made specific reference to EUV radiation, other types of radiation may also be used. For example, interferometer <b>300</b> may also use X-ray radiation. In such an embodiment, beam <b>302</b> may be an X-ray radiation beam rather than an EUV radiation beam.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although specific reference can be made in this text to the use of lithographic apparatus in the manufacture of a specific device (e.g., an integrated circuit or a flat panel display), it should be understood that the lithographic apparatus described herein can have other applications. Applications include, but are not limited to, the manufacture of integrated circuits, integrated optical systems, guidance and detection patterns for magnetic domain memories, flat-panel displays, liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), thin-film magnetic heads, micro-electromechanical devices (MEMS), light emitting diodes (LEDs), etc. Also, for instance in a flat panel display, the present apparatus can be used to assist in the creation of a variety of layers, e.g. a thin film transistor layer and/or a color filter layer.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Although specific reference can have been made above to the use of embodiments of the invention in the context of optical lithography, it will be appreciated that the invention can be used in other applications, for example immersion lithography. The lithographic apparatus can also be of a type wherein at least a portion of the substrate can be covered by an &#x201c;immersion liquid&#x201d; having a relatively high refractive index, e.g., water, so as to fill a space between the projection system and the substrate. An immersion liquid can also be applied to other spaces in the lithographic apparatus, for example, between the patterning device and the projection system. Immersion techniques are well known in the art for increasing the numerical aperture of projection systems. The term &#x201c;immersion&#x201d; as used herein does not mean that a structure, such as a substrate, must be submerged in liquid, but rather only means that liquid is located between the projection system and the substrate during exposure.</p>
