<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A sand separator for capturing sand and rock debris from recovered natural gas fracturing fluid includes a cylindrical, high-pressure-rated vessel disposed vertically and immediately downstream of the gas wellhead. High pressure fracturing fluid enters the top of the separator into an inner flue extending coaxially downward to terminate a spaced distance above the bottom of the vessel. Transverse baffles spaced apart along the length of the flue extend through the flue to the inner walls of the vessel to keep the flue centered within the separator. As the fluid enters the separator, openings through the flue near the vessel inlet permit lighter weight and gaseous constituents to escape the fluid and bypass the flue, thereby reducing the velocity of the fluid remaining inside the flue. As the remaining fluid falls to the bottom of the vessel, it further slows as it reverses direction to rise between the flue and the vessel walls. At the bottom of the vessel, sand and rock debris precipitates out of the slowed fluid and accumulates above a clean-out valve by which the debris periodically may be removed. The gas and fluid recombine relatively free of sand and rock debris and exit the vessel at one or more outlet ports through the vessel walls. The sand separator functions in both exploration and production wells for both petroleum and natural gas.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to petroleum and natural gas and oil wells, and particularly to wellhead site equipment. More particularly, this invention relates to a sand separator installed at the wellhead upstream of other surface equipment for separating sand and rock debris from well effluent fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Exploration for methane, or natural gas, involves injection of high-pressure fluids (mostly water with sand) directly into underground rock formations expected to yield natural gas, a process commonly referred to as &#x201c;hydraulic fracturing.&#x201d; The water pressure fractures the rock strata, whereupon entrapped natural gas escapes into the well bore to be captured at the surface and piped to market. Hydraulic fracturing fluid is recovered from the exploration wells and disposed of, usually by hauling it off in trucks to a remote disposal site.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Fracturing fluid contains a considerable amount of fracturing sand. The sand lodges in the cracks created by fracturing and holds open the cracks to maximize escape of natural gas from the strata. The sand also scours the formation to clean and etch it for maximum gas delivery. Sand included in fracturing fluid doesn't all lodge in the formation, however, and some returns to the surface in what is called the &#x201c;flowback&#x201d; from the well. During flowback, the well disgorges the fracturing fluid under pressure from the escaping natural gas. The flowback fracturing fluid includes a significant quantity of the injected sand, as well as granular rock debris flushed from the rock strata by the fracturing and flowback stages. Such sand and debris can wreak havoc upon choke valves that reduce the return fluid pressure and velocity downstream of the wellhead, and upon relatively sensitive surface testing, metering and processing equipment. A need exists for means for eliminating sand and rock debris from returned hydraulic fracturing fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Production wells likewise need protection from fracturing sand and granular rock debris. Natural gas from producing wells comprises not only gaseous methane, but myriad other liquid byproducts, some of which are valuable (e.g. petroleum and natural gas distillates) and others of which are waste (e.g. stratigraphic saline and residual fracturing fluid), both of which may include significant quantities of sand. Surface equipment adapted for segregating well byproducts and for metering output from producing wells is vulnerable to damage from such debris. A need exists for means for separating solid materials such a sand and rock granules from producing well effluents.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A sand separator for capturing sand and rock debris from recovered natural gas fracturing fluid includes a cylindrical, high-pressure-rated vessel disposed vertically and immediately downstream of the gas wellhead. High pressure fracturing fluid enters the top of the separator into an inner flue extending coaxially downward to terminate a spaced distance above the bottom of the vessel. Transverse baffles spaced apart along the length of the flue extend through the flue to the inner walls of the vessel to keep the flue centered within the separator. As the fluid enters the separator, openings through the flue near the vessel inlet permit lighter weight and gaseous constituents to escape the fluid and bypass the flue, thereby reducing the velocity of the fluid remaining inside the flue. As the remaining fluid falls to the bottom of the vessel, it further slows as it reverses direction to rise between the flue and the vessel walls. At the bottom of the vessel, sand and rock debris precipitates out of the slowed fluid and accumulates above a clean-out valve by which the debris periodically may be removed. The gas and fluid recombine relatively free of sand and rock debris and exit the vessel at one or more outlet ports through the vessel walls. The sand separator functions in both exploration and production wells for both petroleum and natural gas.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the present invention comprises sand separator <b>30</b> installed at a natural gas well downstream from wellhead <b>10</b> and upstream from choke valve manifold <b>13</b> and other well site equipment <b>17</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>. Sand separator <b>30</b> traps and separates sand and rock debris <b>5</b> within a stream of gaseous <b>1</b> and liquid <b>3</b> fluids effluent from wellhead <b>10</b>. See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>. Under high pressure, gas <b>1</b> effectively is dissolved in water <b>3</b>, and the fluid F leaving wellhead <b>10</b> moves under such high pressure and velocity that solids <b>5</b> remain substantially uniformly suspended in water <b>3</b>. The unsurprising effect (absent sand separator <b>30</b>) is to erode and damage relatively sensitive wellhead equipment, including choke valve manifold <b>13</b> adapted to reduce the velocity and pressure of the fluid before entering other equipment <b>17</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>. NOTE: hereinafter, the term &#x201c;fluid F&#x201d; will be used primarily to refer to hydraulic fracturing fluid, which, at various stages, may include varying amounts of dissolved or suspended natural gas <b>1</b>, oil or other liquids (not shown), as well as suspended sand and/or rock debris <b>5</b>. One having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the majority of fluid F comprises water <b>3</b>, and that all such variations of fluid F are contemplated to be found within the present invention's operating environment. Where useful hereinafter, the term fluid F also may be used herein to refer to water <b>3</b>, in contradistinction to its dissolved and/or suspended constituents, particularly where such constituents are present, if at all, in comparatively small amounts. Such usage will be apparent from the context.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Wellhead <b>10</b> comprises a &#x201c;tree&#x201d; of valves <b>11</b> coupled to the well bore casing (not shown) such that wellhead <b>10</b> may contain and regulate flow from the well, during both exploration and production. Valves <b>11</b> may cap (shut-in) the well altogether, and they serve to route well effluent fluid F to a plurality of surface equipment installations such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. One having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> are schematic in nature and not intended to represent a complete well site installation nor dimensional reality. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, choke valve manifold <b>13</b> feeds sand separator <b>30</b> effluent into low-pressure testing and separating equipment <b>17</b> where fracturing fluid F is recovered and collected in mobile tank <b>18</b> for off-site disposal. Flare stack <b>16</b> is provided to burn off into the atmosphere waste natural gas <b>1</b> separated from fluid F in test separator <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Where natural gas <b>1</b> is not a waste product but a primary production commodity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), it is not flared, but instead forwarded through metering equipment <b>23</b> into collector lines <b>25</b> and on to market. Liquid condensates from gas <b>1</b> are captured in production separator <b>21</b> and stored in tank <b>27</b> for later removal and transportation to market (not shown). One having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that fluid F captured in production separator <b>21</b> will contain substantially less of the residual fracturing water <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and more desirable, non-waste liquids like petroleum and natural gas distillates, and that fluid F at this stage is intended to mean any such liquid byproducts having productive value, rather than waste products, as with separator <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Disposed between wellhead <b>10</b> and separators <b>17</b>, <b>21</b>, sand separator <b>30</b> removes solid materials <b>5</b> from the wellhead <b>10</b> effluent. Sand separator <b>30</b> comprises high pressure vessel <b>31</b> having a tubular body, or cylinder <b>32</b>C, capped at both ends by upper and lower domed end caps <b>32</b>U, <b>32</b>L. Vessel <b>31</b> is constructed of materials and by processes, as discussed in detail below, that render vessel <b>31</b> capable of withstanding high pressures directly from wellhead <b>10</b>, without requiring any intermediate velocity or pressure reducing equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Sand separator <b>30</b> stands vertically erect to rely upon gravity for operation, as discussed in more detail below. Piping <b>15</b> from wellhead <b>10</b> couples to inlet <b>33</b> atop upper end cap <b>32</b>U. Sand and other solid debris <b>5</b> removed from fluid F accumulates at the bottom of vessel <b>31</b> above end cap <b>32</b>L and periodically may be removed from vessel <b>31</b> through sand outlet <b>36</b>. The remaining fluid F, comprising almost entirely natural gas <b>1</b> and water <b>3</b>, exits sand separator <b>30</b> at fluid outlet <b>35</b> where it proceeds through velocity-reducing choke valve manifold <b>13</b> and onward to test separator <b>17</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>) or production separator <b>21</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Outlet <b>36</b> provided at the bottom of end cap <b>32</b>L permits periodic removal for disposal of precipitated sand <b>5</b> accumulating atop lower end cap <b>32</b>L. Such sand <b>5</b> accumulation actually comprises a relatively viscous but fluid sand/water slurry, substantially under wellhead pressure within vessel <b>31</b>. Opening outlet <b>36</b> allows it first to pass through choke valve <b>13</b> to reduce its pressure and velocity and then through control valve <b>14</b> to a disposal site. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, sand <b>5</b> is merely routed into mobile tank <b>18</b> for disposal along with recovered fracturing fluid F. In the alternate system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plastic-lined pit <b>19</b> is provided at the well site for discarding sand <b>5</b>. One having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that all such methods of disposal of sand <b>5</b> and water <b>3</b> are contemplated by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Turning now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>, sand separator <b>30</b> further includes flue <b>40</b> depending coaxially inside vessel <b>31</b> from upper end cap <b>32</b>U at inlet <b>33</b> and extending downward toward lower end cap <b>32</b>L. Transverse baffles <b>42</b> disposed diametrically across its length a spaced distance above flue outlet <b>43</b> serve two purposes. First, they provide dimensional stability for flue <b>40</b>, keeping it positioned coaxial with vessel <b>31</b> despite buffeting from the torrent of high pressure wellhead effluent fluid F. Second, since baffles <b>43</b> are disposed across the path of fluid F, they further slow it in its descent from inlet <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Flue <b>40</b> couples to upper end cap <b>32</b> surrounding inlet <b>33</b>, from which nozzle, or downcomer <b>44</b> focuses wellhead <b>10</b> effluent fluid F into a longitudinally directed, high-velocity stream. Downcomer <b>44</b> prevents fluid F from spraying widely enough from inlet <b>33</b> to enter gas ports <b>45</b> arrayed around the perimeter of flue <b>40</b> near inlet <b>33</b> and above the lower end of downcomer <b>44</b>. Gas ports <b>45</b> permit gas <b>1</b> to escape fluid F without passing through flue outlet <b>43</b> with the rest of fluid F, but instead to bypass flue outlet <b>35</b> and to exit flue <b>40</b> separately into the region of vessel <b>31</b> outside flue <b>40</b> and above fluid outlet <b>35</b>. By letting gas <b>1</b> escape fluid F in this manner, separator <b>30</b> substantially reduces the velocity of fluid F as it proceeds downward within flue <b>40</b>, thereby maximizing precipitation of sand <b>5</b> from fluid F, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The length of flue <b>40</b> and the consequent location of flue outlet <b>43</b> relative to fluid outlet <b>35</b> is selected to optimize operation of sand separator <b>30</b>. Fluid F slows as it exits flue <b>40</b> at flue outlet <b>43</b> and then rises between the interior walls of vessel <b>31</b> and the outside of flue <b>40</b>, hydraulically equalizing with its level inside flue <b>40</b> substantially at the elevation of fluid outlet <b>35</b>. Depending upon the through-put volume and flow rate, a preferred head of fluid F above flue outlet <b>43</b> is needed. One having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that this dimension can vary with the size and application of sand separator <b>30</b>, as well as the wellhead fluid F velocity. Preferably, flue outlet <b>43</b> is disposed beneath fluid outlet <b>35</b> approximately seventy (70%) percent of the overall height (distance between upper and lower end caps <b>32</b>U, <b>32</b>L) of cylinder <b>32</b>C, but no less than eighteen (18 in.) inches above lower end cap <b>32</b>L.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">There being very little or no pressure differential across the walls of flue <b>40</b>, it comprises a cylindrical, carbon or stainless, steel tube having a wall thickness adapted to contain the high velocity of fluid F without substantial deformation. Preferably, flue <b>40</b> has an ASTM Schedule 20 to Schedule 80, and preferably Schedule 40, wall thickness. The diameter of flue <b>40</b> is chosen to fall between 35% and 45%, and preferably 40%, of the inside diameter of cylinder <b>32</b>C. Gas ports <b>45</b> through flue <b>40</b> preferably are round and of sufficient number and area to equal the cross section of flue <b>40</b>. One having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any shape of gas ports <b>45</b> will function satisfactorily as long as the total area of all gas ports <b>45</b> substantially equals or exceeds the cross-sectional area of flue <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Vessel <b>31</b> by contrast must withstand internal operating pressures defined by the shut-in pressure of wellhead <b>10</b>, and must have an internal volume sufficient to accommodate the volume of gas <b>1</b> and fluid F reported for wellhead <b>10</b>. Vessel <b>31</b>, including cylinder <b>32</b>C and end caps <b>32</b>U, <b>32</b>L, is constructed from carbon steel, and end caps <b>32</b>U, <b>32</b>L are welded into place (following ASME standards for code vessels and standard shop practices for non-code vessels) to close the ends of cylinder <b>32</b>C securely against the wellhead <b>10</b> shut-in pressure, thereby creating vessel <b>31</b>. Vessel <b>31</b> typically is approximately eight (8 ft.) feet in length, though one having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the length of vessel <b>31</b> may be shorter or longer as needed. Thus, the diameter and wall thicknesses of vessel <b>31</b> are dictated by the wellhead <b>10</b> shut-in pressure and volumes reported for wellhead <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Depending upon the pressures of the gas field in which wellhead <b>10</b> is located, wellhead <b>10</b> shut-in pressures may range from as little as 1000 psig to as much as 15,000 psig. For example, the hydrostatic pressures experienced during 2010 in the Barnett Shale gas field in and around Fort Worth, Tex., typically fall into the range of 1000-1500 psig, thus defining the pressures sand separator <b>30</b> must endure in the region. Further, gas well pressures may surge from time-to-time substantially above such typical field shut-in pressures. Finally, vessel <b>31</b> also must be capable of the reported volume output of water <b>3</b> and gas <b>1</b> of wellhead <b>10</b> effluent fluid F. Such volumes of the Barnett Shale typically may be as much as 10 million cubic feet (MMCF/da.) of natural gas <b>1</b> per day with a water <b>3</b> content of 2000 barrels (bbls./da.) per day.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">By way of a First Example, for relatively low wellhead <b>10</b> shut-in pressures such as those at the lower end of the ranges given above, vessel <b>31</b> preferably will have cylinder <b>32</b>C and end caps <b>32</b>U, <b>32</b>L having outside diameters of sixteen (16 in.) inches with approximately two to two-and one-half (2 in.-2&#xbd; in.) inches of wall thickness. This provides an internal diameter of vessel <b>31</b> of nine to ten (9 in.-10 in.) inches, resulting in a flue <b>40</b> diameter of approximately three and one-half to four (3&#xbd; in. to 4 in.) inches. For a vessel <b>31</b> eight feet in length, flue <b>40</b> will be approximately five and one-half (5&#xbd; ft.) feet long.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For greater wellhead <b>10</b> shut-in pressures, larger diameter cylinders <b>32</b>C and end caps <b>32</b>U, <b>32</b>L create a trade-off between diameter and wall thickness. As a Second Example, a wellhead <b>10</b> shut-in pressure of 5000 psig dictates that cylinder <b>32</b>C walls must increase in thickness, thereby reducing the internal diameter of vessel <b>31</b> too much for the expected throughput volumes. This requires that its outside diameter of vessel <b>31</b> increase to accommodate thicker walls that can withstand the increased pressure while the internal diameter of vessel <b>31</b> remains sufficiently large for the reported volume throughput of natural gas <b>1</b> and fluid F. Thus, in the Second Example, vessel <b>31</b> having the same throughput as the First Example requires wall thicknesses of three to three and one-half (3 in. to 3&#xbd; in.) inches, requiring an outside diameter at least two to three (2 in. to 3 in.) inches greater than the 16 inches of the First Example. Preferably, a nominal outside diameter of twenty (20 in.) inches thus would be chosen to provide the same throughput volume.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</figref>, <b>5</b>B, rack <b>50</b> supports vessel <b>31</b> for both transportation and installation. Rack <b>50</b> comprises upright skid <b>53</b> from which yokes <b>54</b> extend to embrace the outside diameter of vessel <b>31</b>. At its upper end, skid <b>53</b> may include wheels <b>56</b> adapted to allow it to roll on supporting surfaces (not shown) should it engage such surfaces. This can occur when rack <b>50</b> bearing sand separator <b>30</b> is removed from or being placed onto a trailer during transportation. Disposed at the opposite end of skid <b>53</b> from wheels <b>56</b>, platform <b>51</b> extends perpendicular to skid <b>53</b> to form a base upon which sand separator <b>30</b> may be supported during storage and operation. Struts <b>55</b> extend from a lower portion of vessel <b>31</b> diagonally to the corners of platform <b>51</b> to brace vessel <b>31</b> and to give the equipment dimensional stability. Catwalk <b>52</b> disposed on the upper surface of platform <b>51</b> provides operators (not shown) a solid surface upon which to stand while installing or removing sand separator <b>30</b> at wellhead <b>10</b>. Lifting lugs <b>39</b> disposed longitudinally along the outer surface of vessel <b>31</b> opposite skid <b>53</b> provide locations for manipulating the entire assembly during transportation and storage. Rack <b>50</b> is fabricated from carbon steel components of tubing, channel or beam steel commonly available.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In operation, wellhead <b>10</b> effluent fluid F enters vessel <b>31</b> through inlet <b>33</b> and nozzle <b>44</b>, at substantially unchoked wellhead <b>10</b> pressures and velocity. Though fluid F immediately experiences a release of pressure because of the increased diameter of flue <b>40</b> and vessel <b>31</b> in contrast to piping <b>15</b>, the pressure within vessel <b>31</b> remains much too high for surface equipment <b>13</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>. As it descends within flue <b>40</b>, however, gas <b>1</b> separates from fluid F and rises within flue <b>40</b> toward gas ports <b>45</b>, where it escapes flue <b>40</b> into the surrounding region of vessel <b>31</b> above outlet <b>35</b>. With gas <b>1</b> released from the stream of fluid F now substantially containing only water <b>3</b> and sand <b>5</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>), the velocity of fluid F slows considerably by the time it encounters baffles <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) which further retard it. As fluid F exits flue <b>40</b> at flue outlet <b>43</b>, it slows even further while turning the corner and beginning to rise along the outside of flue <b>40</b> against its own head pressure. One having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that fluid F at this point is primarily water <b>3</b>. Water <b>3</b> rises until it reaches outlet <b>35</b>, where it recombines with gas <b>1</b> and exits vessel <b>31</b> through fluid outlet <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As fluid F, still containing suspended sand <b>5</b>, slows and reverses direction below flue outlet <b>43</b>, sand <b>5</b> precipitates out of fluid F and accumulates atop the inside surface of lower end cap <b>33</b>L. Periodically, an operator opens sand outlet <b>36</b> and permits sand <b>5</b> (sand/water slurry) to flow through choke valve <b>13</b> and control valve <b>14</b> to either mobile tank <b>18</b> or disposal pit <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred and alternate embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, sand separator <b>30</b> may or may not be provided with support rack <b>50</b>, depending upon the particular installation at the well site. Also, though separator <b>30</b> has been discussed above in the context of natural gas exploration and production, it works equally well for petroleum exploration and production. The lighter constituents of fluid F in this context are primarily petroleum, which escapes flue <b>40</b> through ports <b>45</b> as does gas <b>1</b> in the above discussion, and recombines at fluid outlet <b>35</b> with fluid F substantially freed of sand <b>5</b>, as discussed above for natural gas <b>1</b>.</p>
