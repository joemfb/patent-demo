<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition and more particularly relates to an oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition that contains colloidal silica and that has an excellent storage stability. The present invention even more particularly relates to an oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition that contains colloidal silica, that has an excellent storage stability, and that, even without the use of a tin catalyst, is converted into a silicone elastomer through the removal of the water fraction and thereby forms a cured film that exhibits a satisfactory strength, i.e., a satisfactory rubbery elasticity, and a satisfactory adherence to substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Oil-in-water silicone emulsion compositions that through the removal of the water fraction form a water-repellent, stain-resistant, and heat-resistant cured film that exhibits mold releasability and peeling releasability are used in paints, paper coating agents, mold release agents, peeling release agents, fiber treatment agents, cosmetics, and so forth. There has been demand in recent years for an oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition that does not employ a tin catalyst as the curing catalyst, and this has led to the appearance of a composition comprising a hydroxyl-containing diorganosiloxane, a silicone resin, and an aminoxy group-terminated diorganosiloxane (refer to JP 06-073291 A) and a composition provided by the mixing and subsequent emulsification of a hydroxyl-containing diorganosiloxane and, as a crosslinking agent, a compound selected from linear siloxanes that have the aminoxy group in side chain position, cyclic aminoxysiloxanes, aminoxysilanes, and the partial hydrolysis products of the preceding (refer to JP 11-193349 A). However, these compositions have had the problems of an inadequate strength on the part of the cured film and/or an inadequate adherence to substrate by the cured film.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Oil-in-water silicone emulsion compositions that contain colloidal silica have been introduced in order to solve these problems (refer to JP 56-016553 A, JP 59-152972 A, JP 09-165554 A, and JP 10-168393 A).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, based on storage stability considerations, the prior colloidal silica-containing oil-in-water silicone emulsion compositions have contained a polyorganosiloxane whose degree of polymerization has been increased by the emulsion polymerization during emulsion production of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and/or decamethylcyclopentasiloxane using a strong acid or strong base as the polymerization catalyst. A problem with these oil-in-water silicone emulsion compositions has been the presence of large amounts of siloxane oligomers, e.g., octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, and so forth, in the final product. This problem is due to the simultaneous occurrence of siloxane bond cleavage reactions during the emulsion polymerization with the production of new low molecular weight polyorganosiloxanes. Due to the volatility of siloxane oligomers such as octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, and so forth, these oil-in-water silicone emulsions have had the problem of not being usable depending on the particular application.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0012">An object of the present invention is to provide an oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition that has an excellent storage stability, that contains little volatile siloxane oligomer, and that, through the removal of the water fraction and even without the use of a tin catalyst, is able to form a cured film that exhibits rubbery elasticity and a satisfactory adherence to substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0013">The oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition of the present invention characteristically comprises (A) 100 mass parts of a polyorganosiloxane that contains in each molecule at least two silicon-bonded hydroxyl or hydrolyzable groups, (B) 0.1 to 200 mass parts of a colloidal silica, (C) 1 to 100 mass parts of an ionic emulsifying agent, (D) 0.1 to 50 mass parts of a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer-type nonionic emulsifying agent, and (E) 10 to 200 mass parts water. The total content of siloxane oligomers comprising 4 to 5 siloxane units in the oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition of the present invention is preferably not more than 2%.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0014">The aforementioned component (A) polyorganosiloxane is preferably a diorganopolysiloxane endblocked at both molecular chain terminals by the hydroxyl group and more preferably has a viscosity at 25&#xb0; C. from 50 mPa&#xb7;s to 2,000,000 mPa&#xb7;s.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0015">The oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition of the present invention preferably additionally incorporates, as a component (F), 0.1 to 50 mass parts of an alkoxysilane or alkoxyalkoxysilane represented by R<sub>a</sub>SiX<sub>4-a </sub>wherein R is an unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbyl group or a substituted monovalent hydrocarbyl group, X is an alkoxy group or an alkoxyalkoxy group, and a is 0, 1, or 2, or a partial hydrolysis and condensation product of the aforementioned alkoxysilane or alkoxyalkoxysilane.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0016">The oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition of the present invention also preferably additionally incorporates an amine as a component (G). The average particle size of the emulsion particles in the oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition of the present invention is preferably not more than 300 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">The method of producing the oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition of the present invention characteristically comprises the steps of: carrying out emulsification and dispersion on the (A) polyorganosiloxane that contains in each molecule at least two silicon-bonded hydroxyl or hydrolyzable groups, the (C) ionic emulsifying agent, the (D) polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer-type nonionic emulsifying agent, and a portion of the (E) water; and incorporating the (B) colloidal silica and the remainder of the (E) water in the emulsion provided by the preceding step.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">The surface treatment method of the present invention is characterized by carrying out a surface treatment on the surface of a substrate with the oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">The oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition of the present invention can form a cured film through the removal of the water fraction and can do this without the use of a tin catalyst; moreover, due to the presence of the colloidal silica, the cured film that is formed has a satisfactory strength, i.e., a satisfactory rubbery elasticity, and a satisfactory adherence to substrate. An excellent storage stability and an excellent film formability are characteristically exhibited due to the use of the ionic emulsifying agent and the polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer-type nonionic emulsifying agent. In addition, since a polyorganosiloxane that has at least two silicon-bonded hydrolyzable groups in each molecule is emulsified and dispersed, the content of siloxane oligomer, e.g., octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, and so forth, is low and use in a broad range of applications is thereby made possible. The method of the present invention for producing the oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition of the present invention can efficiently produce this oil-in-water silicone emulsion composition. The method of the present invention for treating a surface can efficiently form a rubbery elastic cured silicone film on a wide variety of substrate surfaces.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0048">The present invention is particularly described herebelow by examples and comparative examples. The viscosity in the examples is the value measured at 25&#xb0; C.; the parts used to indicate the amount of incorporation denotes mass parts; and the % used to indicate content denotes mass %. In the formulas, Me refers to the methyl group and Et refers to the ethyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">The average particle size of the emulsion particles was measured by dynamic light scattering using a submicron particle analyzer (Coulter Model N4 MD from Coulter Electronics, Inc.) at 25&#xb0; C. and was determined by monodispersion mode analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">The strength of the cured film and its adherence to a glass panel were evaluated by coating the emulsion composition on a glass panel; removing the water fraction by holding for one day at 25&#xb0; C.; and then touching with a finger. With regard to the strength of the cured film, this was evaluated by touching with a finger to determine whether the cured film was adequately cured and exhibited rubbery elasticity. When elasticity was observed for the cured film, the film was also strongly rubbed with a finger to determine whether plastic deformation was seen. With regard to the adherence by the cured film to the glass panel, this was evaluated by rubbing the cured film strongly with a finger and checking whether peeling from the glass panel occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">The total content of siloxane oligomers comprising 4 to 5 siloxane units in the prepared oil-in-water silicone emulsion was measured by weighing out a 1.0 g sample; adding 5 mL methanol, 10 mL hexane, and 10 &#x3bc;L n-undecane and stirring for several minutes; thereafter holding at quiescence overnight and then adding 5 mL ultrapure water taking care to avoid disturbance; and subsequently recovering the hexane layer and performing the measurement with a gas chromatograph (GC-2010 from Shimadzu).</p>
