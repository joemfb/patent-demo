<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a system and method for detecting a loss of cooling fluid from a thermal sub-system in a fuel cell system and, more particularly, to a system and a method for detecting a loss of cooling fluid from a thermal sub-system in a fuel cell system that uses current feedback from a high temperature pump that pumps the cooling fluid through the thermal sub-system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hydrogen is a very attractive fuel because it is clean and can be used to efficiently produce electricity in a fuel cell. A hydrogen fuel cell is an electro-chemical device that includes an anode and a cathode with an electrolyte therebetween. The anode receives hydrogen gas and the cathode receives oxygen or air. The hydrogen gas is dissociated in the anode to generate free protons and electrons. The protons pass through the electrolyte to the cathode. The protons react with the oxygen and the electrons in the cathode to generate water. The electrons from the anode cannot pass through the electrolyte, and thus are directed through a load to perform work before being sent to the cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are a popular fuel cell for vehicles. The PEMFC generally includes a solid polymer electrolyte proton conducting membrane, such as a perfluorosulfonic acid membrane. The anode and cathode typically include finely divided catalytic particles, usually platinum (Pt), supported on carbon particles and mixed with an ionomer. The catalytic mixture is deposited on opposing sides of the membrane. The combination of the anode catalytic mixture, the cathode catalytic mixture and the membrane define a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). MEAs are relatively expensive to manufacture and require certain conditions for effective operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Several fuel cells are typically combined in a fuel cell stack by serial coupling to generate the desired power. For example, a typical fuel cell stack for a vehicle may have two hundred or more stacked fuel cells. The fuel cell stack receives a cathode input reactant gas, typically a flow of air forced through the stack by a compressor. Not all of the oxygen is consumed by the stack and some of the air is output as a cathode exhaust gas that may include water as a stack by-product. The fuel cell stack also receives an anode hydrogen reactant gas that flows into the anode side of the stack. The stack also includes flow channels through which a cooling fluid flows.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The fuel cell stack includes a series of bipolar plates positioned between the several MEAs in the stack, where the bipolar plates and the MEAs are positioned between two end plates. The bipolar plates include an anode side and a cathode side for adjacent fuel cells in the stack. Anode gas flow channels are provided on the anode side of the bipolar plates that allow the anode reactant gas to flow to the respective MEA. Cathode gas flow channels are provided on the cathode side of the bipolar plates that allow the cathode reactant gas to flow to the respective MEA. One end plate includes anode gas flow channels, and the other end plate includes cathode gas flow channels. The bipolar plates and end plates are made of a conductive material, such as stainless steel or a conductive composite. The end plates conduct the electricity generated by the fuel cells out of the stack. The bipolar plates also include flow channels through which a cooling fluid flows.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As mentioned above, a fuel cell stack includes cooling fluid flow channels, typically in the stack bipolar plates, that receive a cooling fluid that maintains the operating temperature of the fuel cell at a desired level. The cooling fluid is pumped through the stack and an external coolant loop outside of the stack by a high temperature pump as part of a thermal sub-system, where a radiator typically cools the cooling fluid when it exits the stack. Temperature sensors are typically provided in the coolant loop external to the fuel cell stack to monitor the temperature of the cooling fluid as it exits and enters the stack to maintain a tight control of the stack temperature. The cooling fluid is typically a mixture of water and glycol that provides enhanced heat removal properties and reduces the freeze temperature of the cooling fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">If a component fails in the thermal sub-system, it is possible that the cooling fluid could leak from the thermal sub-system. If enough of the cooling fluid does leak from the thermal sub-system there may not be enough cooling fluid to reduce the temperature or maintain the desired temperature of the fuel cell stack, thus causing it to overheat, which could cause damage to various fuel cell system components, such as the fuel cells themselves. Therefore, it is known to employ devices and systems to detect cooling fluid leaks to protect the fuel cell system against overheating and potential component damage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one known leak detection design, a dedicated level sensor is employed to detect the level of the cooling fluid in an overflow tank or reservoir that holds the cooling fluid. However, there may be times when the level sensor indicates a low fluid level, but there may not be a significant leak, or no leak at all, and there may still be enough cooling fluid in the thermal sub-system to operate the stack. For example, if the vehicle turns a sharp corner, the fluid in the tank may fall below the level sensor, providing a false indication of a low cooling fluid. Further, for small cooling fluid losses, it may be desirable to only provide a warning indicator and not provide other mitigating actions, such as system shutdown.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a system and method are disclosed for determining a loss of cooling fluid from a thermal sub-system in a fuel cell system. The method includes monitoring current feedback from a high temperature pump that pumps the cooling fluid through a coolant loop. A measured current from the pump is compared to an expected current for the system operating conditions, and if that current is significantly less than what is expected, then it may be as a result of low cooling fluid. If the measured current is less than the expected current for a predetermined period of time, then the system can take mitigating action as a result of a low cooling fluid. The current comparison can be initiated by a level sensor indicator in the cooling fluid reservoir. Further, if the pump speed is too low to provide an accurate current measurement, then it can be increased if the level sensor indicates a low cooling fluid level.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following discussion of the embodiments of the invention directed to a system and method for determining a loss of cooling fluid from a thermal sub-system in a fuel cell system is merely exemplary in nature, and is in no way intended to limit the invention or its applications or uses. For example, as mentioned, the method has particular application for determining a loss of cooling fluid from a thermal sub-system. However, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the invention may have application for pumps pumping any fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified schematic block diagram of a fuel cell system <b>10</b> including a fuel cell stack <b>12</b>. The fuel cell stack <b>12</b> includes a cathode side that receives air from a compressor <b>14</b> on a cathode input line <b>16</b> and provides a cathode exhaust gas on a cathode exhaust gas line <b>18</b>. The fuel cell stack <b>12</b> also includes an anode side that receives a hydrogen gas from a hydrogen source <b>20</b>, such as a high pressure tank, on an anode input line <b>22</b> and provides an anode exhaust gas on an anode exhaust gas line <b>24</b>. Typically the anode exhaust and cathode exhaust from a fuel cell stack are combined into a single stack output. The system <b>10</b> further includes a thermal sub-system that provides a cooling fluid flow to the fuel cell stack <b>12</b>. The thermal sub-system includes a high temperature pump <b>28</b> that pumps the cooling fluid through a coolant loop <b>26</b> external to the fuel cell stack <b>12</b> and through the cooling fluid flow channels in the bipolar plates in the fuel cell stack <b>12</b>. A temperature sensor <b>30</b> measures the temperature of the cooling fluid in the coolant loop <b>26</b> as it enters the fuel cell stack <b>12</b> and a temperature sensor <b>32</b> measures the temperature of the cooling fluid in the coolant loop <b>26</b> as it exits the fuel cell stack <b>12</b>. Although not specifically shown, a typical thermal sub-system for a fuel cell system will include a radiator for cooling the cooling fluid from the fuel cell stack <b>12</b> and a radiator by-pass line for by-passing the radiator, where the amount of cooling fluid that flows through the radiator and that by-passes the radiator is controlled by a suitable control element and valve to get the desired cooling fluid temperature. The thermal sub-system also includes an overflow tank <b>34</b> in fluid communication with the coolant loop <b>26</b>. A level indicator <b>36</b> provides an indication of the level of the cooling fluid within the tank <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As well be discussed in detail below, the present invention proposes a method to detect a loss of cooling fluid in the thermal sub-system that utilizes pump current feedback to determine if the pump <b>28</b> is generating the expected work required to pump the cooling fluid through the coolant loop <b>26</b>. In a cooling fluid loss event, for a constant pump speed, the pump current is significantly reduced because the pump <b>28</b> is pumping air instead of cooling fluid. Based on this, the estimated pump current and a measured pump current can be compared to determine low cooling fluid. Note that the change in current is relatively low over the full range and pump speed, and the resolution of current feedback has low sensitivity. For this reason, the diagnostic is only reliable at high pump speeds where a large delta current is expected between pumping cooling fluid versus air. If the actual pump current is much less than the expected pump current, it can be inferred that the pump <b>28</b> is not pumping significant cooling fluid. A diagnostic could then be set and mitigation actions could be taken to prevent the fuel cell stack <b>12</b> from overheating. Caution must be taken from false positive diagnostics to prevent unnecessary remedial actions, such as a reduced power mode, which affects the driver. The present invention proposes one protection against such a false diagnostic by implementing a diagnostic counter. If the counter reaches a predetermined threshold based on the active diagnostic sensing low cooling fluid in a predetermined time frame, the diagnostic is triggered. Alternately, the algorithm could use a predetermined count threshold in a predetermined allotment of time, such as five positive counts in 30 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The system <b>10</b> includes a controller <b>38</b> that receives a measured current signal from a sensor in the pump <b>28</b> identifying the pump current. The controller <b>38</b> also receives a signal from the level indicator <b>36</b> indicating when the level of the cooling fluid in the tank <b>34</b> is low. The controller <b>38</b> compares the measured current to the expected current, and if there is a significant discrepancy for a long enough period of time, will initiate mitigating actions, including providing a warning light to the driver and remedial mitigation actions for the system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart diagram <b>40</b> for determining a loss of cooling fluid from the thermal sub-system based on the discussion above. At box <b>42</b>, the algorithm resets all of the applicable buffers in the controller <b>38</b> and sets a counter to zero. At decision diamond <b>44</b>, the algorithm determines if the tank cooling fluid level sensor <b>36</b> indicates that the level of the cooling fluid in the tank <b>34</b> is below some level indicating low cooling fluid. If the sensor <b>36</b> does not indicate a low level of cooling fluid, then there is adequate cooling fluid in the thermal sub-system, and the algorithm returns to the box <b>42</b> to continue to monitor the sensor <b>36</b>. If the tank cooling fluid level sensor <b>36</b> does indicate a low cooling fluid level, then the algorithm compares an estimated or predicted pump current based on system operating conditions to a measured pump current to determine if the measured pump current is some significant predetermined value less than the expected pump current for a predetermined period of time, such as two seconds, at decision diamond <b>44</b>. If the measured pump current is not less than the expected pump current for that period of time, then the algorithm returns to the decision diamond <b>42</b> to monitor the state of the cooling fluid level sensor <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">If the measured pump current is significantly less than the estimated pump current for the predetermined amount of time at the decision diamond <b>46</b>, then the cooling fluid level may be quite low. The algorithm then determines if the pump speed is greater than a predetermined speed threshold at decision diamond <b>48</b>. The algorithm checks the pump speed because the process requires a high enough current draw from the pump <b>28</b> to be able to differentiate between a low cooling fluid condition and a normal cooling fluid condition. In other words, if the pump speed is too low, then the current measurement may have significant noise and oscillations, where the difference between the pumped cooling fluid and the pumped air is less than the resolution of the current sensor and could go undetected.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">If the pump speed is greater than the predetermined speed threshold at the decision diamond <b>48</b>, then the algorithm increments a counter at box <b>50</b>, and determines if the count value of the counter is greater than a predetermined count threshold at decision diamond <b>52</b>, such as five counts. The algorithm makes sure that the pump current measurement is well below the estimated current for a long enough period of time so as to reduce the chance that the low pump current is for reasons other than a low cooling fluid. In one non-limiting embodiment, each count occurs every 30 seconds so that the total time that the measured current needs to be below the estimated current is about 2% minutes before the algorithm will take remedial measures. If the count is not greater than the threshold at the decision diamond <b>52</b>, then the algorithm returns to the decision diamond <b>46</b> to compare the currents. If the count is greater than the threshold at the decision diamond <b>52</b>, then the algorithm sets a cooling fluid loss diagnostic at box <b>54</b> to take remedial actions for a low cooling fluid, such as providing a warning light or shutting down the stack <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">If the pump speed is not greater than the speed threshold at the decision diamond <b>48</b>, the algorithm commands the pump speed to the threshold, such as 4000 rpm, at box <b>56</b>. The algorithm then compares the measured current to the estimated current as was done at the decision diamond <b>46</b>, at decision diamond <b>58</b>, because even if the measured current was significantly below the expected current for the required period of time at the decision diamond <b>46</b>, it may have been as a result of a low pump speed. As above, if the measured current is not significantly below the expected current for the required period of time at the decision diamond <b>58</b>, then the algorithm returns to the decision diamond <b>44</b> to monitor the level of the cooling fluid in the tank <b>34</b>. If the measured current is less than the estimated current for the required period of time at the decision diamond <b>56</b>, then the algorithm increments the counter at box <b>60</b> as was done at the box <b>50</b>. Likewise, the algorithm then determines whether the count is greater than the threshold at decision diamond <b>62</b> as was done at the decision diamond <b>52</b>, and, if it is not, returns to the box <b>58</b> to set the pump speed equal to the pump speed threshold. If the counter has reached the threshold at the decision diamond <b>64</b>, then the algorithm proceeds to the diagnostics box <b>54</b>. After the diagnostic is set at the box <b>54</b>, the algorithm will determine whether the pump speed needs to be reset at the box <b>42</b> to the desired pump speed if it has been increased at the box <b>56</b>. It is noted that the increased pump speed for the low cooling fluid algorithm discussed herein will not significantly affect the stack temperature while the diagnostic is being performed.</p>
