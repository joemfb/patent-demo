<p id="p-0001" num="0000">This invention pertains to a three dimensional disposable panty, subassemblies of the panty, and an apparatus and methods for making the panty and subassemblies. The panty is designed to hold a primary absorbent sanitary pad. The panty may have elasticized leg and waist openings and be stretchable about the hip and stomach regions of a user. the panty provides backup protection to control egress of fluids that leak or seep around or through the primary sanitary pad. The panty includes a secondary absorbent positioned in the crotch area and extending into the body of the disposable panty, front and back, and preferably over the leg elastics to trap, inside the panty, leakage from the primary absorbent, and to prevent strike through onto e.g. outer clothing and bed linen. The apparatus and methods facilitate assembling leg elastics and crotch elastics into the panty subassemblies while assembling a series of panty subassemblies in a continuous web structure at a constant, or relatively constant, continuous and efficient speed.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Undergarments are made typically of cotton and/or synthetic materials. The cotton and synthetic panties typically do not offer barrier protection. Often the synthetic undergarments have a cotton lined crotch to absorb vaginal discharges or perspiration. The absorbent/barrier properties of regular undergarments are minimal such that any vaginal discharge and/or heavy perspiration may strike through onto outer clothing; i.e., liquid penetrates from the interior to the exterior of the panty.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Panty liners and feminine care sanitary napkins or pads used with regular undergarments have polyethylene backings that provide some barrier properties inhibiting liquid strike through. However, if the vaginal discharge extends to the sides or the ends of the pads, the discharge can leak or seep around an edge of the pad and onto the undergarment. Such leakage can stain the undergarment. Depending upon the amount of leakage, liquid may strike through or go around the undergarment and stain outer clothing and/or bedding. Women with heavy liquid flows may often use one or more maxi pads, double pads and/or tampons alone, or in combination, and change these pads and tampons frequently to prevent embarrassing, messy leakage around the edges of the pads and/or staining of outer clothing. In some cases, during their heaviest flow days, some women will restrict their activities and stay home.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many women experience some leakage of menses from their pads to their undergarments. This varies from being limited to a small number of pads leaking onto only the undergarment during light flow to more prevalent leakage onto the wearer's outer clothing on pads worn during heavy flow. Normally this leakage occurs at the side of the pad, although end leakage is also a problem. Placement of maxi pads and overnight pads in the crotch of regular undergarments shows that, at best, the pads lay on the leg elastic and, at worst, overhang the leg elastics. This causes side leakage onto the undergarment and possibly onto outer clothing. Typical leakage from the pads is caused by poor fit of the pad to the body, improper positioning of the pad by the user and lack of absorbency. Leakage from the undergarment onto the outer clothing is typically due to incompatibility between the pad width and the panty crotch width and/or lack of barrier properties in the panty material around the edge portion of the pad.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention broadly includes a three dimensional, disposable, discrete panty, subassemblies of the panty, and apparatus and methods for making the panty.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The following detailed description is made in the context of an article including a disposable panty, and corresponding panty subassemblies, for holding a sanitary pad in place as a primary absorbent during use of the panty. It is readily apparent, however, that the present invention can be employed with other disposable sanitary articles, such as feminine tampons, incontinent garments and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The panty subassembly <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a two-layer panty subassembly prior to incorporation of the secondary absorbent. The panty subassembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the finished panty including all elements, but before the final steps of assembling the composite to form the panty structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the finally-assembled disposable panty structure.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the panty subassembly <b>10</b> has an outer cover layer <b>12</b> generally defining the overall length &#x201c;L<b>1</b>&#x201d; and width &#x201c;W<b>1</b>&#x201d; of the subassembly, and a body side layer <b>14</b> secured to the outer cover layer. The panty subassembly <b>10</b> generally includes a front body portion <b>16</b> terminating at a front waist portion <b>18</b> as a first edge of the subassembly, a back body portion <b>20</b> terminating at a back waist portion <b>22</b> as a second edge of the subassembly, and a crotch portion <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The body side layer <b>14</b> includes a front layer element <b>19</b> generally overlying and secured to the outer cover layer <b>12</b> on the front body portion <b>16</b>, and a back layer element <b>21</b> generally overlying and secured to the outer cover layer <b>12</b> on the back body portion <b>20</b>. A space <b>23</b> separates the front layer element <b>19</b> from the back layer element <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, for assembling the subassembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to form a panty <b>25</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a first side edge <b>26</b> of front body portion <b>16</b> is assembled with a first side edge <b>28</b> of the back body portion <b>20</b> to form a first side seal <b>30</b>. Similarly, a second side edge <b>32</b> of the front body portion <b>16</b> is assembled with a second side edge <b>34</b> of the back body portion <b>20</b> to form a second side seal <b>36</b>. The waist portions <b>18</b>, <b>22</b> when assembled form a waist opening <b>38</b> for putting on and taking off the panty <b>25</b>. The waist opening <b>38</b> is surrounded at least in part by a waist elastic <b>40</b>. The waist elastic <b>40</b> is stretched and attached to the waist portions <b>18</b>, <b>22</b> in the stretched state. The waist elastic <b>40</b> is released after attachment to produce waist folds or pleats <b>42</b> to allow expansion of the waist opening <b>38</b> so that the panty <b>25</b> can fit various sizes of people. Because users of this invention generally prefer a brief style panty, the front waist portion <b>18</b> preferably comes as high as the navel and is level around the wearer's waist. Having the panty at this height provides a snug fit. Alternative panty styles include bikini (e.g. regular leg cut or french leg cut) and hipster (e.g. regular leg cut or french leg cut).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, the front body portion <b>16</b>, the back body portion <b>20</b>, and the crotch portion <b>24</b>, in combination, form left and right leg openings <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, respectively, which are generally circular or oval in shape in the finally assembled panty <b>25</b>. The leg openings <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are formed by cutting away portions of the outer cover layer <b>12</b>, and corresponding portions if any of body side layer <b>14</b>. Each leg opening <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> is surrounded at least in part by a back leg elastic <b>48</b>, a front leg elastic <b>50</b>, and a crotch elastic <b>51</b> between the back leg elastic and the front leg elastic. Each of the respective elastics <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>51</b> is adjacent the respective one of the edges <b>52</b> of the corresponding leg openings. The front and back leg elastics <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> are secured between the outer cover layer <b>12</b> and the body side layer <b>14</b> by adhesive <b>55</b>. The crotch elastics <b>51</b> are secured between outer cover layer <b>12</b> and a crotch elastic support sheet <b>53</b>, also by adhesive <b>55</b>. The elastics <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>51</b> are in the stretched state when secured to the outer cover layer <b>12</b>. Accordingly, when the elastics, the outer cover layer, the body side layer, and the support sheet <b>53</b>, are released after the elastics are secured to the outer cover layer, the elastics produce leg folds or pleats <b>54</b> at the edges of the leg openings <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> to allow expansion of the leg openings <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> to fit various sizes of legs.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The front body portion <b>16</b> may be divided into a front upper portion <b>56</b> and a front lower portion <b>58</b>. Similarly, the back body portion <b>20</b> may be divided into a back upper portion <b>60</b> and a back lower portion <b>62</b>. The upper portions <b>56</b> and <b>60</b> are preferably designed to include body elastics <b>64</b> which readily stretch to allow the wearer to put on the panty <b>25</b> and then readily contract to resume the normal release state of the body elastics. This ensures a close or snug fit to different body sizes and forms. A number of body elastics <b>64</b> are positioned on both the front and the back portions <b>56</b>, <b>60</b>, respectively, at positions between the waist opening <b>38</b> and the leg openings <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, so that the panty <b>25</b> has a good fit, particularly around the body.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The lower body portions <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> generally do not require the spaced elastics as in the upper body portions <b>56</b>, <b>60</b>, although the elastic threads may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The width of the crotch portion <b>24</b> between the left and right crotch elastics <b>51</b> should be wide enough to accommodate laying the primary absorbent <b>66</b> between the edges <b>52</b> without having the primary absorbent <b>66</b> obstruct the crotch elastics <b>51</b>. This allows the crotch elastics <b>51</b> to contract and draw up the sides of the crotch about the primary absorbent, to thus accommodate the thickness of the primary absorbent <b>66</b>, and to give surface area within the crotch portion <b>24</b> of the panty, adjacent edges <b>52</b>, to contain leakage from the primary absorbent <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The width of the crotch portion <b>24</b> between the elastics <b>51</b> should not be so wide as to seem bulky or uncomfortable. A suitable width is at least about 2.75 inches (70 mm) between the crotch elastics. Width of crotch portion <b>24</b> is advantageous from about 3 inches (76 mm) to about 3.5 inches (89 mm). Preferably, the width is about 3 inches (76 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Preferably, the crotch elastics <b>51</b> are from about 0.375 inch (10 mm) to about 0.625 inch (16 mm) wide. More preferably, the width is about 0.5 inch (13 mm). Preferably, ruffle material on the edge of the leg openings <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> outside the leg and crotch elastics <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>51</b> is less than about 0.25 (6 mm). More preferably, the ruffle material is less than about 0.125 inch (3 mm). It is most desirable to eliminate any ruffle material from the edges of the leg openings <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The overall width of the crotch portion <b>24</b> includes the width between the left and right crotch elastics <b>51</b>, the width of the crotch elastics, and any ruffle material outside the crotch elastics to the edges <b>52</b> of the leg openings. Preferably, the overall width of the crotch portion <b>24</b> should be at least about 4 inches (102 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the panty subassembly <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with a secondary absorbent <b>68</b> secured in the crotch portion <b>24</b>, over the outer cover layer <b>12</b> and parts of the front and back layer elements <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> of the body side layer <b>14</b>. The width of the secondary absorbent <b>68</b> is sized in relation to the width of the crotch portion <b>24</b>. Preferably, the width of the secondary absorbent <b>68</b> is at least the width of the crotch portion <b>24</b> between the crotch elastics <b>51</b>. More preferably, the width of the secondary absorbent is equivalent to the overall width of the crotch portion <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The secondary absorbent <b>68</b> should have sufficient capacity to absorb any flow or seepage of body fluid around or through the primary absorbent <b>66</b>. The secondary absorbent <b>68</b> should preferably have a capacity and thickness substantially less than that of the primary absorbent <b>66</b>, thus providing a nonbulky and flexible fit. The secondary absorbent <b>68</b> should have a total capacity of about one-half the capacity of the primary absorbent <b>66</b>. Preferably, the secondary absorbent <b>68</b> should have a total capacity of at least about 3 grams and not more than 6 grams. More preferably, the total capacity of the secondary absorbent <b>68</b> should be from about 4 grams to about 6 grams. However, the basis weight of, or the type of, the secondary absorbent <b>68</b> should be selected to provide resistance to flexibility of less than around 400 grams, as measured by INDA Standard Test method IST 90.3-92 Standard Test Method for Handle-O-Meter Stiffness of Nonwoven Fabrics.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The secondary absorbent has a low stiffness. The low stiffness allows the absorbent and its barrier to remain attached to the conformable outer cover layer <b>12</b> and the body side layer <b>14</b> which conform to a wide range of body sizes and shapes. Preferably, the secondary absorbent has a stiffness of less than 400 grams along any axis tested, more preferably less than 300 grams along any axis and less than 100 grams along the axis parallel to the waist opening. The secondary absorbent alone will have a stiffness of less than 250 grams and preferably less than 100 grams along any axis and more preferably less than 75 grams along the axis parallel to the waist opening.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The overall length of the secondary absorbent <b>68</b> should be adequate to extend beyond the ends of the primary absorbent <b>66</b>, in order to be properly positioned to receive liquid which flows or seeps around the edges of the primary absorbent <b>66</b>. This overall length is typically at least about 15 inches (382 mm) thus extending beyond the crotch portion <b>24</b> along the longitudinal centerline A-A of the subassembly <b>10</b>. The length should be in the range of about 15 inches (382 mm) to about 19 inches (484 mm). Preferably, the length of the secondary absorbent <b>68</b> is about 17 inches (433 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The width of the secondary absorbent <b>68</b> beyond the crotch portion <b>24</b> should be at least as wide as the width of the crotch portion <b>24</b>. The width of the secondary absorbent <b>68</b> may be narrowed beyond the crotch portion <b>24</b> but may thus compromise the containment of liquid flowing or seeping from the primary absorbent. More preferably, the width outside the crotch portion is wider than in the crotch portion, and is from about 5 inches (127 mm) to about 12 inches (306 mm), alternatively from about 5.5 inches (140 mm) to about 7.5 inches (191 mm). Preferably, the width is about 6.5 inches (165 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, the waist elastics <b>40</b>, the body elastics <b>64</b>, and the leg elastics <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>51</b> are generally covered by the front and back layer elements <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> of the body side layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Both outer cover layer <b>12</b> and body side layer <b>14</b> are compliant and soft feeling to the wearer. The following description of materials from which the outer cover layer <b>12</b> can be made applies equally to the material of the body side layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The outer cover layer <b>12</b> may be liquid pervious, permitting liquids to readily penetrate into its thickness, or impervious, resistant to the penetration of liquids into its thickness. Outer cover layer <b>12</b> may be made from a wide range of materials, such as natural fibers (e.g. wood or cotton fibers), synthetic fibers (e.g. polyester or polypropylene fibers) or from a combination of natural and synthetic fibers or reticulated foams and apertured plastic films. The outer cover layer <b>12</b> may be woven, nonwoven such as spunbonded, carded, or the like. A suitable outer cover layer <b>12</b> is carded, and thermally bonded by means well known to those skilled in the fabric art. Alternatively, the outer cover layer <b>12</b> is derived from a spunbonded web. In preferred embodiments, the outer cover layer is spunbonded polypropylene nonwoven with a wireweave bond pattern having a grab tensile of 19 pounds as measured by ASTM D1682 and Do, a Taber 40 cycle abrasion rating of 3.0 as measured by ASTM Do and Handle-O-Meter MD value of 6.6 grams and CD value of 4.4 grams using TAPPI method To. Such spunbonded material is available from Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Roswell, Ga. The outer cover layer <b>12</b> has a weight of from about 0.3 ounce per square yard (osy) to about 2.0 osy, preferably about 0.7 osy.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The position and shape of the leg openings <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are important to avoid tightness in the crotch and groin area of the wearer, to obtain adequate buttocks coverage, and to prevent the panty <b>25</b> from tilting forward, e.g. tilting such that the front waist edge dips lower in relationship to the back waist edge. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate the most preferred design for leg fit and buttocks coverage. The shape of the curve across the top of the leg is important. If the curve is too deep, the panty <b>25</b> will shift downward and backward resulting in a short front waist, increased back length and bagginess in the seat of the panty. This would cause the panty <b>25</b> to appear tilted when worn as evidenced by an unevenness around the waist of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, the majority of the front leg edge portion <b>70</b> of the front portion of each leg opening <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> is defined by a straight section <b>72</b> having a length &#x201c;L<b>2</b>&#x201d; at least about 70% of the length &#x201c;L<b>3</b>&#x201d; of the entire front leg edge portion <b>70</b>. The straight section <b>72</b> should form an angle with the centerline A-A of between about 75 degrees and about 100 degrees, and most preferably about 90 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With the panty subassembly <b>10</b> laid out flat as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the majority of the back leg edge portion <b>74</b> of the back portion of each leg is defined by a straight section <b>76</b> having a length &#x201c;L<b>4</b>&#x201d; at least about 70% of the length &#x201c;L<b>5</b>&#x201d; of the entire back leg edge portion <b>74</b>. The straight section <b>76</b> forms an acute angle with the longitudinal centerline A-A of the subassembly <b>10</b>. More preferably, the straight section <b>76</b> of the back leg edge portion <b>74</b> forms an acute angle &#x3b1; with the centerline A-A of the panty <b>25</b> of between about 50 degrees and 65 degrees and most preferably about 60 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The majority of the edge <b>78</b> of the crotch portion of each leg opening <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> is defined by a straight section <b>80</b> having a length &#x201c;L<b>6</b>.&#x201d; Preferably, the straight sections <b>80</b> are straight for at least about 70% of the entire lengths &#x201c;L<b>7</b>&#x201d; of the respective edges <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Each back leg edge portion <b>74</b> includes an arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>1</b>&#x201d; extending from one end <b>81</b> of the respective straight section <b>76</b> to a second end <b>82</b> connecting the respective back leg edge portion.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Each front leg edge portion <b>70</b> includes an arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>2</b>&#x201d; extending from one end <b>84</b> of the respective straight section <b>72</b> to a second end <b>86</b> connecting the respective front leg edge portion <b>70</b> to the front end of edge <b>78</b> of the respective crotch portion.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The shape of the arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>2</b>&#x201d; at the inner groin area is important. If the arc is too shallow, tightness may be experienced at the inner groin area.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The preferred narrow crotch width reduces coverage of the buttocks. To compensate for such reduction, the arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>1</b>&#x201d; is preferably adjusted toward back waist portion <b>22</b>, such that the end <b>82</b> of the arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>1</b>&#x201d; should be positioned slightly forward of centerline B-B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The waist, leg, and body elastics <b>40</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>64</b> respectively are attached to the panty subassembly <b>10</b>, generally between the outer cover layer <b>12</b> and the body side layer <b>14</b>, using apparatus and processes described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Materials suitable for elastics include a wide variety including but not limited to elastic strands, yarn rubber, flat rubber (e.g. as bands), elastic tape, film-type rubber, polyurethane, and, tape-like elastomer, or foam polyurethane or formed elastic scrim. Each elastic may be unitary, multipart, or composite in construction.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Waist elastic <b>40</b> is typically about 0.5 inch (13 mm) wide. The elastic may comprise threads, ribbons, a film, or composite. The threads or ribbons may be multiple and may be applied as a composite. Preferably, the waist elastic is threads, more preferably four threads are used as the elastic and the threads are spaced about 0.17 inch (4.3 mm) apart. The threads may be made of any suitable elastomeric material. One suitable material is spandex such as Lycra&#xae; threads available from Dupont located in Wilmington, Del. Suitable waist elastics include threads having a total decitex (g/1000 m) of about 3760 for 0.5 inch (13 mm) wide elastic. Adhesive <b>55</b> is used to bond the elastic between the outer cover layer <b>12</b> and the body side layer <b>14</b>. A suitable adhesive includes, for example Findley H2096 hot melt adhesive, available from Findley Adhesives, Milwaukee, Wis.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The leg elastics <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, and crotch elastic <b>51</b>, including multiple threads in each, are typically about 0.5 inch (13 mm) wide. The elastic may comprise threads, ribbons, a film or composite. The threads, ribbons, etc., may be multiple and may be applied as a composite. The front leg elastics and the crotch elastics may be threads, preferably numbering three threads which are spaced about 0.17 inch (4.3 mm) apart. Back leg elastics numbering up to six threads may have a width of about 0.75 inch (19 mm) and a spacing of about 0.15 inch (3.8 mm) apart. The threads may be made of any suitable elastomeric material. One suitable material is spandex such as Lycra&#xae; threads available from Dupont, Wilmington, Del. Suitable leg elastics include threads having a total decitex (g/1000 m) of about 3760 for a 0.5 inch (13 mm) wide elastic. Adhesive <b>55</b> is used to bond the several elastics <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, and <b>51</b> to the outer cover layer <b>12</b>, the body side layer <b>14</b>, and the support sheet <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">To provide a snug leg fit and to draw up the sides of the crotch portion <b>24</b> to a cradle to receive the primary absorbent, the leg elastics <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, and the crotch elastics <b>51</b>, are elongated when applied to the layers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> respectively. Preferably, the leg elastics <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> are applied in multiple segments, with the amount of elongation of each segment while being incorporated into the subassembly <b>10</b> being determined according to the position to be occupied by the respective segment. In the case of only front and back leg elastics, the front leg elastics are elongated less than the back elastics. In the case of front elastics, back elastics, and crotch elastics, the front and crotch elastics are elongated less than the back elastics. Preferably, the front and crotch elastics are elongated to about 150% and the back elastics along the leg openings are elongated to about 250% The differing tensions allow easier attachment of the primary absorbent pad <b>66</b>, less tightness in the groin area, and less bunching of the crotch portion <b>24</b> caused by high leg elastic retraction. The back leg elastic is under higher elongation to help keep the seat of the panty from creeping up with movement during use.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, the suggested six (back) and three (front) threads of elastic on the respective back and front leg elastics <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> are each represented as single threads <b>112</b> of elastic. The following description of the characteristics and use of the single threads applies to the usual multiple threads suggested above.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The composite of the elastics extending about each of the leg openings <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> comprises a portion of the back leg elastics <b>48</b>, a portion of the front leg elastics <b>50</b>, and one of the left and right crotch elastics <b>51</b>. Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, the back leg elastic <b>48</b> extends, as a first section <b>48</b>A, from a first locus <b>92</b> at or propinquant the edge <b>28</b> of the subassembly, width-wise across the subassembly at a substantially consistent acute angle .alpha. with the centerline A-A that takes it toward a first edge of the subassembly at front waist portion <b>18</b>, and generally following the back leg edge portion <b>74</b> of the leg opening <b>46</b> along the straight section <b>76</b>A and onto the first arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>1</b>&#x201d; toward the crotch portion <b>24</b>, generally terminating in the first arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>1</b>,&#x201d; at or near the crotch portion <b>24</b>. Back leg elastic <b>48</b> extends, as a second section <b>48</b>B, from the first arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>1</b>&#x201d; across the crotch portion to the second arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>1</b>.&#x201d; From the second arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>1</b>,&#x201d; the back leg elastic <b>48</b> extends, as a third section <b>48</b>C, at an acute angle .alpha. with the centerline A-A away from the front waist portion <b>18</b>, and generally following the back leg edge portion <b>74</b> of the leg opening <b>44</b> along the straight section <b>76</b>B to a second locus <b>94</b> at or propinquant edge <b>34</b>. In the flat configuration shown for the subassembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, sections <b>48</b>A and <b>48</b>C are elongated 250%, while section <b>48</b>B is relaxed, and under no substantial elongation. Preferably, section <b>48</b>B includes a modest amount of slack in the elastic.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The front leg elastic <b>50</b> extends, as a first section <b>50</b>A, from a third locus <b>96</b> at or propinquant the side edge <b>26</b> of the subassembly width-wise across the subassembly and generally following the front leg edge portion <b>70</b> along its longitudinal straight section <b>72</b>A, and onto the first arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>2</b>&#x201d; toward the crotch portion <b>24</b>, generally terminating in the first arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>2</b>,&#x201d; at or near the crotch portion <b>24</b>. Front leg elastic <b>50</b> extends, as a second section <b>50</b>B, from the first arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>2</b>&#x201d; across the crotch portion to the second arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>2</b>.&#x201d; From the second arcuate section &#x201c;A<b>2</b>,&#x201d; the front leg elastic <b>50</b> extends, as a third section <b>50</b>C, width-wise across the subassembly and generally following the front leg edge portion <b>70</b> along its longitudinal straight section <b>72</b>B to a fourth locus <b>98</b> at or propinquant side edge <b>32</b>. In the flat configuration shown for the subassembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, sections <b>50</b>A and <b>50</b>C are elongated 150%, while section <b>50</b>B is relaxed, and under no substantial elongation. Preferably, section <b>50</b>B includes a modest amount of slack in the elastic.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thus, in the embodiment seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>11</b>, the front and rear leg elastics extend across the width W<b>1</b> of the subassembly <b>10</b> as one or more continuous threads.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The crotch elastics <b>51</b> extend generally between the back and front leg elastics <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>, with respective ends of the crotch elastics generally being disposed at or near the arcuate sections &#x201c;A<b>1</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;A<b>2</b>.&#x201d; Accordingly, the elastic properties extant about each leg opening result from the combined contributions of the respective back leg section (e.g. <b>48</b>A), the respective front leg section (e.g. <b>50</b>A), and the respective crotch elastic <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The reason for providing leg elastics in multiple sections is at least two-fold. First, using multiple sections of elastics facilitates placing of the elastics on the outer cover layer <b>12</b> while maintaining advantageous production speeds. As suggested in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>, the subassembly of e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is made as a sequence of such subassemblies in a continuous web <b>100</b>, with the width &#x201c;W<b>1</b>&#x201d; of the subassembly disposed in the &#x201c;with machine&#x201d; direction of the processing apparatus. In such arrangement, the front and back waist elastics <b>40</b>, the front and back body elastics <b>64</b>, and the front and back leg elastics <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> can all be assembled into the subassembly by appropriate continuous feeding of respective continuous threads of elastics into the processing apparatus in the &#x201c;with machine&#x201d; direction while the web <b>100</b> continuously advances in the &#x201c;with machine&#x201d; direction at a constant speed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Given the orientation of the crotch elastics at essentially 90 degrees to the direction of advance of the web <b>100</b>, placing the crotch elastics as a portion of a continuous element of either the front or back leg elastics would suggest either (1) momentarily and regularly stopping the advance of the web <b>100</b> while the crotch elastic is fed into place, or (2) severely slowing the web <b>100</b> and severely driving an elastics guide, in a direction transverse to the web in order to apply the crotch elastic while the web was thus slowed. In either scenario, severe stresses would be placed on the respective drive apparatus, as well as on the web. The invention contemplates, rather, that the crotch elastics are placed in the subassembly <b>10</b> as a separate operation placing separate elastics segments, where the crotch elastics segments are first elongated and oriented transverse to the web <b>100</b>, and are then placed on the web as the web passes the appropriate operating station (not shown) subsequent to placing the leg, body and waist elastics in the subassembly, though the sequence of placing the elastics is not critical.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, a first continuous web, which ultimately becomes cover layer <b>12</b>, is pressed against the assembly roll <b>102</b> by turning roll <b>104</b>. A second continuous web, which ultimately becomes body side layer <b>14</b>, passes under adhesive applicator <b>106</b> and over turning rolls <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, and is pressed against the assembly roll <b>102</b> by turning roll <b>110</b>. Elastic threads <b>112</b> are fed from a continuous supply <b>114</b> of elastic thread through feed nip <b>116</b>, through thread guides <b>118</b> and sets of guide fingers <b>120</b>A and <b>120</b>B, and between cover layer <b>12</b> and body side layer <b>14</b> at the nip formed by assembly roll <b>102</b> and turning roll <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring especially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, thread guides <b>118</b> and corresponding sets of guide fingers <b>120</b>A and <b>120</b>B are elements of lateral guides <b>122</b>A and <b>122</b>B respectively. Each of the lateral guides <b>122</b>A and <b>122</b>B is mounted on a transverse slide bar <b>124</b> for sliding transverse to the with machine direction of travel of the webs. Each lateral guide <b>122</b> is connected to a transverse drive mechanism <b>126</b> including linkage arms <b>128</b> and <b>130</b>, vertical drive shaft <b>132</b>, and a cam follower. The cam followers follow the corresponding cams inside the respective cam housings. The cams are linked to the machine drive shaft <b>140</b> by drive belt <b>142</b>. Thus, the cams, and correspondingly the thread guides and the sets of guide fingers, move transversely with respect to the with machine direction of the webs as the drive shaft turns. The end result is that rotation of the processing line drive shaft <b>140</b> effects transverse motion of the thread guides and the sets of guide fingers, as indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in cooperation with the design of the cams and cam followers.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the guide fingers <b>120</b> are positioned close to the nip <b>144</b> so that they closely control the transverse positions of the elastics with respect to the webs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> as the webs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> enter the nip <b>144</b> and correspondingly trap the elastics between them, fixing the position of the elastics between them by means of adhesive <b>55</b>. Accordingly, the guide fingers <b>120</b> are preferably physically positioned, and provide guidance to the threads of elastic, within one inch of the nip <b>144</b>. To the extent the fingers can be placed closer to the nip <b>144</b>, they provide more positive guidance to the elastic. By careful design of the guide fingers <b>120</b>, and by careful control of the positioning of the guide fingers <b>120</b> with respect to nip <b>144</b>, the guide fingers <b>120</b> can be advantageously positioned within 0.5 inch of the line of contact defined at the nip between roll <b>102</b> and <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The limitation on how close the guide fingers <b>120</b> can be placed to the nip is controlled by the ability to design fingers which can affirmatively guide the threads of elastic while avoiding having the fingers themselves drawn into the nip. The criticality of urging the fingers as ultimately close as possible to the nip can be attenuated by directing the threads <b>112</b> onto the adhesive-coated layer <b>14</b> ahead of nip <b>144</b>, preferably instantaneously ahead of the nip <b>144</b>, as suggested by the depiction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. By directing the threads of elastic onto layer <b>14</b> ahead of the nip, the open distance spanned by the threads between the fingers <b>120</b> and the adhesive-coated layer <b>14</b> is minimized, being held to less than 0.5 inch, for example 0.25-0.375 inch (6 mm to 10 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The transverse movement of the lateral guides <b>122</b>, and thus fingers <b>120</b>, as the webs advance along the processing line, creates transverse positioning of the elastics threads <b>112</b> with respect to the with machine direction of the advancing webs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the pattern of transverse movement of the sets of guide fingers <b>120</b>A and <b>120</b>B relative to the movement of the web in the with machine direction, along the processing line. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the sets of fingers <b>120</b>A and <b>120</b>B are depicted at several locations along the front and back edges of the leg openings <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, to indicate that it is the positioning of the sets of fingers <b>120</b>A and <b>120</b>B, and the dynamic changing of that positioning by the drive mechanism <b>126</b>, that determines the instantaneous transverse location of the elastics in the web at any point and time while the elastics are being placed in the web at nip <b>144</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>. Comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b>, it is seen that the set of fingers <b>120</b>A generally places the threads of the back leg elastics generally parallel to each other in the web, while the set of fingers <b>120</b>B generally places the threads of the front leg elastics generally parallel to each other in the web, both along their respective portions of the designed paths defining the front leg edge portion <b>70</b> and back leg edge portion <b>74</b> of the leg openings <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. The threads of elastic deviate slightly from their parallel relationships with each other as the elastic threads traverse paths that deviate from the with machine direction, the distance between the threads <b>90</b> being generally constant as they emerge from the fingers <b>120</b>. Such deviations from the parallel, resulting from the cross machine traverse of the elastics, are included herein within the phrase &#x201c;generally parallel&#x201d; as respects the relationships of the threads of elastic to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It will be understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> represents only one panty in the continuous sequence of panty subassemblies <b>10</b> contained in the web <b>100</b> passing through nip <b>144</b>. It will also be understood that the web passing through the nip <b>144</b> is further acted upon at cutter <b>146</b> to cut away material from the web <b>100</b> in creating the leg openings <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In general, then, webs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are provided as substantially endless rolls from unwind stands (not shown). Web <b>14</b> is typically provided as front and back layer elements <b>19</b> and <b>21</b>. Space <b>23</b> separates the elements <b>19</b> and <b>21</b>, and generally corresponds with the crotch portion and the portion of the web <b>12</b> which is cut out to form leg openings <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. Adhesive <b>55</b> is applied to the front and back elements <b>19</b> and <b>21</b> of web <b>14</b> by adhesive applicator <b>106</b>. Webs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are joined adhesively, with elastic threads being interposed between webs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> at nip <b>144</b>, and with space <b>23</b> interposed between the front and back elements <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> of the body side layer <b>14</b>. The transverse positions of the elastics change according to a pre-set path of transverse movements, driven by the drive shaft <b>140</b> which drives and times the several operations along the processing line. The threads of elastic <b>112</b>, as placed by the guide fingers <b>120</b>, traverse respective paths that ultimately follow the front and back edges of the leg openings <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, as defined at cutter <b>146</b>, in registration with the advance of the web, and accordingly, with the advance of the series of panty subassemblies <b>10</b> being defined in the web at nip <b>144</b> and cutter <b>146</b>. The portions of the threads of elastic located along the front and back edges of the leg openings are stretched. The portions traversing the crotch portion are relaxed. The crotch portions of the elastic are separately placed in the subassembly <b>10</b> at a later processing station, preferably downstream from the cutter <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A second embodiment of the subassembly is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In the second embodiment, the front edge <b>148</b> of back layer element <b>21</b> is disposed rearwardly of that same edge <b>148</b> as depicted in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, while the guide fingers <b>120</b>A traverse the same path as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Accordingly, as the threads of elastic <b>112</b> extend across the crotch portion <b>24</b>, the threads <b>112</b> are guided forwardly of edge <b>148</b>, into space <b>23</b>, and are thus not held between the layers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, and thus are not controlled by the adhesive on layer <b>14</b>. Rather, the tension is maintained on the threads of elastic <b>112</b> across the crotch portion <b>24</b>, such that the threads retract along the edge <b>148</b> of the layer element <b>21</b> in a configuration that loosely resembles a rope under tension. The rope is subsequently cut such that the cut portions of the threads retract to positions generally defined by the intersection of the edge <b>148</b> of the back layer element <b>21</b> and the path of the threads adhesively held between layer <b>12</b> and the back layer element <b>21</b>. Thus, the threads <b>112</b> generally include loose intermediate ends <b>150</b> after being cut, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Body elastics <b>64</b> and waist elastics <b>40</b> can be incorporated at nip <b>144</b> in the conventional manner of providing stationary feeds and guides at the nip.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In another embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a section of web processing equipment <b>297</b> is shown including a drive side DS and an operator side OS. As generally shown, a plurality of elastic threads <b>212</b> are attached to a stain shield or secondary absorbent web <b>267</b>, and the secondary absorbent <b>267</b> and attached elastic threads <b>212</b> are cut to create a plurality of stain shields <b>268</b> having respective elastic pieces or sections <b>251</b>A attached thereto. The elasticized stain shields <b>268</b> are maneuvered as shown and attached to a garment web <b>201</b> to form a garment blank subassembly. This garment blank subassembly is similar in many ways to the embodiments described above; therefore, only certain features of this embodiment are described below for the sake of brevity and reference is made to the foregoing descriptions for like or similar components of the garment blank subassembly to enable this aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With more particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the processing equipment <b>297</b> supplies the plurality of elastic threads <b>212</b> from an elastic thread roll <b>214</b> generally in a machine direction MD. The elastic threads <b>212</b> are routed by a series of guide rollers G in a known manner and are attached in a stretched condition in a non-machine direction (NMD) in this example to the secondary absorbent web <b>267</b> using an adhesive <b>255</b>A. As shown, the adhesive <b>255</b>A is applied intermittently to the elastic threads <b>212</b> by a plurality of applicators <b>206</b>A to form a plurality of adhesive gaps <b>213</b> along the elastic threads <b>212</b>. The cutter <b>246</b> cuts the secondary absorbent web <b>267</b> into the stain shields <b>268</b> at each adhesive gap <b>213</b>. As further shown, the stain shield <b>268</b> the resultant sections <b>251</b>A are attached to a first or inner side <b>268</b>B, which opposes a second or outer side <b>268</b>A discussed further below.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The exemplary cutter <b>246</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a roller cutter having a plurality of blades <b>246</b>A,B attached thereto for cutting the elastic sections <b>251</b>A at the adhesive gaps <b>213</b> as discussed above. The cutter <b>246</b> is controlled by a controller <b>299</b> disposed on the operator side OS of the processing equipment <b>297</b> in this example. Those skilled in the art will instantly recognize that the controller <b>299</b> can be a computer or a programmable logic controller, which can be programmed to cut the elastic threads <b>212</b> at the adhesive gaps <b>213</b> based on a passage of time or a sensed length of passing elastic threads <b>212</b> to create the sections <b>251</b>A. As shown, each end of each section <b>251</b>A, which formed the gaps <b>213</b> in the elastic threads <b>212</b> before the elastic threads <b>212</b> were cut, retract after being cut to create a retraction area <b>268</b>C on the outer side <b>268</b>B. In this example, the sections <b>251</b>A are from about one (1) inch to about three (3) inches in length.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a second adhesive applicator <b>206</b>B applies a second amount of adhesive <b>255</b>B to the outer sides <b>268</b>B of the stain shields <b>268</b>. As shown, a plurality of applicator assembly segments <b>297</b>A-D subsequently maneuver or rotate the adhesive coated stain shields <b>268</b> transverse to the machine direction MD. As further shown, the applicator assembly segments <b>297</b>A-D affix the adhesive coated outer sides <b>268</b>B and the underlying elastic sections <b>251</b>A to the garment web <b>201</b> with the inner sides <b>268</b>A facing upward or outward from within a crotch area or portion <b>224</b>. As shown, the inner sides <b>268</b>A are located between a plurality of garment elastics <b>251</b>B. In this manner, the individual elastic sections <b>251</b>A are rapidly manipulated, positioned and attached to the crotch area <b>224</b> without having to maneuver the entire garment web <b>201</b> and/or cut the elastic threads <b>212</b> and apply the elastic sections <b>251</b>A to the crotch portions <b>224</b> through acute angles at high machine speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Wherever herein this teaching refers to &#x201c;multiple&#x201d; elements, e.g. multiple threads of elastic or multiple paths of traverse, any two or more such elements are included.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Having thus described the invention in full detail, it will be readily apparent that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention.
