<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to composition and methods for topical application to skin. More particularly, it relates to treatment of scars and rosacea, and other aspects of skin care.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional scar treatment does not adequately provide for other aspects of skin care. Conventional scar treatments are designed for application only to a local area containing a scar, not to skin generally. Often, the chemicals used in scar treatment products are not as desirable for use elsewhere on unscarred skin. This can result in unnecessary effort, expense, and complication when using various scar and skin care products to treat a scar and also care for the skin generally in surrounding areas.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention overcomes these disadvantages by combining nourishing, natural products that benefit and promote the health of skin generally, and are also effective for treatment of scars and rosacea. This removes the expense of additional skin care products which, in turn, eliminates the extra effort and complication associated with using the additional products.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Although certain embodiments of the present invention will be shown and described in detail, it should be understood that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the appended claims. The scope of the present invention will in no way be limited to the number of constituting components, the materials thereof, the shapes thereof, the relative arrangement thereof, etc., and are disclosed simply as an example of an embodiment. The features and advantages of the present invention are illustrated in detail in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As a preface to the detailed description, it should be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The composition of the present invention has been found to have superior and unexpected properties when applied to skin such as reducing redness associated with scars and rosacea, and also flattening raised scars. The composition may include ingredients that serve two general functions: toning and moisturizing skin. Skin toner may cleanse skin, remove dead skin cells, restore alkali balance, and shrink pores. Skin moisturizer may increase water content in the external layers of the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Skin toner may be formulated in various strengths including skin bracers, fresheners, tonics, and astringents. A skin toner may be comprised of a single skin toning ingredient such as witch hazel or it may be comprised of a plurality of ingredients which may be included to serve diverse purposes such as humectants and antiseptics. Water may also be among the ingredients included in a skin toner.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Skin toner may include alum, oatmeal, witch hazel, rubbing alcohol, silver nitrate, zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, Burow's solution, tincture of benzoin, tannic acid, gallic acid, aluminum citrate, aluminum lactate, birch extract, coffee extract, evening primrose extract, grape extract, henna extract, ivy extract, lemon extract, aluminum salts, alfalfa extract, betula extract, citrus extract, dandelion extract, golden seal extract, honeysuckle extract, hops extract, ivy extract, lemon extract, plantain extract, sambucus canadensis extract, tea tree oil, thyme extract, or any other skin toner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moisturizers may impart or restore moisture to skin. Increasing skin water content may make the skin softer and more pliable. Moisturizers may serve to mimic the action of normal skin secretions in maintaining suppleness in the skin and provide a barrier to evaporation. Skin moisturizer may include two general types: occlusives and humectants. Occlusive moisturizers form a layer on the skin which reduces the rate of evaporation. Humectants are nonocclusive hygroscopic substances which retain water and make the water available to the skin. Humectants may also function by improving the lubricity of the skin. Both occlusive and humectant moisturizers may be suitable for use in the present invention. A moisturizer may be comprised of a single moisturizing ingredient such as glycerin or it may be comprised of a plurality of ingredients which may be included to serve diverse purposes such as emollients, emulsifiers, lipids, surfactants, thickeners, and preservatives. Further, a moisturizer may have both occlusive and nonocclusive properties. Water may be among the ingredients included in a moisturizer. Selection of the levels and types of moisturizers incorporated in the composition may be made without adversely affecting the stability of the composition or its in-use characteristics.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A moisturizer may include agents that mimic natural ingredients and function as botanicals, including vitamins, hydroxy acids, and retinoids. Vitamins may include vitamin A, retinol, retinol palmitate, inositol, pyridoxine chlorate, benzyl nicotinate, nicotinamide, dl&#x3b1;-tocopheryl nicotine, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, vitamin D<sub>2 </sub>(ergocalciferol), dl&#x3b1;-tocopherol, potassium dl-&#x3b1;-tocopherol-2-L-ascorbic diester, dl-&#x3b1;-tocopheryl acetate, pantothenic acid, biotin, or any other vitamin. Some ingredients that may reduce the severity of dry skin are alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) and beta hydroxy acids (BHA), including their salts, as well as retinoids. The hydroxy acids are classified according to the number of carboxylic acids on their configuration. Monocarboxylic acids are glycolic, lactic, and mandelic acids. Dicarboxylic acids include malic and tartaric acids. Tricarboxylic acids embody citric acid found in citrus fruits. The BHAs encompass mostly salicylic acid and its derivatives. AHAs have been shown to exfoliate. Thus, they are useful in hyperkeratotic conditions. They act as humectants and have a normalizing effect on the stratum corneum, increasing its plasticity and flexibility. Other ingredients of a moisturizer may include elastin, lecithin, sodium hyaluronate, sodium passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, ceramides, naturally occurring skin lipids and sterols, artificial or natural oils, humectants, emollients, emulsifiers, preservatives, lubricants, greases, natural moisturizing factors (NMF) including low molecular weight substances such as ammonia, amino acids, glucosamine, creatinine, citrate and ionic solutions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, calcium and magnesium, sodium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, hexadecyl, myristyl, isodecyl, or isopropyl esters of adipic, lactic, oleic, stearic, isostearic, myristic and linoleic acids, and their corresponding alcohol esters, sodium isostearoyl-2-lactylate and sodium capryl lactylate, glycerin, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol ethers of methyl glucose, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol ethers of lanolin alcohol, lactic acid, L-proline, and other free fatty acids, coconut fatty acid, tallow fatty acid, nonocclusive liquid water-soluble polyols and the essential amino acid compounds found naturally in the skin, and stearic and lauric acids.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Emollients may smooth roughened skin, change the skin's appearance, lubricate, replace natural skin lipids, and provide occlusion. Emollients may be composed of water in oil emulsions. An emollient may make something soft or supple, and may also sooth the skin or mucous membrane. Emollients, such as lanolin, shea butter, or petrolatum may act as a barrier (occlusion effect) against loss of water and also as a softener of stratum corneum. Other emollients may be oil-water emulsions of varying composition and may include several esters and oils such as octyl dodecanol, hexyl decanol, oleyl alcohol,decyl oleate, isopropyl stearate, isopropyl palmitate, isopropyl myristate, hexyl laureate, and dioctyl cyclohexane. Further, emollients may include long-chain acylglutamic acid cholesteryl esters, cholesteryl hydroxystearate, 12-hydroxystearic acid, stearic acid, rhodinic acid, lanolin fatty acid cholesteryl ester, petrolatum, cocoa butter, esters of fatty acids, glycerin mono-, di-, and tri-esters, epidermal and sebaceous hydrocarbons such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters, squalane, silicone oils and gums, mineral oil, lanolin and derivatives, castor oil, almond oil, oleyl oleate, or any other emollient ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An emulsifier may be a substance that is capable of lowering the interfacial tension between an oil and an aqueous phase and, thus, may aid the dispersal of oil (in the case of oil-in-water emulsions) and water (in the case of water-in-oil emulsions), respectively, into droplets of a small size and help to maintain the particles in a dispersed state. Emulsifiers may be generally classified as i) proteins or carbohydrate polymers, which act by coating the surface of the dispersed fat or oil particles, thus preventing them from coalescing; such emulsifiers are sometimes also called protective colloids, and ii) long-chain alcohols and fatty acids, which are able to reduce the surface tension at the interface of the suspended particles because of the solubility properties of their molecules. Soaps behave in this manner when they exert cleaning action by emulsifying the oily components of soils.</p>
