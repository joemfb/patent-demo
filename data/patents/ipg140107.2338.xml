<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The dunnage can be used for protecting edges of articles such as wood furniture during shipping and has a honeycomb panel having a first and second opposed faces, and a first and second adjacent panel sections folded relative to each other along a V-groove extending into the first face, a layer of antiskid cohesive material applied on the V-groove and maintaining said first and second adjacent panels in said folded configuration, and also applied on a substantial portion of one of said first and second adjacent panel sections, on the first face. The cohesive on the exposed face of the folded dunnage acts as an antiskid which reduces the likelihood of the dunnage sliding once applied to the edge of the article, and also reduces the abrasiveness of the honeycomb panel. A process of production is also disclosed where the V-groove can be made on line.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The specification relates to a dunnage in the form of a folded honeycomb panel which can be used for protecting edges and/or corners of articles such as wood furniture during shipping.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Dunnage in the form of honeycomb panels folded along a V-groove are known per se. However, there remained room for improvement, in particular, folded honeycomb panels were known to slide on the faces of the articles to which they were applied during handling or shipping, which was unpractical. Also, former folded honeycomb panel dunnages were known to slightly scratch articles in some cases, which was undesired.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The dunnage disclosed herein has a layer of an antiskid cohesive applied to exposed surfaces of the V-groove and to at least one of the adjacent sections bordering the V-groove. The antiskid cohesive is normally not activated and is not adhesive by itself but is activated automatically upon folding the blank when both sides of the V-groove are placed into contact with one another. The blanks can thus be conveniently shipped and handled in the unfolded state without particular wrapping or adhesive-covering requirements. Then, once folded, the portion of the antiskid cohesive layer which is on the section of the dunnage adjacent the groove can be applied onto the article, and without adhering thereto, it can provide beneficial antiskid properties resulting from the characteristics of the cohesive and help maintain it in place during handling and shipping of the article. The cohesive can also be less abrasive than the bare surface of the panels and thereby help protect the article from minor scratches. A polyisoprene-based cohesive, which can be obtained from a natural latex for example, can be particularly well suited for these purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with one aspect there is provided an antiskid dunnage comprising: a honeycomb panel having a first and second opposed faces, and a first and second adjacent panel sections folded relative to each other along a V-groove extending into the first face, a layer of antiskid cohesive material applied on the V-groove and maintaining said first and second adjacent panels in said folded configuration, and also applied on a substantial portion of one of said first and second adjacent panel sections, on the first face.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with another aspect there is provided a blank for folding into an antiskid dunnage, the blank comprising: a honeycomb panel having a first and second opposed faces, and having a V-groove in the first face between two adjacent panel sections; a layer of antiskid cohesive including a first portion applied on the V-groove and a second portion applied on at least one of the two adjacent panels, on the first face thereof; wherein the blank can be folded along the V-groove into the dunnage configuration, and thence be automatically maintained in the dunnage configuration by activation of the first portion of antiskid cohesive with the second portion of antiskid cohesive being exposed to a work surface and providing antiskid thereagainst.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another aspect there is provided a method of making an antiskid corner dunnage comprising: longitudinally conveying a web having a honeycomb panel with a first face at least partially coated with an antiskid cohesive, and while the web is so being conveyed cutting a longitudinal slit into the first face of the honeycomb panel using a slitter blade and forming a longitudinal V-groove into the longitudinal slit using an anti-adhesive portion of a V-groove blade.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For further clarity, in this specification, the expression &#x201c;cohesive&#x201d; is intended to relate to a type of adhesive which is normally not gummy nor adhesive to the touch, but which is activated when two covered surfaces are placed into contact with one another. In other words, a cohesive is a type of adhesive which adheres and bonds with itself, but does not normally adhere to other materials. The expression antiskid is used to refer to achieving a friction coefficient which is higher than without the cohesive.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of an antiskid dunnage <b>10</b>, or more specifically, a blank <b>12</b> for folding into the antiskid dunnage <b>10</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The blank <b>12</b> has a honeycomb panel <b>14</b> which generally includes a honeycomb core <b>16</b> sandwiched between a first face sheet <b>18</b> and a second face sheet <b>20</b>. The honeycomb panel <b>14</b> can thus be said to have a first face <b>22</b> and a second face <b>24</b>. A V-groove <b>26</b> is defined in the first face <b>22</b> of the honeycomb panel <b>14</b>, between two adjacent panel sections <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. In this example, the V-groove <b>26</b> is formed by partially compressing the honeycomb core <b>16</b> as will be detailed further below, and a resulting compressed honeycomb section <b>32</b> is thus present below the edges <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> of the first face sheet <b>18</b> which are folded into the V-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this embodiment, the entire first face <b>22</b> of the honeycomb panel <b>14</b> (i.e. the exposed face of the first face sheet <b>18</b>) is covered with an antiskid cohesive <b>38</b>. In this embodiment, the particular antiskid cohesive which is used is product name XB-808, manufactured by Bond Tech Industries inc. This cohesive is a polyisoprene based cohesive, and more particularly has a natural latex polyisoprene base. The characteristics of the polyisoprene-based cohesive in this case contribute to providing antiskid characteristics to the first face <b>22</b>, on both panel sections <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. In this example, a concentration of about 20 g/m<sup>2 </sup>of cohesive <b>38</b> is applied to the first face <b>22</b>. However, it will be understood that lesser concentrations can be used as well to reduce the amount of cohesive used and thereby reduce costs. For instance, as little as 2 g/m<sup>2 </sup>of cohesive could be satisfactory on a face sheet having a closed surface, such as coated paper for example.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For illustrative purposes, in this case, the first face sheet <b>18</b> is a sheet of Kraft paper and the honeycomb core <b>16</b> is paper based. In alternate embodiments, any suitable face sheets can be used, such as Kraft liner, recycled liner, medium paper, chipboard, to name a few examples. A combination of layers can also be used. The cohesive <b>38</b> which is used is normally in an un-activated state, and does not adhere to materials which are placed into contact against it. The blank <b>12</b> is thus convenient to manipulate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, the cohesive <b>38</b> is activated by being applied against itself, which occurs inside the V-groove <b>26</b> when the blank <b>12</b> is folded into the dunnage configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This activates the cohesive on surfaces <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and thereafter maintains the antiskid dunnage <b>10</b> into the folded configuration. It will be noted here that the antiskid dunnage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be used for protecting edges of articles such as pieces of furniture and for securing the articles inside boxes during shipping, for example. It can be particularly useful in shipping furniture having square edges, such as wood or metal furniture. When the cohesive-covered surface of the panels <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> are applied to the article, the cohesive provides a higher friction coefficient and thus helps in maintaining the dunnage into position on the article. Using a cohesive <b>38</b> can provide a higher friction coefficient while simultaneously providing a softer (i.e. less abrasive) surface than bare Kraft paper which can reduce the likelihood of minor scratches being caused by the dunnage.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Other shapes of antiskid dunnage can be made as well which can include more than one V-groove, such as, for example, a three-panel configuration can be made with intersecting longitudinal and transversal V-grooves to adapt against a corner of a piece of furniture, or a five-panel configuration with two longitudinal V-grooves and two transversal V-grooves, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, can be made and used to entirely cover and surround a rectangular upper surface of an article, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically shows a system <b>110</b> which can be used to make an antiskid dunnage such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. In this embodiment, the V-groove <b>126</b> is made directly on-line in the process of making the honeycomb panel <b>114</b>, but it will be understood that in alternate embodiments, the V-groove can be made separately onto pre-made honeycomb panels, although, this will likely yield a lower production rate and thereby increase costs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the process of making the honeycomb panel <b>114</b>, a honeycomb core <b>116</b> is expanded from a compressed state <b>140</b> while face sheets <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> are applied onto the two opposed faces of the expanded honeycomb core <b>116</b>. The face sheets <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> can be any suitable sheets such as Kraft paper or even a combination of layers such as a corrugated cardboard for example, such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and more than one face sheet can alternately be applied onto any one of the two faces of the honeycomb core. Typically, in the field of dunnage, the honeycomb core <b>116</b> is made of wood-fibre based materials, but other materials can be used as well if so desired. The cohesive can be pre-applied on a face of one of the face sheets, but applying it on-line as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, where it is applied with cohesive applying rollers <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, can be preferred. If applied on-line, the cohesive <b>138</b> can be applied prior to adhering the face sheet to the honeycomb core as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but can also alternately be applied after the face sheet has been adhered to the honeycomb core or as a subsequent process.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">After the face sheets <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> are applied and adhered to the expanded honeycomb core <b>116</b>, conveyor belts <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> maintain pressure in order for the adhesive to set. A thin circular slitter blade <b>150</b> can then be used to cut a longitudinal slit <b>125</b> into the first face <b>122</b> of the honeycomb panel <b>114</b>, which is covered with the cohesive <b>138</b>. An also circular but broader V-groove blade <b>152</b> having a V-shaped circular edge can then be used to compress the honeycomb core and fold edge portions (see <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the face sheet <b>118</b> into the V-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Experiments have shown that when doing the cutting and the V-groove on-line on a surface which is covered with cohesive <b>138</b>, events of gumming can occur on the V-groove blade <b>152</b>, and it can thus be helpful to use a V-groove blade which has at least a non-adhesive periphery. Using a V-groove blade made of Teflon, for example, can be useful. Alternately, the periphery of the blade can be made non-adhesive by covering it with an anti-adhesive coating, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a top-plan view showing also showing slitting and V-groove shaping operations taking place on the longitudinally conveyed honeycomb panel <b>114</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, two adjacent dunnage blanks <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>can be formed at once on a sufficiently wide honeycomb panel <b>114</b> by using a cutter blade <b>154</b> which cuts the entire honeycomb panel <b>114</b> into two halves <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>114</b><i>b</i>, and two slitter blades <b>150</b><i>a</i>, <b>150</b><i>b </i>cut corresponding longitudinal slits <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b </i>into the first face <b>122</b> of the honeycomb panel <b>114</b>, one on each corresponding half <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>114</b><i>b</i>. In the illustrated embodiment the two slitter blades <b>150</b><i>a</i>, <b>150</b><i>b </i>and the cutter blade <b>154</b> are mounted on a common rotating shaft <b>156</b>, but the cutting into halves can alternately be made subsequently. More than two dunnage blanks in width can also be made in alternate embodiments as will be understood by persons skilled in the art. In this example, the longitudinal slitting by the two slitter blades <b>150</b><i>a</i>, <b>150</b><i>b </i>is followed by longitudinal V-grooving effected with two corresponding V-groove blades <b>152</b><i>a</i>, <b>152</b><i>b </i>which can both be mounted onto a common rotating shaft <b>158</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the longitudinal slitting and V-grooving is followed by transversal slitting and V-grooving. These latter optional steps can be used to make dunnage which has both longitudinal and tranversal V-grooves, such as the 3 panel dunnage or 5 panel dunnage referred to above. In this embodiment, the transversal slitting is effected with a transverse slitting blade <b>160</b>, and a transversal V-groove blade <b>162</b> is used subsequently. These blades <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> can be configured to effect a number of transversal V-grooves <b>164</b> into the honeycomb panel <b>114</b> as it is being longitudinally conveyed, and more transversal blades can also be used. A transversal cutting blade (not shown), can also be used on-line to cut and separate the honeycomb panel into a number of distinct dunnages and thereby operate in a manner similar to the longitudinal cutter blade <b>154</b> but transversally.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">More precisely, in this example, a transversal slitting blade <b>160</b> slidingly mounted on a transversally extending rail <b>166</b> is used, the transversally extending rail <b>166</b> being slidingly mounted at both opposite ends against a set of longitudinal guides <b>168</b><i>a</i>, <b>168</b><i>b</i>. Henceforth, the transversal slitting blade <b>160</b> can slide along the rail <b>166</b> while being kept at a given longitudinal position relative to the honeycomb panel web <b>114</b> as the rail <b>166</b> on which it is mounted is displaced longitudinally at the same longitudinal speed than the honeycomb panel web <b>114</b>. This can be realized using a system which locks onto the web or conveyor and thereafter carries the transversal rail <b>166</b> longitudinally along with it while the transversal slitting blade <b>160</b> travels across the web. The system can be spring-mounted to spring back to the original position once the slitting has been effected along the entire width. A similar principle can be used with the transversal V-groove blade <b>162</b> and the transversal cutting blade (not shown) for example. Alternately to being mounted on the same rail <b>166</b>, the transversal slitting blade and the transversal V-groove blade can both be mounted on respective rails. Alternately to circular blades, non-circular blades can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an alternate example of an antiskid dunnage <b>210</b>. In this example, the cohesive coating <b>238</b> is applied only to a portion of the exposed first face of one (<b>230</b>) of the two panel sections <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> of the honeycomb panel <b>214</b>. More particularly, the cohesive <b>238</b> is only applied on the portion <b>234</b>, <b>236</b> which corresponds to the V-groove, and onto a substantial portion <b>270</b> of the first panel section <b>230</b>. The remainder portion of the first panel section <b>230</b>, and the entire exposed face of the second panel section <b>228</b> are left bare. This can help reduce the costs because less cohesive is applied, while providing satisfactory antiskid properties for some applications, but may result in less anti-scratch properties than a dunnage <b>10</b> where the entire exposed surface of the first panel <b>30</b> and second panel <b>28</b> are covered (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Such a configuration of the cohesive layer <b>238</b> can be applied by using cohesive rollers on-line which do not cover the entire width of the dunnage <b>210</b>, for example, or using a roller which has radially-wider and radially-narrower (&#x201c;on and off&#x201d;) adjacent sections. In still further alternate embodiments, it can be satisfactory to apply the cohesive in a pattern with a patterned roller for example, in order to reduce the overall amount of cohesive used and consequently reduce the costs of the dunnages. Alternately to rollers, the cohesive can be applied in any suitable way, such as with spray coaters, rod coaters, or any suitable coating head to name a few examples.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The antiskid properties of the dunnage which result from the presence of the antiskid cohesive should be higher than the antiskid properties of the bare material of the face sheets. This can be the case when a latex based polyisoprene is used as the cohesive and Kraft paper is used as the base sheet, for example. More particularly, using a layer of cohesive which provides an antiskid coefficient of 1 (which corresponds to resisting sliding against the predetermined surface at an angle of 45&#xb0;) can be satisfactory for many applications. A greater friction coefficient than 1 can be preferred in some applications. In an embodiment, the first surface of the first panel and/or the second panel has a friction coefficient of at least 0.5. An antiskid coefficient of 1.22 (which corresponds to resisting sliding up to 51&#xb0;) has been achieved on metallic furniture. In all cases, the selected cohesive and selection of concentration thereof should result in sufficient antiskid characteristics so that the resulting panel resist sliding on a surface corresponding to the material of the article to be shipped when angled at 30&#xb0;, when the face of the face sheet on which the cohesive is applied is in contact with the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In alternate embodiments, the dunnage can have more than two panels, such as a five-panel dunnage or a three-panel dunnage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, respectively. Further, in alternate embodiments, the dunnage can be made with a die instead of online, for example.</p>
