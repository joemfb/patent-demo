<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0072484, filed on Jul. 27, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept relate to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device including a process using an organic material.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As semiconductor devices become more highly integrated, the need for a micro-fabrication technology, such as for forming of a photoresist pattern, has grown. In a manufacturing process of a semiconductor device using photolithography, a photoresist layer may be formed on a layer to be patterned, and exposing and developing processes are then performed on the photoresist layer, thereby forming a photoresist pattern. At this time, residues such as scum may remain on an undesired part of a substrate after performing the exposing process, and thus the residues may frequently act as undesirable particles when a subsequent process is performed. In particular, when a highly scaled micro-sized device is formed, a negative influence due to residues such as scum may cause an undesirable result, and thus a method of effectively removing the residue may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there is a need in the art for a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, which effectively removes residues, such as scum, remaining on an undesired part of a substrate after undergoing exposing and developing processes for forming a resist pattern through a simple and low cost process without having a negative influence on shapes and performances of other components on the substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept provide a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, which effectively removes residues, such as scum, remaining on an undesired part of a substrate after undergoing exposing and developing processes for forming a resist pattern through a simple and low cost process without having a negative influence on shapes and performances of other components on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept, there is provided a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, the method including: forming a resist pattern i on a first region on a substrate; bringing a descum solution including an acid source into contact with the resist pattern and with a second region of the substrate, decomposing resist residues remaining on the second region of the substrate by using acid obtained from the acid source in the descum solution and removing the decomposed resist residues and the descum solution from the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The descum solution may include the acid source, an organic compound, and a solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The decomposing of the resist residues may include diffusing acid obtained from the acid source in the descum solution by applying heat to the descum solution.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The decomposed resist residues and the descum solution may be removed by performing a rinse process using at least one selected from the group consisting of deionized water and an alkali solution.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A base layer is disposed on the first region and the second region of the substrate. A part of the base layer is covered by the resist pattern in the first region, and a surface of the base layer in the second region is exposed by the resist pattern and contacts the descum solution when the descum solution is brought into contact with the resist pattern and the second region of the substrate, and the method may further include removing the base layer exposed in the second region by using the resist pattern as an etching mask after the descum solution is removed from the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The base layer may be removed by using a wet etching process. The base layer may include a target layer formed of an insulating material or a conductive material and a protection layer covering the target layer, and the removing of the base layer may include sequentially performing a wet etching process on the protection layer and the target layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept, there is provided a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, the method including: forming a base layer on a substrate, forming a resist pattern on the base layer, thereby exposing a part of the base layer, bringing a descum solution including a water soluble polymer and a solvent into contact with the exposed part of the base layer, applying heat to the descum solution and removing the descum solution from the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The water soluble polymer may include a repeating unit having a substituent comprised of a heterocyclic compound having nitride atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Acid remaining on a surface of the resist pattern may be diffused in the descum solution due to the heat applied to the descum solution.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The descum solution may further include one of an acid source comprised of acid or potential acid. The descum solution may include a water soluble polymer including a copolymer of pyrrolidone and an imidazole, a thermal acid generator (TAG), and deionized water. Acid may be generated from the TAG by the heat applied to the descum solution, and the acid generated from the TAG may be diffused in the descum solution.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a resist layer <b>30</b> is formed on a base layer <b>20</b> on a substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The substrate <b>10</b> may be, for example, a silicon substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The base layer <b>20</b> may be configured as a single-layer structure or a multi-layered structure in which two or more different material layers are sequentially stacked.

Alternatively, the target layer <b>22</b> may be formed of a dielectric layer or an insulating layer such as, for example, silicon nitride or silicon oxide. The protection layer <b>24</b> may be formed so as to completely cover the target layer <b>22</b> to prevent the target layer <b>22</b> from being damaged while undergoing a subsequent process. The protection layer <b>24</b> may be formed of an insulating layer such as, for example, a silicon oxide layer. The protection layer <b>24</b> may be omitted within the scope of exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The resist layer <b>30</b> may be formed of, for example, a conventional resist composition. For example, the resist layer <b>30</b> may be formed of a positive chemically amplified resist composition including a photoacid generator (PAG). Alternatively, the resist layer <b>30</b> may be obtained from, for example, a resist composition for a KrF excimer laser (248 nm), a resist composition for an ArF excimer laser (193 nm), or a resist composition for a F<sub>2 </sub>excimer laser (157 nm). An anti-reflection layer (not shown) may further be formed between the base layer <b>20</b> and the resist layer <b>30</b> when required. The anti-reflection layer may be formed of, for example, an organic or inorganic material.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a resist pattern <b>30</b>P is formed by exposing a portion of the resist layer <b>30</b> and developing the exposed resist layer <b>30</b>. At this time, a plurality of residues <b>30</b>S of the resist layer <b>30</b>, such as, for example, scum, may remain on a surface of the exposed base layer <b>20</b> around the resist pattern <b>30</b>P after developing the resist layer <b>30</b>. The residues <b>30</b>S remaining on the surface of the base layer <b>20</b> may have a negative influence on an etching process of the base layer <b>20</b> in a subsequent process.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the exposed base layer <b>20</b> contacts a descum solution <b>50</b> including, for example, an organic compound and an acid source, and acid obtained from the acid source reacts with the residues <b>30</b>S.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Protecting groups of a polymer constituting the residues <b>30</b>S are deprotected due to the acid, and consequently, the residues <b>30</b>S are decomposed and are thus separated from the surface of the base layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The descum solution <b>50</b> may contact the surface of the base layer <b>20</b> by using any one of various methods. For example, the descum solution <b>50</b> is spin-coated on an upper front surface of the substrate in which the resist patterns <b>30</b>P are formed by using, for example, a pre-wetting process and a spraying process using a stream nozzle. Alternatively, the descum solution <b>50</b> may be coated on the entire exposed surface of the base layer <b>20</b> and the resist patterns <b>30</b>P by using, for example, a spray nozzle included in a linear driving type spray apparatus. Alternatively, the descum solution <b>50</b> may be sprayed on the substrate <b>10</b> by using, for example, a spray nozzle including a shower head.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The acid source that may be included in the descum solution <b>50</b> may be composed of, for example, a potential acid consisting of at least one selected from the group consisting of a thermal acid generator (TAG) and a photoacid generator (PAG), or may be composed of an acid. The type of the acid is not limited, and various types of acids may be used. For example, sulfonic acids such as paratoluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) or CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H may be used. For example, when the descum solution <b>50</b> includes a sulfonic acid, a &#x2014;H group of the sulfonic acid may be substituted with a C1-C10 alkyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Alternatively, the acid source that may be included in the descum solution <b>50</b> may be, for example, at least one selected from the group consisting of perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>9</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H), trifluoroacetic acid (CF<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H), and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Alternatively, the acid source that may be included in the descum solution <b>50</b> may be, for example, a PAG that generates acid when exposed to any one light from a KrF excimer laser (248 nm), an ArF excimer laser (193 nm), or an F<sub>2 </sub>excimer laser (157 nm). The PAG may be composed of, for example, any one selected from the group consisting of triarylsulfonium salts, diaryliodonium salts, sulfonates, and a mixture thereof.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternatively, the acid source that may be included in the descum solution <b>50</b> may be, for example, a TAG that generates acid by heat. The TAG may consist of, for example, an aliphatic or alicyclic compound. For example, the TAG may be composed of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of carbonate ester, sulfonate ester, phosphate ester and a mixture thereof. In detail, the TAG may be composed of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of cyclohexyl nonafluorobutanesulfonate, norbornyl nonafluorobutanesulfonate, tricyclodecanyl nonafluorobutanesulfonate, adamantyl nonafluorobutanesulfonate, cyclohexyl nonafluorobutanecarbonate, norbornyl nonafluorobutanecarbonate, tricyclodecanyl nonafluorobutanecarbonate, adamantyl nonafluorobutanecarbonate, cyclohexyl nonafluorobutanephosphonate, norbornyl nonafluorobutanephosphonate, tricyclodecanyl nonafluorobutanephosphonate, adamantyl nonafluorobutanephosphonate and a mixture thereof.</p>

The organic solvent may be composed of, for example, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), pentanol, propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA), ethyl lactate (EL), cyclohexanone, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The descum solution <b>50</b> may be a composition including, for example, a water soluble polymer including a heterocyclic compound having a nitrogen atom, an acid source, and a deionized water. For example, when the descum solution <b>50</b> includes a TAG as the acid source, the descum solution <b>50</b> is coated on the base layer <b>20</b> and is then baked for about 20 seconds to about 180 seconds at a temperature of about 25&#xb0; C. to about 180&#xb0; C., thereby generating acid from the TAG.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Alternatively, the descum solution <b>50</b> may be a composition including, for example, R-607, which is a kind of RELACS&#x2122; (Resolution Enhancement Lithography Assisted by Chemical Shrink: a product of AZ Electronic Materials), an acid source, and deionized water. In this case, for example, the descum solution <b>50</b> may be coated on the base layer <b>20</b> and then may be baked for about 20 seconds to about 70 seconds at a temperature of about 100&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the descum solution <b>50</b>, polymer content may be determined within a range of, for example, about 1 wt % to about 50 wt % on the basis of the total weight of the descum solution <b>50</b>. In addition, in the descum solution <b>50</b>, acid source content may be determined within a range of, for example, about 1 wt % to about 20 wt % on the basis of the total weight of the descum solution <b>50</b>. Further, in the descum solution <b>50</b>, the solvent content may be determined within a range of, for example, about 30 wt % to about 98 wt % on the basis of the total weight of the descum solution <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, after bringing the exposed base layer <b>20</b> into contact with the descum solution <b>50</b>, to facilitate diffusion of the acid in the descum solution <b>50</b> and to promote reaction between the acid and the residues <b>30</b>S, a baking process for applying heat to a resultant in which the descum solution is coated on the substrate <b>10</b> may be added. At this time, the baking process may be performed, for example, at a temperature of about 100&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C. for about 20 seconds to about 70 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Alternatively, the descum solution <b>50</b> may not include an acid source such as an acid or a potential acid within the scope of exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept. For example, when a positive chemically amplified resist composition is used when forming the resist pattern <b>30</b>P, acid may remain on an external surface of the resist pattern <b>30</b>P. As such, when the descum solution <b>50</b> covering the resist pattern <b>30</b>P and the exposed portion of the base layer <b>20</b> is baked with the acid remaining on the surface of the resist pattern <b>30</b>P, the acid remaining on the surface of the resist pattern <b>30</b>P diffuses to the residue <b>30</b>S in the descum solution <b>50</b> and reacts with the residues <b>30</b>S, thereby decomposing the residues <b>30</b>S. Diffusion of the acid remaining on the surface of the resist pattern <b>30</b>P into the descum solution <b>50</b> may be promoted by the baking process as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, the exposed base layer <b>20</b> contacts the descum solution <b>50</b>, and thus the acid reacts with the residues <b>30</b>S. As a result, the residues <b>30</b>S are decomposed and thus are separated from the surface of the base layer, and the residues <b>30</b>S remain in the descum solution <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the descum solution <b>50</b> is removed with the residues <b>30</b>S decomposed by the reaction with the acid. While the descum solution <b>50</b> is removed, the decomposed residues <b>30</b>S may also be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, remove the descum solution <b>50</b>, a rinsing process may be performed on a resultant in which the descum solution <b>50</b> remains on the substrate <b>10</b> by using any one selected from the group consisting of deionized water and alkali solution, or a combination thereof until the descum solution <b>50</b> and the decomposed residues <b>30</b>S are completely removed. The alkali solution may include, for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) of 2.38% in weight.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, the exposed portions of the protection layer <b>24</b> and the target layer <b>22</b> constituting the base layer <b>20</b> are sequentially etched by using the resist pattern <b>30</b>P as an etching mask, thereby forming a base pattern <b>20</b>P composed of a target layer pattern <b>22</b>P and a protection layer pattern <b>24</b>P.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, the resist pattern <b>30</b>P is removed so as to expose an upper surface of the protection layer pattern <b>24</b>P, and then the protection layer pattern <b>24</b>P is removed so as to expose an upper surface of the target layer pattern <b>22</b>P.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the above embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1F</figref>, a wet process using a descum solution is performed to remove resist residues such as, for example, scum. Accordingly, there is no need to use expensive and large-sized equipment commonly used in a process for removing resist residues such as scum by oxygen plasma or ultra violet (UV) irradiation. Further, the resist residues are effectively removed by using a relatively simple wet process without causing an undesirable deformation of the resist pattern.</p>

At this time, a process for forming a specific structure may need to be performed only in the selected region with the unselected regions covered with a resist pattern so as not to undergo the process for forming the specific structure. However, when the process for forming a specific structure is performed in the selected region after forming the resist pattern, defects or yield deterioration may occur due to resist residues such as scum remaining on a surface of the selected region. According to exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept, before a process for configuring the specific structure in the selected region after forming the resist pattern in the unselected regions is performed, the resist residues such as scum may be removed from the selected region by using, for example, a wet process using the above-described descum solution.
