<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Applications No. 2010-130201 filed on Jun. 7, 2010 and No. 2011-067095 filed on Mar. 25, 2011, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a driving apparatus for a hybrid vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A driving apparatus for a hybrid vehicle proposed by Japanese Patent No. 3099721 is known. The technique of the reference is configured to have an internal combusting engine and first and second electric rotating machines, and the first rotating machine or the first rotating machine and engine is/are used as a prime mover(s) of the vehicle, while the second rotating machine is driven by the engine to generate electric power.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the above technique, when the vehicle runs, the second rotating machine needs to be operated as a generator while the first rotating machine needs to be operated as an electric motor all the time, so that this configuration that the energy always passes through the electrical system degrades the efficiency. Further, since the driving efficiency thereof lowers as the second rotating machine is operated at relatively low rotational speed, the operation efficiency on the high ratio side lowers accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of this invention is therefore to overcome the foregoing drawback by providing a driving apparatus for a hybrid vehicle having an internal combustion engine and at least one electric rotating machine, which apparatus can make a vehicle run only with the engine, while improving the operation efficiency on the high ratio side.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve the object, this invention provides an apparatus for driving a hybrid vehicle having an internal combustion engine (Eg), an electric rotating machine (G) and wheels, comprising: an input shaft (<b>16</b>) connected to the engine; an output shaft (<b>22</b>) connected to the wheels; a first planetary gear mechanism (<b>24</b>) of a double pinion type whose sun gear (Sf) is connected to the input shaft; a second planetary gear mechanism (<b>26</b>) of a single pinion type whose carrier (Cr) is connected to the input shaft; a speed-reduction mechanism (Gr) adapted to reduce rotation of the input shaft in speed and transmit it to a carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism; a clutch (C<b>4</b>) adapted to connect/disconnect the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism and a sun gear (Sr) of the second planetary gear mechanism; and a clutch (C<b>3</b>) adapted to connect/disconnect a ring gear (Rf) of the first planetary gear mechanism and a ring gear (Rr) of the second planetary gear mechanism; wherein the ring gear (Rr) of the second planetary gear mechanism is connected to the output shaft and the electric rotating machine is connected to the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The explanation will be made. When the first and third clutches (C<b>1</b>, C<b>3</b>) <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> are engaged, the first speed (<b>1</b>) is established.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Specifically, the rotation of the input shaft <b>16</b> inputted from the engine <b>12</b> is directly transmitted to the sun gear Sf of the first planetary gear mechanism <b>24</b>, while, since the first clutch (C<b>1</b>) <b>50</b> is engaged, it is reduced in speed through the gears <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and then transmitted to the rotor <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the motor/generator <b>14</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Note that, in this embodiment, the first and second planetary gear mechanisms <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are configured such that rotational speeds of the engine <b>12</b> and motor/generator <b>14</b> are become identical at the rotational speed of N<b>3</b> in the third speed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Since both of the third and fourth clutches (C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>) <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are engaged, the first and second planetary gear mechanisms <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> come together (integrated) and the rotation is outputted from the ring gear Rr of the second planetary gear mechanism <b>26</b>.</p>

The rotation of the sun gear Sr of the second planetary gear mechanism <b>26</b> is determined in accordance with the rotation of the carrier Cf indicated by N<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and consequently, the rotation of the ring gear Rr of the second planetary gear mechanism <b>26</b> is determined and outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the first and fourth clutches (C<b>1</b>, C<b>4</b>) <b>50</b>, <b>56</b> are engaged, the fifth speed (<b>5</b>) is established.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As indicated &#x201c;R-EV&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a gear position of reverse (R) running is established by stopping the engine <b>12</b>, reversely rotating the motor/generator <b>14</b>, and engaging the first and third clutches (C<b>1</b>, C<b>3</b>) <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> similarly to the case of the first speed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The foregoing is to operate the engine <b>12</b> (and the motor/generator <b>14</b>) to establish any given gear position. In place of the engine <b>12</b>, i.e., in EV, it is also possible to operate only the motor/generator <b>14</b> to output rotations corresponding to the first to fifth speeds from the ring gear Rr of the second planetary gear mechanism <b>26</b>, as described &#x201c;EV possible&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this case, the engine <b>12</b> is stopped, but the motor/generator <b>14</b> is operated and the clutches Cn are engaged in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As a result, the rotation corresponding to a gear position of any of the first to fifth speeds can be outputted from the ring gear Rr of the second planetary gear mechanism <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, as indicated &#x201c;electric CVT&#x201d; (i.e., continuous or step-less variable transmission operation (control) through the ECU <b>60</b> similar to the operation using a CVT (Continuous Variable Transmission)) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the electric CVT is possible in the illustrated configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Specifically, it becomes possible to make the ring gear Rr to output the rotation corresponding to a desired ratio if the engine <b>12</b> and motor/generator <b>14</b> are operated and the fourth clutch (C<b>4</b>) <b>56</b> is engaged such that the rotation of the carrier Cf of the first planetary gear mechanism <b>24</b> is inputted (transmitted) to the sun gear Sr of the second planetary gear mechanism <b>26</b>, so as to increase/decrease the rotational speed of the sun gear Sr as shown at the bottom of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus, the first embodiment is configured to have an apparatus for driving a hybrid vehicle having an internal combustion engine (Eg; <b>12</b>) an electric rotating machine (G; motor/generator <b>14</b>) and wheels (<b>20</b>), comprising: an input shaft (<b>16</b>) connected to the engine; an output shaft (<b>22</b>) connected to the wheels; a first planetary gear mechanism (<b>24</b>) of a double pinion type whose sun gear (Sf) is connected to the input shaft; a second planetary gear mechanism (<b>26</b>) of a single pinion type whose carrier (Cr) is connected to the input shaft; a speed-reduction mechanism (Gr) adapted to reduce rotation of the input shaft in speed and transmit it to a carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism; a clutch (C<b>4</b>; <b>56</b>) adapted to connect/disconnect the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism and a sun gear (Sr) of the second planetary gear mechanism; and a clutch (C<b>3</b>; <b>54</b>) adapted to connect/disconnect a ring gear (Rf) of the first planetary gear mechanism and a ring gear (Rr) of the second planetary gear mechanism; wherein the ring gear (Rr) of the second planetary gear mechanism is connected to the output shaft and the electric rotating machine is connected to the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The apparatus further includes: a hydraulic pressure supply device (<b>58</b>) adapted to supply hydraulic pressure to the clutches to connect; and a controller (ECU; <b>60</b>) that controls operation of the engine (<b>12</b>), rotating machine (<b>14</b>) and hydraulic pressure supply device (<b>58</b>) to establish a transmission speed (n-th speed) in accordance with running condition of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">With this, since the vehicle running only with the engine <b>12</b> is made possible, it becomes possible to avoid the degradation in operation efficiency that the energy always passes through the electrical system.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Specifically, since there are provided with the third and fourth clutches (C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>) <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and the speed-reduction mechanism Gr (gears <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, first and second clutches (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>) <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>) that can reduce the rotation of the input shaft <b>16</b> in speed and transmit it to the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism <b>24</b>, it becomes possible to establish a fixed gear position by engaging at least two of the first and second clutches (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>) of the speed-reduction mechanism Gr and the third and fourth clutches (C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>), so that the vehicle can run only with the engine <b>12</b>, thereby avoiding the degradation in operation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, since the motor/generator (G) <b>14</b> is connected to the carrier Cf of the first planetary gear mechanism <b>24</b> that decreases in its differential rotation as the gear ratio becomes higher, it becomes possible to decrease an amount of dragged rotation by the motor/generator (G) <b>14</b> as the gear ratio becomes higher, thereby improving the operation efficiency on the high ratio side when the vehicle runs with the engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">To be more specific, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the rotational speed of the carrier Cf is decreased like N<b>3</b>, N<b>2</b> and then N<b>1</b> as the ratio becomes higher, i.e., third, fourth and then fifth speed. In other words, an amount of dragged rotation amount caused by the rotation by the motor/generator (G) <b>14</b> can be decreased as the ratio becomes higher, thereby improving the operation efficiency on the high ratio side when the vehicle runs with the engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, when the operation mode is switched, it becomes possible to increase the rotational speed of the motor/generator (G) <b>14</b> at a low speed where power generation is needed, while it becomes possible to decrease the rotational speed of the motor/generator (G) <b>14</b> during running with the engine <b>12</b>, thereby improving the efficiency of the engine <b>12</b> operation.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the apparatus, the speed-reduction mechanism (Gr) comprises a clutch (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>; <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>) adapted to connect/disconnect the input shaft and the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism in response to a running condition of the vehicle.

Also, similarly to the first embodiment, it is possible to achieve the EV running by operating the first motor/generator <b>14</b>. It is further possible to enhance the EV running performance by operating both of the second and first motor/generators <b>66</b>, <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next the explanation on series EV running, i.e., the vehicle running with power generation will be made. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a velocity diagram similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, but showing the operation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In this case, the first clutch (C<b>1</b>) <b>50</b> (or the second clutch (C<b>2</b>) <b>52</b>) is engaged to operate the first motor/generator <b>14</b> at reduced rotational speed to generate power. The electric energy generated by the motor/generator <b>14</b> is stored in the energy storage (not shown), or supplied to itself or to the second motor/generator <b>66</b> as indicated by dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The reverse (R) running is done by stopping the engine <b>12</b> and reversely rotating the second motor/generator <b>66</b>. The same purpose can be achieved by engaging the first and third clutches (C<b>1</b>, C<b>3</b>) <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> and reversely rotating the first motor/generator <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next the switching from the vehicle running with electric CVT to the vehicle running mainly with the engine <b>12</b> will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a velocity diagram similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, but showing the operation thereof during the vehicle running at low/medium speed in any of the first to third speeds and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is that during the vehicle running at medium/high speed in any of the fourth to seventh speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">To be more specific, this will be the case where the vehicle runs mainly with the motor/generator <b>14</b> under low/medium load, but it runs mainly with the engine <b>12</b> under high load.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the rotation of the engine <b>12</b> and that of the motor/generator <b>14</b> are controlled such that the rotation of the ring gear Rf of the first planetary gear mechanism <b>24</b> and that of the ring gear Rr of the second planetary gear mechanism <b>26</b> correspond with each other (and also so that the engine speed corresponding to a desired gear position is achieved). This can be applied to the medium/high speed running.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The second embodiment is configured to have an apparatus for driving a hybrid vehicle having an internal combustion engine (Eg; <b>12</b>) an electric rotating machine (G; motor/generator <b>14</b>) and wheels (<b>20</b>), comprising: an input shaft (<b>16</b>) connected to the engine; an output shaft (<b>22</b>) connected to the wheels; a first planetary gear mechanism (<b>24</b>) of a double pinion type whose sun gear (Sf) is connected to the input shaft; a second planetary gear mechanism (<b>26</b>) of a single pinion type whose carrier (Cr) is connected to the input shaft; a speed-reduction mechanism (Gr) adapted to reduce rotation of the input shaft in speed and transmit it to a carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism; a clutch (C<b>4</b>; <b>56</b>) adapted to connect/disconnect the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism and a sun gear (Sr) of the second planetary gear mechanism; and a clutch (C<b>3</b>; <b>54</b>) adapted to connect/disconnect a ring gear (Rf) of the first planetary gear mechanism and a ring gear (Rr) of the second planetary gear mechanism; wherein the ring gear (Rr) of the second planetary gear mechanism is connected to the output shaft and the electric rotating machine is connected to the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The apparatus further includes: a hydraulic pressure supply device (<b>58</b>) adapted to supply hydraulic pressure to the clutches to connect; and a controller (ECU; <b>60</b>) that controls operation of the engine (<b>12</b>), rotating machine (<b>14</b>), second rotating machine (<b>66</b>) and hydraulic pressure supply device (<b>58</b>) to establish a transmission speed (n-th speed) in accordance with running condition of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">With this, since the vehicle running only with the engine <b>12</b> is made possible, it becomes possible to avoid the degradation in operation efficiency that the energy always passes through the electrical system.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Specifically, since there are provided with the third and fourth clutches (C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>) <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and the speed-reduction mechanism Gr (gears <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, first and second clutches (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>) <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>) that can reduce the rotation of the input shaft <b>16</b> in speed and transmit it to the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism <b>24</b>, the vehicle can run only with the engine <b>12</b>, thereby avoiding the degradation in operation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">To be more specific, since the first and second planetary gear mechanisms <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are configured such that the rotational speed of the carrier Cf of the first planetary gear mechanism <b>24</b> becomes zero when the first speed is established as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it becomes possible to run the vehicle only with the engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Further, since the motor/generator (G) <b>14</b> is connected to the carrier Cf of the first planetary gear mechanism <b>24</b> that decreases in its differential rotation as the gear ratio becomes higher, it becomes possible to decrease the rotational speed of the carrier Cf and decrease an amount of dragged rotation by the motor/generator (G) <b>14</b> as the gear ratio becomes higher like fifth, sixth and then seventh speed, thereby improving the operation efficiency on the high ratio side when the vehicle runs with the engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Further, when the operation mode is switched, it becomes possible to increase the rotational speed of the motor/generator (G) <b>14</b> at low speed where power generation is needed, whereas it becomes possible to lower the rotational speed of the motor/generator (G) <b>14</b> when the vehicle runs with the engine <b>12</b>, thereby improving the efficiency of the engine <b>12</b> operation.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the apparatus, the speed-reduction mechanism (Gr) comprises a clutch (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>; <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>) adapted to connect/disconnect the input shaft and the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism in response to a running condition of the vehicle. With this, similarly to the first embodiment, the vehicle running only with the engine <b>12</b> with a fixed gear ratio is made possible in accordance with the vehicle running condition, thereby further reliably avoiding the degradation in operation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The apparatus further includes: a brake (B<b>1</b>; <b>64</b>) adapted to fasten the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism to an apparatus housing (<b>10</b><i>a</i>). With this, in addition to the foregoing effects, it becomes possible to reliably decrease the amount of dragged rotation by the motor/generator (G) <b>14</b> at the highest ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The apparatus further includes: a second electric rotating machine (M; <b>66</b>) connected to the output shaft. With this, in addition to the foregoing effects, when the vehicle is started to run with the second motor/generator <b>66</b>, it becomes possible to operate also the first motor/generator <b>14</b> to assist the second motor/generator <b>66</b> and therefore, the second motor/generator <b>66</b> can be made compact. Further, when the vehicle is accelerated, the second motor/generator <b>66</b> can be operated to improve the acceleration performance.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Further, when the vehicle runs with the second motor/generator <b>66</b>, the engine <b>12</b> can drive the (first) motor/generator <b>14</b> to generate power, thereby charging electric energy.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Further, since the second motor/generator <b>66</b> is provided and the clutches (first and second clutches (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>) <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>) of the speed-reduction mechanism Gr are engaged in accordance with the vehicle running condition, it becomes possible to suitably change the power generation efficiency depending on the running condition, i.e., between the case where the priority is assigned to the power generation and the case where the priority is assigned to fuel consumption efficiency of the engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is an overall view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, but schematically showing a driving apparatus for a hybrid vehicle according to a third embodiment of the invention. In the third embodiment, constituent elements corresponding to those of the first and second embodiments are assigned by the same reference symbols and will not be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The explanation will be made with focus on points of difference from the first and second embodiments. In the third embodiment, a fifth clutch (C<b>5</b>) <b>70</b> is installed between the engine <b>12</b> and the input shaft <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As a result, when the vehicle runs with the first motor/generator <b>14</b> (or the first and second motor/generators <b>14</b>, <b>66</b>), it becomes possible to prevent the engine <b>12</b> from acting as load by cutting the connection between the engine <b>12</b> and the input shaft <b>16</b>. Hence, it becomes possible to reduce the power consumption during the vehicle running with the motor/generator <b>14</b> (or <b>14</b> and <b>66</b>). The remaining configuration is the same as that in the first and second embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a velocity diagram of the first and second planetary gear mechanisms <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, etc., of the apparatus <b>10</b> according to the third embodiment and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a table showing engagement of clutches used for establishing gear positions.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, when the third and fourth clutches (C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>) <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are engaged so that the vehicle runs with the first motor/generator <b>14</b> (or the first and second motor/generators <b>14</b>, <b>66</b>) in the EV running mode, upon releasing the fifth clutch (C<b>5</b>) <b>70</b>, it becomes possible to prevent the engine <b>12</b> from being dragged (acting as load), thereby reducing the power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, since the vehicle running with both the first and second motor/generators <b>14</b>, <b>66</b> are made possible at the time of vehicle starting at the EV running mode and the like, the motor size can be made compact, similarly to the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a velocity diagram similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, but showing the operation of the EV travel with the second and third speeds and the fourth to sixth speeds in the third embodiment and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a table showing engagement of the clutches used for establishing gear positions during the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the third embodiment, similarly to the first and second embodiments, the planetary gear mechanisms <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are of split type. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, fixed gear ratios can be established not with the engine <b>12</b> but with the first motor/generator <b>14</b> as the prime mover. In this case, upon releasing the fifth clutch (C<b>5</b>) <b>70</b>, the power consumption can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Note that although the third embodiment is configured by adding the fifth clutch (C<b>5</b>) <b>70</b> to the structure of the second embodiment, the third embodiment may be configured by adding the fifth clutch (C<b>5</b>) <b>70</b> to the structure of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The third embodiment is configured to have an apparatus for driving a hybrid vehicle having an internal combustion engine (Eg; <b>12</b>) an electric rotating machine (G; motor/generator <b>14</b>) and wheels (<b>20</b>), comprising: an input shaft (<b>16</b>) connected to the engine; an output shaft (<b>22</b>) connected to the wheels; a first planetary gear mechanism (<b>24</b>) of a double pinion type whose sun gear (Sf) is connected to the input shaft; a second planetary gear mechanism (<b>26</b>) of a single pinion type whose carrier (Cr) is connected to the input shaft; a speed-reduction mechanism (Gr) adapted to reduce rotation of the input shaft in speed and transmit it to a carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism; a clutch (C<b>4</b>; <b>56</b>) adapted to connect/disconnect the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism and a sun gear (Sr) of the second planetary gear mechanism; and a clutch (C<b>3</b>; <b>54</b>) adapted to connect/disconnect a ring gear (Rf) of the first planetary gear mechanism and a ring gear (Rr) of the second planetary gear mechanism; wherein the ring gear (Rr) of the second planetary gear mechanism is connected to the output shaft and the electric rotating machine is connected to the carrier (Cf) of the first planetary gear mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">With this, since the vehicle running only with the engine <b>12</b> is made possible, it becomes possible to avoid the degradation in efficiency that the energy always passes through the electrical system.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The apparatus further includes: a clutch (C<b>5</b>; <b>70</b>) installed at a location between the engine (Eg) and the input shaft (<b>16</b>). With this, when the vehicle runs with at least the motor/generator (the first motor/generator (rotating machine G) <b>14</b> or the second motor/generator (rotating machine M) <b>66</b>, or the both), it becomes possible to prevent the engine <b>12</b> from acting as load by cutting the connection between the engine <b>12</b> and the input shaft <b>16</b>. Hence, it becomes possible to reduce the power consumption during the vehicle running with the motor/generator.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">It should be noted that, in the foregoing, although the motor/generator <b>14</b> is installed on the input shaft <b>16</b>, it could be installed on the intermediate shaft <b>36</b> or the like instead.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">While the invention has thus been shown and described with reference to specific embodiments, it should be noted that the invention is in no way limited to the details of the described arrangements; changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the appended claims.</p>
