<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An integrated circuit for transmit and receive matching is described. The integrated circuit includes a transmit amplifier. The transmit amplifier includes a first transistor, a second transistor and a first inductor. The first inductor couples the first transistor to the second transistor. The integrated circuit also includes a low noise amplifier. The low noise amplifier includes a third transistor, a fourth transistor, the first inductor, a second inductor, a third inductor and a transformer. The second inductor couples the first inductor to the third transistor. The third inductor couples the third transistor to ground.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a wireless device <b>102</b> for use in the present systems and methods. A wireless device <b>102</b> may be a base station, a wireless communication device, a controller, or the like. A base station is a station that communicates with one or more wireless communication devices. A base station may also be referred to as, and may include some or all of the functionality of, an access point, a broadcast transmitter, a Node B, an evolved Node B, etc. The term &#x201c;Base Station&#x201d; will be used herein. Each base station provides communication coverage for a particular geographic area. A base station may provide communication coverage for one or more wireless communication devices. The term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to a base station and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A wireless communication device may also be referred to as, and may include some or all of the functionality of, a terminal, an access terminal, a user equipment (UE), a subscriber unit, a station, etc. A wireless communication device may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless device, a wireless modem, a handheld device, a laptop computer, etc. A wireless communication device may communicate with zero, one, or multiple base stations on the downlink and/or uplink at any given moment. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from a base station to a wireless communication device, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from a wireless communication device to a base station.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Base stations and wireless communication devices may communicate with each other in a wireless communication system. Wireless communication systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., bandwidth and transmit power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, spatial division multiple access (SDMA) systems, wireless local area network (WLAN) systems and Bluetooth systems.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A wireless device <b>102</b> may make use of time division duplex (TDD). In TDD, signals may be transmitted and received over the same channel using the same antenna <b>112</b>. A transmitter and a receiver on the wireless device <b>102</b> may take turns using the antenna <b>112</b>, thus allowing the resources to be switched in time. To implement TDD, a diplexer <b>110</b> may be used. A diplexer <b>110</b> is a passive device that implements frequency domain multiplexing. In one configuration, the diplexer <b>110</b> may be removed and the switching circuitry <b>108</b> may be coupled directly to the antenna <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The wireless device <b>102</b> may include an integrated circuit <b>104</b>. The integrated circuit <b>104</b> may include a transceiver <b>106</b> (a combination of a transmitter and a receiver). In one configuration, the diplexer <b>110</b> may be part of the transceiver <b>106</b>. The diplexer <b>110</b> is a discrete component that is located off of the integrated circuit <b>104</b>. Typically, a transceiver <b>106</b> may include a transmit/receive (T/R) switch that is a discrete component cascaded on the wireless device <b>102</b>, thereby occupying a lot of area for the system. The cascading of building blocks may hurt the system noise figure. For example, a transmit/receive (T/R) switch that is a discrete component may have 1 decibel (dB) of loss. Furthermore, the transmit/receive (T/R) switch requires matching circuitry for the transmitter and the receiver. Integration of all the components is the ultimate goal towards a true single chip solution that includes front end analog and baseband digital.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Integration of the transmit/receive (T/R) switch and the matching circuitry may be difficult, especially in complementary metal oxide (CMOS) technology. This is because of the limited quality (Q) of the components like an on-chip inductor, which is essential for radio frequency (RF) frontend design at high frequencies. An off-chip inductor may have a quality (Q) of Q&#x3e;40 while a typical on-chip inductor may have a quality (Q) of Q&#x3c;10. By eliminating the need for a transmit/receive (T/R) switch and combining the matching circuitry onto the integrated circuit <b>104</b>, less area usage, lower power consumption and better performance may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The transceiver <b>106</b> may include the combined matching circuitry <b>114</b>. The combined matching circuitry <b>114</b> may provide impedance matching for a receive (Rx) chain <b>116</b> and a transmit (Tx) chain <b>130</b> on the transceiver <b>106</b>. The receive (Rx) chain <b>116</b> may include a low noise amplifier (LNA) <b>120</b>, a mixer <b>124</b>, a baseband filter <b>126</b> and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) <b>128</b>. The receive (RX) chain <b>116</b> may receive a receive signal <b>118</b> from the diplexer <b>110</b> via the combined matching circuitry <b>114</b>. The low noise amplifier (LNA) may have a low noise amplifier (LNA) output <b>122</b> that is provided to the mixer <b>124</b>. The transmit (Tx) chain <b>130</b> may include a transmit amplifier <b>134</b> (such as a driver amplifier (DA) or a power amplifier (PA)), a mixer <b>138</b>, a baseband filter <b>140</b> and a digital-to-analog (DAC) converter <b>142</b>. The transmit amplifier <b>134</b> may receive a transmit amplifier input <b>136</b> from the mixer <b>138</b>. The transmit (Tx) chain <b>130</b> may provide a transmit signal <b>132</b> to the diplexer via the combined matching circuitry <b>114</b>. The combined matching circuitry <b>114</b> along with the low noise amplifier (LNA) <b>120</b> and the transmit amplifier <b>134</b> may be referred to as switching circuitry <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a symbolic diagram illustrating a wireless device <b>231</b> with switching circuitry <b>237</b>. The wireless device <b>237</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> may be one configuration of the wireless device <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.
