<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to devices and methods for delivery of ingestible materials to a user's body and more particularly to mechanical devices and methods for delivering ingestible materials to a user's gastrointestinal tract through a feeding tube.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In many situations, a person or animal can be unable to orally consume ingestible materials such as food products, nutritional supplements or medications and must be intubated with a feeding tube for delivery of such products. Intubation generally involves placing a feeding tube through the mouth or nose of the patient beyond the esophagus and extending to a position in the user's gastrointestinal tract, typically the stomach. A conventional feeding tube typically includes a tube inlet located outside the user's body and a tube outlet positioned inside the user's body. Ingestible materials can be delivered to the user's gastrointestinal tract by injecting such materials into the feeding tube inlet. The ingestible material can then move through the tube and can be ejected from the tube at the tube outlet for consumption by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many applications, it is desirable to inject the ingestible material through the feeding tube into a user's body using a manual, plunger-driven syringe device. One exemplary application involves the use of a nasogastric feeding tube. A nasogastric feeding tube generally extends through the patient's nostril, nasopharynx, oropharynx, and esophagus leading into the user's stomach or intestine. Devices for delivering ingestible materials to a user through the nasogastric tube inlet using a plunger-driven delivery device, or syringe, are known in the art. Such conventional devices generally include a device having a longitudinal cylindrical chamber, or barrel, defining an interior cavity for storing an ingestible material such as a food product, nutritional supplement or medication. A plunger is typically disposed in the barrel for pushing the ingestible material from the chamber through a device orifice. Conventional devices of this type can include a tube fitting located on or near the device orifice for coupling the device to the nasogastric feeding tube inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One problem associated with conventional plunger-driven feeding tube delivery devices involves incomplete advancement of the ingestible material through the feeding tube. Generally, the feeding tube can have a length from about 10-100 cm, depending on the size of the patient and the particular application. When ingestible material is injected into the nasogastric tube, the material must be pushed through the entire length of the tube to the tube outlet inside the user's body. In some applications, the volume of the ingestible material is less than the interior volume of the feeding tube, and a plunger-driven delivery device is not capable of pushing the entire ingestible material volume completely through the feeding tube using only one stroke of the plunger. Instead, using conventional devices and methods, some ingestible material may remain in the feeding tube after the plunger has been fully depressed in a single stroke, thereby forming an occlusion of ingestible material in the tube and forcing the user to perform additional steps to completely evacuate the tube into the user's stomach. Such additional steps can take many forms and can include disconnecting the delivery device from the tube, retracting the plunger to refill the chamber with a flushing fluid or alternatively providing a new syringe device filled with a flushing liquid, attaching the refilled device to the tube inlet, and injecting the flushing liquid into the tube to force the occlusion of ingestible material through the tube into the user's stomach.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another problem associated with conventional plunger-driven feeding tube delivery devices includes the growth and development of microorganisms in the feeding tube following passage of the ingestible material through the tube. In some applications, the ingestible material includes chemical compounds that can promote the growth of bacteria in the interior of the tube. Conventional devices can leave ingestible material deposits on the interior wall of the tube following delivery, creating regions that may support bacterial growth. Such bacterial growth can pose health risks to the user as subsequent injections through the tube will likely introduce the bacteria into the user's body. Additionally, because some conventional syringe or plunger-driven devices do not fully evacuate the feeding tube following operation of the plunger, a biofilm can form on the interior of the feeding tube.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, there is a continuing need in the art for improvements in plunger-driven feeding tube delivery devices and methods for introducing ingestible materials into a user's body through a feeding tube.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of the present invention provides a plunger-driven feeding tube delivery device for injecting ingestible material into a feeding tube. The device includes a device body defining a first chamber, a second chamber and an exit orifice. A first plunger is disposed in the first chamber, the first plunger being moveable between a first retracted position and a first depressed position. A second plunger is disposed in the second chamber, the second plunger being moveable between a second retracted position and a second depressed position. A pivotable interlock is disposed on the device body between the first and second plungers, wherein the interlock engages and prevents movement of the second plunger from the second retracted position to the second depressed position unless the first plunger is in the first depressed position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another embodiment of the present invention provides a plunger-driven feeding tube delivery device for injecting ingestible material into a feeding tube. The device includes a device body defining a first chamber, a second chamber and an exit orifice shaped for ejecting ingestible material into the feeding tube. A first plunger is disposed in the first chamber, and a second plunger disposed in the second chamber. The device body defines a first passage between the first chamber and the exit orifice, and the first passage includes a first passage length. The device body defines a second passage between the second chamber and the exit orifice, and the second passage includes a second passage length, wherein the first passage length is less than the second passage length.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further embodiment of the present invention provides a method of administering an ingestible material to a user through a feeding tube. The method includes the steps of: (a) providing a plunger-driven feeding tube delivery device having a first chamber, a second chamber, an exit orifice, a first plunger disposed in the first chamber and a second plunger disposed in the second chamber, the delivery device including an ingestible material contained in the first chamber and a flushing liquid contained in the second chamber; (b) connecting the exit orifice to the feeding tube; and (c) sequentially delivering the ingestible material and then the flushing liquid into the feeding tube.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Numerous other objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a first plunger <b>22</b> is disposed in the first chamber <b>18</b>, and a second plunger <b>24</b> is disposed in the second chamber <b>20</b>. Each plunger can be longitudinally moved within each corresponding chamber to eject a substance from the exit opening <b>26</b> into a feeding tube. In some embodiments, first plunger <b>22</b> includes a first plunger seal <b>23</b> for sealing first chamber <b>18</b>. Additionally, second plunger <b>24</b> includes a second plunger seal <b>25</b> for sealing second chamber <b>20</b>. Each plunger <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> generally includes a retracted position and a depressed position. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, each plunger <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> is shown in a retracted position. First plunger <b>22</b> is moveable from the first retracted position, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, to the first depressed position seen in an embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Similarly, second plunger <b>24</b> is moveable from the second retracted position, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, to the second depressed position seen in an embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each chamber <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> includes a chamber volume and a chamber diameter. In some embodiments, the first chamber diameter and the second chamber diameter are about the same. In other embodiments, it may be advantageous to provide first and second chambers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> having different diameters. In such embodiments, when first and second plungers <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are depressed simultaneously, different flowrates and material volumes can be ejected from each respective chamber simultaneously. Additionally, in some embodiments, it may be desirable to provide a device having first and second chambers of differing lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in some embodiments, a pivotable interlock <b>40</b> is disposed on the device body <b>16</b> between the first and second plungers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. Interlock <b>40</b> engages and prevents movement of the second plunger <b>24</b> from the second retracted position to the second depressed position unless the first plunger <b>22</b> is in the first depressed position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, interlock <b>40</b> in some embodiments includes a first interlock end <b>41</b> and a second interlock end <b>43</b>. Each interlock end <b>41</b>, <b>43</b> extends from a pivot <b>46</b>, or axle, about which interlock <b>40</b> is pivotally mounted. Pivot <b>46</b> in some embodiments is integrally formed on device body <b>16</b>. First interlock end <b>41</b> extends toward first plunger <b>22</b> and second interlock end <b>43</b> extends toward second plunger <b>24</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, in some embodiments, interlock <b>40</b> includes a spring <b>48</b> disposed between interlock <b>40</b> and device body <b>16</b>. Spring <b>48</b> can include a coil spring disposed about pivot <b>46</b>. In some embodiments, spring <b>48</b> is a torsion spring having a first spring end <b>49</b><i>a </i>attached to the interlock <b>40</b> and a second spring end <b>49</b>b attached to the device body <b>16</b>. The torsion spring <b>48</b> is positioned such that second interlock end <b>43</b> is biased toward second plunger <b>24</b>, and first interlock end <b>41</b> is biased toward first plunger <b>22</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, first plunger <b>22</b> in some embodiments defines a first plunger recess <b>42</b> substantially facing interlock <b>40</b>. Similarly, second plunger <b>24</b> defines a second plunger recess <b>44</b> substantially facing interlock <b>40</b>. Second plunger recess <b>44</b> defines a second recess surface <b>47</b> adjacent second plunger recess <b>44</b>. In some embodiments, second interlock end <b>43</b> extends partially into second plunger recess <b>44</b> and engages second recess surface <b>47</b>, thereby preventing movement of second plunger <b>24</b> toward exit orifice <b>26</b> when first plunger <b>22</b> is in the first retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, when the first and second plungers are both in the retracted position, first interlock end <b>41</b> partially extends into first plunger recess <b>42</b>, and second interlock end <b>43</b> partially extends into second plunger recess <b>44</b>. Because second interlock end <b>43</b> engages second recess surface <b>47</b>, second plunger <b>24</b> cannot be pushed in or moved from the second retracted position to the second depressed position unless the second interlock end <b>43</b> is disengaged from the second recess surface <b>47</b>. Although the embodiment seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates a second recess surface <b>47</b> having an inclined shape, it is understood that second recess surface <b>47</b> can have various other suitable shapes and orientations for engaging interlock <b>40</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, in some embodiments, second recess surface <b>47</b> is oriented at a second recess surface angle <b>59</b> relative to the longitudinal axis of second plunger <b>24</b>. Second recess surface angle <b>59</b> can range between about thirty degrees and about one-hundred fifty degrees. In a preferred embodiment, second recess surface angle <b>59</b> can range between about sixty degrees and about one-hundred twenty degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, in some embodiments, first plunger <b>22</b> can be moved from the first retracted position seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> to the first depressed position, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, while second plunger <b>24</b> remains in the second retracted position. Before first plunger <b>22</b> is depressed, delivery device <b>10</b> can be attached to feeding tube <b>60</b> by connecting tube fitting <b>34</b> or adapter fitting <b>86</b> to inlet fitting <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When first plunger <b>22</b> is moved to the first depressed position, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, ingestible material <b>12</b> contained in first chamber <b>18</b> is ejected from exit orifice <b>26</b> on device body <b>16</b> and enters feeding tube <b>60</b>. In some embodiments, the volume of ingestible material <b>12</b> ejected from delivery device <b>10</b> does not pass completely through feeding tube <b>60</b> to the stomach <b>62</b>. Instead, some ingestible material <b>12</b> may form an occlusion in feeding tube <b>60</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Thus, it may be necessary to subsequently inject a flushing liquid <b>14</b> into feeding tube <b>60</b> to flush the ingestible material <b>12</b> completely through feeding tube <b>60</b> and out tube outlet <b>66</b> into stomach <b>62</b>. However, in some embodiments, before second plunger <b>24</b> can be depressed, interlock <b>40</b> must be disengaged from second plunger <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, in some embodiments, an interlock release surface <b>45</b> is defined on first plunger <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, interlock release surface <b>45</b> is located adjacent plunger recess <b>42</b>. In other embodiments, interlock release surface <b>45</b> can be located at other positions on first plunger <b>22</b>. Interlock <b>40</b> is positioned on device body <b>16</b> such that interlock release surface <b>45</b> engages first interlock end <b>41</b> when first plunger <b>22</b> moved to the first depressed position. When interlock release surface <b>45</b> engages first interlock end <b>41</b>, interlock <b>40</b> rotates about pivot <b>46</b>, causing second interlock end <b>43</b> to disengage from second recess surface <b>47</b> and to move away from second plunger recess <b>44</b>, thereby freeing second plunger <b>24</b> for movement from the second retracted position to the second depressed position. Disengagement of interlock <b>40</b>, also referred to as angular movement of interlock <b>40</b> following engagement of first interlock end <b>41</b> by interlock release surface <b>45</b>, is illustrated in an embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when interlock <b>40</b> is disengaged, second plunger <b>24</b> can be moved from second retracted position to second depressed position, forcing flushing liquid <b>14</b> through tube <b>60</b>. When flushing liquid <b>14</b> enters tube <b>60</b>, flushing liquid <b>14</b> can push ingestible material <b>12</b> into the stomach <b>62</b>. Also, in some applications, flushing liquid <b>14</b> can lubricate feeding tube <b>60</b>, allowing ingestible material <b>12</b> to slide more easily through feeding tube <b>60</b> into stomach <b>62</b>. Flushing liquid <b>14</b> can also partially dissolve ingestible material <b>12</b>, further facilitating travel of ingestible material <b>12</b> through feeding tube <b>60</b> into stomach <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, ingestible material <b>12</b> includes a food product, a nutritional supplement and/or a pharmaceutical compound or medication. In some embodiments, ingestible material <b>12</b> is a solid. In other embodiments, ingestible material <b>12</b> can include a powder or particulate material that is intended to be mixed with flushing liquid <b>14</b>. In other embodiments, ingestible material <b>12</b> can include an amorphous solid such as a gel or a paste. One or more nondigestible prebiotic materials that promote the growth and development of bacteria in the digestive tract, such as but not limited to a galactooligosaccharide (GOS) or a fructooligosaccharide (FOS), can also be included in ingestible material <b>12</b> in some embodiments. Other suitable prebiotic or probiotic materials and mixtures known in the art can be included in ingestible material <b>12</b> in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The presence of ingestible material <b>12</b> in feeding tube <b>60</b> can contribute to the growth and development of bacteria on the inner tube wall. Such bacterial growth and development presents a threat of contamination to the user and is generally undesirable. Additionally, after one or more uses, tube <b>60</b> may develop a biofilm on the interior tube wall. Such a biofilm may include one or more types of bacteria and can pose a health hazard to the user. Bacteria and biofilm growth and development can be prevented by forcing a flushing liquid <b>14</b> through tube <b>60</b> following passage of ingestible material <b>12</b> through feeding tube <b>60</b>. Flushing liquid <b>14</b> contained in second chamber <b>20</b> can perform one or more functions when injected into the feeding tube <b>60</b>. First, flushing liquid <b>14</b> can push ingestible material <b>12</b> through feeding tube <b>60</b> into the user's stomach <b>62</b>. Second, flushing liquid <b>14</b> can disinfect the interior feeding tube wall to inhibit bacterial growth and development. Third, flushing liquid <b>14</b> can prevent biofilm growth and development on the interior feeding tube wall. It is understood that flushing liquid <b>14</b> can perform as few as one or as many as all of these functions in various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, flushing liquid <b>14</b> comprises water. In further embodiments, flushing liquid <b>14</b> includes a disinfectant material or an antimicrobial agent for killing and/or preventing the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria in tube <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, after second plunger <b>24</b> is moved to the second depressed position, flushing liquid <b>14</b> travels through feeding tube <b>60</b> and enters stomach <b>62</b>. At this point, delivery device <b>10</b> can be disconnected from feeding tube <b>60</b> and discarded in some embodiments. In other embodiments, delivery device <b>10</b> can be disconnected from feeding tube <b>60</b> and refilled or stored for future reuse.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in yet another embodiment, a plunger-driven feeding tube delivery device <b>10</b> includes a device body <b>16</b> defining a first chamber <b>18</b>, a second chamber <b>20</b> and an exit orifice <b>26</b> shaped for ejecting ingestible material into a feeding tube. In some embodiments, a first plunger <b>22</b> is disposed in the first chamber <b>18</b> and a second plunger <b>24</b> is disposed in the second chamber <b>20</b>. The device body <b>16</b> defines a first passage <b>70</b> extending between the first chamber <b>18</b> and the exit orifice <b>26</b>. The device body <b>16</b> also defines a second passage <b>72</b> extending between the second chamber <b>20</b> and the exit orifice <b>26</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the first passage <b>70</b> includes a first passage length <b>78</b>, and second passage <b>72</b> includes a second passage length <b>74</b>. In some embodiments, the first passage length <b>78</b> is less than the second passage length <b>74</b>. In further embodiments, the ratio of the second passage length <b>74</b> to the first passage length <b>78</b> is greater than about two. In other embodiments, the ratio of the second passage length <b>74</b> to the first passage length <b>78</b> is greater than about five.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, an ingestible material <b>12</b> can be disposed in the first chamber <b>18</b> and a flushing liquid <b>14</b> can be disposed in the second chamber <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, first plunger <b>22</b> is attached to second plunger <b>24</b> by a plunger bridge <b>32</b>. Plunger bridge <b>32</b> allows both first and second plungers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to be simultaneously depressed using a single plunger knob <b>36</b>. During use, the device body <b>16</b> can be held in one hand by an operator while plunger knob <b>36</b> is depressed using the other hand, thereby forcing first and second plungers simultaneously toward exit orifice <b>26</b> and dispensing one or more materials from first and second chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, delivery device <b>10</b> is adapted to not dispense the flushing liquid <b>14</b> until some or all of ingestible material <b>12</b> has been dispensed. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, when first and second plungers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are depressed together, ingestible material <b>12</b> is pushed through first passage <b>70</b> out exit orifice <b>26</b> into feeding tube <b>60</b> toward stomach <b>62</b>. Simultaneously, flushing liquid <b>14</b> is pushed through second passage <b>72</b>. Because second passage <b>72</b> includes a second passage length <b>74</b> longer than first passage length <b>78</b>, flushing liquid <b>14</b> does not reach exit orifice <b>26</b> until some or all of ingestible material <b>12</b> has entered feeding tube <b>60</b>. Thus, in some embodiments, delivery device <b>10</b> is capable of sequentially delivering ingestible material <b>12</b> followed by flushing liquid <b>14</b> into feeding tube <b>60</b> using only a single, simultaneous stroke of first and second plungers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in some embodiments, first passage <b>70</b> can include a partial amount of ingestible material <b>12</b> after first plunger <b>22</b> is moved to the first depressed position. This may be undesirable in some applications. To overcome this problem, in some embodiments, a first gas pocket <b>19</b> can be included in first chamber <b>18</b> between first plunger seal <b>23</b> and ingestible material <b>12</b>. The first gas pocket <b>19</b> can include a gas volume similar to the volume of the first passage <b>70</b>. Thus, when first plunger <b>22</b> is moved to the first depressed position, first gas pocket <b>19</b> is forced through first passage <b>70</b>, thereby pushing any residual ingestible material <b>12</b> out of first passage <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Similarly, in some embodiments, second passage <b>72</b> can include a partial amount of flushing liquid <b>14</b> disposed therein after second plunger <b>24</b> is moved to the second depressed position. This may be undesirable in some applications. To overcome this problem, in some embodiments, a second gas pocket <b>21</b> can be included in second chamber <b>20</b> between second plunger seal <b>25</b> and flushing liquid <b>14</b>. Second gas pocket <b>21</b> can include a gas volume similar to the volume of the second passage <b>72</b>. Thus, when second plunger <b>24</b> is moved to the second depressed position, second gas pocket <b>21</b> is forced through second passage <b>72</b>, thereby pushing any residual flushing liquid <b>14</b> out of second passage <b>72</b>. First and second gas pockets <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> can include a sterile, inert gas in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in some embodiments, a first gas pocket <b>19</b> and/or a second gas pocket <b>21</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, can be disposed in first and second chambers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, respectively, in an embodiment having an interlock <b>40</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. For example, ingestible material <b>12</b> can be provided in a device as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> with a first gas pocket <b>19</b> positioned between first plunger seal <b>23</b> and ingestible material <b>12</b>. Similarly, in some embodiments, flushing liquid <b>14</b> can be provided in a device as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> with a second gas pocket <b>21</b> positioned between second plunger seal <b>25</b> and flushing liquid <b>14</b>. It is understood, that in some embodiments, a gas pocket is provided in both chambers. In other embodiments, a gas pocket is provided in only one chamber. For example, in some embodiments, ingestible material <b>12</b> is relatively viscous, and second chamber <b>18</b> of a device as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> includes a flushing liquid <b>14</b> and second gas pocket disposed between second plunger seal <b>25</b> and flushing liquid <b>14</b>. In such embodiments, a second gas pocket may be necessary to force both flushing liquid <b>14</b> and ingestible material <b>12</b> completely through the feeding tube.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the plunger-driven feeding tube delivery device <b>10</b> of the present invention is a disposable, single-use syringe. The delivery device <b>10</b> can be provided in a sanitary package and can be pre-filled with ingestible material <b>12</b> and flushing liquid <b>14</b>. In other embodiments, delivery device <b>10</b> can include a reusable and refillable syringe. In some embodiments, interlock <b>40</b> is exposed so that a user can manually manipulate the angular position of interlock <b>40</b> for removing first and/or second plungers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> from device body <b>16</b> for cleaning or refilling.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the delivery device <b>10</b> includes a removable seal <b>30</b> covering exit orifice <b>26</b>. The removable seal <b>30</b> can be manually removed by a user prior to use. In some embodiments, removable seal <b>30</b> includes a seal tab <b>31</b> radially protruding from the perimeter of seal <b>30</b> for manually peeling seal <b>30</b> from tube fitting <b>34</b>. In other embodiments, delivery device <b>10</b> is provided with a removable cap covering exit orifice <b>26</b> and sealing delivery device <b>10</b> from contamination prior to use.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally, as previously noted, in some embodiments, one or both chambers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> can include a pharmaceutical ingredient. In some embodiments, a first pharmaceutical ingredient having a first time release rate can be disposed in ingestible material <b>12</b> in the first chamber <b>18</b>. Similarly, in some embodiments, a second pharmaceutical ingredient having a second time release rate can be disposed in the second chamber <b>20</b> as a second ingestible material in place of flushing liquid <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, only one pharmaceutical ingredient is disposed in the device. One embodiment provides a first pharmaceutical ingredient with a first release rate disposed in the first chamber and a second pharmaceutical ingredient of the same pharmaceutical compound but with a second release rate disposed in the second chamber, wherein the first release rate is faster than the second release rate. As such, the first pharmaceutical release rate is designated to be delivered from the device into the feeding tube first, and the second pharmaceutical ingredient is designated to be delivered into the feeding tube second. In such embodiments, in some applications, a second gas pocket can be disposed in the second chamber to flush the second pharmaceutical ingredient from the device through the feeding tube into the user's stomach. Such an embodiment can provide the user with a smoother, longer-lasting dose of the same drug by sequentially delivering first a fast release dose of the drug, followed by an extended release dose of the same drug.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another embodiment, two different pharmaceutical compounds may be used to tread a certain indication. When the two different compounds are manufactured or provided in a single container, the compounds may become unstable or have a tendency to chemically react. One way to overcome this problem is to provide a device in accordance with the present invention having the first pharmaceutical compound disposed in the first chamber <b>18</b> and the second pharmaceutical compound disposed in the second chamber <b>20</b>. In such embodiments, the first pharmaceutical compound will be spatially separated from the second pharmaceutical compound until the first and second plungers are depressed to deliver both compounds to the user through the feeding tube. Additionally, in such embodiments, a gas pocket can be disposed in the second chamber to provide a gas flush for the second pharmaceutical compound. It is understood that the first and second pharmaceutical compounds can be suspended or contained in another material, such as an ingestible solid or liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A further embodiment of the present invention provides a method of administering an ingestible material to a user through a feeding tube. In some embodiments, the method includes the steps of: (a) providing a plunger-driven feeding tube delivery device having a first chamber, a second chamber, an exit orifice, a first plunger disposed in the first chamber and a second plunger disposed in the second chamber, the delivery device including an ingestible material contained in the first chamber and a flushing liquid contained in the second chamber; (b) connecting the exit orifice to the feeding tube; and (c) sequentially delivering the ingestible material then the flushing liquid into the feeding tube. In some embodiments, the first and second plungers are mechanically linked by plunger bridge <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In further embodiments, step (c) of the method further includes the steps of: (c1) depressing the first plunger, dispensing the ingestible material into the feeding tube; and (c2) depressing the second plunger after the first plunger has been depressed, dispensing the flushing liquid into the feeding tube. In some embodiments, the delivery device includes a first passage positioned between the first chamber and the exit orifice, and the device also defines a second passage between the second chamber and the exit orifice. The first passage includes a first passage length, and the second passage includes a second passage length, wherein the second passage length is greater than the first passage length. In this embodiment, step (c) further includes the steps of: (c1) simultaneously depressing the first and second plungers; (c2) forcing the ingestible material through the exit orifice into the feeding tube; and (c3) forcing the flushing liquid through the second passage.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an additional embodiment, the present invention provides a method of packaging a plunger-driven feeding tube delivery device. The method includes the steps of: (a) providing a device body having a first chamber, a second chamber, an exit orifice; (b) filling the first chamber with an ingestible material; (c) filling the second chamber with a flushing liquid; (d) positioning a first plunger in the first chamber; (e) positioning a second plunger in the second chamber; (f) positioning an interlock between the first and second plungers; and (g) engaging the second plunger with the interlock so that the second plunger cannot be depressed until the first plunger has been depressed.</p>
