<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">With the advent of the digital age, financial account holders are increasingly relying on online platforms to manage their financial accounts, initiate financial transactions, and obtain information relating to their financial accounts. These online platforms may support a variety of software applications such as online financial applications (e.g., online banking applications) rendered by traditional web browsers running on desktop or laptop devices, online financial applications rendered by mobile browsers running on mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, dedicated smartphone or tablet mobile banking or other financial applications, and so forth. These online applications have dramatically increased the speed and efficiency with which financial account holders are able to conduct financial transactions and manage their financial accounts.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In addition to providing functionality for initiating financial transactions and managing financial accounts, online financial applications generally provide financial account holders with various financial transaction and account information relating to pending and processed financial transactions. Such information may include a posting date of a transaction, a transaction amount, a brief description of the transaction, an available financial account balance, and so forth.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Online financial applications such as online banking applications may provide a financial account holder with information relating to a financial account such as transaction and account details. Account statements, whether mailed or delivered in electronic form, may also provide transaction and account details. To date, however, the nature of the transactional and account information provided to a financial account holder through an online interface or in a paper statement has been limited in scope. Conventionally, such information has been limited to transaction amounts, account balance information, posting dates, minimal descriptions of the type/nature of the transactions, or similar information. Further, while account holders may have some degree of control over the formatting or arrangement of the information presented via an online banking interface, they generally are not able to control the type, nature, or scope of information that is presented. Further, conventional online financial account interfaces (e.g., online banking interfaces, online credit card interfaces, etc.) and client applications for initiating financial transactions (e.g., bill payments, person-to-person (P2P) payments and requests for payments, account-to-account (A2A) funds transfers, retail payments, and check deposits) fail to provide a mechanism by which a requestor associated with a financial transaction (e.g., an account holder) can identify content relating to a financial transaction and associate the content with the financial transaction such that the content may be presented to a user (e.g., an account holder) via an online financial account interface or as part of a downloadable or mailed account statement.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">This disclosure relates to systems, methods, and computer-readable media for facilitating the presentation of content relating to a financial transaction. A service provider system may receive a request associated with a financial transaction on behalf of a requestor. The request may be received, for example, from a client device that hosts any of a variety of types of client applications. An illustrative, non-exhaustive list of such client applications may include an online banking application or other financial application, a person-to-person (P2P) client application that supports functionality for transferring funds between financial accounts associated with different account holders (e.g., a P2P payment or a request for a P2P payment), a funds transfer application that supports functionality for transferring funds between financial accounts associated with a same account holder, a client application that supports functionality for electronic bill presentment and payment, a client application that supports functionality for remote deposit capture, an application or interface that facilitates retail payments, and so forth. In certain embodiments, the request may be received from a client application hosted by a merchant or a device or system associated with the merchant or other payee as part of a credit card transaction, a debit card transaction, a check payment, an Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) transaction, and so forth. The merchant or payee may be online or brick-and-mortar and the financial transaction may be an online transaction or a physical point-of-sale (POS) transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The requestor may be any entity from whom the request associated with the financial transaction is received by the service provider system. For example, the requestor may be a party to the financial transaction (e.g., a payor, a payee etc.), a merchant that submits the financial transaction request based on authorization received from a payor, and/or an individual or other entity authorized to submit the request by an account holder of a financial account associated with the financial transaction. The financial transaction associated with the request may be any of a variety of types of financial transactions including, but not limited to, a bill payment, a P2P payment, a request for a P2P payment, a retail payment, an account-to-account transfer, a funds transfer, a check deposit, and so forth. In fact, the financial transaction may include any transaction according to which funds are transferred from one financial account to one or more other financial accounts. A financial account to be debited or credited as part of the financial transaction may include any of a variety of types of financial accounts including, but not limited to, a demand deposit account, a savings account, a money market account, a line of credit account, a debit card account, a credit card account, a prepaid card account, a stored value account, or a brokerage account.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It should be appreciated that the foregoing are not exhaustive listings of the types of client applications, financial transactions and/or financial accounts to which systems and methods of the disclosure may be applicable. Any financial transaction involving the exchange of value between any two or more value holding entities and any applications that support such value exchanges are within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The request may be associated with content relating to the financial transaction. The content may include any of a variety of types of content including textual content, one or more images, electronic or multimedia content such as audio and/or video content, and so forth. The textual content may include, but is not limited to, a textual description of the financial transaction, textual information associated with and/or generated by one or more parties to the financial transaction, and so forth. Illustrative examples of textual content include, but are not limited to, a sales receipt, a purchase order, a sales invoice, a bill, or a greeting card associated with the financial transaction. Such textual content may be organized according to any suitable format for presentation in connection with an online account interface or within an account statement. For example, the textual content may be rich textual content that may be encoded in accordance with any suitable formatting specification such as any of those defined by any of a variety of markup languages (e.g., Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML), Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL), etc.). The textual content may have graphical elements, tags, metadata, and so forth associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Illustrative types of image content may include an image of an individual associated with the financial transaction (e.g., an image of an account holder of a financial account from which funds are to be debited in connection with the financial transaction, an image of an account holder of a financial account to which funds are to be credited in connection with the financial transaction, etc.), an image of an event associated with the financial transaction (e.g., an image of an event at which the financial transaction was initiated), an image of a purchased item associated with the financial transaction (e.g., an image of a product purchased as part of an online financial transaction or as part of a financial transaction initiated at a physical retail location), an image of a purchase order associated with the financial transaction, an image of an invoice associated with the financial transaction, an image of a receipt associated with the financial transaction (e.g., an image of a physical or online-generated sales receipt), an image of a greeting card or message, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Illustrative types of electronic or multimedia content include, but are not limited to, audio files (e.g., digital music, audio books, other audio recordings, etc.), video files, electronic books (e-books), collections of images, content capable of being streamed, and so forth. Such electronic or multimedia content may be associated with and/or generated by one or more parties to the financial transaction or may be purchased or identified in connection with the financial transaction. It should be appreciated that the above-described examples of the types of content relating to the financial transaction are merely illustrative and that any of a variety of types of content are within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In various embodiments, the content relating to the financial transaction may be identified by the requestor of the financial transaction or a party to the financial transaction. In some embodiments, the requestor may also be a party to the financial transaction. For example, in the case of a request to make a P2P payment or a request to request a P2P payment, the requestor may be an account holder associated with a financial account to be debited or an account holder associated with a financial account to be credited. The requestor may also be an entity that is not a party to the financial transaction such as an account holder of a financial account associated with the financial transaction, but that is authorized to submit the request on behalf of the account holder (e.g., a user authorized to submit requests for P2P payments or requests for requests for P2P payments on behalf of a corresponding account holder). Various content (e.g., an image of an account holder associated with the financial account to be credited as part of the P2P payment, an image of an account holder associated with the financial account to be debited as part of the P2P payment, textual content, etc.) may be identified by the requestor. The client application (e.g., P2P client application, A2A client application, etc.) may provide an interface that allows the requestor or the party to the financial transaction (such as in those scenarios in which the requestor is a different entity from the party to the financial transaction) to attach, append, or otherwise associate the content with the request for the financial transaction. For example, the client application may provide functionality that allows the requestor or the party to the financial transaction to browse for content stored locally or remotely and to associate the content with the request. Alternatively, the requestor or the party to the financial transaction may designate or otherwise associate a location identifier with the request that identifies a resource where associated content is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In certain embodiments, the requestor may correspond to the payor. In other embodiments, the requestor may be an entity other than the payor such as, for example, a merchant or payee associated with the financial transaction. For example, in the case of a credit card transaction in which a payment is made to a payee (e.g., a merchant), the requestor may be the merchant who submits a request for a financial transaction on behalf of the payor. In certain embodiments, the content may be identified by the payee independently of the payor. For example, the payee may identify content (e.g., a sales receipt, electronic content purchased as part of the financial transaction, etc.) based on the nature/type of the financial transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other embodiments, the payor (e.g., the credit card holder) may specify the type of content he/she wishes to associate with the financial transaction. As a non-limiting example, a payor may identify, as part of an online purchase of a product, content to associate with the financial transaction. Such content may include any suitable content such as, for example, an image of the product purchased, an image of a sales receipt for the product purchased or textual content included in the sales receipt, and so forth. A client application through which the payor initiates the financial transaction (e.g., by submitting payment information) may provide functionality for allowing the payor to identify or otherwise specify the content to be associated with the financial transaction. For example, the payor may be permitted to attach, append, or otherwise associate the content with the financial transaction. In other embodiments, the payee (e.g., merchant) may provide a set of options of content types to associate with the financial transaction. The payor may select one or more of the content types and the payee may associate corresponding content with the financial transaction. In such scenarios, the payee may identify or generate the content corresponding to the content types selected by the payor.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In certain other embodiments, the payor and the payee may each identify content relating to the financial transaction. For example, in the case of a financial transaction initiated in the context of an event or function, the payor may identify first content relating to the financial transaction (e.g., an image of the event) and the payee (e.g., the merchant) may identify second content relating to the financial transaction (e.g., an image of a sales receipt, a textual and/or graphical representation of the sales receipt, etc.). The first content and the second content may both be presented in association with the corresponding financial transaction via an online account interface or an account statement.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In various embodiments, the request associated with the financial transaction may include the content itself. As a non-limiting example, content associated with a P2P payment request may be supplied with the request by utilizing functionality provided by the client application through which the P2P payment request is submitted. For example, the client P2P application may provide a user with a capability to attach or append the content to the request. As another non-limiting example, a request received by the service provider system which is associated with an online purchase may include content (e.g., content purchased as part of the transaction, content relating to the product or service purchased such as an image of the purchased product, textual or multimedia content generated by the purchaser as part of the online purchase, etc.) that is attached or appended to or otherwise provided in association with the request.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In those embodiments in which the content is included in or otherwise provided in conjunction with the request, the service provider system may store the content in one or more local datastores that form at least part of the service provider system. Alternatively, the service provider system may direct one or more server devices to store the content in one or more remote datastores. More specifically, the service provider system may transmit the content to the one or more server devices along with an instruction/request for the server device(s) to store the content in the remote datastore(s). As will be described in more detail hereinafter, the service provider system may subsequently retrieve or access the content by submitting a request for the content to the server device(s). In still other embodiments, the service provider system may store at least a portion of the content in the local datastore(s) and direct storage of at least a portion of the content in the remote datastore(s). For example, a portion of the content may be stored in the local datastore(s) and a remaining portion of the content may be stored in the remote datastore(s). Alternatively, multiple instances of the content may be stored to provide redundancy, where one or more instances of the content are stored in the local datastore(s) and one or more instances of the content are stored in the remote datastore(s).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In various other embodiments, the request associated with the financial transaction may include an identifier that facilitates access to and retrieval of the content associated with the financial transaction rather than the content itself. For example, the request may include an identifier that specifies a location at which the content is stored. In certain embodiments, the service provider system may utilize the identifier provided with the request to obtain or retrieve the content. Upon retrieval of the content, the service provider system may proceed to store the content locally in the one or more local datastores, or alternatively, may direct storage of the content in the remote datastore(s) as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Upon receipt of the content, either with the financial transaction request or by retrieving the content using an identifier provided with the request, the service provider system may identify a content location identifier that facilitates access to the content associated with the financial transaction. In some embodiments, the service provider system may generate the content location identifier, while in other embodiments a system, device, or program module(s) distinct from the service provider system may generate the content location identifier. If generated by a system, device, or module(s) distinct from the service provider system, the content location identifier may be obtained, received, or retrieved by the service provider system from the entity that generates the content location identifier. In those embodiments in which the request includes an identifier that identifies a location where the content is stored, that identifier may correspond to the content location identifier identified by the service provider system. Alternatively, the service provider system may utilize the identifier provided with the request to access and retrieve the content, store the content in the local datastore(s) or direct storage of the content in the remote datastore(s) upon receipt of the content, and proceed to generate a second identifier (e.g., the content location identifier) that serves to facilitate access to the content stored in the local datastore(s) and/or remote datastore(s).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The content location identifier may be any suitable identifier that facilitates access to and retrieval of the content. For example, the content location identifier may be a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that references a resource where the content is stored (e.g., the local datastore(s) and/or the remote datastore(s)). In various embodiments, the content location identifier may be a shortened URL that is shorter than a longer URL that identifies a resource where the content is stored. The shortened URL may be generated from the longer URL and may redirect to the resource identified by the longer URL. The shortened URL may be generated in accordance with any suitable URL shortening methodology. For example, the shortened URL corresponding to a longer URL may be generated using an appropriate hash function that maps the longer URL to a unique key that may be used to generate the shortened URL. In some embodiments, as will be described in more detail hereinafter, the content location identifier may include a resource locator such as a shortened URL as well as anchor text or an indication of anchor text to be included in a presentation of information associated with a financial account that is debited or credited as part of the financial transaction. For example, financial account information presented via an online application interface may include the anchor text as a selectable representation of the content location identifier (e.g., a clickable hyperlink) that, upon selection, directs a user to the resource identified by the content location identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Upon identification or generation of the content location identifier, the service provider system may generate a debit or a credit instruction associated with the financial transaction. The service provider system may embed the content location identifier within the generated debit or credit transaction or append the content location identifier thereto and transmit the debit or credit instruction to a payment network or a financial institution at which a financial account associated with the financial transaction is held. The payment network to which the debit or credit instruction may be transmitted may be any suitable payment network including, but not limited to, an ACH network, such as that supported by the Federal Reserve or the Electronic Payments Network (EPN), a proprietary network of financial institutions, a debit network, a credit network, or any other suitable payment network capable of facilitating and/or processing financial transactions between member financial institutions or between member financial institutions and non-member financial institutions. In one or more embodiments, the payment network may be a real-time payment network. The payment network may include any number of computing devices, payment gateways, routers, switches, communicative links, and so forth that facilitate financial transactions between financial institutions.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Upon receipt of the debit or credit instruction, the payment network may cause a debit or credit to be posted to a financial account. The payment network may transmit or otherwise convey the debit or credit instruction via a set of communicative links to, for example, a core account processing system associated with the financial institution which, in turn, may cause a debit or credit to be posted to the financial account. Alternatively, the payment network, via a set of communicative links to the financial institution, may cause the debit or credit to be posted to the financial account.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, rather than transmitting the debit or credit instruction to a payment network, the service provider system may transmit the debit or credit instruction to a financial institution at which a financial account to be debited or credited as part of the financial transaction is held. For example, the service provider system may transmit the debit or credit instruction via a set of communicative links to one or more program modules configured to interact with a core account processing system of the financial institution. Upon receipt of the debit or credit instruction, the program module(s) may cause an associated debit or credit to be posted to the financial account, or alternatively, may direct the core account processing system to post the debit or credit to the financial account.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As previously described, the debit or credit instruction transmitted by the service provider system may include a content location identifier that facilitates access to content relating to the financial transaction, and may optionally further include information that may be included in a representation of the content location identifier. An online banking application or other online user interface may be configured to present information (e.g., transaction and account information) associated with the financial account. Such online account information may include an indication of the posting of the debit or credit to the financial account. The presentation of information may further include a representation of the content location identifier. For example, as previously described, the content location identifier may be a shortened URL that redirects to a longer URL that identifies a resource where the associated content is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the content location identifier itself (e.g., the shortened URL) may be displayed as part of the presentation of information. In other embodiments, an alternate representation of the content location identifier may be displayed. For example, anchor text associated with the content location identifier may be displayed. The anchor text may include, for example, text that is generally descriptive of the nature/type of content with which the content location identifier is associated. The anchor text may have been provided along with the content location identifier in connection with the debit or credit instruction. In other embodiments, a key or other identifier that identifies the anchor text to display may have been supplied with the debit or credit instruction. In still other embodiments, the representation of the content location identifier may be an image such as an icon that is representative of the content or the type of content, a thumbnail image of the content itself, or the like. It should be appreciated that numerous other representations of the content location identifier are within the scope of this disclosure and may be presented.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In still further embodiments, variable free-form content may be provided in association with the content location identifier. The variable content may be distinct from anchor text which, as described earlier, may be presented as a representation of the content location identifier. The variable content may be, for example, a character string (e.g., an access code) that may be presented in association with the representation of the content location identifier, and which provides access to the content upon selection of the representation of the content location identifier and redirection to a resource where the content is stored. It should be appreciated that numerous other examples of variable content associated with the content location identifier and distinct from the content identified by the content location identifier are within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;representation of the content location identifier&#x201d; may refer to the content location identifier itself or to some other representation associated with the content location identifier. For example, the &#x201c;representation of the content location identifier&#x201d; may refer to the content location identifier (e.g., a URL that includes a combination of alphanumeric characters), anchor text displayed as part of a hyperlink associated with the content location identifier, and so forth. In various embodiments, the representation of the content location identifier included in the presentation of information may be selectable. For example, the content location identifier displayed as part of an online presentation of information associated with the financial account may be hyperlinked or otherwise selectable. In other embodiments, anchor text associated with the content location identifier may be hyperlinked or otherwise selectable. Selection of the representation of the content location identifier may initiate a process for access and retrieval of content stored at a location referenced by the content location identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the online presentation of information provided by way of the online financial application may not include a selectable representation of the content location identifier. Rather, in certain embodiments, the content location identifier (e.g., a URL) may be displayed but may not be selectable, in which case, it may be necessary for a user to copy and paste the content location identifier into, for example, a browser field to initiate a process for accessing and retrieving the associated content. In the online context, the content location identifier may not be selectable if presented, for example, as part of a downloadable online account statement.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In other embodiments, the transaction and account information associated with the financial account that is debited or credited may be presented as part of a paper statement that may be mailed to an account holder on a periodic basis. The paper statement may include a representation of the content location identifier (e.g., the content location identifier itself) or a representation of the content referenced by the content location identifier. As will be described in more detail hereinafter, upon receipt of the content location identifier provided in connection with the debit or credit instruction, the financial institution (or more specifically an online financial application associated with the financial institution) may utilize the content location identifier to access and retrieve associated content. Upon receipt of the content, a representation of the content may be generated and presented in the paper statement. Alternatively, the representation of the content may itself be received by the online financial application. The representation of the content may be displayed in the paper statement in relative proximity to other transaction information associated with the financial transaction with which the content is associated. As a non-limiting example, the content may be an image of an individual from whom funds were received as part of a P2P payment. The representation of the content that is generated and displayed in the paper statement may be a thumbnail image of the original image.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring again to the online context, as previously noted, a selectable representation of the content location identifier (e.g., a hyperlink) may be presented as part of an online presentation of financial account information. Upon selection of the representation of the content location identifier, a request for the content may be generated. In certain embodiments, the request may be directed to one or more server devices configured to access and retrieve the content from one or more remote datastores. The server device(s) may transmit the content to the requesting application (e.g., the online financial application) for presentation to a user of the requesting application. For example, the content may be presented in a pop-up window overlaying the online application interface presenting the financial account information. Alternatively, the content may be presented in a new browser window or a new browser tab separate from a browser window or tab in which the financial account information is rendered. In still other embodiments, a dedicated software application may be accessed and opened for presenting the content such as, for example, when the content is multimedia content.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In other embodiments, the request for the content may be redirected to the service provider system. Upon receipt of the request for the content, the service provider system may access the local datastore(s) to retrieve the content, or alternatively, if the content is stored in the remote datastore(s), may re-transmit the request or generate and submit another request for the content to the server device(s) that may control access to the remote datastore(s). Upon receipt or retrieval of the content, the service provider system may generate a representation of the content which may include altering the content in some fashion. For example, the service provider system may compress, partition, or otherwise modify the content to conform to specifications of the online financial account application to which the modified content may be transmitted. In other embodiments, the service provider system may transmit the content to the online financial account application in unadulterated form. Upon receipt of the content, the online financial account application may modify the content according to various specifications prior to presenting the content to a user. Selection of the selectable representation of the content location identifier may cause the online financial account application to receive or retrieve the content and control the presentation of the content to a user. Alternatively, selection of the representation of the content location identifier may cause the user (e.g., the browser via which the user is accessing the financial account application) to be redirected to a resource hosted by the service provider system (or an alternate resource) such that the server provider system may control presentation of the content to the user.</p>

For example, in certain embodiments, such as those in which the content is stored in the remote datastore(s) <b>114</b>, the service provider computer(s) <b>106</b> may receive the content location identifier <b>122</b> from the server device(s) <b>112</b>. Further, in those embodiments in which the request <b>124</b> does not include the content <b>128</b> but instead includes an identifier that identifies a location where the content <b>128</b> is stored, the content location identifier <b>122</b> may correspond to the identifier provided with the request <b>124</b>. Alternatively, in certain of those embodiments in which the request <b>124</b> includes an identifier associated with the content <b>128</b> rather than the content <b>128</b> itself, the processor(s) <b>202</b> may execute computer-executable instructions included in the content location identifier identification module <b>210</b> and/or the content storage and retrieval module <b>216</b> to retrieve the content <b>128</b> from the resource (e.g., the remote datastore(s) <b>126</b>) where the content <b>128</b> is stored using the identifier provided with the request <b>124</b>, store or direct storage of the content <b>128</b> in the local datastore(s) <b>108</b> and/or the remote datastore(s) <b>114</b>, respectively, and generate the content location identifier <b>122</b> or receive the content location identifier <b>122</b> from the server device(s) <b>112</b>. In various embodiments, the processor(s) <b>202</b> may execute computer-executable instructions provided as part of the content location identifier generation module <b>212</b> to generate the content location identifier <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at operation <b>306</b>, the service provider system <b>104</b> may generate a debit or credit instruction <b>130</b> associated with the financial transaction based on the request received at operation <b>302</b>. For example, the processor(s) <b>202</b> may execute computer-executable instructions included in the payment instruction generation module <b>214</b> to generate the debit or credit instruction <b>130</b>. The debit or credit instruction <b>130</b> may be generated in accordance with a standard that specifies various formatting requirements that the debit or credit instruction <b>130</b> must adhere to in order to provide for interoperability between various payment networks and financial institutions.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The content location identifier <b>122</b> identified (or generated) at operation <b>304</b> may comprise a content locator (e.g., a URL) that identifies a location where the associated content <b>128</b> is stored.
