<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to semiconductor testing apparatuses. In an embodiment, the disclosure relates to chucks for supporting a solar cell in hot spot testing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Localized heating, or &#x201c;hot spots,&#x201d; in a solar cell can occur because of interconnection failure, cell failure, partial shading, mismatch of photo current from solar cell to solar cell, and/or partial shading. For example, when a single solar cell connected in series generates less current than other solar cells in the series, localized heating may occur because the current flowing through each solar cell in the series is not equal. Damage to, for example, a module of solar cells can occur if the localized heating of one or more solar cells become too high.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many tests have been developed to test the ability of a solar cell to withstand hot spot heating. In these tests, a solar cell can reach a temperature of approximately 120&#xb0; C., and this heat is not easily dissipated during testing. When testing a large number of solar cells, the tests need to be stopped or delayed for a certain time between each solar cell to allow a testing apparatus to cool down. However, this delay reduces the speed of the tests and therefore allows only a very limited number of solar cells to be tested at a given time.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, a chuck to support a solar cell in hot spot testing is provided. Here, the solar cell has a top surface and a bottom surface. This chuck comprises a base portion and a support portion disposed above the base portion. The support portion is configured to support the solar cell above the base portion and to define a space, between the bottom surface of the solar cell and the base portion, that thermally separates a portion of the bottom surface of the solar cell from the base portion. It should be noted that, in this embodiment, the portion of the bottom surface that is thermally separated comprises between about 70% and about 90% of the bottom surface, which has metal conductors. However, the top surface is absent of any metal conductors. The chuck additionally comprises a bore through the base portion and the support portion. This bore is configured to allow a probe to make contact with the metal conductors through the bore. The probe is configured to apply a negative bias voltage to the solar cell.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, a hot spot testing apparatus is provided. The hot spot testing apparatus comprises a thermal imaging camera configured to detect heat distribution over a top surface of a solar cell, where the top surface is absent of any metal conductors. Additionally included is a chuck disposed below the thermal imaging camera. The chuck comprises a base portion and a support portion configured to support the solar cell above the base portion and configured to define a space, between a bottom surface of the solar cell and the base portion, that thermally separates a portion of the bottom surface of the solar cell from the base portion. Here, the bottom surface has metal conductors. The chuck further comprises a bore through at least the base portion and additionally comprises a probe disposed below the chuck. This probe is configured to make contact with the metal conductors through the bore and to apply a negative bias voltage to the solar cell.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another embodiment, a chuck to support a solar cell in hot spot testing is provided. This embodiment of the chuck comprises a base portion and a support portion disposed above the base portion. The support portion is configured to support the solar cell above the base portion and to define a space, between a bottom surface of the solar cell and the base portion, that thermally separates a portion of the bottom surface of the solar cell from the base portion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one other embodiment, a method of hot spot testing a solar cell, which has a top surface and a bottom surface, is provided. In this method, the solar cell is transported over a chuck. This chuck comprises a base portion and a support portion disposed above the base portion. The support portion is configured to support the solar cell above the base portion and configured to define a space, between the bottom surface of the solar cell and the base portion, that thermally separates a portion of the bottom surface of the solar cell from the base portion. In this embodiment, the portion of the bottom surface that is thermally separated comprises between about 70% and about 90% of the bottom surface. Here, the bottom surface of the solar cell has metal conductors while the top surface is absent of any metal conductors. The chuck further comprises a bore through the base portion and the support portion, a side portion, and a vacuum tunnel having openings at two ends, where one of the openings is located within substantially a same region of the bore and another of the openings is located at the side portion. In this method, a vacuum suction is applied through the vacuum tunnel to hold the solar cell in place, and a negative bias voltage is applied to the solar cell through the metal conductors. A heat distribution of the top surface is detected upon application of the negative bias voltage.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following description and the drawings illustrate specific embodiments of the invention sufficiently to enable those skilled in the art to practice them. Other embodiments may incorporate structural, logical, electrical, process, and other changes. Examples merely typify possible variations. Individual components and functions are optional unless explicitly required, and the sequence of operations may vary. Portions and features of some embodiments may be included in or substituted for those of others. Embodiments of the invention set forth in the claims encompass all available equivalents of those claims. Embodiments of the invention may be referred to, individually or collectively, herein by the term &#x201c;invention&#x201d; merely for convenience and without intending to limit the scope of this application to any single invention or inventive concept if more than one is in fact disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a hot spot testing apparatus <b>100</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The hot spot testing apparatus <b>100</b> tests an ability of the solar cell <b>104</b> to withstand hot spot heating. In this example, the hot spot testing apparatus <b>100</b> includes a thermal imaging camera <b>102</b>, a solar cell <b>104</b>, a chuck <b>106</b>, and probes <b>108</b>. The solar cell <b>104</b> is placed on top of the chuck <b>106</b>, which is configured to hold or support the solar cell <b>104</b>. To test the solar cell <b>104</b> for hot spots, the probes <b>108</b> disposed below the chuck <b>106</b> are configured to make contact with metal conductors located on the bottom of the solar cell <b>104</b> and apply a negative bias voltage. As explained in more detail below, the chuck <b>106</b> may include bores (not shown) from which the probes <b>108</b> pass through in order to make contact with the metal conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With the application of the negative bias voltage, the solar cell <b>104</b> becomes, for example, short-circuited and dissipates power in the form of heat. The thermal imaging camera <b>102</b>, which is disposed above the solar cell <b>104</b>, can detect this heat distribution over a surface of the solar cell <b>104</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a thermal image of a top surface of the solar cell <b>104</b> during hot spot testing. As depicted, the application of the negative bias voltage generates localized heating of the solar cell <b>104</b> where regions of the solar cell <b>104</b> are heated to different temperatures that range from, for example, 20&#xb0; C. to 26&#xb0; C. From the thermal image detected by the thermal imaging camera <b>102</b>, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the ability of the solar cell <b>104</b> to withstand hot spot heating can be identified.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a diagram of a cross-sectional view of an example of a solar cell <b>104</b>. The solar cell <b>104</b> employs a silicon wafer <b>301</b> having a top surface <b>302</b> configured to face the sun to receive solar radiation and a bottom surface <b>304</b> where metal conductors <b>306</b> to the solar cell <b>104</b> are formed. The solar cell <b>104</b> includes p-type polysilicon regions <b>308</b> and n-type polysilicon regions <b>310</b> formed in a polysilicon layer on the bottom surface <b>304</b> of the solar cell <b>104</b>. The bottom surface polysilicon layer may be doped to have the p-type polysilicon regions <b>308</b> and n-type polysilicon regions <b>310</b>, with each adjacent p-type polysilicon region <b>308</b> and n-type polysilicon region <b>310</b> forming a p-n junction. Metal conductors <b>306</b> are connected to the p-type polysilicon regions <b>308</b> and n-type polysilicon regions <b>310</b> to allow external circuits and devices to receive electrical power from the solar cell <b>104</b>, or alternatively, to allow external circuits and devices to deliver electrical power to the solar cell <b>104</b> in hot spot testing. Given that the polysilicon layer is formed on the bottom surface <b>304</b> of the solar cell <b>104</b>, the top surface <b>302</b> is absent of any metal conductors, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> depict different views of a chuck <b>400</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, configured to support a solar cell <b>104</b> in a hot spot testing apparatus, such as the hot spot testing apparatus <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> depicts a top view of the chuck <b>400</b> while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> depicts a side view of the chuck <b>400</b> in support of a solar cell <b>104</b>. In this embodiment, the chuck <b>400</b>, as depicted, is rectangular in shape, but it should be appreciated that in other embodiments, the chuck <b>400</b> may be formed in a variety of other shapes, such as squares, triangles, ovals, and circles. The chuck <b>400</b> includes a base portion <b>404</b> and support portions <b>402</b> that, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, are disposed above the base portion <b>404</b>. The chuck <b>400</b> additionally includes bores <b>406</b> through the base portion <b>404</b> and the support portions <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The support portions <b>402</b> are configured to support the solar cell <b>104</b> above the base portion <b>404</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the support portions <b>402</b> are shaped as rectangles, but may be any suitable shape and/or size such as, for example, squares, ovals, cylinders, and triangles. It should be noted that in hot spot testing, heat generated from the solar cell <b>104</b> is transferred to the chuck <b>400</b>. To possibly reduce the amount of heat transferred to the chuck <b>400</b>, the surface area of contact between the bottom surface (such as bottom surface <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the solar cell <b>104</b> and the chuck <b>400</b> can be minimalized by supporting the solar cell <b>104</b> with the support portions <b>402</b> rather than the entire surface of the chuck <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally, the support portions <b>402</b> define a space <b>409</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, between the bottom surface of the solar cell <b>104</b> and the base portion <b>404</b>. That is, the elevation of the solar cell <b>104</b> above the base portion <b>404</b> of the chuck <b>400</b> creates a space <b>409</b>. This space <b>409</b> may, in one embodiment, be greater than or equal to about 0.5 millimeters. In another embodiment, the space <b>409</b> may be greater than or equal to about 1.5 millimeters. As used herein, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; means that the specified dimension or parameter may be varied within an acceptable tolerance for a given design or application. In some embodiments, for example, an acceptable tolerance for a parameter is &#xb1;10%. It should be noted that this space <b>409</b> serves to thermally separate a portion of the bottom surface of the solar cell <b>104</b> from the base portion <b>404</b>. As used herein, &#x201c;thermal separation&#x201d; refers to a temperature division between two or more areas at different temperatures. In effect, the space <b>409</b> serves as insulation between the base portion <b>404</b> and the bottom surface of the solar cell <b>104</b>. The space may reduce the amount of heat transferred from the base portion <b>404</b> of the chuck <b>400</b> to the solar cell <b>104</b>. For example, thermal separation can be defined in terms of thermal conductivity of a material, liquid, or gas that, as discussed above, thermally separates the base portion <b>404</b> from the bottom surface of the solar cell <b>104</b>. In one example, the thermal conductivity of air is about 0.025 W/(m*K).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the bores <b>406</b> are holes through, for example, the base portion <b>404</b> and the support portions <b>402</b>. As discussed above, the example of the solar cell <b>104</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> has a bottom surface where metal conductors are formed. In hot spot testing, probes apply negative voltage to the solar cell <b>104</b> through the metal conductors. The bores <b>406</b> allow such probes to pass through in order to make contact with the metal conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> depict various views of chucks <b>500</b> and <b>500</b>&#x2032;, in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention, configured to support a solar cell in a hot spot testing apparatus, such as the hot spot testing apparatus <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the chucks <b>500</b> and <b>500</b>&#x2032; are configured to support or hold a solar cell (not shown) in hot spot testing and are separated by a channel <b>514</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> depicts a top view of the chucks <b>500</b> and <b>500</b>&#x2032; while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> depicts a side view of one chuck <b>500</b>. In this alternate embodiment, each chuck <b>500</b> or <b>500</b>&#x2032; includes a base portion <b>508</b> (as illustrated with a hatched pattern in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) and a support portion <b>510</b> that is disposed above the base portion <b>508</b>. Additionally, each chuck <b>500</b> or <b>500</b>&#x2032; includes bores <b>504</b>, mounting holes <b>502</b>, vacuum tunnel openings <b>505</b> and <b>506</b>, and straight channels <b>512</b>. The bores <b>504</b>, as discussed above, are configured to allow probes to make contact with the metal conductors formed on the bottom surface of a solar cell. The mounting holes <b>502</b> are used to secure the chucks <b>500</b> and <b>500</b>&#x2032; to, for example, a table included in a hot spot testing apparatus. The chucks <b>500</b> and <b>500</b>&#x2032; may be secured with screws, bolts, or other fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The support portion <b>510</b> is configured to support the solar cell above the base portion <b>508</b> and to define a space between the bottom surface of the solar cell and the base portion <b>508</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the portion of the bottom surface of the solar cell that is thermally separated comprises between about 70% and about 90% of the bottom surface. In other words, about 10% to about 30% of the bottom surface is supported by the support portion <b>510</b>. In one embodiment, at least about 26% of the bottom surface of a 150 mm&#xd7;150 mm solar cell is supported by the two chucks <b>500</b> and <b>500</b>&#x2032; depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. As a result of the thermal separation created by the space between the bottom surface of the solar cell and base portion <b>508</b>, the amount of heat transferred from the solar cell to the chucks <b>500</b> and <b>500</b>&#x2032; may be reduced to between about 0.020 W/(m*K) and 0.030 W/(m*K).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition to supporting the solar cell, the chucks <b>500</b> and <b>500</b>&#x2032; also hold the solar cell in place during hot spot testing. In one example, the solar cell can be held in place with the use of vacuum suction. The vacuum can be applied through vacuum tunnels to force the bottom surface of the solar cell to adhere to a surface of the support portion <b>510</b>. Each vacuum tunnel has at least two openings <b>505</b> and <b>506</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, each chuck <b>500</b> or <b>500</b>&#x2032; includes at least one side, and in one embodiment, one vacuum tunnel opening <b>505</b> can be located at the side. The other vacuum tunnel openings <b>506</b> may be located on a surface of the support portion <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> depicts a magnified view of a support portion <b>510</b> having a vacuum tunnel opening <b>506</b> located near a bore <b>504</b>. In one embodiment, each vacuum tunnel opening <b>506</b> located at the surface of the support portion <b>510</b> can be located within substantially the same region of the bore <b>504</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; means that the specified dimension may extend within an acceptable tolerance for a given application. This dimension may depend on the geometry or shape of the vacuum tunnel opening <b>506</b> and/or the bore <b>504</b>, the force of the applied vacuum, and/or the force applied by probes when in contact with the solar cell. In one embodiment, a distance <b>511</b> or dimension between a vacuum tunnel opening <b>506</b> and a bore <b>504</b> may range from about 1 millimeter to about 2 millimeters. For example, the distance <b>511</b> may be about 1.9 millimeters. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the vacuum tunnel openings <b>506</b> are located substantially within the same region of the bores <b>504</b> to possibly reduce, for example, the sheer force applied to a cell solar cell resulting from the vacuum force and an opposite force applied by probes when in contact with the bottom surface of the solar cell. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref>, each vacuum tunnel opening <b>505</b> or <b>506</b> is circular or crescent in shape, but it should be appreciated that in other embodiments, the vacuum tunnel openings <b>505</b> or <b>506</b> may be formed in a variety of other shapes, such as rectangles and ovals.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The support portions of the chucks <b>500</b> and <b>500</b>&#x2032; also include a number of straight channels <b>512</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> depicts a magnified view of these straight channels <b>512</b>. Each solar cell has a corner, and a number of these straight channels <b>512</b> are configured to contact a portion of the corner. Given that each channel of the straight channels <b>512</b> is separated from the other channels by a space, the straight channels <b>512</b> are configured to reduce surface contact of the support portion <b>510</b> with the corner of the solar cell. In one example, the straight channels <b>512</b> may be located within the vicinity of corners of the solar cell to accommodate the different sizes of the solar cells, such as 150 mm&#xd7;150 mm, 125.50 mm&#xd7;125.50 mm, and other sizes. For example, a corner of a large solar cell is in contact with a larger number of straight channels <b>512</b> when held in place by a chuck compared to a smaller solar cell.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be appreciated that the chucks <b>500</b> and <b>500</b>&#x2032; may be comprised of a variety of different materials. In one embodiment, heat transfer may be further reduced with the use of plastic polymers. Examples of plastic polymers include polyether ether ketone (PEEK), GAROLITE, MC NYLON, polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride (BAKELITE), MICROTHERM SUPER G, and other plastic polymers. In one embodiment, the plastic polymer has a thermal conductivity between about 0.250 W/(m*K) and about 0.288 W/(m*K). Examples of such plastic polymers include PEEK and GAROLITE. Additionally, the selection of the plastic polymer for the chucks <b>500</b> and <b>500</b>&#x2032; may be based on the tensile strength of the plastic polymer. In one embodiment, the plastic polymer may have a tensile strength between about 95 MPa and about 100 MPa. Examples of plastic polymers with tensile strengths in this range include PEEK and MC NYLON.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a flow diagram of a general overview of a method <b>600</b> in accordance with an embodiment for hot spot testing solar cells. In an example embodiment, the method <b>600</b> may be implemented by the hot spot testing apparatus <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a solar cell is transported over a chuck at <b>602</b>. In this example, the solar cell has a top surface and a bottom surface, where the bottom surface has metal conductors while the top surface is absent of any metal conductors. The chuck that supports the solar cell has a base portion and a support portion disposed above the base portion, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To hold the solar cell in place, vacuum suction is applied at <b>604</b> through vacuum tunnels of the chuck. With the solar cell held in place, probes may make contact with the bottom surface of the solar cell and apply, at <b>606</b>, a negative bias voltage to the solar cell through the metal conductors. With the negative all bias voltage applied, regions of the solar cell are heated, and at <b>608</b>, the heat distribution on the top surface of the solar cell is detected. After the heat distribution is detected, vacuum suction is stopped and the solar cell, which is heated, is transferred away from the chuck. The method <b>600</b> is then repeated for another solar cell. The use of the chuck as described above to support the solar cell may, for example, reduce the amount of heat transferred from the heated solar cell to the chuck. Thus, the chuck may not be significantly heated during hot spot testing. A subsequent solar cell can therefore be quickly transported over the chuck without the chuck transferring significant heat from a previous hot spot test. As a result, the use of the various embodiments of chucks described above in hot spot testing may, for example, facilitate the testing of a large number of solar cells for hot spots in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
