<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a multi-phase clock signal generator, a signal phase adjusting loop utilizing the multi-phase clock signal generator, and a multi-phase clock signal generating method, and particularly relates to a multi-phase clock signal generator comprising a ring phase shifting loop, a signal phase adjusting loop utilizing the multi-phase clock signal generator, and a multi-phase clock signal generating method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A multi-phase clock signal generator is always applied to the electronic apparatus needing clock signals with different phases, such as a DDR (double date rate) ram.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the circuit or method for generating multi-phase clock signals always needs huge circuit region or complicated design. For example, a quadratur PLL utilizing a quadrature oscillator may be utilized to generate multi-phase clock signals. However, a frequency of the quadrature oscillator is controlled by voltage and very sensitive to supply voltage noise. Also, a frequency of the quadrature oscillator is not actively driven by external clock frequency and is free running. Also, such structure needs a large circuit region and high power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also, an analog multi-phase generator utilizing a delay chain controlled by a charge pump is also utilized to generate multi-phase clock signals. However, such circuit also has huge circuit area and may induce high power consumption. Besides, analog logic is relatively difficult for process portability, sensitivity for high yield in mass production.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, phase skew problems may exist in the multi-phase clock signals. The phase skew problems are difficult in achieving high accuracy. For example, some prior arts may utilize a plurality of delay lock loops to correct the phase skew issue. However, such structure needs a large circuit size, high power consumption and very complicated control logic. The locking time is too long, which is not appropriate for high speed applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One objective of the present application is to provide a multi-phase clock generator with small circuit size and very low power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another objective of the present application is to provide a multi-phase clock generator that can correct phase skew issue.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One embodiment of the present application provides a multi-phase clock signal generator, comprising: a ring phase shifting loop, having a plurality of output terminals and phase shifting units, for phase-shifting a input clock signal to generate output clock signals with different phases, wherein the output clock signals are respectively output at different output terminals respectively located between the phase shifting units.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another embodiment discloses a signal phase adjusting loop, comprising: a multiphase generator, comprising: a ring phase shifting loop, having a plurality of output terminals and phase shifting units, for phase-shifting the delayed input clock signal to generate output clock signals with different phases, wherein the output clock signals are respectively output at different output terminals; and a phase adjusting circuit, for receiving one of the output clock signals and a input signal, to adjust a phase of the input signal according to a phase of the one of the output clock signals.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another embodiment discloses a multi-phase clock signal generating method, comprising: (a) providing a plurality of phase shifting units to form a ring phase shifting loop; (b) utilizing the phase shifting units to phase-shift a input clock signal to generate output clock signals with different phases; and (c) selecting at least one part of output terminals respectively between the phase shifting units to output the selected output clock signals.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another embodiment discloses a multi-phase clock signal generator, comprising: a ring phase shifting loop (<b>801</b>), including a plurality of controllable delay cells, for generating output clock signals having different phases via the controllable delay cells according to a input clock signal, wherein delay amount of the controllable delay cells are determined by a biasing voltage; a phase skew detecting circuit (<b>805</b>), for computing phase differences of the output clock signals to generate a phase skew detecting signal; and a biasing circuit (<b>803</b>), for providing the biasing voltage according to the phase skew detecting signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another embodiment discloses a multi-phase clock signal generating method, comprising: generating output clock signals having different phases via at least one controllable delay cells according to a input clock signal, wherein delay amount of the controllable delay cells are determined by a biasing voltage; computing phase differences of the output clock signals to generate a phase skew detecting signal; and providing the biasing voltage according to the phase skew detecting signal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of above-mentioned embodiments, accurate multi-phase clock signals can be generated by utilizing a small number of devices. Circuit layout size and power consumption can minimized. Meanwhile, the resolution of the multi-phase clock signals can be pre-selected via changing the integer N. The frequency of the multi-phase clock signals is only determined by external clock signal and will not be affected by supply voltage noises. Additionally, via utilizing the phase skew sensing mechanism according to the present application, the phase skew difference can be linearly sensed to adjust the outputs phase skew.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Via utilizing feedback biasing voltage, high phase skew accuracy through ultra wide range operating frequency can be acquired. Actively driven balanced Bias generation concept is for Power down saving mode, which maintains prior Bias information before entering power down.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a multi-phase clock signal generator <b>100</b> according to one embodiment of the present application. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the multi-phase clock signal generator <b>100</b> includes a ring phase shifting loop <b>101</b>, which has a plurality of output terminals and phase shifting units, for phase-shifting a input clock signal CLK<sub>i</sub>, CLK<sub>iF </sub>to generate output clock signals CLK<sub>1</sub>, CLK<sub>2</sub>, CLK<sub>3 </sub>and CLK<sub>4 </sub>with different phases.

The output clock signals CLK<sub>1</sub>, CLK<sub>2</sub>, CLK<sub>3 </sub>and CLK<sub>4 </sub>are respectively output at different output terminals. The number of the output clocks and the out put terminals are <b>4</b> in this example. The output clock signals CLK<sub>1</sub>, CLK<sub>2</sub>, CLK<sub>3 </sub>and CLK<sub>4 </sub>are generated based on external clock signals (i.e. the input clock signal CLK<sub>i </sub>and CLK<sub>iF</sub>). The ring phase shifting loop <b>101</b> idles if no external clock signals are transmitted to the ring phase shifting loop <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-FIG</figref>. <b>5</b> are circuit diagrams illustrating detail structures of the block diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, according to embodiments of the present application. The common feature of the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-FIG</figref>. <b>5</b> is that the ring phase shifting loop has a plurality of phase shifting units arranged to form a ring, and has a plurality of output terminals located between phase shifting units the to output the output clock signals with different phases. The detail circuit structures thereof are described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the ring phase shifting loop <b>201</b> has four phase shifting units <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>207</b>, and <b>209</b> arranged in a ring. Also, the ring phase shifting loop <b>201</b> includes a plurality of output terminals <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> respectively locating between the phase shifting units <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>207</b>, and <b>209</b>. Additionally, the ring phase shifting loop <b>201</b> includes a plurality of loading match components <b>211</b> and <b>213</b>, coupled to the output terminals <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> and the phase shifting units <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>207</b>, and <b>209</b>. The phase shifting units <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>207</b>, and <b>209</b>, which are phase mixing units for phase mixing in this example, serve to phase splitting and interpolating the input clock signal CLK<sub>i </sub>and CLK<sub>iF </sub>to generate clock signals with different phases. Please note that the phase shifting units <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>207</b>, and <b>209</b> can be drivers inside the ring phase shifting loop <b>201</b>. The loading match components <b>211</b> and <b>213</b> serve to provide balanced loading to the ring phase shifting loop <b>201</b>, such that the clocks signals at the output terminals <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> can have desired phase shift. In this embodiment, the output clock signals respectively have 0&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 180&#xb0; and 270&#xb0; phase difference from the input clock signal CLK<sub>i</sub>. That is, the multi-phase clock signal generator <b>200</b> has an integer N=4. Please note that the inter N can be changed, if the number of phase shifting units is changed or the selected output terminal number is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Besides the ring phase shifting loop <b>201</b>, the multi-phase clock signal generator <b>200</b> can include other devices such as the clock drivers <b>215</b>, <b>217</b>, and the output drivers <b>219</b>, <b>221</b> and <b>223</b>, but do not mean to limit the scope of the present application. The clock drivers <b>215</b>, <b>217</b> serve to drive the input clock signal CLK<sub>i </sub>and CLK<sub>iF</sub>, and the output drivers <b>219</b>, <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> serve to drive the output clock signals such that the output clock signals can match the requirements of follow up processes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the wave forms of the embodiments disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the clock waveforms of phase &#x3c6;, 90&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, 270&#xb0; respectively having 0&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 180&#xb0; and 270&#xb0; phase difference from the input clock signal CLK<sub>i</sub>. Phase skews may exist between different clock signals due to the device delay or other reasons, but are ignored in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> for brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which is a circuit diagram according to another embodiment of the present application. In this case, the multi-phase clock signal generator <b>300</b> also includes a phase shifting loop <b>301</b>, a clock driver <b>323</b>, and output drivers <b>325</b>, <b>327</b>, <b>329</b> and <b>331</b>. However, the structure of the phase shifting loop <b>301</b> is slightly different from which of the phase shifting loop <b>201</b>. Eight phase shifting units <b>303</b>-<b>317</b>, which are also phase mixing units in this example, are included in the phase shifting loop <b>301</b> rather than four phase shifting units in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Besides, the phase shifting loop <b>301</b> has latches <b>319</b> and <b>321</b>, for fixing the phases of the clock signals at the output terminals <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> and <b>310</b>, in addition with or without the loading match components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Additionally, the input clock can be a single ended input signal here.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although the phase shifting loop <b>301</b> has eight phase shifting devices, the phase shifting loop <b>301</b> still includes four output terminals <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> and <b>310</b>. Such kind of structure calls are called a 2N structure, which means the number of the output terminals is half of the number of phase shifting units. It is especially useful for odd number of clock phase generation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which is a circuit diagram according to another embodiment of the present application. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also discloses a phase shifting loop <b>401</b>, clock drivers <b>417</b>, <b>419</b> and output drivers <b>421</b>, <b>423</b>, <b>425</b> and <b>427</b>. The phase shifting loop <b>401</b> includes latches <b>403</b>, <b>405</b>, <b>407</b>, and <b>409</b>. The latches <b>403</b>, <b>405</b>, <b>407</b>, and <b>409</b>, which serve as phase shifting units, latch phases the input clock signal such that it can output phase-shifted clock signal, to generate clock signals with different phases. The latch <b>411</b> can be a latch which's type is different from which of the latches <b>403</b>, <b>405</b>, <b>407</b>, <b>409</b> and <b>411</b>. Via utilizing latches as phase shifting units, the mismatches among output terminals can be reduced. The latch <b>411</b> serves to fix the phases of the clock signals at the output terminals <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> and <b>410</b>. Also, the phase shifting loop <b>401</b> includes loading match units <b>413</b> and <b>415</b> to provide desired loading to the ring phase shifting loop <b>401</b>, such that the clocks signals at the output terminals <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> can have desired phase shift. In this embodiment, the output clock signals respectively have 0&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 180&#xb0; and 270&#xb0; phase differences from the input clock signal CLK<sub>i</sub>. The waveforms of the input clock signals CLKi, CLKiF, and output clock signals are the same as which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Thus it is omitted for brevity here.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which is a circuit diagram according to another embodiment of the present application. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the multi-phase clock signal generator <b>500</b> includes clock drivers <b>523</b> and <b>525</b>, and a phase shifting loop <b>501</b>. The phase shifting loop <b>501</b> has six phase shifting units <b>503</b>-<b>513</b>. Accordingly, the six output terminals <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>512</b> respectively output clocks signals having 0&#xb0;, 60&#xb0;, 120&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;240&#xb0; and 300&#xb0; phase differences from the input clock signal CLK<sub>i</sub>. That is, the N in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is <b>6</b>. Besides, the phase shifting loop <b>501</b> includes loading match components <b>515</b>, <b>517</b>, and latches <b>519</b>, <b>521</b>. All the clock phases are generated by mutual phase interpolating of CLKi and CLKif. Please note that the concept disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can be applied to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. That is, the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes N=<b>6</b>, but it can be extended to N=2&#xd7;3 or N=2&#xd7;6. N=2&#xd7;3 indicates that a number of the phase shifting units is 6 but a number of the output terminals is 3. Besides, N=2&#xd7;6 indicates that a number of the phase shifting units is 12 but a number of the output terminals is 12. More phase shifting units are utilized, higher power the multiphase-generator circuit causes, but higher solution is acquired. On the contrary, less phase shifting units are utilized, lower power the multiphase-generator circuit causes, but lower solution is acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram illustrating how the multi-phase clock signal generator is applied to a DLL (Delay lock loop). Such a DLL can be applied to a memory device such as a DDR RAM, but not limited. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the delay lock loop <b>600</b> includes a controllable delay line <b>601</b>, a phase detector <b>603</b> and a delay control circuit <b>605</b>. The controllable delay line <b>601</b> delays an input clock signal IS to generate a delayed input clock signal CLK<sub>i</sub>, CLKiF (i.e. the input clock signals in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>) according to a control signal CS. The controllable delay line <b>601</b> delays an input clock signal IS to generate a delayed input clock signal according to a control signal CS.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The multiphase generator <b>607</b>, which can utilize the circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, generates a plurality of output clock signals CLK<sub>1</sub>, CLK<sub>2</sub>, and CLK<sub>3 </sub>according to the delayed input clock signal CLK<sub>i</sub>, CLKiF. The phase detector <b>603</b> receives a one of the output clock signals (CLK<sub>1</sub>), which has a phase substantially the same as the delayed input clock signal CLK<sub>i </sub>and detects phases of the output clock signal CLK<sub>1 </sub>and the input clock signal IS, to generate the phase difference information. The delay control circuit <b>605</b> generates the control signal CS to adjust the delay amount of the controllable delay line <b>601</b> according to the phase difference information. By this way, the multiphase generator <b>607</b> not only generates the output clock signal CLK<sub>1</sub>, but can generate output clock signals with other phases for other purposes. For example, all the output clock signals CLK<sub>1</sub>, CLK<sub>2</sub>, CLK<sub>3 </sub>. . . can form a clock bus and proper logic to utilize it and transmitted to a data output buffer <b>609</b> to output data.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Please note that the multiphase generator <b>607</b> is not limited to be utilized in a DLL.

For a DLL, the phase adjusting circuit <b>602</b> includes the delay line <b>601</b>, the phase detector <b>603</b> and the delay control circuit <b>605</b>. However, if the multiphase generator <b>607</b> is applied to a PLL, the phase adjusting circuit <b>602</b> can include a phase detector, a charge pump, and a low pass filter. Such variation should also be included in the scope of the present application.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the phase skew issue. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the phases of output clock signals CLK<sub>1</sub>, CLK<sub>2</sub>, CLK<sub>3 </sub>and CLK<sub>4 </sub>may drift due to various kinds of reasons. Accordingly, the phase difference signals &#x394;P<sub>1</sub>, &#x394;P<sub>2</sub>, &#x394;P<sub>3 </sub>and &#x394;P<sub>4 </sub>are ideally having the same phase interval, which means output clock signals CLK<sub>1</sub>, CLK<sub>2</sub>, CLK<sub>3 </sub>and CLK<sub>4 </sub>having the same phase difference, but practically not. A phase skew detection signal &#x394;D<sub>N </sub>is utilized to indicate the skew difference of &#x394;P<sub>1</sub>, &#x394;P<sub>2</sub>, &#x394;P<sub>3 </sub>and &#x394;P<sub>4 </sub>. The signal &#x394;D<sub>N </sub>keeps low only when &#x394;P=&#x394;P<sub>2</sub>=&#x394;P<sub>3</sub>=&#x394;P<sub>4 </sub>due to phase detector diff-pair configuration as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. If the clock signals CLK<sub>1</sub>, CLK<sub>2</sub>, CLK<sub>3 </sub>and CLK<sub>4 </sub>are adjusted to such state. This state is called phase skew lock-in condition, which means phase skew is minimized within sensing resolution. It needs a huge circuit or complicated design to adjust the clock signals to phase skew lock-in condition in prior arts.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a power down saving mode. In the power down saving mode, the phase skew difference is bypassed, ignoring phase-in-lock or not. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the regions Y<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>3 </sub>and Y<sub>4 </sub>in the phase difference signals &#x394;P<sub>1</sub>, &#x394;P<sub>2</sub>, &#x394;P<sub>3 </sub>and &#x394;P<sub>4 </sub>indicate the real phase differences. After adjusting, the regions Y<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>3 </sub>and Y<sub>4 </sub>will be adjusted to the pulses X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>3 </sub>and X<sub>4</sub>. That is, the differences in the phase difference signals &#x394;P<sub>1</sub>, &#x394;P<sub>2</sub>, &#x394;P<sub>3 </sub>and &#x394;P<sub>4 </sub>will be adjusted to be the same value, even if the phase difference still exist between the output clock signals. By this way, the phase skew detecting signal &#x394;D<sub>N </sub>can be kept at a low level, and the phase skew issue can be ignored. The areas of pulses X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>3 </sub>and X<sub>4 </sub>can be determined by pull-up/pull-down standby current amount. Such condition is named an ultra low power lock-in condition.</p>
