<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Reference is made to commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/240,112 filed concurrently herewith, entitled &#x201c;Operating a Selectively Interconnected Modular Printing System&#x201d; by Kevin M. Gobeyn et al, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for configuring a modular printing system, having a plurality of modules that are configured to be selectively interconnected to form different printing system configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to printing apparatus for web media and more particularly relates to non-contact printing that uses a configurable, modular arrangement of components.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Continuous web printing permits economical, high-speed, high-volume print reproduction. In this type of printing, a continuous web of paper or other substrate material is fed past one or more printing subsystems that form images by applying one or more colorants onto the substrate surface. This type of printing has a number of advantages over conventional web printing methods. In a conventional web-fed rotary press, for example, a web substrate is fed through one or more impression cylinders that perform contact printing, transferring ink from an imaging roller onto the web in a continuous manner. These earlier contact printing systems tend to have heavy frame structures, precision-designed components, and complex and costly alignment procedures for precisely adjusting substrate transport between components and subsystems. For this reason, conventional contact-printing systems generally have fixed configurations, with equipment designs that are specific for a restricted range of printing applications and relatively narrow range of media and ink types.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With recent advances in inkjet printing technology, non-contact printing has demonstrated capabilities for high-speed continuous web printing with suitable image quality and provides a range of features that support improvements in equipment flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency. These techniques are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2011/0128337 entitled &#x201c;Media Transport System For Non-Contact Printing&#x201d;, by Muir et al. Using digitally controlled print-heads that direct fine dots of ink across an air gap and onto the rapidly moving print media, non-contact printing offers a number of advantages not available with these earlier contact-printing systems. Because impression rollers with attached printing plates are not used with these systems, the design of such systems permits more flexibility than was previously available in terms of colorants and other liquids that can be applied, operating speeds, permitted media types, sizes, print formats, and other attributes. In addition, because print content is not transferred from a contacting roller, the printing format/layout of a non-contact digital printing is not limited by an impression roller diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As non-contact printing systems are being developed, a number of design advantages present themselves, including interchangeability of components and modular design. Modular design permits a printing system to be configured or re-configured from a set of standard components, so that the same basic printing system can have a number of different configurations. These techniques are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2011/0128338 entitled &#x201c;Modular Media Transport System&#x201d;, by DeCook et al. Techniques for web media handling between modules, such as &#x201c;kinematic&#x201d; or &#x201c;exact constraint&#x201d; mechanical interfaces simplify the task of aligning the media path between one modular component and another. The design of the present invention is well suited to take advantage of systems that make use of exact constraint web handling that make it feasible to re-configure a modular arrangement in a timely and economical manner.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional solutions for adapting a printer to a particular print job or set of printing conditions include feedback loops and similar control arrangements, often with the help of pre-defined &#x201c;job ticket&#x201d; parameter sets or templates that can be selectable for a particular print job. These conventional approaches can work well with dedicated and smaller-scale print apparatus that have a narrow range of capabilities and where interoperability of modular components is not needed. Such conventional solutions, however, can fall far short of what is needed in order to support high-speed modular web media printing systems. Some factors affecting interoperability for a modular system can include differences in acceptable media transport speed for various modules; drying time requirements; response time needed at different modules for changing speed or other parameters; environmental factors such as heat and humidity that can affect applied inks and media handling, receptivity, and drying time; colorant density and number of inks or other colorants or fluids used by a job; data processing speeds, media types and properties; and other factors. In a large-scale printing system that is designed to handle different types of print jobs, the number of operational factors that can be varied and possible combinations of parameters that can be used can well exceed the practical limits of pre-defined template parameter sets and exceed the capabilities of interactive control loops or other conventional mechanisms for adapting and interoperability between components.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to meet the needs of a dynamic printing market, high-speed non-contact digital printers must provide the capability to be configurable from modular components, and the various capabilities and performance of each modular component must be taken into account at a system level. Thus, there is a need for apparatus and methods that permits modular system configuration and that adapt system operational control to the combined capabilities of the individual modular components.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention relates to an effective way to configure printing modules. In accordance with the present invention a method is provided for configuring a modular printing system, having a plurality of modules that are configured to be selectively interconnected to form different printing system configurations comprising:</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The method and apparatus of the present invention help enables an operator to take full advantage of a modular approach to the design of a digital printing system. It automatically identifies a suitable range of operational parameters and selections that can be made available for an operator based on the selected configuration of modular components that are interconnected to form a particular printing system. In the drawings and text that follow, like components are designated with like reference numerals, and similar descriptions concerning components and arrangement or interaction of components already described are omitted. Where they are used, the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, and so on, do not denote any ordinal or priority relation, but are simply used to more clearly distinguish one element from another. Drawings are provided in order to illustrate and emphasize important concepts and are not necessarily drawn to scale.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The apparatus and methods of the present invention are particularly well suited for printing apparatus that provide non-contact application of ink or other colorant onto a continuously moving web medium. The print-head of such a system selectively moistens at least some portion of the media as it courses through the printing system, but without the need to make contact with the print media. Examples of non-contact printing include continuous inkjet printing or drop on demand inkjet printing. In the context of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;continuous web of print media&#x201d; refers to a continuously moving sheet medium that serves as the receiving print medium onto which colorant is applied in a non-contact fashion. This is to be distinguished from various types of &#x201c;continuous webs&#x201d; or &#x201c;belts&#x201d; that are actually transport system components, such as toner transfer belts or fuser belts, rather than receiving print media and that are typically used to transport a cut sheet medium within an electro-photographic or other printing system. The terms &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; are terms of art referring to relative positions along the transport path of a moving web. The term &#x201c;print job&#x201d; is a term of art that relates to that portion of a print run that produces one or more versions of a given document.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;module&#x201d; refers broadly to a component of a printing system that supports the supply, printing, finishing, or process conditioning of the web print media in some manner. Modules of a printing system can include various items of equipment such as media suppliers, marking components (e.g. ink), media transport system components, marking engines, environmental conditioning units, (e.g. dryers, chillers, exhaust fans), and media finishing equipment, such as slitters, folding equipment, binding equipment, coating and lamination apparatus, and other components that handle the media, whether unprinted, in the process of being printed upon, or in some post-printing operation stage. A basic set of modules required for a simple printer configuration would include a media supply, single color printer module, and take-up modules arranged in that order. Beyond this basic set and configuration of modules required for printing, additional modules can be selectively interconnected upon initial installation or at any time after initial installation to accommodate the particular printing requirements. The modular configuration can be changed to accommodate a special print job requiring a special media or treatment to the print media, a change in the nature of the printing service provided by printing operation, or to rapidly exchange a module to correct a component failure. Additional modules, such as multicolor printers, radiant energy dryers, forced-air dryers, slack loops, UV curing units, web position monitoring and control systems, as well as an array of finishing modules such as cutters, slitters, stackers, collators, and various binding systems can be added to enhance the capabilities and performance of the selectively configured printer. In addition, modules of a print system can also include data processing and handling components that are in the image data path as well as control and interface components, and components that provide various types of metadata that is either associated with the digital image data or with the printing system or process itself. In addition, modules of a print system can include a broad range of available media and ink components and types that have varying characteristics and features including; ink viscosity, ink lay down, media porosity, paper based media and plastic based media, pigmented inks, aqueous inks, and solvent inks.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As the term would be recognized and used by those skilled in the printing process, a modular arrangement implies a measure of interchangeability and configurability, so that one modular component can be configured to be compatible with another modular component in some way. Modular components with the same function are generally considered to be at least somewhat interchangeable, so that, for example, an alternate printer module, an alternate print-head assembly, or an alternate dryer could be substituted in the place of a given component when configuring a print system. Given this broad understanding, a &#x201c;modular printing system&#x201d; is a system that provides printing capability by selectively combining two or more modular components to form a particular printing system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the present invention generate information that is stored in computer-accessible memory <b>66</b>. Computer-accessible memory <b>66</b> can be a memory storage device used for longer term storage, such as a device using magnetic, optical, or other data storage media. In addition, the computer-accessible memory <b>66</b> can include an electronic memory such as a random access memory (RAM) that is used for shorter term storage, such as circuitry employed to store a computer program having instructions for controlling one or more computers to practice the method according to the present invention. The term &#x201c;memory&#x201d; as used herein can also refer to a display buffer, data register, computation workspace, or other electronic circuitry that is used to temporarily store data that is displayed on a display screen or used in calculation for example.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to the schematic side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a digital printing system <b>10</b> for continuous web printing according to a commercial printing embodiment. A first module <b>20</b> and a second module <b>40</b> are provided for guiding continuous web media that originates from a source roller <b>12</b>. Following an initial slack loop <b>52</b>, the media that is fed from source roller <b>12</b> is then directed through digital printing system <b>10</b>, past one or more digital print-heads <b>16</b> and supporting printing system <b>10</b> components, such as a dryer <b>14</b>. First module <b>20</b> has a support structure that typically includes web guidance features such as an edge guide or other cross-track positioning mechanism <b>22</b> for positioning the continuously moving web of print media in the cross-track direction, orthogonal to the direction of travel and in the plane of travel, and a tensioning mechanism <b>24</b> that sets the tension of the print media.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Downstream from first module <b>20</b> along the path of the continuous web media, second module <b>40</b> also has a support structure and components that cooperate with first module <b>20</b> to maintain the kinematic dynamics of the continuous web of print media in traveling from the first module <b>20</b> into the second module <b>40</b>. Printing system <b>10</b> optionally also includes a turnover mechanism <b>30</b> that is configured to turn the media over, flipping it backside-up in order to permit printing on the reverse side. A take-up roll <b>18</b> is then formed, rewound from the printed web media. One or more slack loops <b>52</b> can also be provided towards the take-up end to facilitate drying, to reduce binding, to compensate for any differential transport speeds between modules, or to compensate for differential acceleration or deceleration of the paper transport. The printing mechanism can include a number of other components, including multiple print heads and dryers, for example, as described in more detail subsequently.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The modularity of a printing system, such as printing system <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, enables two or more printing modules <b>20</b> and <b>40</b> to be connected together in order to provide particular printing capabilities. Module <b>20</b> is a four-color printer in one embodiment, applying precisely registered ink dots of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK) in sequence onto the moving web print media, then drying the newly printed media at dryer <b>14</b>. Module <b>20</b> then passes the printed web to module <b>40</b> that flips the media over and performs CMYK printing onto the opposite side of the media. Other operations are also possible, including application of fewer or additional colors, application of laminates or other fluids or coatings, use of slitters or perforating devices, and use of components that provide various types of printing preparation or finishing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It order to better understand aspects of the present invention that support interoperability of modular printing system components, it is instructive to distinguish &#x201c;module configuration data&#x201d; from &#x201c;system configuration data&#x201d;, as these terms are used in the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Module Configuration Data</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each individual module <b>20</b>, <b>40</b> in the modular printing system <b>10</b> has some amount of associated module configuration data. In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;module configuration data&#x201d; is used to encompass the various types of information that are associated with each module <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>. For modular printing system <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, associated module configuration data includes data that describes module type, capabilities, module requirements, including module order requirements. This can include various data about the equipment itself, such as its overall function, model and type, power requirements, weight or required floor strength, order requirements in the sequence of media handling as installed in the system, and other physical and dimensional data. Other examples of module configuration data include the number and printing order of colors and ink types supplied; range of available transport speed settings; current settings and available range for variables such as web media thickness, stiffness, or width; capabilities of supporting components such as dryers, chillers, and the like; ventilation and exhaust requirements; and other configuration data. Examples of media information that is also considered module configuration data include media porosity, tensile strength, beam strength, thickness, color, and surface characteristics. Examples of ink information include viscosity and amount of water or solvent content.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Alternatively, measurement data from one or more sensors provided in modular printing system <b>10</b> can provide module configuration data. This is useful when media or ink characteristics are unknown and can be helpful for monitoring ambient printing conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The schematic block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a modular printing system <b>50</b> formed from an arrangement of different modules <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> and a modular raster image processor (RIP) <b>90</b>. Each of the modules <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> has associated module configuration data <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For any particular module <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, a substantial portion of its module configuration data <b>70</b> does not change during operation or when the module is used with a different set of modules <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. Some portion of the module configuration data <b>70</b> can be variable, such as where data from sensors associated with the module <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> are provided. For example, a temperature sensor that lies within a dryer module can provide different temperature values during operation.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">System Configuration Data</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the collection of the current module configuration data <b>70</b> from each module <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> in the system is then used to define a system configuration <b>48</b>. In the particular modular printing system <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, modular printing system <b>50</b> has three printing modules <b>58</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>; a web media supply module <b>60</b>, and a web media take-up module <b>62</b>. Each module has associated module configuration data <b>70</b> as described earlier. A system controller <b>82</b>, such as a computer or computer workstation or some type of dedicated logic control processor, is in data communication with each module and obtains the module configuration data <b>70</b> from each module <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, using this information to generate system configuration <b>48</b>. System configuration <b>48</b> can be stored in processor-accessible memory <b>66</b> on system controller <b>82</b> or some other memory device. An operator <b>86</b> can then view and update the system configuration data on a display <b>84</b> in order to control the operation of modular printing system <b>50</b>. System configuration <b>48</b> can store a considerable amount of information on the system's capabilities in view of the current set of modules <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a raster image processor (RIP) <b>90</b> can also be considered as a type of module, providing configuration data <b>70</b> and operational parameter data for the image data path of modular printing system <b>50</b>. As described previously, RIP <b>90</b> can have a maximum processing or throughput speed for image data that can, in some cases, provide a constraint for print speed. Other data from RIP <b>90</b> can include metadata that is associated with the digital image data, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> arrangement, each of modules <b>58</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>60</b>, and <b>62</b> is represented as a separate apparatus, in a separate chassis. It should be noted that modular design and associated storage of configuration data <b>70</b> can also apply for components within a single equipment chassis, as shown for module <b>20</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Digital print-head <b>16</b> also provides configuration data <b>70</b>, as well as heater <b>14</b>. In addition, sensors <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> also provide variable data from which module configuration data is determined, such as temperature, relative density of the applied colorant, web stiffness, humidity, and other variables. Sensors <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are used to monitor print media <b>38</b> and ambient conditions within module <b>20</b>. This data is similarly provided to system controller <b>82</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and used to generate system configuration <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Operational Parameters</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As noted previously, the information and parameter values in system configuration <b>48</b> are conditioned by the module configuration data <b>70</b>. As one example, the speed of the modular printing system <b>50</b>, in feet/minute (or other similar metric) is dependent on the speed ranges available with each of the individual modules <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> that form the system. Each of modules <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> has an operating speed or a range of speeds. The printing speed that is available from modular printing system <b>50</b> is the highest speed that each of the modules <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> can handle. This printing speed is provided and displayed as part of system configuration <b>48</b>. As another example, one or another of the modules <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> can have a constrained media width capability. This value then determines the maximum web media width that is usable and provided as part of system configuration <b>48</b>. As yet another example, capacity of a dryer module can limit the speed at which the modular printing system <b>50</b> can operate given a set of media and ink lay down requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As examples like this show, the system configuration data that results from collecting module configuration data determines various operational parameters for the assembled printing system. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, operational parameters <b>72</b> include various settings and measured values associated with the arrangement of modules <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> in the current modular printing system <b>50</b>. Operational parameters <b>72</b>, derived from the system configuration <b>48</b>, are used to operate the modular printing system <b>50</b> during printing and can include a host of parameters such as selected exhaust fan CFMs, media conveyance speed for an operation in process, dryer settings, media tensioning parameters, and measures of energy used. Operational parameters <b>72</b> can include parameters that are selectable to the operator or that define ranges of values that are operator-selectable. An operator interface, for example, can permit the operator to select from among a set of operational parameters for running a print job.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The data communication between system controller <b>82</b> and each of the modules <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> that form modular printing system <b>50</b>, represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, can take any of a number of forms, such as using cable interconnection, wireless communication, or networked connection, for example. Within the module <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> itself, configuration data <b>70</b> can be stored in a memory <b>66</b> and updated by a microprocessor or other controller during configuration and operation. Alternately, a module <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> can simply provide a configuration ID or link that is used to access further configuration information from a remote or centralized source, such as from a web page or other networked source. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents a point-to-point connection between each module <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> and system controller <b>82</b>, other connection arrangements are possible, including arrangements that employ module-to-module communication.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The logic flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows how system configuration <b>48</b> and operational parameters <b>72</b> are generated in an embodiment of a modular printing system <b>50</b> having multiple modules <b>1</b> . . . n, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Each of modules <b>1</b> . . . n provides its module configuration data <b>70</b> to a configuration generation process <b>76</b>. This information can be transmitted automatically to system controller <b>82</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) upon power-up, as a type of self-identification process. Alternately, this data can be transmitted periodically, or as soon as data connection between the module <b>1</b> . . . n and the system controller <b>82</b> is available. Alternately, system controller <b>82</b> can request module configuration data <b>70</b> from one or more modules <b>1</b> . . . n, such as when requested from an operator <b>86</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Configuration generation process <b>76</b> combines the module configuration data <b>70</b> and, optionally, job parameters <b>26</b> and generates system configuration data <b>48</b>. Operational parameters <b>72</b> can then be obtained using the system configuration data <b>48</b> based on operator preferences for running a print job and based on environmental and other sensed data from the modular printing system <b>50</b>. Operational parameters <b>72</b> can be displayed by a user interface <b>80</b> or stored for reference or use in computer-accessible memory <b>66</b>. The range of selectable operational preference settings <b>78</b> are determined, by the system controller <b>82</b>, from the associated configuration information <b>70</b> for each module <b>1</b> . . . n provided by the selectively interconnected modular printing system <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">User Interface</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, as shown by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the user interface <b>80</b> that is provided from system controller <b>82</b> is generated and adapted according to the system configuration data <b>48</b> and operational parameters <b>72</b>. With this feature, the operator interface for the printing system differs between one configuration of modular components and another. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, the printing system <b>10</b> having the turnover mechanism module <b>30</b> at an appropriate downstream location can provide two-sided printing, for which additional operator information, selections, and settings over the single-sided printing case would be more appropriate. Various controls for finishing equipment can be provided where such optional modular components are used, but are not available as part of the operator interface when this equipment is absent or has one or more of its functions disabled.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The plan views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> show an example user interface <b>80</b> screen using a standard tabbed-window arrangement. A number of tabs <b>32</b> enable operator selection of functions for display in a corresponding window <b>33</b>. In the embodiment shown, this user interface <b>80</b> provides access to module configuration data for one or more modules of the printing system and provides access to the resulting system configuration data that is generated according to the module configuration data <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Operator Preferences</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Operator preferences for the printing system are conditioned by the modular composition of the system, so that specific operator preferences are enabled or disabled based on the modular and system configuration detected by system controller <b>82</b> and on the specific operational parameters <b>72</b> that are generated from system configuration data. In one embodiment, as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the operator <b>86</b> can make a preference setting <b>78</b> that sets decision criteria for job handling, based on information that is obtained from the printing system modules and stored in the system configuration. The operator <b>86</b> can indicate, via user interface <b>80</b>, a preference for increasing throughput, so that the job execution sequence is optimized for productivity, requiring little or no operator interaction with printing system <b>10</b> between jobs, such as changing media or adjusting operation variables. Alternately, the operator <b>86</b> can select a preference setting for a job sequence that reduces cost or energy utilization by operating at a speed that increases dryer efficiency. The operator <b>86</b> can have a range of selectable speed parameters available, based on media type, print speeds of various printing modules, transport speeds of finishing equipment, or other operational criteria. As a result the operator <b>86</b> can have a preference that relates to considerations of image quality, energy utilization, or throughput. As in some conventional systems, the operator <b>86</b> also has the option of reconfiguring operation of a module from the operator interface, such as to adjust desired web tensioning, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Status information and warnings can also be provided as part of the user interface <b>80</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Workflow</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The modular printing system of the present invention is further advantaged by improving workflow according to the modular arrangement of system components. Where there is a backlog of jobs, for example, the operator interface can give the operator the option to order jobs according to module setup, to help reduce required operator attention, adjustments, and reconfiguration between print jobs. Knowledge of the particular system configuration data for each job enables the system to automatically order jobs in sequence according to parameters such as media and ink types used, preferred operating temperature range for ink drying on a particular media type, and efficient sequences of operation and utilization for finishing equipment. This increases the throughput of the system and reduces the cost to operate it.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, the system configuration permits variable media transport speed from one job to the next and, in some cases, even within the same print job. Adapting the print drop rate to the media transport speed is described, for example, in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,003,979 entitled &#x201c;Gray Scale Printing with High Resolution Array Ink Jet&#x201d; to Schneider et al. This would even permit acceleration (or, correspondingly, deceleration) of the web transport speed during the transition between jobs or even during printing within the same job. This would be useful, for example, where a portion of a print job must be printed at a slower speed, such as to achieve higher color density or where extended drying time is needed over specific pages of a job. Instead of requiring that the printing speed be constrained to the lowest speed required for a portion of the job, embodiments of the present invention permit printing system <b>10</b> to change print speeds within the job as needed. The capability to accelerate the media transport speed while printing can help to improve throughput in a number of ways, such as by adjusting speed over a portion of a print job according to print content. This system is particularly useful when printing books and multi-page compound documents that include, for example, many pages of black text interspersed with full color photographic images. The speed of the transport will increase if only black text is printed and decrease when full color photographs are printed. Also paperback books and magazines can be printed in proper sequence, facilitating in-line finishing, incorporating full color covers and mono-chromatic pages.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
