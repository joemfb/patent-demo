<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The two-stroke engine has a plurality of intake passages extending from the external air inlet port through the crankcase, separating the intake air charge from the air and oil vapor within the crankcase. The piston has one or more corresponding inlet tubes depending therefrom that telescope within the crankcase intake passages as the piston reciprocates. All intake air travels through these passages and is separated from the remainder of the crankcase volume. The incoming air charge passes through a concentric poppet valve in the piston crown to enter the combustion chamber. Fuel is provided by conventional direct or port injection and ignition is provided by one or more conventional spark plugs. Diesel operation is achievable when the engine is configured appropriately. Exhaust exits the combustion chamber through a poppet valve in the cylinder head, the poppet valve being actuated by a rocker arm and pushrod from a crankshaft driven cam.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to internal combustion engines, and particularly to a two-stroke reciprocating internal combustion engine having an internal structure that precludes oil mixing with the intake air charge.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The reciprocating internal combustion engine has been the mainstay of motive power plants for a considerable period of time, due to its relative size and weight for its power output, fuel economy, and ease of operation. Nevertheless, such engines have their drawbacks. For example, the two-stroke engine in which both the exhaust and compression portions of the cycle occur during the upstroke of the piston and the power and intake strokes occur during the downstroke of the piston, is well known to produce relatively high power output for its size and weight due to the efficiency of a power stroke at every revolution of the crankshaft. However, such engines have historically been relatively inefficient insofar as fuel consumption and emissions production are concerned due to the lack of separation of the four distinct phases of the cycle with each having its own stroke, as in the conventional four-stroke (Otto cycle) engine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another problem with the two-stroke engine is that conventionally such engines initially draw the intake charge into the crankcase, whereupon the downstroke of the piston on the power stroke pressurizes the crankcase to force the intake charge into the cylinder for the next power stroke. As the crankcase is essentially continually filled with air, the conventional oil-filled crankcase used in the lubrication of the four-stroke engine cannot be used for lubrication of the two-stroke engine. Accordingly, oil is either mixed with the fuel during refueling, or oil is injected into the engine during operation, with two-stroke engines. Either system results in oil contamination of the air-fuel mixture as it passes through the engine, is burned to produce power, and passes out of the engine as exhaust. The present day requirement to reduce engine emissions precludes the use of such an engine operating principle in most applications, even though the relatively high power output of such engines for their weight can result in a desirable reduction of the weight of the vehicle in which it is installed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, a two-stroke engine solving the aforementioned problems is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The two-stroke engine includes a system for separating the intake charge from the crankcase volume, thereby precluding contamination of the intake charge with lubricating oil. A pre-compression chamber or intake column is provided external to the crankcase and cylinder. A reed valve is located at the inlet to the intake column for controlling the airflow into the column. One or more additional intake passages extend along the intake column and communicate with corresponding crankcase transfer passages within the crankcase of the engine. The crankcase transfer passages communicate with piston transfer passages that depend from the piston of the engine and telescope within the crankcase transfer passages. Thus, all intake gases are completely separated from the crankcase volume and its oil vapors at all times.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A concentric poppet valve is located in the piston crown. The intake air charge flows from the intake passages through the crankcase and piston transfer passages and into the combustion chamber when the intake valve in the piston crown opens. Conventional direct fuel injection is used to deliver fuel directly into the combustion chamber, since fuel and oil are not added to the intake charge prior to delivery to the engine. Alternatively, port fuel injection may be provided to deliver fuel to the intake port(s) of the engine. One or more conventional spark plugs are used to ignite the fuel and air mixture to produce power. The engine may be operated as a diesel once initial ignition has occurred if the engine has been designed and configured for compression ignition operation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A poppet exhaust valve is provided in the cylinder head to exhaust the spent mixture after the power stroke. The exhaust valve is actuated by a rocker arm and pushrod. The pushrod is actuated by a cam driven by rotation of the crankshaft, as is conventional in the art. Alternative exhaust valve actuation may be provided by an overhead cam driven by a mechanism from the crankshaft, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The engine disclosed in the majority of the drawings is a single cylinder, air-cooled engine. However, it will be seen that the operating principle disclosed herein may be extended to a multi-cylinder, liquid cooled engines, which is within the scope of the invention as claimed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These and other features of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The two-stroke engine has an internal structure separating the intake air charge from the air and oil vapor within the crankcase, thus providing a cleaner running engine in comparison to conventional two-stroke engines. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides an external left side elevation view of an exemplary air cooled, single cylinder embodiment <b>10</b> of the engine, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 11</figref> providing additional external and internal views of the engine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The engine <b>10</b> includes a crankcase <b>12</b> having a crankshaft <b>14</b> disposed therein. A cylinder <b>16</b> extends from the crankcase <b>12</b>. The cylinder <b>16</b> includes a cylinder head <b>18</b> thereon. The head <b>18</b> has provision for at least one spark plug <b>20</b> and fuel injector <b>22</b> (direct or port) therein. The head <b>18</b> may include multiple spark plugs <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An intake column <b>24</b> extends externally along the left side of the cylinder <b>16</b>. The intake column <b>24</b> has an inlet end <b>26</b> adjacent the cylinder head <b>16</b> and an opposite base <b>28</b> joined with the crankcase <b>12</b> and communicating with the crankcase chamber or internal fluid volume <b>30</b> thereof (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 11B</figref>), the column <b>24</b> defining an intake volume <b>32</b> therein. At least one, and preferably two, external intake passages (tubes, etc.) <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>extend along the cylinder <b>16</b> and adjacent to the intake column <b>24</b>. These two external passages <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b </i>have inlet ends communicating with the inlet end <b>26</b> of the intake column <b>24</b> via an intake plenum or air box <b>36</b>. The opposite bases <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b </i>of the external passages <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b </i>extend into the crankcase <b>12</b> and communicate with internal crankcase intake passages <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b</i>, respectively, which serve to separate the intake volumes <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>therein from combustion gases, oil, or other fluids in the chamber or internal volume <b>30</b> of the crankcase <b>12</b>. The crankcase intake passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>each extend upwardly from the interior of the crankcase <b>12</b> into the lower portion of the interior of the cylinder <b>16</b> and have upper portions parallel to the axis of the cylinder <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A piston <b>44</b> reciprocates within the cylinder <b>16</b>, and is connected mechanically to the crank throw of the crankshaft via a conventional connecting rod <b>46</b>. The piston <b>44</b> includes at least one piston inlet passage, and preferably a plurality of piston inlet passages <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b</i>, depending therefrom. These piston inlet passages <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>correspond in number to the internal crankcase intake passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, and telescope within their respective crankcase inlet passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>as the piston <b>44</b> reciprocates within the cylinder <b>16</b> during engine operation. The piston inlet passage <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>are each hollow and define intake volumes, respectively <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b</i>, with the intake volumes <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the crankcase inlet passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>communicating with the intake volumes <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>of the piston inlet passages <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>in an essentially continuous flow during engine operation. It will thus be seen that the fixed crankcase inlet passages <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>and their mating and telescoping piston inlet passages <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>separate and seal their respective inlet volumes <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>and <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>from the internal crankcase volume <b>30</b> to preclude contamination of the inlet air charge with oil vapor from the crankcase internal volume <b>30</b> during engine operation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 11B</figref> provide a series of progressive views of the engine <b>10</b> during operation, with each set of FIGS. A and B showing the progressive positions of the internal components of the engine <b>10</b> at each 45&#xb0; of clockwise rotation of the crankshaft <b>14</b>. It will be noted that the engine may be made to rotate in the opposite, counterclockwise direction by adjusting the timing of the cam <b>62</b> (discussed further below) relative to the crankshaft <b>14</b>, and adjusting the ignition timing accordingly for spark ignition engines. The piston <b>44</b> includes a concentric poppet intake valve <b>52</b> in the crown <b>54</b> thereof, with the intake valve <b>52</b> reciprocating to open and close ports <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b </i>extending through the piston <b>44</b> and communicating with the respective piston intake passages <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b</i>. The intake valve <b>52</b> is actuated primarily by differential pressure between the inlet passage volumes <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>, <b>50</b><i>a</i>, and <b>50</b><i>b</i>, and the upper cylinder and combustion chamber <b>58</b> during engine operation, although a conventional return spring (not shown) may be installed about the intake valve stem in the piston <b>44</b> as required. No mechanical timing mechanism is provided for the intake valve <b>52</b>, as operation of the valve <b>52</b> is dependent upon differential pressure between the crankcase and the upper cylinder. Thus, the intake valve <b>52</b> operates properly regardless of the direction of rotation of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A poppet exhaust valve <b>60</b> is installed concentrically through the cylinder head <b>18</b>. The exhaust valve <b>60</b> is actuated by a cam <b>62</b> on the crankshaft <b>14</b>, with the cam cyclically driving a tappet <b>64</b> that in turn reciprocates a pushrod <b>66</b>. The pushrod <b>66</b> operates a rocker arm <b>68</b> on the cylinder head <b>18</b>, to reciprocate the exhaust valve <b>60</b> periodically as required during engine operation. Other mechanisms may be used alternatively to operate the exhaust valve, e.g., an overhead cam driven by a rotary shaft from the crankshaft, etc. Also, other conventional means (mechanical, electronic, pneumatic, etc.) may be used to adjust the valve timing as desired, depending upon engine speed and power output.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The cycle begins as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, with the piston <b>44</b> at top dead center, i.e., the crank throw of the crankshaft <b>14</b> at its maximum height. At this point both the intake valve <b>52</b> and exhaust valve <b>60</b> are closed, in order to maximize pressure in the combustion chamber <b>58</b> for efficient operation. The rise of the piston <b>44</b> in the cylinder <b>16</b> has maximized the internal volumes <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>, <b>50</b><i>a</i>, and <b>50</b><i>b </i>within the inlet passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>and <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>as the piston <b>44</b> has lifted the piston inlet passages <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This also maximizes the fluid volume <b>30</b> within the crankcase <b>12</b>, which draws air downwardly from the internal volume <b>32</b> of the intake column <b>24</b>. In order to minimize this cyclic movement of air within the intake column <b>24</b>, the internal fluid volume <b>30</b> of the crankcase <b>12</b> is minimized by filling the crankcase <b>12</b> insofar as possible with a solid, volume limiting filler <b>70</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>5</b>A, <b>6</b>A, etc. This filler <b>70</b> need not be of the same material as the metal crankcase <b>12</b> of the engine <b>10</b>, but may be a lighter plastic material as desired, so long as it limits the internal fluid volume <b>30</b> of the crankcase <b>12</b> in order to minimize the transfer of air from the intake column <b>24</b> back and forth with the internal volume <b>30</b> of the crankcase <b>12</b>. Sufficient room is left only for the eccentric rotation of the lower end of the connecting rod <b>46</b> on its crank throw, and for the lower portions of the internal crankcase intake passages <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It will be seen that as the air within the volume <b>32</b> of the intake column <b>24</b> pulses back and forth during each cycle of engine operation, that air from the crankcase volume <b>30</b> is pushed upwardly into the intake column <b>24</b> during the downstroke of the piston <b>44</b> before being drawn back into the crankcase volume during the piston upstroke. The actual mixing of the crankcase air or gas with the intake air charge is minimal due to the rapidity of the cyclic operation of the engine <b>10</b>. However, such mixing may be further minimized by the installation of a sliding, floating plunger or separator <b>72</b> within the intake column <b>24</b> to separate the air volume <b>30</b> of the crankcase <b>12</b> and the intake air charge portion within the intake column <b>24</b>. The floating separator <b>72</b> slides upwardly and downwardly within the intake column <b>24</b> with each cycle of the engine <b>10</b> during operation, separating the air within the upper portion of the intake column <b>24</b> (which communicates with the incoming air within the external intake passages <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b</i>, via the intake plenum <b>36</b>) and the air volume <b>30</b> within the crankcase. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the piston <b>44</b> is at its maximum height, thereby drawing the floating separator <b>72</b> downwardly to its lowest point within the intake column <b>24</b>. The pressure within the upper volume <b>32</b> of the intake column <b>24</b> has momentarily stabilized at this point, before beginning to increase as the piston <b>44</b> begins its descent and pushes the air within the crankcase <b>12</b> back into the lower portion of the intake column <b>24</b>. Accordingly, the inlet valve <b>74</b> (e.g., carbon fiber flexible reed-type valve, etc.) within the intake plenum <b>36</b> is closed. A relatively thin brace <b>76</b>, shown in section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B through 11B</figref>, extends across the throat of the plenum <b>36</b> to limit excessive movement of the inlet valve <b>74</b> during closure. This brace <b>76</b> is shown essentially in its entirety in the top plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> show the engine operation at a point of 45 degrees of clockwise rotation of the crankshaft <b>14</b> from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, with the piston <b>44</b> having started its downward travel due to combustion pressure in the top of the cylinder <b>16</b>. The exhaust valve <b>60</b> is closed at this point due to the orientation of the cam <b>62</b>, and the intake valve <b>52</b> in the piston crown <b>54</b> is also closed due to the relatively high pressure within the combustion chamber <b>58</b> and upper portion of the cylinder <b>16</b> in comparison to that in the crankcase volume <b>30</b> and lower portion of the intake column <b>24</b>. However, it will be seen that the descending piston <b>44</b> is reducing the internal volume <b>30</b> within lower portion of the cylinder <b>16</b> and the crankcase <b>12</b>, and thus forcing contained crankcase air back into the lower portion of the intake column <b>24</b>. This causes the floating separator <b>72</b> in the intake column <b>24</b> to begin to rise, with the increasing pressure within the upper portion of the intake column <b>24</b> and also within the telescoping crankcase tubes or passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>and piston tubes or passages <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>holding the reed valve <b>74</b> within the intake plenum <b>36</b> closed against ambient external pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the crankshaft <b>14</b> is shown rotated 90 degrees from its initial top dead center position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. Combustion pressure continues to force the piston <b>44</b> downwardly in the cylinder <b>16</b>, with the exhaust valve <b>60</b> and intake valve <b>52</b> remaining closed. The continuing reduction of the volume <b>30</b> within the crankcase <b>12</b> as the piston <b>44</b> descends forces the floating separator <b>72</b> further toward the inlet end <b>26</b> of the inlet column <b>24</b>. The reduction of volume within the collapsing, telescoping crankcase tubes or passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>and piston tubes or passages <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>also increases the pressure within the upper portion of the inlet column <b>24</b> to hold the reed intake valve <b>74</b> closed, but the volume in the crankcase <b>30</b> and below the floating separator <b>72</b> is at least slightly greater than the volume in the tubes or passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>a</i>, and <b>48</b><i>b</i>, thus causing the floating separator <b>72</b> to rise somewhat within the inlet column <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> illustrate the engine <b>10</b> cycle with the crankshaft <b>14</b> rotated clockwise to about 135 degrees from the top dead center position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. The exhaust valve <b>60</b> remains closed, as the lobe of the cam <b>62</b> has not yet rotated around to begin to lift the tappet <b>64</b>. The intake valve <b>52</b> also remains closed, as even though pressure within the cylinder <b>16</b> is dropping due to the expanding volume within the cylinder as the piston <b>44</b> continues its downstroke, the pressure within the cylinder still remains above that contained within the crankcase <b>12</b> and ambient atmosphere. As the piston <b>44</b> continues its downstroke and reduces the volume <b>30</b> within the crankcase <b>12</b>, the pressure within the crankcase <b>12</b> pushes the floating separator <b>72</b> higher in the inlet column <b>24</b>. This results in the reed intake valve <b>74</b> remaining closed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> illustrate the positions of the internal components of the engine <b>10</b> when the piston <b>44</b> reaches bottom dead center, i.e., the crankshaft <b>14</b> has rotated 180 degrees from the top dead center position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. It will be seen that the lobe of the cam <b>62</b> has rotated to a point where it begins to lift the tappet <b>64</b>, thus actuating the exhaust valve train to open the exhaust valve <b>60</b> and relieve the residual pressure within the cylinder <b>16</b>. At this point the internal volume <b>30</b> within the crankcase <b>12</b> is minimized, thus producing the maximum pressure within the crankcase <b>12</b>. This forces the floating separator <b>72</b> to its maximum height within the inlet column <b>24</b>, thus minimizing the volume in the upper end of the column <b>24</b> below the reed intake valve <b>74</b>. This lowest point of travel of the piston <b>44</b> also results in minimal volume within the collapsed telescoping inlet passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>a</i>, and <b>48</b><i>b</i>, which along with their communication with the upper portion of the internal volume of the inlet column <b>24</b>, further increases the pressure within these passages to a pressure higher than that within the cylinder <b>16</b>, particularly since the exhaust valve <b>60</b> is now open. This pressure differential between the nearly ambient pressure within the cylinder <b>16</b> due to the open exhaust valve <b>60</b> and the pressure buildup within the inlet passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>a</i>, and <b>48</b><i>b</i>, pushes the intake valve <b>52</b> in the piston crown <b>54</b> open, allowing a charge of fresh intake air to flow into the cylinder <b>16</b>. The ports <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b </i>that extend through the piston <b>44</b> preferably do not lie in a diametric vertical plane through the piston, but rather preferably extend upwardly and inwardly at some angle away from the center of the piston <b>44</b>. This results in the incoming charge swirling or spiraling about the interior of the cylinder <b>16</b> as the charge is confined by the interior cylinder wall. This swirling or spiraling action of the incoming charge may be either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending upon the orientation of the ports <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b </i>through the piston <b>44</b>. As the exhaust valve <b>60</b> is open as the intake air charge enters the cylinder <b>16</b>, the intake air charge assists in expelling the exhaust from the cylinder <b>16</b> to reduce the adulteration of the confined charge within the cylinder <b>16</b> for the next combustion event in the cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the crankshaft <b>14</b> is shown rotated about 225 degrees from its initial top dead center position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, with the piston <b>44</b> starting its upward travel in the cylinder <b>16</b>. The lobe of the cam <b>62</b> has not rotated sufficiently to allow the tappet or lifter <b>64</b> to drop, with the exhaust valve <b>60</b> thus remaining at least somewhat open. The relatively small volumes <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>, <b>50</b><i>a</i>, and <b>50</b><i>b </i>within the crankcase inlet passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>and piston inlet passages <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>still result in relatively high pressure within these passages, thus forcing more intake air into the cylinder <b>16</b> through the open intake valve <b>52</b> in the piston crown <b>54</b>. However, pressure within the inlet tubes or passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>a</i>, and <b>48</b><i>b </i>still remains relatively high due to their reduced volume and the reduced volume in the upper portion of the intake column <b>24</b> due to the relatively high pressure in the crankcase <b>12</b> forcing the floating separator <b>72</b> upwardly in the intake column <b>24</b>, thus continuing to hold the intake reed valve <b>74</b> closed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>show the engine <b>10</b> at the point of its cycle where the crankshaft <b>14</b> has rotated about 270 degrees, or three quarters of the way clockwise from its initial top dead center position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. At this point in the cycle, the lobe of the cam <b>62</b> has rotated beyond the tappet or lifter <b>64</b>, thus allowing the exhaust valve <b>60</b> to close. The closure of the exhaust valve <b>60</b>, along with the upward travel of the piston <b>44</b> in the cylinder <b>16</b>, results in the closing of the intake valve <b>52</b> in the piston crown <b>54</b>. This initiates the compression of the fresh air charge in the now closed cylinder, for the next combustion event and power stroke. The piston inlet tubes or passages <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>are extending from their respective fixed crankcase inlet tubes or passages <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b</i>, thus increasing the volumes <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>and <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>therein. This causes a reduction in pressure within the upper portion of the intake column <b>24</b>. The internal pressure within the column <b>24</b> is reduced further due to the floating separator <b>72</b> being drawn downwardly in the column <b>24</b> because of the now increasing volume and corresponding drop in pressure within the crankcase <b>12</b> due to the rising piston <b>44</b>. The result is that the pressure within the upper portion of the inlet column <b>24</b> is reduced to a level lower than ambient with ambient air pressure thus forcing the inlet reed valve <b>74</b> open, generally as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> illustrate the positions of the internal components of the engine <b>10</b> when the crankshaft <b>14</b> has rotated to a point 315 degrees clockwise from its top dead center position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. At this point, both the exhaust valve <b>60</b> and intake valve <b>52</b> remain closed, thus further compressing the fresh intake charge in the top of the cylinder <b>16</b> for subsequent injection of fuel and ignition. The volume <b>30</b> within the crankcase <b>12</b> is increasing, thus drawing the floating separator <b>72</b> downwardly in its inlet column <b>24</b>. This increases the volume in the upper portion of the intake column <b>24</b>, and correspondingly reduces the pressure therein. Simultaneously, the telescoping piston inlet tubes <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>are being drawn further from the fixed crankcase inlet tubes <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, thus expanding the volumes <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>, <b>50</b><i>a</i>, and <b>50</b><i>b </i>therein to reduce the pressure further within the tubes. The result of this relatively low pressure within the tubes or passages <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>a</i>, and <b>48</b><i>b </i>and the upper portion of the inlet column <b>24</b> is that the intake reed valve <b>74</b> is drawn further open, generally as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>b</i>. Shortly after this point, preferably at some point slightly before the piston <b>44</b> again reaches top dead center, fuel is injected through the injector <b>22</b> and ignition is initiated by the spark plug(s) <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), to begin the two-stroke cycle of operation anew.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Accordingly, it will be seen that the two-stroke engine <b>10</b>, and other engine embodiments utilizing the same or similar separation of intake charge from the crankcase gases, provide an internal combustion power plant that essentially eliminates any contamination of the incoming air charge with oil vapor from the crankcase as occurs in conventional two-stroke engines. The engine <b>10</b> described above is depicted as an air-cooled, single cylinder engine. However, it will be seen that the operating principle described herein is adaptable to a number of other engine configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a multi-cylinder inline engine <b>110</b> having a single crankcase <b>112</b>, with each of the cylinders <b>116</b> employing a water jacket therearound to provide liquid cooling. Air-cooled multiple cylinder engines are obviously possible using the present intake system, as well as single cylinder engines employing liquid cooling. While the engine <b>110</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is shown as an inline four cylinder, it will be appreciated that other cylinder arrangements, e.g., Vee, horizontally opposed, radial, etc., may be constructed using the system described further above.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The system of separating the incoming air charge from the contaminated gases within the crankcase provides another advantage that has heretofore been difficult to attain in multiple cylinder two-stroke engines. Conventional multi-cylinder two-stroke engines require the separation from one another of the volumes within the crankcase that correspond with each cylinder. This is due to the initial compression of the incoming air charge in the crankcase as the piston descends on its power stroke. A single volume within the crankcase would not provide such initial compression, as the pistons are at various points in their cycles in a balanced engine and the charge within the crankcase would do no more than pulse or flow back and forth beneath the various pistons as they reciprocate at different times within their cylinders. The multi-cylinder two-stroke engine <b>110</b> precludes this problem by means of the novel inlet system that separates the incoming intake charge from the variable volume within the crankcase.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Moreover, while the engine <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 11B</figref> is shown with multiple spark plugs, it will be understood that the engine may be constructed to operate using the two-stroke compression ignition (Diesel) principle, if so desired. Such an engine would require only a single glow plug for starting, rather than the multiple spark plugs illustrated with the engine <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the drawings. Accordingly, the two-stroke engine <b>10</b> and other embodiments thereof are adaptable to widespread application in a number of different fields and operating environments.</p>
