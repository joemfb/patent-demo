<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In aspects of the assembly jig and method of the invention, when a packaging substrate is curved concaving upward at temperatures of melting solder, the gap between the assembly jig and the packaging substrate can be made smaller than the dimension of the sum of the thickness of the semiconductor chip and the thickness of the melted solder by allowing a part of the bottom surface of the chip positioning piece to become always, or substantially always, in contact with the upper surface of the packaging substrate owing to the weight of the chip positioning jig itself. As a consequence, the semiconductor chip does not slip aside out of the opening of the chip positioning piece. Therefore, the semiconductor chip can be positioned accurately on the packaging substrate.</p>

The packaging jig <b>500</b> is made from a material that does not contaminate the heating furnace, hardly deforms so as not to cause damages of cracks or the like in the mounted semiconductor chips and solder plates that become in contact with the packaging jig, and further is readily machined.

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-194477 (also referred to herein as &#x201c;Patent Document 1&#x201d;) discloses a positioning jig comprising a first jig and a second jig, the latter being analogous to the inner positioning piece mentioned above. The first jig has a positioning hole (i.e., an opening) into which a solder sheet (i.e., a solder plate) and a semiconductor element (i.e., a semiconductor chip) are inserted. The positioning hole is disposed corresponding to a metal circuit (i.e., a conductive pattern) on a circuit board (i.e., a packaging substrate). The second jig is possible to be inserted into and removed from the positioning hole. The second jig has a pressing surface that opposes the metal circuit in the state of the second jig inserted into the positioning hole and presses the semiconductor element put on the solder sheet towards the circuit board. The second jig is positioned by the wall surface of the positioning hole so that the pressing surface opposes the metal circuit in the state of the second jig inserted into the positioning hole. The document asserts that such a construction well solders the semiconductor element to the joint place and forms a good solder fillet.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The purpose of the assembly jig in this document is to improve formation of a solder fillet. Fillet formation is assisted by making the jig directly in contact with the semiconductor chip and pressing the semiconductor chip. In order to obtain a good fillet configuration, the jig is made from stainless steel and heats the jig itself.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-270262 (also referred to herein as &#x201c;Patent Document 2&#x201d;) discloses a positioning jig in which a planar body, which is analogous to the inner positioning jig mentioned above, has protrusions protruding from the lower surface of the planar body toward an insulation substrate at places close to the outer periphery thereof by creating steps in the lower surface of the planar body within a range including a part of a positioning hole. Since the protrusions provided on the lower surface of the planar body touch or approach the upper surface of the insulation substrate close to the outer periphery thereof when the positioning jig is put on the insulation substrate convex upward, a solder foil and a heating element in the positioning hole are so disposed that movement in the positioning hole is restricted by the protrusions and thus, the solder foil and the heating element are mounted at a predetermined position. The document asserts that such a construction allows a semiconductor element to be mounted at a predetermined position on a curved insulation substrate without shifting the element.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to cope with the shift of the chip, the construction of this document comprises the parts analogous to the inner positioning piece and the outer framework, and in consideration of distortion of the packaging substrate protruding toward upper or front surface side of the packaging substrate due to heat in the soldering process, the inner positioning piece is cut in the central region thereof to absorb the protruding distortion of the packaging substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-040881 (also referred to herein as &#x201c;Patent Document 3&#x201d;) discloses a positioning construction in which a carbon jig for positioning (i.e., an inner positioning piece) is disposed on the front surface side of an insulating circuit board and, a solder plate and a semiconductor chip are placed in the opening of the carbon jig. Then, the whole assembly is put into a heating furnace and heated up to a temperature higher than the melting point of the solder for example, about 300&#xb0; C. to melt the solder. Thus, the semiconductor chip is mounted on the insulating circuit board. While the insulating circuit board is temporarily distorted in a configuration protruding toward rear surface side when heated, since the carbon jig has a stepped portion on the rear surface side so as to make the carbon jig thinner toward the direction separating from the opening, the degree of close attachment between the carbon jig and the insulating circuit board is enhanced, according to the assertion of the document.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The construction described in the document, in consideration of distortion of the packaging substrate, concaved in the front surface side thereof due to heat in the soldering process, has an inner positioning piece cut in the peripheral region thereof to absorb the concave distortion of the packaging substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With the progress of performance improvement in semiconductor chips, reduction of size and thickness of a semiconductor chip has been recently in progress. The thickness of semiconductor chips has been reduced down to about 100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a packaging substrate <b>53</b> curved at a temperature in the soldering process. The packaging substrate <b>53</b> curves due to thermal stress in the assembling process. This curved configuration creates a gap S between the packaging substrate surface <b>53</b><i>a </i>and the rear surface <b>61</b><i>a </i>(i.e., the rear surface of a flat plate <b>62</b>) of the inner positioning piece <b>61</b> that is one of the components of the assembly jig. If the gap S becomes larger than a dimension T<b>5</b> that is the sum of the thickness of the semiconductor chip <b>55</b> with an advanced thickness reduction and the thickness of the melted solder <b>54</b><i>b</i>, which is nearly equal to a thickness of the solder plate <b>54</b><i>a</i>, the semiconductor chip <b>55</b> should slip aside in this gap S, which causes difficulty in accurate positioning of the semiconductor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The Patent Documents 1, 2, and 3 all do not disclose such a means for preventing the semiconductor chip from slipping aside in the gap that provides one chip-positioning piece for every one semiconductor chip and makes the gap between the assembly jig (i.e., the bottom surface of the chip positioning piece) and the thermally distorted packaging substrate surface be smaller than the sum of the thickness of the semiconductor chip and the thickness of the solder disposed under the semiconductor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, in the construction disclosed in Patent Document 3, when the curvature of the concaved packaging substrate surface becomes large, the inner positioning piece in the document leaves the very large gap failing to absorb the large concaved curvature. Thus, the semiconductor chip slips aside in the gap. Accordingly, there are presently certain needs in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the present invention address these and other needs. Embodiments of the invention provide an assembly jig for a semiconductor device and an assembly method for a semiconductor device in which the dimension of the gap between the assembly jig and the packaging substrate surface is made smaller than the sum of the thickness of the semiconductor chip and the thickness of the solder in the process of soldering the semiconductor chip to the packaging substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the invention include an outer framework for positioning a packaging substrate, the outer framework being positioned and mounted on a cooling base, an inner positioning piece in a shape of a flat plate positioned by the outer framework and mounted on the packaging substrate, and a chip positioning piece(s) positioned by an opening(s) formed in the inner positioning piece and allowed to move in the vertical direction relative to and independently of the inner positioning piece. Also, A length of the chip positioning piece passing through the opening in the inner positioning piece is larger than a thickness of the inner positioning piece.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the length of the chip positioning piece passing through the opening in the inner positioning piece is at least a dimension that allows a part of a bottom surface of the chip positioning piece to become in contact with an upper surface of the packaging substrate curved in an amount estimated at elevated temperatures to which the packaging substrate is subjected.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the chip positioning piece includes a pipe portion passing through the opening of the inner positioning piece and a flange portion on the pipe portion, and a length of the pipe portion is at least a dimension that allows a part of a bottom surface of the chip positioning piece to become in contact with an upper surface of the packaging substrate curved in an amount estimated at elevated temperatures to which the packaging substrate is subjected.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the outer framework, the inner positioning piece, and the chip positioning piece are formed from carbon.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, a method of assembling a semiconductor device can include steps of positioning and mounting an outer framework on a cooling base, mounting a first solder plate on the cooling base inside the outer framework and a packaging substrate on the first solder plate by positioning with the outer framework, mounting an inner positioning piece on the packaging substrate by positioning with the outer framework, inserting a pipe portion of a chip positioning piece into an opening of the inner positioning piece and positioning the chip positioning piece by making a part of a bottom surface of the pipe portion of the chip positioning piece become in contact with the packaging substrate, and inserting a second solder plate and a semiconductor chip laminated in this order into an opening of the chip positioning piece to position the second solder plate and the semiconductor chip. The method can also include putting a whole assembly into a heating furnace and melting the first solder plate and the second solder plate while making a part of the bottom surface of the pipe portion of the chip positioning piece be in contact with the packaging substrate that is curved due to thermal stress, the whole assembly including the cooling base, the packaging substrate, the first and second solder plates, the semiconductor chip, and an assembly jig that includes the outer framework, the inner positioning piece, and the chip positioning piece; solidifying the first solder plate and the second solder plate which have been melted, to fix the packaging substrate onto the cooling base and fix the semiconductor chip onto the packaging substrate and extracting the whole assembly from the heating furnace and removing the assembly jig from the cooling base.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, a length of the pipe portion of the chip positioning piece is at least a dimension that allows a part of the bottom surface of the pipe portion of the chip positioning piece to become in contact with an upper surface of the packaging substrate curved at temperatures to melt the first and second solder plates.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, when the packaging substrate is curved concaving upward at temperatures of melting the solder, the gap between the assembly jig and the packaging substrate can be made smaller than the dimension of the sum of the thickness of the semiconductor chip and the thickness of the melted solder by allowing a part of the bottom surface of the chip positioning piece to become always in contact with the upper surface of the packaging substrate owing to the weight of the chip positioning jig itself. As a consequence, in some embodiments, the semiconductor chip does not slip aside out of the opening of the chip positioning piece. Therefore, the semiconductor chip can be positioned accurately on the packaging substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the process of positioning and soldering a semiconductor chip on a packaging substrate using an assembly jig, the packaging substrate typically curves at a certain temperature in the soldering process. Embodiments of the invention prevent a semiconductor chip with a reduced thickness from a positional shift by making a dimension of the gap between the assembly jig and the surface of the packaging substrate be smaller than the sum of the thickness of the semiconductor chip and the thickness of the melted solder irrespective of a quantity of the distortion.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>) through <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>) show a construction of an assembly jig for a semiconductor device of a first embodiment example according to embodiments of the present invention, in which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>) show a structure of a chip positioning piece, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>) show a structure of an inner positioning piece, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>) show a structure of an outer framework, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>) show a construction of whole of the assembly jig. Of these drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>), and <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>) are plan views and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>), <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>) are sectional views taken along the line X-X in the respective plan views.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>), the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is composed of a pipe portion <b>2</b> and a flange portion <b>4</b> formed at the top of the pipe portion <b>2</b>. The chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is provided with an opening <b>5</b> having a square shape in a top plan view and has four side surfaces <b>3</b> around the opening <b>5</b>. The flange portion <b>4</b> is provided for the purpose of preventing the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> from dropping through an opening <b>9</b> in an inner positioning piece <b>7</b> when the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is inserted into the opening <b>9</b>. A gap of about 0.05 mm is formed between the outer wall surface of the pipe portion of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b>, which is an outer wall surface of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b>, and an inner wall surface <b>10</b> of the opening <b>9</b> in the inner positioning piece <b>7</b>. Thus, the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> can freely and independently move in the vertical direction with respect to the inner positioning piece <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">If two adjacent chip positioning pieces are formed in a configuration of direct contact with each other (this case is not shown in the drawings), a flange portion is not formed at this contact side and the outer wall surface of the pipe portion <b>2</b> is extended up to the top of the flange portion <b>4</b> forming an outer side surface <b>3</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b>. In this case, a gap of about 0.05 mm is provided between the outer side surface of the two adjacent chip positioning pieces <b>1</b> allowing easy relative slip motion.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The length L<b>1</b> of the pipe portion <b>2</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b>, the pipe portion <b>2</b> being disposed through the opening <b>9</b> in the inner positioning piece <b>7</b>, is larger than the thickness L<b>2</b> of the inner positioning piece <b>7</b>. Preferably, the length L<b>1</b> of the pipe portion <b>2</b> is long enough to allow the bottom of the pipe portion <b>2</b> to become in contact with a packaging substrate <b>21</b> (which is not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) through <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>) but illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11)</figref> curved at a temperature in the soldering process as described afterward.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the configuration in which a part of the bottom surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the pipe portion <b>2</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is always in contact with the packaging substrate <b>21</b>, the dimension T<b>1</b> of the gap between the bottom surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the pipe portion <b>2</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is smaller than the dimension T<b>2</b> of the sum of the thickness W<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> and the length W<b>2</b><i>a </i>of the melted solder (which is approximately equal to the thickness W<b>2</b> of the solder plate). Therefore, a positional shift of the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In order to ensure the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> to become in contact with the packaging substrate <b>21</b> by the weight of the chip positioning piece itself, the weight of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is sufficiently increased by increasing the thickness of the flange portion <b>4</b>, for example. The flange portion <b>4</b> can be eliminated from the chip positioning piece <b>1</b>, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the example described above, the opening <b>5</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> has a shape of square in the top plan view and the opening <b>5</b> is surrounded by four surfaces of a monolithic side wall <b>3</b>. The four surfaces, however, can be formed by combining four separated flat plates, or forming two or three continuous surfaces by a monolithic body with two or three walls and the other necessary surfaces by a side wall(s) of other chip positioning piece.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The inner positioning piece <b>7</b> is a flat plate <b>8</b> having openings <b>9</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>). The flat plate <b>8</b> of the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> is positioned by an outer framework <b>13</b> on a cooling base and a packaging substrate (for sake of clarity, these parts are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) through <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>), but are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5)</figref>. In the opening <b>9</b> of the inner positioning piece <b>7</b>, the pipe portion <b>2</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is inserted. In this example, the openings <b>9</b> of the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> are prepared corresponding to one chip positioning piece <b>1</b> for one opening <b>9</b>. The opening <b>9</b>, however, can have such a large planar area that allows two or more chip positioning pieces <b>1</b> to be inserted in one enlarged opening.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The outer framework <b>13</b> is composed of a frame <b>14</b> for positioning the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> and a tab <b>17</b> for positioning the packaging substrate <b>21</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>). In end regions of the frame <b>14</b>, positioning holes <b>16</b> are formed. A cooling base <b>25</b>, a component of the semiconductor module, is also provided with positioning holes <b>26</b> in the end regions thereof as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>). By fitting the holes <b>16</b> to the holes <b>26</b>, the outer framework <b>13</b> is positioned and fixed to the cooling base <b>25</b> using bolts and nuts (not depicted in the drawings), for example. Alternatively, the frame <b>14</b> can be provided with positioning metal pins analogous to the metal pins <b>68</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> instead of the positioning holes <b>16</b> formed in the end region of the frame <b>14</b>. The metal pins are inserted into the positioning holes <b>26</b> in the cooling base <b>25</b> to position the outer framework <b>13</b> on the cooling base <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the tabs are absent in the outer framework <b>13</b>, the packaging substrate <b>21</b> and the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> are positioned using the inner wall surface <b>15</b> of the outer framework <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>) show construction of the whole of the assembly jig. The assembly jig <b>100</b> is composed of the outer framework <b>13</b>, the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> positioned by the inner wall surface <b>15</b> of the frame <b>14</b> of the outer framework <b>13</b>, and the chip positioning pieces <b>1</b> positioned by the openings <b>9</b> of the inner positioning piece <b>7</b>. When a soldering step in the process of assembling a semiconductor device is conducted in a reducing atmosphere and at high temperatures without using flux, the assembling jig <b>100</b> is preferably made from carbon which does not contaminate the heating furnace (without attacking property), little deforms thermally, scarcely damages the touching parts including the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> by cracking or other destructive phenomenon, and is readily machined.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>) show a configuration in which the solder plate <b>24</b>, the packaging substrate <b>21</b>, and the assembly jig <b>100</b> are positioned on the cooling base <b>25</b>. The solder plate <b>24</b> is put on the cooling base <b>25</b> and then the packaging substrate <b>21</b> is put on the solder plate <b>24</b>, the packaging substrate <b>21</b> being positioned by the tab <b>17</b> of the outer framework <b>13</b> which composes the assembly jig <b>100</b>. The chip positioning pieces <b>1</b> are put on the packaging substrate <b>21</b> and positioned by the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> which composes the assembling jig <b>100</b>. The cooling base <b>25</b> and the outer framework <b>13</b> can be positioned relatively to each other for example, using metal pins as in a conventional construction.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The packaging substrate <b>21</b> is distorted with the upper surface thereof concaved upward when heated to temperatures at which the first solder plate <b>24</b> and the second solder plate <b>32</b> beneath the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> melt. (The second solder plate <b>32</b> and the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>) but shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.) In the construction of embodiment, the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is allowed to move freely and independently in the vertical direction with respect to the inner positioning piece <b>7</b>, and the length L<b>1</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is adequately larger than the thickness L<b>2</b> of the inner protruding piece <b>7</b>. As a consequence, a part of the bottom surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the pipe portion <b>2</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> can be always in contact with the upper surface <b>22</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b> owing to the weight of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> itself even when the packaging substrate is concaved upward.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The whole of the assembly jig <b>100</b> can be removed from the cooling base <b>25</b> by removing and lifting the outer framework <b>13</b> from the cooling base <b>25</b>, which in turn raises the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> by the tab <b>17</b> of the outer framework <b>13</b>, thereby picking up the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> by the periphery of the opening <b>9</b> of the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> which becomes in contact with the flange portion <b>4</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b>. Thus, whole the assembly jig <b>100</b> is removed altogether at once.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the tab <b>17</b> of the outer framework <b>13</b> and the flange portion <b>4</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> are not provided, the outer framework <b>13</b> and the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> are individually lifted and removed from the cooling base <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the situation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> in the soldering process, the gap T<b>1</b> between the bottom surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the pipe portion of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> and the upper surface <b>22</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b> can be made smaller than the dimension T<b>2</b> of the sum of the thickness W<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> and the thickness W<b>2</b><i>a </i>of the melted solder <b>32</b><i>a </i>beneath the semiconductor chip <b>31</b>, the thickness W<b>2</b><i>a </i>being approximately equal to the thickness W<b>2</b> of the solder plate <b>32</b>. Consequently, the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> does not shift laterally when the solder plate <b>32</b> melts to the melted solder <b>32</b><i>a</i>, to avoid slipping out from the opening <b>5</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b>. Therefore, the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> is positioned on the packaging substrate <b>21</b> with high accuracy.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Then referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the second solder plate <b>32</b> and the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> on the second solder plate <b>32</b> are positioned and mounted on the packaging substrate <b>21</b> by inserting into the opening <b>5</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Then referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the whole assembly is put into a heating furnace <b>41</b>, the whole assembly including the semiconductor chip <b>31</b>, the second solder plate <b>32</b>, the chip positioning piece <b>1</b>, the inner positioning piece <b>7</b>, the outer framework <b>13</b>, the packaging substrate <b>21</b>, the first solder plate <b>24</b>, and the cooling base <b>25</b> mounting all the parts listed above. The whole assembly in the heating furnace <b>41</b> is heated in a reducing atmosphere <b>42</b> at a temperature of about 300&#xb0; C. to melt the first and second solder plates <b>24</b> and <b>32</b> transforming the solder plates into melted solders <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Then, the melted solders <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>a </i>are solidified by cooling in the heating furnace <b>41</b> to fix the packaging substrate <b>21</b> onto the cooling base <b>25</b> and fix the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> onto the packaging substrate <b>21</b> with the solidified solders <b>24</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, respectively. After that, the whole assembly including the assembly jig <b>100</b>, the cooling base <b>25</b>, the packaging substrate <b>21</b>, the solidified solders <b>24</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> is extracted from the heating furnace <b>41</b>, and the assembly jig <b>100</b> is removed from the cooling base <b>25</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Thus, the soldering process is completed to fix the packaging substrate <b>21</b> onto the cooling base <b>25</b> and fix the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> onto the packaging substrate <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is an enlarged sectional view showing the state in the step illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> with melted solders. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the surface <b>22</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b> is concaved upward at the temperature of the soldering process. This concaving distortion creates a gap R between the bottom surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> and the upper surface <b>22</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b>. However, in the positioning jig of the invention, the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> inserted in the opening <b>9</b> of the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> is not fixed but allowed to move freely and independently in the vertical direction in the inner positioning piece <b>7</b>. Consequently, a part of the bottom surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the pipe portion <b>2</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is always in contact with the upper surface <b>22</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b> following the distortion of the packaging substrate <b>21</b>. The gap T<b>1</b> between the bottom surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the pipe portion <b>2</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> and the upper surface <b>22</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b> is very small in this situation. Therefore, the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> does not slip aside from the opening <b>5</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> and a lateral positional shift of the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">This situation is described more in detail in the following. With increase in the temperature, the packaging substrate <b>21</b> becomes more curved, to increase the gap R between the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> and the upper surface <b>22</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b>. The gap R would be as large as about 500 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the construction of the invention, however, the chip positioning jig <b>1</b> is always allowed to become contact with the upper surface <b>22</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b> owing to the weight of the chip positioning jig itself independently of the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> at a part of the chip positioning jig <b>1</b>. Consequently, the gap T<b>1</b> between the bottom surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the pipe portion <b>22</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> and the upper surface <b>2</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b> can be made small for example less than about 50 &#x3bc;m for a semiconductor chip <b>31</b> of about 10 mm square.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">On the other hand, for a semiconductor chip <b>31</b> with a thickness W<b>1</b> of 100 &#x3bc;m and a solder plate with a thickness W<b>2</b> of 100 &#x3bc;m, for example, the gap of about 200 &#x3bc;m is permitted between the upper surface <b>22</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b> and the bottom surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the pipe portion <b>2</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b>. Hence, a large margin in the gap of 150 &#x3bc;m=200 &#x3bc;m&#x2212;50 &#x3bc;m can be obtained, in which the dimension 200 &#x3bc;m is the allowable gap and the dimension 50 &#x3bc;m is the largest presumable gap T<b>1</b> in these conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Since the length L<b>1</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is larger than the thickness L<b>2</b> of the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> in an amount greater than the gap R between the inner positioning piece <b>7</b> and the upper surface <b>22</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b>, a part of the bottom surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the pipe portion <b>2</b> of the chip positioning piece <b>1</b> is always in contact with the upper surface <b>22</b> of the packaging substrate <b>21</b>. Therefore, a lateral positional shift of the semiconductor chip <b>31</b> is avoided and positioning accuracy of the chip is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The curving distortion of the packaging substrate <b>21</b> occurs caused by the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of an insulation substrate and conductive materials of a conductive pattern and a conductive film on the insulation substrate. (The insulation substrate and the conductive materials are not shown in the drawings.) The conductive film is formed on the back surfaced of the insulation substrate and the conductive pattern is formed on the front surface of the insulation substrate. The conductive film on the back surface is not formed in a conductive pattern but formed as a uniform single sheet on the whole back surface. The conduction pattern on the front surface, on the other hand, is composed of a plurality of circuit patterns. Hence, the area of the conductive film on the back surface is larger than that of the conductive pattern on the front surface. As a consequence, the packaging substrate <b>21</b> distorts with a concaved front surface, which is the upper surface, when the thermal expansion coefficient of the conductive material is larger than that of the insulation substrate at elevated temperatures.</p>
