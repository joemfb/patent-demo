<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to pumps and more particularly to pumps of the type which include for example sump pumps, submersible pumps, jet pumps and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Centrifugal sump pumps find application in a wide range of industries including mining. Mining applications for sump pumps typically include pumping a mixture of water with mineral particles of different particle sizes and densities. This mixture is commonly referred to as slurry and because it contains solids it can be very abrasive. Consequently sump pumps used in mining in most instances are constructed from wear resistant materials.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sump pumps used in mining applications are typically mounted on beams on top of a usually wide and relative shallow sump or pit. A driving motor and pump bearings are all disposed above floor level so they are not submerged thereby ensuring longer life of these parts. The pumping elements are attached to a vertical shaft and are normally positioned at the end of a long cantilevered shaft and near to or close to the bottom of the sump. The sumps are normally located strategically within the plant and sunk below the normal floor level with shallow angled surrounding floor areas so that all leakage, spillage or slurry products will gravitate directly into the sump. Depending on the size of the sump in relation to the sump pump, the type of particles and their density and the flow rate of slurry required from the sump, some percentage of particles will naturally collect in the bottom of the sump and, once settled out of the water, they tend not be picked up again by the sump pump. Over time these particles build-up and can block the sump, particularly if the particles tend to bind together.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional sump pump apparatus is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which is a schematic sectional side elevation thereof. The sump pump <b>10</b> as shown includes a pump casing <b>12</b> with an impeller <b>14</b> disposed therein. The impeller <b>14</b> is operatively connected to a drive shaft <b>16</b> which in the normal pump operating position is generally vertically arranged. The drive shaft <b>16</b> is supported by a bearing assembly <b>18</b> and is operatively connected to a driving motor (not shown). A column <b>20</b> surrounds the drive shaft <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The pump casing <b>12</b> has two inlets to a pump chamber <b>21</b> within the casing, namely a first inlet <b>22</b> and a second inlet <b>24</b>. A first strainer <b>26</b> is provided at the first inlet <b>22</b> and a second strainer <b>28</b> at the second inlet <b>24</b>. A discharge pipe <b>25</b> extends from the pump casing <b>12</b>. When in use the first inlet <b>22</b> and strainer <b>26</b> is positioned close to the bottom of the sump with the second inlet <b>24</b> located above it. The strainers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> function to prevent the ingress of large particulate matter into direct contact with the impeller <b>14</b> which is housed in the casing <b>12</b>. Such particulates can jam the rotation of the impeller and possibly damage the impeller, leading to an early failure of the sump pump. However the impeller can still become damaged by a build-up of finer particulates within the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to try and alleviate the problems of particle build up both in the sump pit and within the conventional sump pump housing as referred to above, it has been proposed to provide agitators which somehow extend separately into the sump pit, or another co-axial type of agitator which can be fitted to an extension shaft which projects below the second inlet <b>24</b>. However the effectiveness of known agitators can vary considerably and, because agitators tend to wear rapidly, their efficiency can be rapidly diminished during use. In some circumstances, trials have been made in which the lower sump pump inlet <b>22</b> is completely closed off, with the slurry only entering via the upper pump inlet <b>24</b>. While this may prevent jamming the rotation of the impeller, this may also limit the flow that can be pumped, which in turn may result in sump overflow.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first aspect the present invention provides a pump impeller having a rotational axis and including:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">a hub,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">a back shroud extending from the hub, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">a front shroud,
<br/>
wherein each of the shrouds has an inner surface and an outer surface, the impeller also having:
</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0011">a plurality of pumping vanes extending between the respective inner surfaces of the shrouds, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0012">an impeller inlet opening in the front shroud coaxial with the rotation axis of the impeller,</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0013">wherein the impeller includes one or more inducer elements which extend from the inner surface of the front shroud towards the rotation axis and which are positioned adjacent the impeller inlet opening.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0014">During use of such an impeller, when the impeller is caused to rotate the inducer elements can assist the uplift of particulate matter into the region of the pumping vanes and thus the subsequent removal of the matter from adjacent the impeller inlet opening. In situations such as clearing settled solids from a sump pit, the particles may be relatively large in size or naturally heavy or dense, and the inducer elements can assist with the removal of such settled material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0015">In one embodiment the impeller can include a plurality of inducer elements, the said elements are arranged circumferentially about the impeller inlet opening. In other forms there may be only one inducer element, for example a screw-form or helix shaped protrusion on the inside surface of the impeller front shroud.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0016">In one embodiment a plurality of flow generating elements can be arranged in a spaced apart fashion and extending from the outer surface of the front shroud in the region of the impeller opening. The arrangement is such that in use the flow generating elements are adapted to cause a recirculating flow in the region of the pump inlet and externally thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">In one embodiment the front shroud can include an annular wall portion and a projecting wall portion depending therefrom, the projecting wall portion arranged to extend away from the pumping vanes to terminate at a free end, the impeller inlet opening being in the region of the free end so as to define an impeller intake region between the impeller inlet opening and the pumping vanes.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">In one embodiment the projecting wall portion can taper inwardly from the annular wall portion when moving in a direction towards the free end. In one form of this, the projecting wall portion may be curved.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">In one embodiment the impeller can also have a further group of pumping vanes on the outer surface of the back shroud arranged in spaced relation from one another. In one form of this, each further pumping vane can be curved with one end adjacent the back shroud outer peripheral edge and extending inwardly therefrom towards the hub.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">In one embodiment of the impeller, in situations where there are a plurality of inducer elements, the said elements can be in the form of vanes. In one form the vanes can be generally of an aerofoil shape. In one arrangement, the vanes can be located on the inner surface of the projecting wall portion adjacent the free end.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">In one embodiment of the impeller, in situations where there is a plurality of flow generating elements, the said elements can also in the form of vanes. In one form these vanes can also generally be of an aerofoil shape. In one arrangement, these vanes can be located on the outer surface of the projecting wall portion adjacent the free end.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">The inducer elements are arranged such that in use, when the impeller is rotating they assist in creating a swirling flow adjacent to and externally of the impeller inlet. In one embodiment the inducer elements are in the form of vanes extending from the inner surface of the front shroud, each having free edge portion which is spaced from the central rotation axis. In one arrangement of this, each vane extends towards the rotation axis to a point about half the radius of the impeller opening. The inducer vanes may be of any suitable shape and not necessarily aerofoil-shaped. The vanes may extend generally radially or may be inclined to the normal radial direction. Any suitable number of inducer elements may be provided, and in one embodiment two are arranged in diametric opposed position at the impeller flow intake region.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">In a second aspect the present invention provides a flow directing device, in use for directing material in relation to an adjacent moving impeller, the device including a main body having an inner side and an outer side, a plurality of passageways extending between the inner side and the outer side of the main body, at least one passageway providing for the in use delivery of material to an opening of the impeller and at least one other passageway providing for the in use circulation of a flow of material past the impeller.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">In response to the in use rotation of the adjacent impeller, such a device can create a recirculation flow pattern of slurry material aimed to cause the disturbance of settled particulate matter in the region of the impeller, which can be important for clearing settled solids from a sump pit when the particles may be large in size or naturally heavy or dense. Once the settled solid material is disturbed, the flow directing device also has a separate passageway which leads to the opening of the impeller where the pumping action draws the fluidised slurry material into the impeller for removal. The device therefore performs a dual function and is ideally suited to pumping applications in areas where solids may have been allowed to settle for some time.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">In one form, the flow directing device can include a chamber adjacent the inner side of the main body, said passageways communicating with said chamber. In one form the device can include a plurality of said delivery passageways and a plurality of said circulation passageways.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">In one embodiment, a plurality of said passageways can be generally annular in shape when viewed in a horizontal cross-section and arranged substantially concentrically with respect to one another. In one form of this, the or each circulation passageway may be disposed radially outwardly with respect to the or each delivery passageway.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">In one embodiment of the flow directing device, the main body includes a peripheral side wall section and a plurality of concentrically arranged ring shaped elements operatively connected together and operatively connected to the peripheral side wall section, the annular spaces between the ring shaped elements providing for said passageways. In one form of this, one of said ring shaped elements can include a skirt portion at the outer side of the main body which provides for a partial barrier between the circulation passageway(s) and the delivery passageway(s).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">In a third aspect the present invention provides a flow directing device which is arranged to direct two material flows in response to the relative movement of an adjacent impeller, the flows being:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">

    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0029">a mixing flow in which material is mixed and agitated in response to the movement of the adjacent impeller in use; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0030">a pumping flow in which material is passed through the adjacent impeller in use and pumped to another location.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0031">Such a device has operational advantages as have already been described herein for the device of the second aspect.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0032">In a fourth aspect the present invention provides a pump casing including:

        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0035">a feed opening between the intake region and the pumping chamber;
<br/>
wherein a plurality of flow distribution vanes are positioned in the region of the feed opening.
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0036">In response to the in use rotation of the adjacent impeller, the flow distribution vane(s) in the pump casing can assist with the efficient delivery of slurry material into the pumping chamber, where the pumping action draws the fluidised slurry material into the impeller for removal. The vane(s) can reduce swirl and improve the efficiency of delivery of the slurry flow to the in use outer surface of the back shroud of the impeller.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0037">In one embodiment having a plurality of inlets, said flow distribution vanes can extend from the inlets and be arranged in spaced-apart relation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0038">In one embodiment the main body section can include a back wall and a peripheral side wall depending from said back wall, wherein the intake region extends from said back wall in a direction opposite to the peripheral side wall.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0090">Referring now to the drawings, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> a pump assembly <b>100</b> is shown which comprises a pump casing <b>30</b>, an impeller <b>50</b> and a flow directing device <b>80</b>. The impeller <b>50</b> is disposed within the pump casing <b>30</b> and the flow directing device <b>80</b> mounted to the pump casing to enclose the impeller <b>50</b> therebetween when the three components are assembled together. In one normal mode of operation the impeller <b>50</b> is mounted for rotation about a substantially vertical axis, and the flow directing device <b>80</b> is disposed below the pump casing <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 8</figref> the pump casing <b>30</b> includes a pump body section <b>32</b> having a pumping chamber <b>36</b> therein which is adapted to receive the impeller <b>50</b>. The pump body section <b>32</b> includes a peripheral side wall <b>34</b>, a back wall <b>38</b> and an open front side <b>42</b>. A peripheral mounting flange <b>35</b> surrounds the open front side <b>42</b>. The central axis of flange <b>35</b> is axially offset with respect to the central axis of second inlet <b>44</b>. The open front side <b>42</b> provides for a first inlet <b>40</b> to the pumping chamber <b>36</b>. A discharge pipe <b>49</b> extends from the peripheral side wall <b>34</b> and is in fluid communication with the pumping chamber <b>36</b>. The pumping chamber <b>36</b> is of a volute shape.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0092">The pump casing <b>30</b> further includes a strainer section <b>46</b> which extends from the back wall <b>38</b> of the pump body section <b>32</b>. The strainer section <b>46</b> and the pump body section <b>32</b> are an integral unit which may be cast or otherwise suitably formed. By manufacturing the strainer section of wear resistant material (as is the pump body section <b>32</b>), the life of the product can be extended compared with the prior art apparatus (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in which the strainer section is made of a mesh material which can become rapidly worn. The strainer section <b>46</b> is hollow and has a generally frusto-conical side wall <b>43</b> tapering inwardly towards the back wall <b>38</b> of the pump body section <b>32</b>. A mounting flange <b>51</b> is provided at the end of the strainer section <b>46</b> remote from pump body section <b>32</b>. A second inlet <b>44</b> provides for fluid communication between the pumping chamber <b>36</b> and the interior of the strainer section <b>46</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, six elongate feed aperture slots <b>45</b> are arranged in the side wall <b>43</b> of the strainer section <b>46</b>, the apertures <b>45</b> being in spaced apart relation around the side wall <b>43</b>. A plurality of flow distribution vanes in the form of twelve vertically-aligned, elongate protrusions <b>47</b> are provided in the region of inlet <b>44</b>. These protrusions <b>47</b> assist the even flow of slurry material and reduce swirl in flow from the strainer section <b>46</b> into the pumping chamber <b>36</b> via the inlet <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0093">In further embodiments of the pump casing, a different shape of strainer section other than frusto-conical can be envisaged, as well as a different shape of the pump body section <b>32</b>, for example dome-like rather than the generally flat-topped form <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0094">Referring now in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 14</figref> there is illustrated an impeller <b>50</b> which, as is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, comprises a hub <b>52</b> having a mounting <b>54</b> for a drive shaft (not shown) and an eye <b>53</b>. The impeller <b>50</b> is rotatable about the axis of rotation X-X. The impeller further includes a back shroud <b>56</b> extending from the eye <b>53</b> of the hub <b>52</b> the back shroud having an inner face <b>57</b> and an outer face <b>58</b>. The impeller further includes a front shroud <b>60</b> with an impeller opening <b>70</b> extending therethrough. A plurality of pumping vanes <b>74</b> extend between the shrouds <b>56</b> and <b>60</b>, each vane having an inner leading edge portion <b>76</b> and a trailing outer edge portion <b>77</b>. The front shroud has an inner surface <b>62</b> and an outer surface <b>63</b>. As shown, the front shroud <b>60</b> is generally curved in shape to define a projecting wall portion which extends away from the pumping vanes <b>74</b> and which tapers in an inwardly curved manner. The portion of the front shroud <b>60</b> which is adjacent to the impeller opening <b>70</b> is generally coaxial with respect to the rotation axis X-X. The shroud <b>60</b> has an inner edge <b>65</b> and an outer edge <b>66</b>, the impeller inlet opening <b>70</b> being at the inner edge <b>65</b>. In the space between the shrouds <b>56</b>, <b>60</b> is a flow intake region <b>68</b> which is located between the inner edge of the front shroud <b>65</b> and the inner edge of the vanes <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0095">The impeller also includes four further pumping vanes <b>78</b> extending from the outer face <b>58</b> of back shroud <b>56</b>. These pumping vanes <b>78</b> are generally curved and arranged with one end being adjacent to the outer peripheral edge portion <b>77</b> of the back shroud <b>56</b>, and the other end being adjacent to the hub <b>52</b>. In use a material slurry which is drawn into the pump in the region of the back shroud <b>56</b> by the rotation of the impeller <b>50</b> is pumped via these pumping vanes <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0096">The impeller <b>50</b> further includes two flow inducer elements disposed circumferentially within the flow intake region <b>68</b>. The inducer elements are in the form of inducer vanes <b>73</b> which are located on the inner face <b>57</b> of the front shroud and which extend toward the axis of rotation X-X. These inducer vanes <b>73</b> help create a swirling flow which, in the application of a sump pump, extends from the impeller inlet towards the bottom of the sump or pit to assist the particles to be uplifted and entrained in the flow and to enter the pump impeller <b>50</b>. The number, size, shape and proportion of the vanes can vary beyond the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 14</figref> in which two vanes are shown of aerofoil cross section, angled relative to the flow into the intake, positioned diametrically opposite one another at the impeller opening <b>70</b> and extending towards the inlet centreline by approximately 50% of the radius. The number and shape of the inducer vanes, and the angle and distance of each relative to the centreline can be varied to optimise the inflow to suit specific pumping needs.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0097">The impeller <b>50</b> further includes a plurality of flow generating vanes <b>72</b> extending from the outer surface of the front shroud. As illustrated six vanes are shown around the outer surface of the front shroud. These flow generating vanes <b>72</b> help create a recirculating flow in the region of the pump inlet, aimed to cause a disturbance of any settled particulate matter in the region of the impeller which, in the application of a sump pump, can be in the bottom of the sump or pit to assist the particles to be entrained in the flow. The number, size, shape and proportion of the vanes can vary beyond the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 14</figref> in which six vanes are shown of aerofoil cross section, each aerofoil being angled relative to the flow into the intake region <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0098">Referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 20</figref>, a flow directing device <b>80</b> is shown which, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, comprises a main body <b>81</b> which is comprised of an outer peripheral wall section <b>85</b> and an inner section. <b>86</b>. The outer wall section <b>85</b> and inner wall section <b>86</b> are interconnected by a series of flanges <b>87</b>. The main body <b>81</b> has an inner side <b>82</b> and an outer side <b>83</b>. The outer peripheral wall section <b>85</b> is generally circular when viewed in plan and has an annular mounting flange <b>88</b> at one side thereof. A chamber <b>89</b> is provided adjacent the inner side <b>82</b> and is in communication with concentrically arranged delivery passageways <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> and formed by ring shaped elements <b>95</b> and <b>96</b>. Passageway <b>92</b> is generally annular in shape about inner passageway <b>91</b>. The ring shaped elements <b>95</b> are connected together by flanges. The passageways are generally annular in shape when viewed in horizontal cross-section and arranged substantially concentrically with respect to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0099">The device <b>80</b> further includes annular flow circulating passageways <b>93</b> and <b>94</b> which provides for flow circulation between the inner and outer sides of the main body <b>81</b>. The passageways are generally concentric with one another, and the ends thereof being adjacent the inner side of the main body <b>81</b>. The ring shaped element <b>96</b> has a skirt portion <b>98</b> which extends beyond the other elements and aids as a partial barrier between the delivery passageways <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> and the flow circulating passageways <b>93</b> and <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0100">In response to the in use rotation of the adjacent impeller <b>50</b>, such a device <b>80</b> can create a recirculation flow pattern of slurry material aimed to cause the disturbance of settled particulate matter in the region of the impeller, which can be important for clearing settled solids from a sump pit when the particles may be large in size or naturally heavy or dense. Slurry material can be cycled through flow passageways <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> to effect dispersal of settled particles. Once the settled solid material is disturbed, the flow directing device <b>80</b> also has concentrically arranged delivery passageways <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> which lead to the impeller. Rotation of the impeller <b>50</b> causes a pumping action which draws the fluidised slurry material into the impeller <b>50</b> for removal. The device <b>80</b> therefore performs a dual function and is ideally suited to pumping applications in areas where solids may have been allowed to settle for some time.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0101">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> which shows the pump assembly <b>100</b> in its installed position, the axis X-X which is the axis of rotation of the impeller <b>50</b> is axially offset with respect to the central axis of the flange <b>35</b> on pump casing <b>30</b> and flange <b>88</b> on flow directing device <b>80</b>. A circular, compressible rubber seal can be incorporated between the flanges on the pump casing <b>30</b> and the device <b>80</b>. The arrangement of the flanges ensures that the device <b>80</b> can only fit in one orientation with respect to the casing <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0102">In the assembled position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the front shroud <b>60</b> of the impeller <b>50</b> is partially disposed within chamber <b>89</b> of the flow directing device <b>80</b> with the flow inducer elements <b>73</b> being adjacent and in fluid communication with passageways <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> of the device <b>80</b>, and the flow generator vanes <b>72</b> being adjacent and in fluid communication with passageways <b>93</b> and <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> a pump sub-assembly <b>110</b> is shown including a pump <b>100</b> as herein described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 21</figref>. The pump sub-assembly <b>110</b> includes a mounting plate <b>125</b> which is secured to a floor below which the sump is located. When installed the pump apparatus <b>100</b> is arranged in a generally upright orientation as shown in the drawings, with the flow directing device <b>80</b> being disposed close to the bottom of the sump. A drive shaft <b>116</b> is operatively connected to the pump impeller <b>50</b> and is supported by a bearing assembly <b>118</b>. A column <b>120</b> surrounds the drive shaft <b>116</b> and an extension pipe <b>128</b> extends from the discharge pipe <b>49</b> of the pump casing <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> a vertically-mounted motor <b>134</b> is provided to drive the pump drive shaft <b>116</b>. The motor shaft (not shown) is operatively connected to pump drive shaft <b>116</b> by a vee-belt transmission. The motor drive shaft is arranged for adjustable pivotal movement relative to the pump drive shaft <b>116</b> so that the distance between the two shafts can be adjusted thereby providing for correct tensioning or re-tensioning of the belt. This can be effected by a one point adjustment screw which can be adjusted by a hand tool. A cover <b>132</b> overlies the transmission and can be readily removed to provide access to the transmission in order to adjust the belt tension, for example. A lifting frame <b>130</b> can be used to lift the apparatus by way of any suitable lifting device.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0105">The operation of the pump apparatus will hereinafter be described. The pump sub-assembly <b>110</b> and motor <b>134</b> is installed in an upright orientation with the column <b>120</b> and pump assembly <b>100</b> extending into the sump and arranged so that the flow directing device <b>80</b> is adjacent the bottom of the sump where particulate matter tends to settle and build up.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0106">Actuation of the motor <b>134</b> causes rotation of pump drive shaft <b>116</b> and the impeller <b>50</b> associated therewith. When the impeller <b>50</b> is rotating, the inducer vanes <b>73</b> cause flow currents which stir up the particulate matter on the bottom of the sump. In addition the flow generator vanes <b>72</b> cause a circulating flow stream through the passages <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> in the flow directing device <b>80</b> which add to the disturbance of the particulate matter and cause general mixing and agitation. As a result of this action, the disturbed particulate matter will be pumped by passing through the pump casing <b>30</b> and out through the outlet pipe bend <b>49</b>. The passages in the flow directing device <b>80</b> limit the size of the particulate matter which can pass through the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0107">When the impeller <b>50</b> becomes worn, for example, the flow directing device <b>80</b> can be removed and the impeller replaced with a new one before the (or another) flow directing device <b>80</b> is refitted to the pump casing <b>30</b>.</p>
