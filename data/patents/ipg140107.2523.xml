<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Taiwanese Application No. 96123957 filed Jul. 2, 2007. The subject matter of this priority document is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Advances in medical technologies have offered new promises in the field of tissue regeneration. Recently, for example, bioengineered cartilage tissue has been surgically implanted in patients to repair cartilage in injured knees. In some situations, to engineer such an implant, primary cells are harvested from a donor tissue and cultured on scaffolds to form new tissues. During this process, harvested and cultured cells/tissues are frequently washed and filtered to remove chemical reagents and prevent contamination. Conventional washing apparatus include laboratory centrifuges that use centrifugal forces to separate tissue/cell from mixtures. However, laboratory centrifuges are not suitable for use in operating rooms.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one aspect, in general, an apparatus for washing biological material is provided which includes an outer sleeve, and an inner sleeve disposed within the outer sleeve. The outer sleeve has an open end for receiving the biological material, and an opposed closed end. The inner sleeve is detachably and slidably positioned within the outer sleeve, and includes a first port for receiving and dispensing washing liquid, a second port defining a liquid flow path between an interior of the inner sleeve and an interior of the outer sleeve, and a filter disposed in the second port. The filter allows passage of washing liquid but not passage of the biological material therethrough. A chamber, formed between the filter and the closed end of the outer sleeve, is configured to permit flow of washing liquid via the filter while retaining the biological material therein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments may include one or more of the following features.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The outer sleeve includes a first sleeve piece and a second sleeve piece detachably connected to the first sleeve piece. The inner sleeve includes a resilient member that sealingly engages an inner peripheral surface of the outer sleeve. The resilient member includes an annular rubber member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The outer sleeve comprises a base member and an extension member. The base member has an open end and an opposed closed end, and the extension member has open, first and second ends which are respectively opposed. The first end of the extension member is configured to detachably connect to the open end of the base member. The second end of the extension member is configured to detachably connect to another extension member.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in a preferred embodiment, a washing apparatus <b>100</b> includes an inner sleeve <b>20</b> detachably and slidably positioned in an outer sleeve <b>10</b>. The inner sleeve <b>20</b> and the outer sleeve <b>10</b> are elongate tubular members, and in some embodiments are circular in cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the outer sleeve <b>10</b> includes a first sleeve piece <b>11</b> and a second sleeve piece <b>12</b>. The second sleeve piece <b>12</b> serves as a base member, and includes an open upper end <b>18</b>, and a closed lower end <b>19</b>. The terms &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower&#x201d; are used here and throughout this document for descriptive purposes rather than to imply any absolute relative orientation. The first sleeve piece <b>11</b> serves as an extension member, and includes opposed upper <b>14</b> and lower <b>15</b> ends. Both the upper and lower ends <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are open. The opening in the upper end <b>14</b> is identified as an opening <b>13</b>. The lower end <b>15</b> of the first sleeve piece <b>11</b> is detachably connected to the open upper end <b>18</b> of the second sleeve piece <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the first and second sleeve pieces are connected, e.g., by threads, although it is within the scope of the invention to detachably connect the first and second sleeves <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> by other conventional means, such as press-fit engagement. In some embodiments, the outer periphery of the upper end <b>18</b> of the second sleeve piece <b>12</b> is provided with threads <b>28</b> configured to cooperatively engage complementary threads <b>27</b> formed on the inner periphery of the lower end <b>15</b> of the first sleeve piece <b>11</b>. In some embodiments, the outer periphery of the upper end <b>14</b> of the first sleeve piece is provided with threads <b>26</b> configured to cooperatively engage complementary threads of an additional extension member (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The outer sleeve <b>10</b> is configured to receive, through the opening <b>13</b>, biological material that needs to be washed. When washing is completed, the first sleeve piece <b>11</b> can be detached from the second sleeve piece <b>12</b> in which the biological material is collected.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the inner sleeve <b>20</b> has a first port <b>22</b> formed in an upper end <b>44</b> thereof, and a second port <b>23</b> formed in a lower end <b>42</b> thereof. The first port <b>22</b> is configured to receive washing liquid (e.g., saline), while the second port <b>23</b> defines a flow path for liquid exchange between the interiors of the inner and outer sleeves <b>20</b> and <b>10</b>. The upper end <b>44</b> of the inner sleeve <b>20</b> includes a stop member <b>25</b>. The stop member <b>25</b> also serves as a handle.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The stop member <b>25</b> is an outwardly extending protrusion having an outer dimension that is greater than the dimension of the opening <b>13</b> in the upper end of the outer sleeve <b>10</b>. The stop member <b>25</b> determines a maximum distance that the inner sleeve <b>20</b> is allowed to travel within in the outer sleeve <b>10</b>. The inner sleeve <b>20</b> further includes a tubular body <b>21</b> extending from the stop member <b>25</b>. In some embodiments, the tubular body <b>21</b> has an axial dimension that is less than that of the outer sleeve <b>10</b>, so that when the inner sleeve <b>20</b> is inserted into the outer sleeve <b>20</b> to the extent permitted by the stop member <b>25</b>, the lower end <b>42</b> of the inner sleeve <b>20</b> is spaced apart from the closed lower end <b>19</b> of the outer sleeve. That is, a chamber <b>50</b> is formed within the outer sleeve between the lower end <b>42</b> of the inner sleeve <b>20</b> and the closed lower end <b>19</b> of the outer sleeve, in which the biological material may be collected. Thus, the stop member <b>25</b> is provided so as to limit the extent to which the inner sleeve moves relative to the outer sleeve <b>10</b>, whereby mishandling of the apparatus <b>100</b> that may damage the biological material is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The chamber <b>50</b> varies in size based on the relative positions of the inner and outer sleeves <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The inner sleeve <b>20</b> further includes a filter structure <b>32</b> disposed in the second port <b>23</b>. Thus, an upper boundary of the chamber <b>50</b> is provided by the filter structure <b>32</b>. Biological material <b>40</b> can be placed in the outer sleeve <b>10</b> and confined in the chamber <b>50</b> by the filter <b>30</b> during washing process (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). For purposes of this disclosure, biological material <b>40</b> may include, but is not limited to, one or more of cells or lysates thereof, and tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, a resilient member <b>24</b> is provided at the lower end <b>42</b> of the inner sleeve <b>20</b> that sealingly engages an inner peripheral surface of the outer sleeve <b>10</b>. The resilient member <b>24</b> is affixed to the outer peripheral surface of the inner sleeve <b>20</b>, and may consist of, for example, an annular rubber member (e.g., an o-ring). The resilient member <b>20</b> serves to seal the space between the inner peripheral surface of the outer sleeve <b>10</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the inner sleeve <b>20</b>, whereby washing fluid and biological material is prevented from exiting the chamber <b>50</b> other than through the filter <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The filter structure <b>32</b> disposed in the second port <b>23</b> defines a liquid flow path between the interiors of the inner and outer sleeves <b>20</b>, <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the filter structure <b>32</b> includes a filter <b>30</b> affixed to and sandwiched between a wire mesh member <b>34</b> and support members <b>29</b> formed in the second port <b>23</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B</figref>, <b>5</b>A, and <b>5</b>B). In other embodiments, the filter structure <b>32</b> includes a filter <b>30</b> affixed to and sandwiched between two wire mesh members (not shown). This arrangement provides additional support to the filter <b>30</b> to prevent filter breakage or deformation during the washing process. In still other embodiments, the filter <b>30</b> is mounted on a support structure (e.g., a wire mesh member) that is detachable from the second port <b>23</b> to allow reuse of the washing apparatus with replacement filters (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Depending on the implementation, various filters may be employed in the filter structure <b>32</b> of washing apparatus <b>100</b>. For example, when washing tissues obtained from cartilage, a mesh filter having a pore size of 100 &#x3bc;m may be suitable, while a mesh filter having a pore size in the range from 150 &#x3bc;m to 3000 &#x3bc;m may be suitable for tissues obtained from an umbilical cord. When the biological material to be washed consists of cells rather than tissues, it is preferable to choose membrane filters having a smaller pore size. For example, when washing cells, a membrane filter having a pore size of 10 &#x3bc;m may be suitable. In some embodiments, the membrane filters may include pore sizes in the range of 5 &#x3bc;m to 20 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a flow chart <b>400</b> illustrates a method of washing biological material using the apparatus <b>100</b> described above.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Initially, in step <b>410</b>, biological material <b>40</b> (e.g., biological tissue) is placed in the outer sleeve <b>10</b> through the opening <b>13</b>. In step <b>420</b>, the inner sleeve <b>20</b> is inserted in the outer sleeve <b>10</b> to form the chamber <b>50</b>, in which the biological material <b>40</b> is retained during the washing process. In step <b>430</b>, the chamber <b>50</b> is filled with washing liquid <b>60</b> suitable for this biological material <b>40</b>. The washing liquid <b>60</b> is provided through the first port <b>22</b> of the inner sleeve <b>20</b>. One example of a commonly used washing liquid <b>60</b> includes phosphate buffer saline (PBS), but the invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, the washing process <b>440</b> is performed by driving washing liquid <b>60</b> in and out of the chamber <b>50</b> through the filter <b>30</b>. This process <b>440</b> includes e.g., moving the inner sleeve <b>20</b> in a first axial direction D<b>1</b> to compress the chamber <b>50</b> (step <b>442</b>), and moving the inner sleeve <b>20</b> in a second axial direction D<b>2</b> to expand the chamber (step <b>444</b>), as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, respectively. These two steps can be performed multiple times in an alternating manner to remove, for example, undesired chemical reagents contained in the biological material. In some applications, gentle agitation of the mixture (step <b>446</b>) also helps improve washing efficiency. Gentle agitation may be provided after one or both of the compression step (step <b>442</b>) or the expansion step (step <b>444</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">During washing, the biological material <b>40</b> is substantially retained in the chamber <b>50</b>, while washing liquid <b>60</b> enters and exits the chamber <b>50</b> through the filter <b>30</b>. The rubber resilient member <b>24</b>, affixed at the exterior of the inner sleeve <b>20</b>, prevents fluid exchange between inner and outer sleeves <b>20</b>, <b>10</b> other than through the liquid flow path provided by the filter <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">After the washing process <b>440</b>, washing liquid <b>60</b> in the chamber <b>50</b> is discharged through the filter <b>30</b> and subsequently the first port <b>22</b> to a waste container, as shown in step <b>450</b>. Discharge of the washing liquid <b>60</b> may be achieved, for example, by inverting the apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some applications, it is desirable to wash the biological material <b>40</b> multiple times to ensure successful removal of chemical reagents and other undesired substances. In these cases, after discharging the washing liquid <b>60</b> (step <b>450</b>), fresh washing liquid <b>60</b>&#x2032; is supplied to the chamber <b>50</b> through the first port <b>22</b> (step <b>430</b>) to repeat the washing process <b>440</b> and the discharging step <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When biological material <b>40</b> has been sufficiently washed (step <b>460</b>), the inner sleeve <b>20</b> is detached from the outer sleeve <b>10</b> where the biological material <b>40</b> is collected (step <b>470</b>). In some applications, the first and second sleeve pieces <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are further disassembled to provide easy access to the biological material <b>40</b>.</p>
