<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to electrical devices, and relates more particularly to systems and methods to emulate high frequency electrical signatures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many current approaches for detecting and classifying electrical appliance activation use a distributed model wherein each electrical device has a dedicated sensor, which looks for changes in the device's state (e.g., the turning-on and turning-off of the device). Device level sensing is conceptually straightforward, but requires time-consuming and expensive installation and maintenance. Indirect sensing techniques have also been used where microphones, accelerometers, and video cameras are placed throughout a structure to detect electrical appliance activity. Such techniques are effective, but require costly installation and maintenance and may also raise privacy concerns in a home setting. For example, one technique for electrical event detection involves indirectly listening to the activation of switches and motors through microphones distributed throughout a living space.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, a need or potential for benefit exists for an apparatus or method that can provide detailed information about the electrical state of electrical devices in a home or other structure but also is relatively inexpensive to deploy and does not require professional installation.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Electrical power on electrical power lines can include electrical noise. The electrical noise present on an electrical power line can be caused by the operation of an electrical device, which is electrically coupled to the electrical power line. This type of electrical noise is called conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI). EMI can be classified into two types: transient noise and continuous noise. In some embodiments, continuous or transient electrical noise that occurs when an electrical device is turned-on is not the same shape of the electrical noise after a few alternating current electrical cycles (e.g., one alternating current electrical cycle is 1/60th of a second in the United States). For example, the electrical noise of a compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) has one shape for a few alternating current electrical cycles while the CFL is warming up and then the shape of the electrical noises changes to second shape after the CFL is warmed-up. In another example, DC (direct current) motors have a continuous noise but the continuous noise of the DC motor can only lasts microseconds but can repeat every alternating current electrical cycle while the DC motor is running The electrical event detection device described below can detect all of these types of electrical noise.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Transient noise is characterized by the short duration for which it can be observed, generally tens of nanoseconds to a few milliseconds. Substantially continuous noise, on the other hand, can be observed for as long as the electrical device is operational in some examples. In many embodiments, &#x201c;continuous noise,&#x201d; as used herein, can mean repetitive, continual, uninterrupted, or repeated noise. In the same or different embodiments, noise can be continuous if a pattern in the noise is repeated every alternating current cycle (or if an electrical noise signal is observed without cessation while the electrical device is operation. Noise can be still considered continuous noise if a one alternating current cycle break occurs in the noise.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In many examples, continuous electrical noise can be identifiable on the electrical power line for a length of time greater than one alternating current electrical cycle. In another example, continuous electrical noise can be identifiable for a length of time that is less than one alternating current cycle but the electrical signals are repeated in three or more alternating current electrical cycles. In another example, continuous electrical noise can be electrical signals that are identifiable on the electrical power line for a length of time greater than approximately ten milliseconds. In another example, continuous electrical noise can be electrical signals that are identifiable on the electrical power line for a length of time greater than approximately fifty milliseconds. In still other examples, continuous electrical noise can be electrical signals that are identifiable on the electrical power line for a length of time greater than approximately one second. In yet further examples, continuous electrical noise can be electrical signals that are identifiable on the electrical power line for a length of time greater than approximately ten seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Both transient and continuous noise can either be concentrated within a narrow frequency band or spread over a wider bandwidth (i.e., broadband noise). A CFL is an example of an electrical device that generates continuous noise, which is conducted over the electrical power line due to its electrical coupling with the electrical power line infrastructure. Because a structure's electrical distribution system is interconnected in parallel at the structure's circuit breaker panel, conducted EMI propagates widely from a given electrical device throughout the electrical line infrastructure of the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Continuous noise is usually intrinsic to an electrical device's operation and internal electronics. Appliances like a grinder emit electrical noise synchronous to the frequency of AC (alternating current) power (60 Hz in the USA) and its harmonics (120 Hz, 180 Hz, etc.) due to the continuous making and breaking of electrical contact by motor bushes of this type of electrical device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A switched-mode power supply (SMPS) is an electrical power supply unit that incorporates a switching regulator to provide the output voltage required by electrical devices using the SMPS. The function of the SMPS is to provide a regulated output voltage usually at a different level from the input voltage received from the electrical power infrastructure. Electrical devices using SMPS have become increasingly prevalent because of their higher efficiency, smaller size, and lower cost compared to traditional power supplies. Additionally, manufacturers increasingly employ SMPS in their products to meet minimum energy efficiency requirements (e.g., the United States Department of Energy's Energy Star program). For example, most personal computers as well as fluorescent lighting now use SMPS. More than ten years ago, most consumer electronic devices did not employ SMPS because of the immature state of SMPS technology and the absence of low cost, single chip SMPS implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Modern SMPS-based electrical devices generate noise that is synchronous to their power supply's internal oscillator. Additionally, in contrast to traditional linear power regulators, an SMPS does not dissipate excess power as heat, but instead stores energy in an inductor and switches this stored energy in from the electrical power line and out to the load as required, and thus wasting much less energy than traditional electrical power supplies. The key to an SMPS smaller size and efficiency is its use of a power transistor to switch the stored electrical energy at a high frequency, also known as the switching frequency. The switching frequency is usually much higher than the 60 Hz AC line frequency (in the U.S.) because, at higher frequencies, the inductors or transformers required are much smaller. A typical SMPS operates at tens to hundreds of kilohertz (kHz). The switching waveform can be adjusted to match the power requirements of the electrical device that the SMPS is powering. For example, a CFL's power supply employs an SMPS to generate the high voltages necessary to power the CFL. The switching action, which is the cornerstone of an SMPS's operating principle, generates a large amount of EMI centered around the switching frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some examples, method and system can detect the noise generated by electrical appliances that contain switch mode power supplies. A certain percentage of electrical appliances in a home or other structure, however, do not contain switch mode power supplies and therefore, do not emit any continuous high frequency signatures, which can be detected by the SMPS method(s).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Embodiments described herein can alleviate this problem using a very low cost hardware platform, which can be attached at the AC inlet (plug) of any given appliance. The device can leak a high frequency signal onto the AC line emulating those signals emitted by switch mode power supplies. One embodiment can vary the leaked frequency with a predetermined ratio with the power or load current of the appliance to which the device is coupled. This procedure can allow the device measuring the EMI (electromagnetic interference) on the power line to ascertain the amount of power or current used by the specific appliance coupled to the device. Furthermore, this device can be used as a mechanism to calibrate a contactless current sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">This method of signature enhancement is not to be confused with commonly available devices which measure power or current and use two way communication (such as communications using, for example, the Zigbee or X2 standard) to send that information to a display or computing device. Unlike these communication devices, the device described herein is not a communication device and does not send any bits of information. Instead, the device merely enhances the noise signature of an appliance to which it is coupled. This enhancement aids in disaggregation using techniques involving disaggregation via continuous noise (EMI).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, a signal emulation device which when attached to the AC inlet of an appliance leaks a high frequency signature (e.g., 10 kHz to 2 MHz frequency tone) on to the AC line. The high frequency signature does not comprise a communication scheme and is strictly present to emulate the signatures generated within switch mode power supplies for the purpose of aiding any disaggregation methods, which utilize high frequency continuous noise.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some examples, the tone generated is fixed in frequency and is present when the appliance it is coupled to is drawing above a certain amount of electrical power and absent when the electrical power draw is below this threshold. The tone generated can vary in frequency with direct proportion to the amount of current draw or power draw of the electrical appliance. The signal emulation device can be used with a contactless current sensor for the purpose of calibrating the sensor. The signal emulation device can also be used with any techniques to disaggregate a homeowner's energy bill utilizing EMI and high frequency continuous noise from switch mode power supplies.</p>

Electrical coupling mechanism <b>111</b> is further configured to place the emulated high frequency electrical noise signal on electrical power line <b>150</b> via electrical plug <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The frequencies generated by emitter module <b>130</b> can primarily be between 300 kHz (kilohertz) and 2 MHz (megahertz) in some examples. This range can be used because most existing devices in a home produce switching frequencies between 10 kHz and 300 kHz and it would be helpful if this device does not to interfere with the sensing of existing switching supplies in a home. Furthermore, standard powerline communication devices usually operate at frequencies above 2 MHz so it would be useful for signal emulation system <b>100</b> to operate below 2 MHz. The frequency band between 300 kHz and 2 MHz can be subdivided into two or more channels. In many examples, each signal emulation device can choose one channel of a preset table of channels.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Emitter module <b>130</b> can be further configured to generate the emulated high frequency electrical noise signal when monitoring module <b>120</b> detects the usage of the electrical power above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 1 watt, 10 watts, and 100 watts) by electrical appliance <b>155</b>.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In various embodiments, emitter module <b>130</b> is configured to not emit any emulated high frequency electrical noise signal when electrical appliance <b>155</b> is not drawings the electrical power.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">User input device <b>113</b> can be coupled to emitter module <b>130</b> and configured to allow a user of signal emulation device <b>110</b> to specify a frequency range of the frequency of the emulated high frequency electrical noise signal.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">User input device <b>114</b> can be coupled to emitter module <b>130</b> and configured to allow a user to select whether the frequency of the emulated high frequency electrical noise signal is a fixed frequency or if the frequency of the emulated high frequency electrical noise signal is dependent upon the amount of the electrical power used by electrical appliance <b>155</b>. That is, emitter module <b>130</b> can be configured to work in either CW (continuous wave) mode or variable frequency mode. CW mode emulates the behavior of a fixed frequency switching supply, which emits a fixed frequency tone onto the AC line and turns this tone on/off when the load current draw is greater than some preset threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The variable frequency mode emits a frequency, which is designed to vary within the predetermined channel bandwidth with the frequency proportional to the amount of current or power being consumed by the appliance. The user of signal emulation device <b>110</b> can determine if emitter module <b>130</b> is going to emit signals in the continuous wave or variable frequency module using user input device <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The width of the channel can be determined by the power measurement resolution desired at the EMI sensor, the resolution bandwidth that electrical usage detection device <b>140</b> and the number of channels desired. For example, if electrical usage detection device <b>140</b> has a sampling rate of 2 MSPS (mega samples per second) and uses an 8192 point FFT (fast Fourier transform), the resolution bandwidth is 244 Hz (hertz). If the desired power measurement resolution is 10 Watts (W) and the typical outlet is rated for a maximum of 120V (volts) and 15 A (amperes) (1800 W), this resolution requires 180 steps for a channel width of 43.92 kHz. Thus, this choice will lead to 15 channels between 300 kHz and 1 MHz and 38 channels between 300 kHz and 2 MHz.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Furthermore, electrical usage detection device <b>140</b> can be calibrated by switching on a known load on each phase of the structure and then using that known amount of power in an equation to generate a calibration factor.
