<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An intracardiac defibrillation catheter system equipped with a defibrillation catheter, a power source device and an electrocardiograph. The defibrillation catheter is equipped with a first DC electrode group and a second DC electrode group. The power source device is equipped with a DC power source unit, a catheter-connected connector, an electrocardiograph-connected connector, an arithmetic processing unit, which controls the DC power source unit and has an output circuit for outputting a direct current voltage from the DC power source unit, and a changeover unit, in which the catheter-connected connector is connected to a common contact. The electrocardiograph-connected connector is connected to a first contact, and the arithmetic processing unit is connected to a second contact. In the intracardiac defibrillation catheter system, electric energy necessary and sufficient for defibrillation can be surely supplied. The defibrillation catheter can be used as an electrode catheter for cardiac potential measurement when a defibrillation treatment is not performed.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An automated external defibrillator (AED) is known as a defibrillator for removing atrial fibrillation (see, for example, Patent Literature 1).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a defibrillation treatment by the AED, an electrode pad is attached to the body surface of a patient to apply a DC voltage thereto, thereby giving electric energy within the body of the patient. Here, the electric energy flowing within the body of the patient from the electrode pad is generally controlled to 150 to 200 J, and a part (generally, about several % to 20%) thereof flows into a heart to be used for defibrillation treatment.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">And now, the atrial fibrillation is liable to occur during cardiac catheterization, and it is necessary to conduct electrical defibrillation even in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the AED that electric energy is supplied from the outside of the body, however, it is difficult to supply effective electric energy (for example, 10 to 30 J) to a heart that has suffered the atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other words, when a proportion of electric energy flowing into the heart of the electric energy supplied from the outside of the body is small (for example, about several %), it is impossible to conduct a sufficient defibrillation treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, when the electric energy supplied from the outside of the body flows into the heart in a high proportion, it is considered that the tissue of the heart may possibly be damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, in the defibrillation treatment by the AED, burn is easy to occur on the body surface to which the electrode pad has been attached. When the proportion of the electric energy flowing into the heart is small as described above, the degree of burn becomes heavy by supplying the electric energy repeatedly to be a considerable burden on the patient subjected to the catheterization.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been made on the basis of the foregoing circumstances and has as an object the provision of an intracardiac defibrillation catheter system capable of surely supplying electric energy necessary and sufficient for defibrillation to a heart that has suffered atrial fibrillation during cardiac catheterization.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the present invention is to provide an intracardiac defibrillation catheter system by which a defibrillation treatment can be conducted without causing burn on the body surface of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A further object of the present invention is to provide an intracardiac defibrillation catheter system, the defibrillation catheter of which can be used as an electrode catheter for cardiac potential measurement when no defibrillation treatment is performed.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The defibrillation catheter making up the intracardiac defibrillation catheter system according to the present invention is inserted into a cardiac cavity in such a manner that the first DC electrode group is located in a coronary vein, and the second DC electrode group is located in a right atrium to respectively apply voltages different in polarity from each other to the first DC electrode group and the second DC electrode group (apply a direct current voltage between the first DC electrode group and the second DC electrode group) through the first lead wire group and the second lead wire group by the power source device, thereby directly applying electric energy to a heart that has suffered fibrillation to conduct a defibrillation treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described above, the electric energy is directly given to the heart that has suffered the fibrillation by the first DC electrode group and the second DC electrode group of the defibrillation catheter arranged within the cardiac cavity, whereby electric stimulus (electric shock) necessary and sufficient for defibrillation treatment can be surely given only to the heart.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, no burn is caused on the body surface of the patient because the electric energy can be directly applied to the heart.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first contact is selected in the changeover unit making up the power source device, whereby a route from the catheter-connected connector to the electrocardiograph-connected connector is ensured, so that a cardiac potential can be measured by the electrodes making up the first DC electrode group and/or the second DC electrode group of the defibrillation catheter, and the resultant cardiac potential information can be inputted into the electrocardiograph via the catheter-connected connector, the changeover unit and the electrocardiograph-connected connector.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In other words, when a defibrillation treatment is not necessary during cardiac catheterization, the defibrillation catheter making up the present invention can be used as an electrode catheter for cardiac potential measurement. As a result, such troubles as to remove an electrode catheter to newly insert a catheter for defibrillation when atrial fibrillation has occurred during cardiac catheterization can be saved.
