<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national phase of PCT Application No. PCT/US2010/040541 filed Jun. 30, 2010 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/496,938 filed Jul. 2, 2009, the disclosures of which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for detecting proximity of one or more objects relative to a user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A vehicle, such as an automobile, truck, boat, and the like typically includes one or more user interfaces accessible by occupants including an operator and/or passengers for displaying information and providing input for various accessories located in and/or around the vehicle. A user interface may include one or more controls that an occupant uses to control an accessory, in addition to a display for displaying status information for the vehicle and/or an accessory. In addition to accessories mounted in the vehicle, a user interface may be used to control portable accessories for the vehicle or occupants, such as personal electronic devices. As one example, a vehicle user interface may be used to control a wirelessly linked mobile phone when detected within proximity of the vehicle. As with the accessories, the user interface may be mounted in the vehicle, or may be portable. For example, a portable remote starter key fob with status display may be used to start the vehicle. Similarly, a hand-held user interface may be used to control an audio/video system or stereo system that may be permanently or removably mounted in the vehicle, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">User interfaces may be used in general-purpose passenger vehicles, as well as special-purpose commercial or industrial vehicles, to provide input to various types of devices or accessories associated with the vehicle operation or purpose. For example, delivery vehicles may include hand-held bar code readers to identify and track packages. Such tools may be independent of the vehicle, or may interface with one or more vehicle systems, such as a vehicle cellular or satellite communications system to send or receive delivery information, for example. The bar code reader functions as a user interface or input device to provide information to the operator or to a remote location, such as a central dispatch computer, for example. Information may include the status of a particular package, the source, destination, etc. and is typically manually updated by the driver when scanning a bar code or similar packaging identifying information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In various types of vehicles, one user interface, referred to as the instrument cluster, is located behind the steering wheel for access by the operator of the vehicle. Another user interface, referred to as the center stack console, is accessible to the operator and any front seat passengers. Other areas of a vehicle that may have user interfaces for control and/or information display include door armrests, where window, mirror, and security controls may be placed, and overhead consoles where sunroof and interior lighting controls may be placed, for example. Of course, the particular type of user interface and its location may vary depending on the type of information displayed or accessory being controlled across a wide variety of applications.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various user interfaces, such as the center stack console, for example, may include controls and a display associated with multiple accessories, such as audio, navigation, and climate control (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) accessories, for example. The surface of the user interface is divided into adjacent areas each being associated with an accessory. Each area of the user interface has controls positioned adjacent to a portion of the display. Many of the controls are typically implemented as mechanical switches such as pushbutton switches, rockers, slide switches, and rotary switches that an operator uses to control various functions of the corresponding accessories. These switches operate using mechanical mechanisms to complete electrical contact. As a result, mechanical switches may exhibit reduced performance over time as activation causes wear on moving components and electrical contacts. Switch reliability declines and contacts may become intermittent with continued use. In addition, repeated physical contact may lead to deterioration of switch face legends and graphics. Mechanical switches are also susceptible to contamination from external matter like dirt, food, and liquids. Ultimately, mechanical switches are expensive for automotive use. In today's automobile, mechanical switches as the controls for vehicle accessories are responsible for some $400 or so of the automobile cost.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to inherent physical limitations and cost, mechanical switches present constraints to automotive ergonomics and aesthetics by limiting vehicle styling and layout options. In particular, mechanical switches are permanently fixed, numerous, and occupy relatively large portions of the surface of the user interface. For example, a standard HVAC system requires controls for adjusting vent selection, blower motor speed, temperature, etc. The controls may be doubled to accommodate individual comfort control between the driver and a passenger. In a luxury class vehicle, the HVAC system may further require controls for heated mirrors, heated seats, rear passenger air flow, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As vehicle accessories are augmented with additional features, the user interface used to control these accessories becomes increasingly complex. Additional accessory features are accompanied by more controls and adding mechanical switches may increase the size of the interface. If the interface has a display associated with the accessory, expansion of the control interface may be necessary to accommodate operator control of the additional features. Together, the mechanical switches and the displays of a control interface consume valuable space of the surface of the control interface and increase overall cost.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Mechanical switches should be arranged to provide comprehensive and intuitive accessory control for the user. Excessive buttons or knobs clutter the interface and may result in the operator hunting for a desired switch. Sophisticated multi-function control knobs, those with switches that activate by tilting, pivoting, or swiveling, may have obscure functions and may be difficult to maneuver for some operators. Furthermore, sophisticated control knobs have many intricate parts making them expensive and prone to failure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A system or method for tracking items proximate a user interface device include a user interface having at least one touch-sensitive region and a receiver for wirelessly receiving a signal from at least one item to determine proximity of the item relative to the user interface device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, a system or method includes a user interface device having a sealed housing containing a display screen having an input region with user touch detected based on capacitive coupling. Other embodiments include detection of user touch using acoustic, optical, and/or combination strategies such as surface acoustic wave (SAW), photo detection, and the like. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, items or objects include a passive or active data tag and directly or indirectly communicate at least identification information to the user interface device. The interface device may determine location, presence, and/or proximity of the item based on the communication and display status information for the identified objects, which may include the presence or absence of a particular object or group of objects within a corresponding designated proximity of the user interface device. The user interface device may be permanently or removably mounted in a vehicle and powered by a vehicle battery, internal battery, and/or AC power, for example. In one embodiment, a user interface device communicates with a remote input device, such as a position controller or pointer device that may be implemented by a touch pad, track ball, stylus, or similar device mounted in a vehicle. One embodiment includes a remote input device implemented by a steering wheel mounted track ball in wired or wireless communication with the user interface device. Another embodiment includes a remote input device implemented by a touch pad mounted on a steering wheel of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various embodiments of the present disclosure include a user interface device having a touch pad secured to a generally transparent or translucent faceplate by a refractive index matched adhesive to reduce visibility of touch pad components through the faceplate. The user interface device may be used in a variety of applications including logistics management, object tracking, and/or vehicle/personal accessories control, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of a system or method according to the present disclosure include various advantages. For example, use of an input device incorporating a solid-state touch sensitive surface improves robustness and longevity. Touch sensitive input devices according to the present disclosure may be mounted behind the surface of relatively thick non-conductive materials, such as glass, and are thus unaffected by external contamination, which facilitates portable use for various commercial and industrial applications, for example. In some applications, flexible construction of capacitive touch pads can be used to better accommodate ergonomic and aesthetic design considerations. Various embodiments include optically transparent touch pads to facilitate overlaying of the touch pad on a corresponding display of the user interface device, which may reduce the surface area required for controls and/or input devices. Furthermore, overlay construction is amenable to direct visual feedback of touch switch activation. Touch sensitive surfaces or regions can be arranged to create custom control interfaces to supplant virtually any kind of input or control device, including single button switches, dials, multi-point inputs, keyboards, position controllers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition to accessories mounted in a vehicle, various types of portable accessories may be manipulated using a touch sensitive user interface according to the present disclosure. The user interface may be permanently or removably mounted in the vehicle and used to control and display information associated with vehicle accessories and/or personal electronic devices used in or around a vehicle. For example, the expanding market of personal electronic devices and associated remote wireless access and communications capabilities enables remote access to vehicle accessory systems. Conversely, many vehicles are capable of communicating with and controlling personal portable electronics via a user interface of the vehicle, such as a vehicle voice recognition system used to control a mobile phone wirelessly linked to the vehicle user interface. Embodiments may include a vehicle mounted input device such as a touch pad or track ball in communication with a user interface device to facilitate use of the user interface device by vehicle occupants.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of a touch sensitive user interface that employ mutual capacitance according to the present disclosure are capable of single point and multipoint sensing of human touch through relatively thick non-conductive surfaces. Mutual capacitance sensing also facilitates touch detection through thick surfaces including any combination of natural or synthetic material such as glass, plastic, wood, rubber, and leather up to one quarter inch thick.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A user interface according to the present disclosure may provide single and/or multiple sensing regions (e.g., capacitive touch switches, touch pads) located at desired touch points on the surface of the user interface to create unique surface locations that when touched generate single point, multipoint, or two-dimensional coordinate information, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments according to the present disclosure may use optically transparent materials including Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), clear conductive polymers, or other such materials to provide a touch sensitive region of the user interface over a display of the interface. The ITO may be applied directly to the surface to create the desired touch sensitive regions, or applied to a substrate film layer, such as a polyester layer, which is then affixed to the surface of the interface. Touch pads can be constructed on single or multiple substrate layers to achieve desired layout and performance characteristics. For applications not requiring transparent control surfaces, more conventional translucent or opaque materials such as metal foil, conductive ink, metal film, or conductive epoxy may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In other embodiments, a user interface for controlling vehicle accessories includes capacitive touch regions integrated with a display device to create visual feedback in response to detecting a touch (contact or proximity) of a user using mutual capacitance detection strategies to facilitate placement of the sensing layer on the internal side of a display surface. Mutual capacitance technology according to the present disclosure facilitates placement of touch pads behind, in front of, or within thicker display surfaces, such as glass, while providing multi-touch point recognition. In addition, touch sensitive regions can be tailored to follow intricate contours of the surface of the user interface and can be made transparent for overlaying a display. Sensitivity thresholds for touch pads can be increased to detect user presence prior to actual contact with the surface of the user interface. This proximity detection capability permits displays to remain inactive, dimmed, or hidden until an approaching object, such as a human finger, is detected. When the object is sensed, the display brightens or becomes active prior to actual contact with the touch sensitive region. Mutual capacitance techniques also facilitate recognition of various types of inputs, such as a single point, multipoint simultaneous, multipoint sequential, and/or multipoint gestural inputs corresponding to sensor proximity and/or contact. Using multiple touch switch inputs, gesturing can be detected and processed into corresponding operator input commands. Multiple gesture interpretation can be recognized and processed to create consecutive or simultaneous macro command sequences for controlling vehicle accessories.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments of a user interface according to the present disclosure facilitate sharing of electrical interface hardware and input controls of the user interface for multiple vehicle accessories and/or multiple personal electronic accessories. This facilitates input/control and output/display for multiple vehicle accessories from a common, programmable interface that can be removably or permanently mounted in a vehicle, such as within an instrument cluster or center stack console, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Various embodiments of a user interface according to the present disclosure may provide customized and/or restricted access to various functions in response to one or more occupant and/or vehicle status indicators. For example, one embodiment includes a conductor disposed within a vehicle seat with an electrical signal applied to the conductor to act as a carrier or signature signal that is detected by the user interface during proximity or surface contact to determine which occupant is manipulating the user interface. The user interface may control accessibility to various functions and/or may customize the user interface display and controls based on which occupant is manipulating the user interface. In addition, various other vehicle and/or ambient status information may be used to determine the user interface configuration, display features, and/or available functions, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments of a system or method according to the present disclosure may also include a user interface having wireless communications capabilities. In one embodiment, a user interface provides remote access and control over vehicle accessories and/or personal electronic devices. The user interface provides a touch sensitive control and display for personal electronics in addition to remote access to vehicle accessories. In another embodiment, a user interface communicates with one or more items or objects having a passive or active data tag to determine proximity of the object(s) to the user interface device. In one embodiment, the user interface device identifies an object or group of objects within a selected proximity and generates an alert signal in response. The alert signal may be used to identify an object that is not within the selected proximity, or to indicate that a defined group of objects are within the selected proximity, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The above embodiments, features, and advantages as well as other embodiments, features, and advantages of a system or method according to the present disclosure will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As those of ordinary skill in the art will understand, various features illustrated and described with reference to any one of the Figures may be combined with features illustrated in one or more other Figures to produce embodiments that are not necessarily explicitly illustrated or described. Likewise, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that embodiments illustrated in particular Figures may be used in applications described with respect to embodiments illustrated in other Figures. The combinations of features illustrated provide representative embodiments for representative applications. However, various combinations and modifications of the features consistent with the teachings of this disclosure may be desired for particular applications or implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Touch sensitive user interface devices according to the present disclosure may be used to advantage in a wide variety of applications. In vehicle applications, for example, touch sensitive user interface devices facilitate interaction with more sophisticated vehicles, in addition to various types of personal portable electronics that may be used in and around vehicles. With the increase in available vehicle accessories, options, and general or special purpose vehicle applications, user interfaces according to the present disclosure may be used to provide efficient management of control and display functions while affording designers flexibility in arranging the interface for both ergonomics and aesthetics.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, a touch sensitive user interface refers to virtually any type of user interface that includes one or more regions used to capture user input associated with proximity to, or contact with, the touch sensitive region. A user interface having touch sensitive regions according to the present disclosure may use solid-state electronic devices to implement one or more detection strategies as generally known to those of ordinary skill in the art. As such, various embodiments may be implemented independent of the particular detection strategy used to capture user input, while other embodiments may be limited to a particular detection strategy. Detection strategies may incorporate various electrical, acoustical, optical, and/or combination strategies to detect user input, which may include gestures detected by contact with, and/or proximity to, a particular touch sensitive region, for example. Representative user input detection strategies may incorporate capacitance (or mutual capacitance), optical beam, infrared, vision/camera, and surface acoustic wave detection strategies, for example. Such strategies often provide superior reliability and reduced overall cost relative to mechanical switches, although mechanical switches may also be incorporated into and/or used in cooperation with a user interface in various embodiments of the present disclosure. In general, solid-state touch sensitive switches according to the present disclosure provide advantages relating to reduced control interface complexity and improved ergonomics, while providing a sealed user interface for use in challenging environments that can be permanently or removably mounted in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of a system <b>10</b> having a user interface <b>12</b> that may be used to control one or more vehicle accessories, personal electronic devices, and/or as an input device for an object tracking system according to the present disclosure is shown. User interface <b>12</b> includes a surface <b>14</b> constructed from, for example, a rigid, transparent, non-conductive material, such as glass or plastic. User interface <b>12</b> includes one or more touch sensitive regions, which are implemented by capacitive touch switches (i.e., touch pads) <b>16</b> in this embodiment. However, other strategies may be used to detect user input depending on the particular application and implementation as previously described. Touch switches <b>16</b> may be mounted in front of, within, and/or behind control interface surface <b>14</b> at respective touch sensitive areas or regions of interface surface <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the user does not actually touch the active region or touch switch <b>16</b> in most applications because the touch switch is positioned behind or within a protective non-conductive material as previously described. As such, as generally used herein, activating, triggering, contacting, or touching a touch sensitive region, switch, or pad includes contacting the surface of any protective covering or faceplate, or the outermost surface of the interface. In some applications, touch sensitive regions or switches may also be activated or triggered by an object within close proximity of the surface of the protective covering or faceplate without actually contacting the surface. Triggering or activation of a particular switch or region may be determined by an associated signal exceeding a corresponding trigger threshold, or by a rate of change in the signal exceeding a corresponding threshold, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Interface <b>12</b> is associated with one or more devices, which may include one or more accessories of a vehicle, personal electronic devices, etc. Interface <b>12</b> may be permanently or removably mounted in a vehicle and may be powered by an internal battery, a vehicle battery, and/or an AC power cord depending on the particular application and implementation. As such, interface <b>12</b> may communicate with one or more associated devices via a wired and/or wireless connection. In one embodiment, interface <b>12</b> includes at least a receiver for receiving information from active tags associated with objects within a predetermined or programmable proximity of user interface device <b>12</b>. Alternatively, interface <b>12</b> may include a transceiver for wirelessly polling and/or communicating information, such as identification information, status information, position/location information, etc. with one or more objects within a designated proximity of user interface device <b>12</b> as described in greater detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A mounting location for interface <b>12</b> may be selected for accessibility by one or more vehicle occupants, such as a vehicle operator <b>24</b>. Operator <b>24</b> can trigger (i.e., contact or be in proximity with) touch sensitive region or switches <b>16</b> (e.g., &#x201c;controls&#x201d;, &#x201c;inputs&#x201d;, &#x201c;input controls&#x201d;, &#x201c;touch pads&#x201d;, &#x201c;touch sensitive areas&#x201d;) to provide input to devices associated with interface <b>12</b>. Device input may then be processed to control various functions of the corresponding devices, which may include displaying information associated with one or more devices, for example. In the embodiment illustrated, interface surface <b>14</b> may also function as a display to communicate status or identification information, for example, associated with one or more of the devices associated with control interface <b>12</b>. As such, interface surface <b>14</b> may also be referred to as a display surface.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">System <b>10</b> further includes touch switch drive and detection electronics <b>18</b>. Drive and detection electronics <b>18</b> drive touch switches <b>16</b> with an electrical charge and detect touch activation of touch switches <b>16</b> while touch switches <b>16</b> are driven with the electrical charge. Drive and detection electronics <b>18</b> can either be collocated with touch switches <b>16</b> on control interface surface <b>14</b> or separated from user interface <b>12</b> by an electrically conductive wire <b>20</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Drive and detection electronics <b>18</b> can be integrated into a sealed housing with various other components for increased functionality, particularly for a portable interface <b>12</b> in more challenging applications or environments. Drive and detection electronics <b>18</b> generate signals indicative of activation of touch switches <b>16</b> in response to manipulation or triggering of (for example, contacting or nearly contacting) touch switches <b>16</b> by operator <b>24</b>. While being driven with an electrical charge, touch switch <b>16</b> will trigger or activate upon contact with a conductive object, such as a human finger, as a result of touch switch <b>16</b> capacitively coupling with the conductive object. Similarly, if sensitive enough, a touch switch <b>16</b> may be activated by a conductive object in proximity with touch switch <b>16</b> as a result of touch switch <b>16</b> capacitively coupling with the object while being driven with an electrical charge, as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment according to the present disclosure, system <b>10</b> provides customized and/or restricted access to various functions in response to one or more occupant and/or vehicle status indicators <b>34</b>. Representative vehicle status indicators may include whether the vehicle is moving or stationary, vehicle speed, doors open/closed, engine running or stopped, parking brake set/released, airbag activated/deactivated, etc. Representative occupant status indicators may include where an occupant is seated, whether a seatbelt is latched, a stored preference selector, etc. In one embodiment, vehicle/occupant status <b>34</b> includes occupant position or presence detection using a conductor disposed within a vehicle seat with an electrical signal applied to the conductor to act as a carrier or signature signal that is detected by the user interface during proximity or surface contact to determine which occupant is manipulating the user interface. The user interface may control accessibility to various functions and/or may customize the user interface display and controls based on which occupant is manipulating the user interface. In addition, various other vehicle and/or ambient status information may be used to determine the user interface configuration, display features, and/or available functions, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>10</b> includes a device interface to communicate input and/or receive output from one or more associated devices.

The device interface functions to provide suitable signal types and levels to control associated devices and may provide various signal conditioning and circuitry protection functions as well. Similarly, the device interface may condition or format incoming signals for use by user interface <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, a device interface is implemented by accessory control electronics <b>22</b>. Accessory control electronics <b>22</b> are operable to control the functions of the accessories associated with user interface <b>12</b> in response to activation of one or more touch switches <b>16</b>. In this embodiment, accessory control electronics <b>22</b> receive the touch activation signals from drive and detection electronics <b>18</b> over an electrically conductive wire <b>26</b>. In turn, accessory control electronics <b>22</b> control the functions of the accessories associated with user interface <b>12</b> in response to activation of one or more touch switches <b>16</b>. In another embodiment, the device interface communicates with associated devices wirelessly using a proprietary or standard communication strategy or protocol, such as Bluetooth, for example.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>through <b>2</b><i>f</i>, with continual reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, representative mounting configurations for capacitive touch switches <b>16</b> to user interface surface <b>14</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure are shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>through <b>2</b><i>f </i>illustrate a partial user interface <b>12</b> with corresponding touch switches <b>16</b>. Of course, the actual number and configuration of touch switches <b>16</b> will depend on the requirements of the particular application. Depending on size and strength requirements of user interface <b>12</b>, surface <b>14</b> is typically between 0.100 to 0.250 inches in thickness and is made of a material such as glass or plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the mounting configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, touch switches <b>16</b> are located between the external side of surface <b>14</b> and a non-conductive exterior layer <b>28</b>. Layer <b>28</b> is placed as a protective shield to prevent direct operator contact with touch switches <b>16</b>. Layer <b>28</b> may also be implemented by a substrate upon which touch switches <b>16</b> are initially constructed. For embodiments where layer <b>28</b> is a substrate for construction of touch switches <b>16</b>, layer <b>28</b> may be made of polycarbonate, acrylic, or polyester, for example. In any case, operator contact occurs on outer surface <b>30</b> of layer <b>28</b>. The thickness of layer <b>28</b> is typically selected based on the performance requirements of a particular application. Representative applications may include a layer thickness of between about 0.005 inches and about 0.015 inches. For most applications, signal strength increases as a conductive object approaches touch switches <b>16</b>, with the maximum signal strength corresponding to contact with layer <b>28</b>. As such, a thinner layer <b>28</b> may be used to advantage to increase maximum signal strength when covering touch switches <b>16</b> that may otherwise exhibit low sensitivity as a thinner layer <b>28</b> may increase capacitive coupling by facilitating closer proximity of the conductive object. Although it is not required that layer <b>28</b> be kept thin, this thickness presents a significant disadvantage in touch technologies different from that defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The mounting configuration represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>provides a simple approach for placing touch switches <b>16</b> onto user interface surface <b>14</b>. In this configuration, touch switches <b>16</b> are placed directly onto the backside (i.e., internal side) of user interface surface <b>14</b> without an additional protective layer between touch switches <b>16</b> and surface <b>14</b>. This is a cost effective approach where touch switches <b>16</b> do not require protection on the back side of user interface surface <b>14</b>. Placing touch switches <b>16</b> onto the back side of interface surface <b>14</b> clears external side <b>32</b> of user interface surface <b>14</b> (i.e., the side of user interface surface <b>14</b> presented to operator <b>24</b>) from touch switch components and protective films. A designer is then free to transform external side <b>32</b> of user interface surface <b>14</b> to create whatever appearance is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the mounting configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>, touch switches <b>16</b> are located between the internal side of interface surface <b>14</b> and a non-conductive exterior layer <b>28</b>. This construction is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>. In this embodiment, layer <b>28</b> forms the substrate onto which touch switches <b>16</b> are initially constructed. Once assembled, layer <b>28</b> can also function as a protective shield for touch switches <b>16</b>, though protection may not be necessary as touch switches <b>16</b> are located on the backside of interface surface <b>14</b>. As previously described, placing touch switches <b>16</b> onto the internal side of surface <b>14</b> clears external side <b>32</b> of surface <b>14</b> from touch switch components and protective films. This provides greater flexibility in selection of finishes for external side <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the mounting configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d</i>, a non-conductive layer <b>28</b> is placed on the internal side of interface surface <b>14</b> and touch switches <b>16</b> are placed on layer <b>28</b>. As a result, layer <b>28</b> is disposed between the internal side of surface <b>14</b> and touch switches <b>16</b>. In this configuration, layer <b>28</b> with touch switches <b>16</b> thereon can be bonded to the internal side of surface <b>14</b> without exerting bonding stress on touch switches <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the mounting configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>e</i>, two separate touch switch layers <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are placed on respective sides of a non-conductive layer <b>28</b> with the first touch switch layer <b>16</b><i>a </i>being placed on the internal side of interface surface <b>14</b>. This configuration is desirable when two layers of touch switches <b>16</b> are desired to meet the design requirements of user interface <b>12</b>. A cost savings can be realized either in the manufacturing of touch switches <b>16</b> or by simplifying assembly of interface <b>12</b> when this configuration is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>f </i>illustrates another representative mounting configuration with alternating touch switch layers and non-conductive layers.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with continual reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a user interface <b>12</b> having touch switches <b>16</b> arranged in a representative configuration in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is shown. In this embodiment, user interface surface <b>14</b> functions as an accessory control area permanently or removably mounted within a vehicle center stack console. Touch switches <b>16</b> are positioned across control interface surface <b>14</b> to provide operator <b>24</b> with controls for various vehicle accessories, such as audio, climate control, and navigation, for example. Touch switches <b>16</b> are arranged in separate touch switch regions or groups <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, and <b>70</b>. As described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, touch switches <b>16</b> of each touch switch group are arranged in certain patterns and arrays to provide desired functionality for this representative application. Of course, the representative configuration is used only for ease of illustration and explanation and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the touch sensitive switches <b>16</b> may be arranged in virtually any conceivable configuration to provide desired functionality for a particular application or implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the representative configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, touch switches <b>16</b> are shared among accessories to reduce the overall number of switches to control all available accessory functions. In this embodiment, surface <b>14</b> is optically transparent for viewing of a display device positioned behind surface <b>14</b>. Graphical images generated by the display device can then be seen through surface <b>14</b> to assist operator <b>24</b> in locating positions of desired touch switches <b>16</b>, and/or to display accessory functions assigned to each touch switch <b>16</b>, for example. In this regard, surface <b>14</b> may also be referred to as a display surface. As described in greater detail below, refractive index matching considerations may be used to reduce user visibility of various components of touch switches <b>16</b> through surface <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the arrangement of touch switches <b>16</b> of touch switch group <b>40</b> of user interface <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will be described in greater detail. As previously described, in this representative embodiment, touch switches <b>16</b> of touch switch group <b>40</b> are arranged in a configuration for entering single input commands. For example, touch switches <b>16</b> of touch switch group <b>40</b> may function as accessory selection switches. In the illustrated example, touch switch group <b>40</b> includes six touch switches <b>16</b>. Of course, the number and/or configuration of touch switches <b>16</b> may vary depending upon the particular application and implementation. Each touch switch <b>16</b> can be assigned a primary device or accessory, such as audio, climate control, navigation, communication, or vehicle status reporting, for example. Depending upon the particular application, each touch switch <b>16</b> may also be associated with more than one device. One advantage of using touch sensitive switches according to the present disclosure is the ability to program user interface <b>12</b> to assign one or more functions to touch switches <b>16</b> and provide a corresponding visual display to improve usability of the interface for multiple devices. Once a particular device or accessory is selected by activation of a corresponding touch switch <b>16</b>, the functionality of one or more of the touch switches within group <b>40</b> may switch to a secondary function associated with the selected device or accessory, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates touch switches <b>16</b> of touch switch group <b>50</b> of user interface <b>12</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in greater detail. Touch switches <b>16</b> of group <b>50</b> are arranged in a configuration particularly suited for entering multiple sequential input commands. As such, touch switches <b>16</b> of touch switch group <b>50</b> are arranged close together in an arcuate fashion. This configuration may be used to imitate or simulate an analog input, such as an input associated with a slider control, for example. Of course, switches <b>16</b> may be arranged in other configurations to provide simulated analog input, such as in a circle to simulate a rotary dial, or in a horizontal, vertical, and/or diagonal linear fashion as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, for example. Simulated analog input provided by these configurations or similar configurations may be used for various functions in a number of applications, such as for adjusting climate control temperature settings; adjusting volume, tone, or balance settings for a vehicle mounted or personal portable audio accessory; or as a scrubber bar for browsing information of a navigation accessory, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, touch switch group <b>50</b> includes nine (9) touch switches <b>16</b>. Because of their close proximity to one another, two or more adjacent touch switches <b>16</b> may be triggered or activated simultaneously when operator <b>24</b> is within close proximity to and/or contacts interface surface <b>14</b>. Switch detection electronics <b>18</b> can process signal data from each of these nine inputs (i.e., touch switches <b>16</b>) individually and/or as groups or subgroups to generate various control signals for associated accessories. Adjacent touch switches <b>16</b> that are simultaneously activated can then be interpreted as input points falling between adjacent touch switches <b>16</b>. For example, if inputs are processed both separately for each individual switch, and in combination of two-switch pairs for adjacent switches, seventeen different inputs may be detected. Alternatively, or in combination, activation of switches within group <b>50</b> can be interpreted as a single group or multiple groups by mapping switch inputs to a common command, or ignoring activation of any number of the touch switch signals, for example, to emulate a smaller number of touch switches <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, switch group <b>60</b> of interface <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is shown in greater detail. Touch switches <b>16</b> of group <b>60</b> are arranged in a configuration suitable both for entering single input commands and multiple sequential input commands. Touch switches <b>16</b> of group <b>60</b> are arranged in respective arrays of single point touch switches <b>16</b>. Each touch switch <b>16</b> can be activated to generate a specific input command similar to that of a mechanical switch. Additionally, touch switches <b>16</b> are intentionally arranged in respective arrays to accommodate touch input expressed in a gestural form. Activation of any one of touch switches <b>16</b> (or adjacent pairs of switches in some applications) can prompt recognition of a single point input command. Sequential activation of more than one touch switch <b>16</b> can be interpreted as an input gesture rather than a series of single point input commands.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">One example of an application for arrays of touch switches <b>16</b> configured as a touch switch group <b>60</b> is for use in operating the climate control system of a vehicle. In this representative application, tapping touch switch (touch pad) TP<b>21</b> activates a climate adjustment mode for the driver while tapping touch pad TP<b>25</b> activates a climate adjustment mode for the passenger. After an occupant is selected, sequential activation of touch pads TP<b>21</b>-TP<b>22</b>-TP<b>23</b>-TP<b>24</b>-TP<b>25</b> represents a command to increase fan speed for the selected occupant. Conversely, sequential activation of these touch pads <b>16</b> in the reverse order represents a command to reduce fan speed. At the same time, a sequential activation of touch pads TP<b>16</b>-TP<b>17</b>-TP<b>19</b>-TP<b>23</b>-TP<b>27</b>-TP<b>29</b>-TP<b>30</b> represents the command to decrease temperature for the selected occupant, while touch pad activation in the reverse order represents a command to increase temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Not all of touch switches <b>16</b> of a touch switch group need to be activated for the gestural command to be recognized. Sequential activation of two or more touch switches <b>16</b> may be recognized as a gestural input or command. Appropriate position of touch switches <b>16</b> facilitates interpolation of positions between or among proximate touch pads when desired. Interpolated positions may be used to simulate an analog input, such as a potentiometer input, for example. This feature is useful when trying to create precise set-point controls, such as those used for temperature or volume adjustment, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, touch switches <b>16</b> of switch group <b>70</b> of user interface <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are shown in greater detail. The configuration of switches <b>16</b> within group <b>70</b> facilitates both single input and multiple sequential input commands using a two-dimensional input array. As such, touch switches <b>16</b> are arranged in touch switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>and touch switch rows <b>16</b><i>b</i>. Touch switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>and rows <b>16</b><i>b </i>are separated from one another by a substrate layer <b>28</b> as illustrated and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>e </i>and <b>2</b><i>f</i>. The individual touch switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>and rows <b>16</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) are formed by sequentially connected touch switches <b>16</b>. Touch switches <b>16</b> are positioned to reduce signal cross talk between switches of column <b>16</b><i>a </i>and row <b>16</b><i>b </i>by managing the size of any overlap area <b>72</b> common to both switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>and rows <b>16</b><i>b</i>. In addition, touch switches <b>16</b> may be appropriately sized and positioned to define areas void of touch pad material on both sides of substrate <b>28</b> to reduce or eliminate overlap <b>72</b> and resulting cross talk between touch switch layers <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">During use, operator <b>24</b> moves within proximity of, or contacts surface <b>14</b> capacitively coupling with one or more switches <b>16</b> within column <b>16</b><i>a </i>and/or row <b>16</b><i>b</i>. Touch switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>and rows <b>16</b><i>b </i>may be positioned so that the operator contact area will include both a touch pad column <b>16</b><i>a </i>and row <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The activated location is determined by monitoring the signals generated by each touch switch column <b>16</b><i>a </i>and row <b>16</b><i>b</i>. When contact is not directly over a touch switch column <b>16</b><i>a </i>or row <b>16</b><i>b</i>, the activated position may be interpolated by reading the input signal from the two closest touch switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>and rows <b>16</b><i>b </i>as determined by the corresponding signal strengths corresponding to surrounding switches. As all touch switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>and rows <b>16</b><i>b </i>sense independently, it is possible to identify a multitude of contact areas within array <b>70</b>. As such, array <b>70</b> is capable of simultaneous multi-point recognition. One or more touch locations may then be identified by the intersecting points of high signal strength, for example. Multi-point or multi-touch recognition may be used to generate various types of input, including but not limited to gestural input, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Because of their close proximity to one another, adjacent touch switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>and rows <b>16</b><i>b </i>can produce an input signal when operator <b>24</b> makes contact between them on control interface surface <b>14</b>. Adjacent touch switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>and rows <b>16</b><i>b </i>experiencing simultaneous input signal can then be interpreted as input points that fall between adjacent touch switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>or rows <b>16</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Technologies such as resistive touch screens are established as position sensing touch panels. However, resistive touch screens do not completely address the problems associated with mechanical switches. Resistive touch screens are placed on the external side of a control interface surface where they are continuously subjected to activation pressures, lay flat, and have a simple footprint such as a square or a rectangle. Their application is limited both by their geometry and durability. Capacitive touch sensors (i.e., capacitive touch switches) are a better solution for applications that can benefit from interface surfaces with complex geometries. Likewise placement of capacitive touch sensors behind or within the control interface surface completely hides the electrical components to produce a clean and natural appearing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, with continual reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an electrical circuit diagram of the capacitive touch electronics of control interface <b>12</b> for reading multiple touch switch inputs <b>16</b> into a one input touch switch drive and detection circuit <b>18</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is shown. This electrical circuit diagram illustrates exemplary electronic circuitry for operating a multitude of capacitive touch sensors <b>16</b> arranged as an array. The outlined circuitry block <b>18</b> represents a single input drive and detection circuit for measuring the capacitive signal developed on a touch sensor <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this example, switches A through H of a multiplexor <b>91</b> provide solid state switching between touch sensors <b>16</b> and drive and detection electronics in a multiplexed fashion which permits one drive and detection circuit <b>18</b> to sense input on eight independent touch sensors <b>16</b>. When solid state switch A of multiplexor <b>91</b> is closed, drive and detection circuitry <b>18</b> becomes electrically connected to touch sensor <b>16</b><i>b </i>that is connected to ROW<b>1</b>. Drive and detection circuitry <b>18</b> turns each solid state switch <b>16</b> on in progression to read each of the four touch switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>and rows <b>16</b><i>b </i>independently. This successive multiplexed reading of touch inputs has the benefit of reducing the number of inputs and components required by drive and detection circuit <b>18</b>. In one embodiment drive and detection circuitry <b>18</b> uses a microprocessor <b>92</b> to control the multiplexing and sensor reading tasks. However, drive and detection circuitry <b>18</b> could employ an ASIC or other such highly integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, position interpolation is performed by measuring capacitive signal strength developed on adjacent touch switches <b>16</b>, columns <b>16</b><i>a</i>, and rows <b>16</b><i>b </i>and then interpolating actual touch position by comparing the signal strengths on two adjacent touch switch columns <b>16</b><i>a </i>or rows <b>16</b><i>b</i>. This effectively increases resolution without additional hardware. The output response from drive and detection circuitry <b>18</b> can be individual signals for each touch switch <b>16</b>, and/or a serial data stream. The output response can represent or identify an activated touch switch <b>16</b> and/or provide an indication of signal strength for each touch switch <b>16</b> to be processed further by accessory control electronics <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In one embodiment, the input signal acquired by drive and detection circuitry <b>18</b> when reading a touch switch <b>16</b> is a numerical value representing the amount of electrical charge developed on the touch switch as a result of capacitive coupling to its surroundings. For a single switch input, the measured or detected charge value can be compared directly to a predetermined or adaptable threshold value to determine whether touch switch <b>16</b> has been activated. Alternatively, or in combination, a delta or change in the measured charge value, and/or a rate of change in the measured charge value is/are compared to one or more corresponding thresholds to determine switch activation. Those of ordinary skill in the art may recognize various other strategies for detecting activation or triggering of a touch sensitive switch.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Gestural command inputs can be used to communicate special instructions by the operator to the accessory control. For example a touch gesture tracing the outline of a circle or partial arc on the touch switch array may represent a command to rotate or turn a virtual control knob that is represented on a display behind control interface surface <b>14</b>. Tracing an X on the touch switch array could signify the canceling of a function while tracing a check mark might communicate acceptance or completion of accessory adjustments. A gestural input may be detected by drive and detection circuitry <b>18</b> by detecting a sequence or series of switch activations across a group or array of touch switches <b>16</b>. For example, switch activations of designated switches detected by drive and detection circuitry <b>18</b> over a predetermined time period can be decoded as a gestural input command.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As previously described, one advantage of using capacitive touch sensors <b>16</b> in a user interface <b>12</b> is the ability to detect an object within some proximity of touch switch <b>16</b> before the object actually makes contact with surface <b>14</b>. This capability may be used in various applications to provide a &#x201c;wakeup&#x201d; response for a &#x201c;sleeping&#x201d; user interface <b>12</b>. For example, user interface <b>12</b> can enter a sleep mode after a period of inactivity where any corresponding lights or displays are darkened or inactive until operator <b>24</b> comes within some range or proximity of surface <b>14</b>. When an approaching user is detected, interface <b>12</b> &#x201c;wakes&#x201d; and acknowledges operator <b>24</b> by activating the display, lighting the control interface panel, sending an audible wake-up confirmation, vibrating and/or providing other such feedback to operator <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Proximity detection strategies may be used separately or in various combinations to provide proximity detection for touch sensitive interfaces according to the present disclosure. Four representative strategies for use with capacitive touch switches are described explicitly herein and may be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination of software and hardware depending on the particular application and implementation. However, those of ordinary skill in the art may recognize various other strategies for use with capacitive touch switches and/or other touch sensitive detection strategies previously described. In a first representative strategy, the activation or triggering threshold used by drive and detection electronics <b>18</b> to determine activation of a touch switch <b>16</b> is adjusted to increase sensitivity. When a conductive object, such as user <b>24</b>, moves toward switch <b>16</b>, the signal strength increases and detection occurs when a corresponding threshold is crossed, which may be based on signal strength or rate of change, for example, as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In a second representative strategy, proximity detection signal values are read from two or more touch switches <b>16</b> and processed by drive and detection electronics <b>18</b>. Various signal processing strategies may be used to combine the signal values to control and enhance detection sensitivity. In one embodiment, signal values are combined by summing. The collective signal value has a greater magnitude (and greater magnitude of change) in response to an approaching or proximate object such that the detection threshold is crossed prior to contact with surface <b>14</b>. Other, more sophisticated mathematical/statistical techniques may be used to filter and/or process the raw data/signals provided by a group or array of sensors to detect a corresponding proximate object.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In a third representative strategy, two or more touch switches <b>16</b> are temporarily or persistently connected together to create a touch switch <b>16</b> having a larger surface area. This may be accomplished by energizing two or more touch switches <b>16</b> in multiplexor <b>91</b> to electrically join individual touch switches <b>16</b> together. By increasing switch surface area, the signal input to drive and detection electronics <b>18</b> will exhibit a correspondingly stronger response to approaching or proximal objects. This effectively makes the touch switch surface more sensitive.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Proximity detection is provided using a fourth representative strategy where user interface <b>12</b> has dedicated touch sensor switches, areas, or regions having higher sensitivity than other touch switches to detect approaching or proximal objects. Increased sensitivity may be provided using one or more of the previously described strategies and/or may be inherent in the construction of the switches or areas designed for proximity detection. These touch sensor switches, areas, or regions can be strategically positioned around the periphery and/or within user interface <b>12</b> independent of the position of surface <b>14</b> or other touch sensitive switches. Alternatively, or in combination, these switches may be placed adjacent to, or intermixed among, touch switches <b>16</b>. Likewise, the touch sensor switches, areas, or regions used for proximity detection can be constructed on separate conductive layers or substrates relative to other touch sensitive switches.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Any combination of the four noted proximity detection methods can be implemented to achieve the desired characteristics of proximity detection to an approaching or proximal object. Proximity detection can be implemented across the touch interface surface or selectively controlled by sensing the signal(s) provided by one or more touch switches <b>16</b>. Likewise, proximity detection may utilize a different detection strategy than used for touch sensitive detection/activation of other switches. For example, infrared or photo detection strategies may be used for proximity detection with capacitive coupling used to detect activation of other touch sensitive switches.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Proximity detection may be used to detect three-dimensional gestural input. For example, variations in touch switch signal strength, touch switch location, and/or signal time tracking may be used to provide a three-dimensional gesturing palette via surface <b>14</b>. Recognition of hand gesturing above surface <b>14</b> may be performed by analyzing or processing information related to depth or distance as represented by the signal strength corresponding to various touch switches <b>16</b>. In this way, proximity detection is suited for advanced gesture recognition by processing not only multipoint and sequential point gestures in the time domain, but also adding a third component representing depth or distance that can be used to differentiate among otherwise similar gestures.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a simplified assembly drawing illustrates construction and operation of a representative embodiment of a user interface having a display and one or more touch sensitive switches according to the present disclosure. User interface device <b>100</b> incorporates a solid-state touch sensitive panel or pad <b>102</b> having an associated electrical connector <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, panel <b>102</b> is implemented by a capacitive touch sensor pad, such as the SmartTouch&#x2122; pad available from the assignee of the present application. Sensor panel <b>102</b> may be constructed as previously described. In the illustrated embodiment, sensor panel <b>102</b> is constructed with a generally transparent substrate and an array of conductors <b>118</b> (not shown to scale) such that illuminated portions of screen <b>106</b> of display <b>108</b> are visible to a user. In one embodiment, sensor panel <b>102</b> is constructed using indium tin oxide (ITO) with touch sensitive switches or regions positioned or programmed as desired for particular applications. Display <b>108</b> may be implemented by a rigid or semi-rigid flat panel or contoured display, such as an LED or LCD display. Alternatively, display <b>108</b> may be implemented by a flexible display, such as an organic light emitting diode (OLED) or similar display, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, device <b>100</b> includes one or more electronics cards or boards <b>110</b> with associated connectors as represented by connector <b>112</b>. Electronics <b>110</b> may include various drive and detection electronics for sensor panel/layer <b>102</b> as previously described. In one embodiment, electronics <b>110</b> include a microprocessor as well as computer readable storage media implemented by memory and/or persistent storage having stored data representing program code or instructions executable by the microprocessor to provide touch sensitive user interface functions for an associated vehicle accessory, personal electronics, tracking system, and the like as described herein. Electronics <b>110</b> may also include various hardware, firmware, and/or software to communicate with: a wired or wireless remote input device, such as a mouse, track ball, stylus, or touch pad; a cellular, satellite, or radio frequency (RF) network; and/or active/passive identification tags associated with tracked cargo or objects as described in greater detail herein, particularly with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-14</figref>. Electronics board <b>110</b> may be connected to display <b>108</b> and sensor panel <b>102</b> to control information presented to the user via display <b>108</b> and process input detected by sensor panel or touch pad <b>102</b> as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">User interface device <b>100</b> may also include a front cover or faceplate <b>120</b> having a generally transparent non-conductive active surface area <b>122</b>, which may be made of glass or plastic, for example. Surface area <b>122</b> may incorporate tinted or smoked material to reduce reflections or glare and enhance visibility of display screen <b>106</b>. Alternatively, or in combination, one or more anti-reflective (AR) layers or coatings may be applied to either side of area <b>122</b> to provide desired aesthetics and/or enhance visibility or readability of display screen <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, a cloaking or masking layer <b>130</b> may be used to reduce visibility of features <b>118</b> of sensor panel <b>102</b> to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Light passing from display screen <b>106</b> may be partially reflected by one or more layers of sensor panel <b>102</b> and area <b>122</b> of face plate <b>120</b> resulting in feature pattern <b>118</b> being visible to a user. Conventional strategies for reducing visibility of features <b>118</b> include adding filters and reflector sheets to mask this visual effect. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, a user interface without a masking layer <b>130</b> has features <b>118</b>&#x2032; of a sensor panel <b>102</b>&#x2032; visible to a user through transparent surface <b>122</b>&#x2032; of the faceplate. Although suitable for some applications, visibility of features <b>118</b>&#x2032; may not be particularly aesthetically pleasing and may reduce the readability of display screen <b>106</b> through surface <b>122</b>&#x2032;. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, layer <b>130</b> reduces or eliminates visibility of features <b>118</b> through surface <b>122</b>. According to the present disclosure, appropriate selection of material, thickness, and controlled application of layer <b>130</b> may operate to reduce or eliminate internal reflections that otherwise reveal features <b>118</b> of sensor panel <b>102</b> to the user. This may be performed by selecting a material that reduces or eliminates the refractive index differences between area <b>122</b>, panel <b>102</b>, and screen <b>106</b>, for example, as large differences in refractive indices typically generate more internal reflections. In various embodiments layer <b>130</b> is implemented by an adhesive spray, liquid, or filter that is generally transparent and colorless, such as DP-270, which is commercially available from 3-M corporation, for example. When implemented by an adhesive spray, layer <b>130</b> is applied to panel <b>102</b> and/or the back surface of area <b>122</b> in a manner that minimizes or eliminates air bubbles or any contaminants between surface <b>122</b> and panel <b>102</b>. Adhesive layer <b>130</b> then secures sensor pad <b>102</b> to faceplate <b>120</b>. An additional layer or coating of clear acrylic may be applied to the back side of surface <b>122</b> and/or the surface of panel <b>102</b> to further reduce visibility of features <b>118</b>. Screen <b>108</b> and electronics <b>110</b> are then assembled with a rear cover (not shown) secured to faceplate <b>120</b> to form an air tight seal to prevent dust, water, or other environmental contaminants from entering input device <b>100</b>. This facilitates use of input device <b>100</b> in various challenging environments.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As previously described, user interface or input device <b>100</b> includes an active surface <b>122</b> for entering commands or data via a solid-state touch sensitive switch or array as well as for displaying information to a user via screen <b>108</b>.

As previously described, although the illustrated embodiment includes a capacitive sensor panel <b>102</b>, other touch detection strategies may be used in place of, or in combination with, a capacitive sensor panel <b>102</b>.</p>

As such, input device <b>100</b> may include one or more data/power interfaces or connectors for charging an internal battery and exchanging data with a local or remote device or network.

As previously described, a sealed assembly provides a robust device for both permanent, fixed installations as well as removable mounting for portable hand-held use with solid state input suitable for use in challenging environments and applications. A generally transparent touch detection panel <b>102</b>&#x2033; is positioned between a display <b>108</b>&#x2033; and active surface <b>122</b>&#x2033;. Housing <b>120</b>&#x2033; includes at least one printed circuit board <b>110</b>&#x2033; that cooperates with display <b>108</b>&#x2033; and sensor panel <b>108</b>&#x2033; to capture input from a user in proximity to, or in contact with, active surface <b>122</b>&#x2033;.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Similar to previously described embodiments, where capacitive sensing is employed, sensor layer <b>102</b>&#x2033; may be manufactured using a generally transparent material such as ITO and secured to the back side of surface <b>122</b>&#x2033; with a liquid spray adhesive <b>130</b>&#x2033; between the ITO and face plate. Spray adhesive <b>130</b>&#x2033; eliminates any air gap between the back surface of area <b>122</b>&#x2033; and sensor panel <b>102</b>&#x2033;. A clear acrylic spray <b>132</b> or any clear spray may also be used on the rear surface of area <b>122</b>&#x2033; to create a uniform &#x201c;wet&#x201d; appearance to further mask the effects of light entering through surface <b>122</b>&#x2033;, reflecting from sensor panel <b>102</b>&#x2033;, and exiting the face plate in addition to reducing visibility of any grid or array on sensor <b>102</b>&#x2033; illuminated by light from display <b>108</b>&#x2033;.

Device interface hardware and/or software <b>142</b> cooperates with transceiver <b>140</b> and antenna <b>152</b> to wirelessly transmit and receive information using one or more standard communication technologies and protocols. Wireless communications capabilities may be used to communicate with cell phones, PDAs, laptops, and netbook computers as well as vehicle systems and accessories.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As previously described, a remote input device <b>160</b> may communicate with user interface/input device <b>100</b>&#x2033; via a wireless communication link and/or an optional wired link <b>154</b>. Remote input device <b>160</b> may be implemented by a mouse, keypad, keyboard, track ball, touch pad, etc. Similar to user device <b>100</b>&#x2033;, remote input device <b>160</b> may be permanently or removably mounted in a vehicle, such as illustrated and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">User interface/input device <b>100</b>&#x2033; may be used to locate and/or track one or more objects <b>170</b> having associated active or passive identification tags <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, respectively. Tags <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> may be implemented using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to communicate at least identification information to device <b>100</b>&#x2033;. Position information may also be transmitted, or may be determined indirectly by device <b>100</b>&#x2033; based on signal strength and/or direction for each tagged device.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Utilization of active and/or passive tags and the type of information stored and/or transmitted by a particular tag may depend on a number of considerations. In general, a passive tag does not contain its own power source, such as a battery. Power to transmit identification and/or location information is supplied by the polling or reading device <b>100</b>&#x2033; via antenna <b>152</b>. When radio waves from antenna <b>152</b> are encountered by a passive RFID tag <b>168</b>, an internal tag antenna and coil generate sufficient power to activate the tag and transmit some or all of its stored information encoded in a tag memory. Passive tags generally have a longer life than active tags, are less expensive to manufacture, and are much smaller. However, passive tags usually have a shorter useful range, typically on the order of several feet from device <b>100</b>&#x2033;. Active tags have one or more internal power supply sources, such as a battery, electrovoltaic (solar cell), MEMS device, or radioactive isotope to provide on-board power that can be used as a partial or complete source of power for the tag circuitry and antenna. Active tags can generally be read at distances of one hundred to several hundred feet or more, greatly improving their utility and flexibility for a number of applications. They may also include other sensors that can use electricity for power, such as a location or motion sensor, for example. However, active tags are generally larger and more expensive to manufacture than passive tags.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Embodiments of the present disclosure are generally independent of the particular type of identification tag <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> and the particular communication strategy employed, both of which may vary depending on the particular application. Tracked objects or devices <b>170</b> may employ one or more identification tags <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, which may use various communication strategies intended for low-power, low-bandwidth digital communications, such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, or Dash-7, for example. Those of ordinary skill in the art may recognize operational characteristics of a particular type of tag or communication strategy that provide advantages for particular applications. For example, tags employing a communication strategy using a relatively longer wavelength, such as Dash-7, may be able to penetrate surrounding obstacles made of metallic materials or concrete better than tags using ZigBee, or Wi-Fi, for example. A single identification tag <b>166</b> or <b>168</b> may be associated with more than one tracked item or object. For example, a single tag may be associated with a bin, pallet, or other container associated with multiple tracked objects. Likewise, different types of identification tags may be used for different types of objects. For example, more sophisticated active tags may be used to identify more valuable objects with less expensive passive tags used for less valuable objects or items.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one embodiment, system <b>200</b> is used to track items, object, and/or equipment <b>170</b> that is to be utilized for a particular project, such as a construction project.

Device <b>100</b>&#x2033; detects location and/or proximity of items <b>170</b> within range and determines whether all items listed for the project or for a particular delivery vehicle are present. Depending on the particular application, proximity of objects <b>170</b> to user device <b>100</b>&#x2033; may be determined by signal strength and direction of responding ID tags <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, and/or by position coordinates of particular objects relative to position coordinates of device <b>100</b>&#x2033; with position coordinates determined using GPS system <b>142</b> and satellites <b>164</b>, cellular network <b>162</b>, and/or similar position/location determination strategies.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Depending on the particular strategy used to identify tracked objects, the system or method may optionally transmit a polling signal to activate passive-type identification tags as represented by block <b>310</b>. A polling signal may be transmitted periodically and/or in response to a particular command or request generated by the user or triggered by occurrence of an event, for example. The polling signal may be received by tracked objects within proximity of the user device to activate or read the identification information from those objects. Alternatively, active identification tags may periodically transmit an identification and/or location signal. Whether transmitted by an active or passive tag, an identification signal associated with the tracked object(s) within proximity of the user interface device is received as represented by block <b>320</b>. The received signal may be used to determine the position of each tracked object relative to the user interface device. In one embodiment, tracked objects transmit position/location information using GPS coordinates determined by GPS satellites. Proximity of tracked items may also be inferred based on signal characteristics, such as signal direction and strength, for example. Location information for tracked objects may also be determined indirectly via a wireless or wired network connection. For example, tracked objects may transmit identification and/or position information to a base station or relay station with the information forwarded to a user interface device via a wireless or wired network connection.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Identification information for one or more tracked objects may be used to determine whether the previously identified objects are present within a particular area or proximity of the user interface device as represented by block <b>340</b>. The particular area, proximity, or range to determine &#x201c;presence&#x201d; may be specified by the user and may vary depending on the particular application. The user interface device may generate an alert for the user with respect to the status of one or more tracked objects as represented by block <b>350</b>. For example, the user interface device may generate an alert that all items specified for a particular list are within the designated proximity to be &#x201c;present&#x201d;. An alert may be generated indicated that one or more tracked objects have changed position/location, or that one or more tracked objects have moved out of a particular proximity or range of the user interface device. Various other types of status messages or alerts may be specified depending on the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In addition to providing an interface to a tracking or logistics management system, the user interface device may be used to control one or more vehicle accessories or personal electronic devices as represented by block <b>360</b>.
