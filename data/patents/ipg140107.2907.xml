<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure is generally directed to a polyalkylene glycol ester containing intermediate transfer member, and to an intermediate transfer member that includes a mixture of a polyimide, a polyalkylene glycol ester, an optional polysiloxane, and an optional conductive component.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Intermediate transfer members, such as intermediate transfer belts selected for transferring a developed image in xerographic systems, are known. For example, there are known intermediate transfer members that include materials with characteristics that cause these members to become brittle, resulting in inadequate acceptance of the developed image and subsequent partial transfer of developed xerographic images to a substrate like paper.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A disadvantage relating to the preparation of an intermediate transfer member is that there is usually deposited a separate release layer that is present on a metal substrate. Thereafter, there is applied to the release layer the intermediate transfer member components, and where the release layer allows the components to be separated from the member by peeling or by the use of mechanical devices. The intermediate transfer member can be in the form of a film, which can be selected for xerographic imaging systems, or the film can be deposited on a supporting substrate like a polymer layer. The use of a release layer adds to the cost and time of preparation, and such a layer can modify a number of the intermediate transfer member characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need for intermediate transfer members that substantially avoid or minimize the disadvantages of a number of known intermediate transfer members.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need for intermediate transfer member materials that possess self release characteristics from a number of substrates that are selected when such members are prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also, there is a need for intermediate transfer members that retain their flatness characteristics with minimal or no curl, and where the surface of the member is smooth with minimal rugged peaks and valleys.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, there is a need for intermediate transfer members with excellent wear and acceptable abrasion resistance, and which members possess improved stability with no or minimal degradation for extended time periods.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another need relates to intermediate transfer members that have excellent conductivity or resistivity, and that possess acceptable humidity insensitivity characteristics leading to developed images with minimal resolution issues.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other needs are achievable in embodiments with the intermediate transfer members and components thereof disclosed herein.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> there is illustrated a three layer intermediate transfer member comprising a supporting substrate <b>15</b>, a layer thereover <b>16</b> comprising a mixture of a thermosetting polyimide <b>17</b>, a polyalkylene glycol ester <b>18</b>, an optional siloxane polymer <b>19</b>, and an optional conductive component <b>21</b>, and an optional release layer <b>23</b> comprising release components <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">There is disclosed a self-releasing intermediate transfer member that generally comprises a polyalkylene glycol ester, such as a polyethylene glycol dilaurate, a polyethylene glycol di(2-ethylhexonate), or mixtures thereof. In embodiments, the polyalkylene glycol ester can be mixed with a polymer material to form an intermediate transfer member layer. Thus, in particular embodiments, there is disclosed a self-releasing intermediate transfer member that generally comprises a polyimide, a polyalkylene glycol ester that primarily functions as an internal release agent, a polysiloxane polymer and a conductive component like carbon black, and which member has excellent release and stability characteristics, smooth high quality surfaces, and improved mechanical properties.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The intermediate transfer members disclosed herein exhibit self-release characteristics, and where the use of an external release layer present on, for example, a stainless steel substrate is avoided; have excellent mechanical strength while permitting the rapid and complete transfer of from about 90 to about 99 percent, or from about 95 to about 100 percent transfer of a xerographic developed image; possess a Young's modulus of, for example, from about 3,000 to about 7,000 Mega Pascals (MPa), from about 3,600 to about 6,000 MPa, from about 3,500 to about 5,000 MPa, or from about 3,700 to about 4,000 MPa; have a high glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) of from about 200&#xb0; C. to about 400&#xb0; C., or from about 275&#xb0; C. to about 350&#xb0; C.; a CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) of from about 20 to about 70 parts per million per degree Kelvin (ppm/&#xb0; K), or from about 30 to about 60 ppm/&#xb0; K; and an excellent resistivity as measured with a known High Resistivity Meter of, for example, from about 10<sup>8 </sup>to about 10<sup>13 </sup>ohm/square, from about 10<sup>9 </sup>to about 10<sup>13 </sup>ohm/square, from about 10<sup>9 </sup>to about 10<sup>12 </sup>ohm/square, or from about 10<sup>10 </sup>to about 10<sup>12 </sup>ohm/square.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Self-release characteristics without the assistance of any external sources, such as prying devices, permit the efficient, economical formation and full separation, from about 95 to about 100 percent, or from about 97 to about 99 percent, of the disclosed intermediate transfer member films from substrates, such as steel, upon which the members are initially prepared, and where release materials and separate release layers can be avoided on the metal substrates. The time period to obtain the self-release characteristics varies depending, for example, on the components selected for the polyalkylene glycol ester containing mixtures disclosed. Generally, however, this time period is from about 1 to about 60 seconds, from about 1 to about 35 seconds, from about 1 to about 10 seconds, or from 1 to about 5 seconds, and in some instances less than about 1 second.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The intermediate transfer members of the present disclosure can be provided in any of a variety of configurations, such as a one-layer configuration, or in a multi-layer configuration including, for example, a top release layer. More specifically, the final intermediate transfer member may be in the form of an endless flexible belt, a web, a flexible drum or roller, a rigid roller or cylinder, a sheet, a drelt (a cross between a drum and a belt), a seamless belt, that is with an absence of any seams or visible joints in the members, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As disclosed herein, the intermediate transfer member generally comprises a polymer layer formed from a polyalkylene glycol ester, or generated from a mixture of materials comprising at least a polyalkylene glycol ester. In embodiments, the polyalkylene glycol ester can be mixed with a polymer material, such as a polyimide polymer material or precursor thereof, other optional materials, such as a polysiloxane polymer, a conductive component, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Polyalkylene Glycol Esters</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The polyalkylene glycol esters selected for the disclosed intermediate transfer members assist in imparting, or provide self-release characteristics to the material. As such, when the intermediate transfer member is formed on an underlying substrate, the intermediate transfer member will self-release from the substrate.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Intermediate Transfer Member Formation</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The intermediate transfer members illustrated herein comprising a polyalkylene glycol ester, or comprising a mixture of a polyimide, a polyalkylene glycol ester, a polysiloxane, and an optional conductive filler component, can be formulated into an intermediate transfer member by any suitable method. For example, with known milling processes, uniform dispersions of the intermediate transfer member mixtures can be obtained, and then coated on individual metal substrates, such as a stainless steel substrate or the like, using known draw bar coating or flow coating methods. The resulting individual film or films can be dried at high temperatures, such as by heating the films at from about 100&#xb0; C. to about 400&#xb0; C., or from about 160&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C., for a suitable period of time, such as from about 20 to about 180 minutes, or from about 40 to about 120 minutes, while remaining on the substrates. After drying and cooling to room temperature, about 23&#xb0; C. to about 25&#xb0; C., the films self release from the steel substrates, that is the films release without any external assistance. The resultant intermediate transfer film product can have a thickness of, for example, from about 15 to about 150 microns, from about 20 to about 100 microns, or from about 25 to about 80 microns.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The intermediate transfer members illustrated herein can be selected for a number of printing and copying systems, inclusive of xerographic printing systems. For example, the disclosed intermediate transfer members can be incorporated into a multi-imaging xerographic machine where each developed toner image to be transferred is formed on the imaging or photoconductive drum at an image forming station, and where each of these images is then developed at a developing station, and transferred to the intermediate transfer member. The images may be formed on a photoconductor and developed sequentially, and then transferred to the intermediate transfer member. In an alternative method, each image may be formed on the photoconductor or photoreceptor drum, developed, and then transferred in registration to the intermediate transfer member. In an embodiment, the multi-image system is a color copying system, wherein each color of an image being copied is formed on the photoreceptor drum, developed, and transferred to the intermediate transfer member.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">After the toner latent image has been transferred from the photoreceptor drum to the intermediate transfer member, the intermediate transfer member may be contacted under heat and pressure with an image receiving substrate such as paper. The toner image on the intermediate transfer member is then transferred and fixed, in image configuration, to the substrate such as paper.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">MEASUREMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The above intermediate transfer members of Example I, and the Comparative Example 1 were measured for Young's Modulus following the known ASTM D882-97 process. Samples (0.5 inch&#xd7;12 inch) of each intermediate transfer member were placed in the Instron Tensile Tester measurement apparatus, and then the samples were elongated at a constant pull rate until breaking. During this time, there was recorded the resulting load versus the sample elongation. The Young's Modulus was calculated by taking any point tangential to the initial linear portion of the recorded curve results, and dividing the tensile stress by the corresponding strain. The tensile stress was calculated by the load divided by the average cross sectional area of each of the test samples. The results are provided in Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The surface resistivity of the above intermediate transfer members of Example I, and Comparative Example 1 was also measured using a High Resistivity Meter, and the results are provided in Table 1.</p>
