<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to wireless networks and, more specifically, to a method and apparatus for association control in mobile wireless networks.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A mobile wireless network is a set of spatially distributed base stations or access points (APs) that are each connected to a network, for example, a telephone network and/or the Internet. Each AP provides a coverage area within which it is able to communicate wirelessly to a mobile terminal and thus provide the mobile terminal with network access. As the mobile terminal travels beyond the coverage area of a first AP and into the coverage area of a second AP, network communication is handed off from the first AP to the second AP such that the mobile terminal may retain network access even when in motion.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of mobile wireless networks include mobile telephone networks such as CDMA and GSM networks, networks based on IEEE 802.11 standards (WiFi), networks based on IEEE 802.16 standards (WiMAX), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Handoff is performed as the mobile terminal travels beyond the coverage area of the AP currently providing network access. Specifically, handoff is performed before the signal received by the mobile terminal from the AP degrades below a point where network access is compromised. This point may be determined by monitoring the signal strength of the current AP and initiating a handoff when the signal strength of the current AP falls below a signal strength of an available AP.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Handoff of network access from one AP to another AP involves, among other concerns, determining which AP to handoff network access to. For example, the mobile terminal may be within the coverage area of multiple APs and there may be a selection of APs that may receive the handoff.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Conventionally, network access is handed off to the AP with the strongest signal. In such a situation, the mobile terminal may analyze the signal strength of each available AP and select a desired AP based on the strongest signal. Accordingly, as the mobile terminal leaves the coverage area of a first AP, network access may be handed off to another AP without a loss of network access.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, frequent handoff of network access may be problematic for a mobile terminal. For example, handoffs may potentially cause interruption of data transfer across the network. When data transfer is involved in real-time communication service, such as a voice call, interruption of data transfer may be undesirable potentially leading to noticeable delays in communication. Additionally, interruption of data transfer may lead to unacceptable delays in interactive applications that rely upon network-based communication. Moreover, the process of handing off network access may be expensive in terms of battery drain and computational economy, both of which may be scarce in mobile terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Approaches have been developed to minimize latency in handoffs. For example, S. Pack and Y. Choi, &#x201c;<i>Fast Inter</i>-<i>AP Handoff using Predictive Authentication Scheme in a Public Wireless LAN</i>,&#x201d; in proc. IEEE Networks Conference, Atlanta, Ga., August 2002; M. Shin, A. Mishra, and W. Arbaugh, &#x201c;<i>Improving the Latency of </i>802.11 <i>Hand</i>-<i>offs using Neighbor Graphs</i>,&#x201d; in Proc. ACM MobiSys, Boston Mass., June 2004; A. Mishra, M. Shin, and W. Arbaugh, &#x201c;<i>Context Caching using Neighbor Graphs for Fast Handoffs in a Wireless Network</i>,&#x201d; in Proc. IEEE Infocom, Hong Kong, China, March 2004; and I. Ramani and S. Savage, &#x201c;<i>SyncScan: Practical Fast Handoff for </i>802.11 <i>Infrastructure Networks</i>,&#x201d; in Proc. IEEE Infocom, Miami, Fla., March 2005; each of which are herein incorporated by reference. According to such approaches, channel scanning time and handoff latency may be minimized. However, such approaches have not been concerned with minimizing the number of handoffs, and accordingly, expense of battery drain and computational economy associated with handoffs is not minimized.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In describing the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology is employed for sake of clarity. However, the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide approaches for minimizing the frequency of handoffs as a mobile terminal roams through a mobile communications network. The frequency of handoffs may be minimized by utilizing one or more of the approaches discussed herein for selecting a desired AP to receive handoff. By minimizing the frequency of handoffs, the quality of mobile network communication may be maximized while battery power and computational resources of the mobile terminal may be conserved.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As discussed above, the conventional approach for selecting an AP to receive handoff includes determining which of the available APs provides the strongest signal to the mobile terminal and then handing off network access to the AP that has been determined to provide the strongest signal. The strength of the signal may primarily depend on the distance between the mobile terminal and the access point, but other factors such as obstructions and atmospheric conditions may play a role as well. For the purposes of simplifying discussion, it will be assumed herein that signal strength is wholly a factor of distance between the mobile terminal and the access point.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thus according to the conventional approach, when a mobile terminal roaming within a network of APs leaves the coverage area of a particular AP, network access is handed off to the AP that is closest to the mobile terminal at that moment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing network handoff. The trajectory of the mobile terminal is assumed to be linear for the benefit of description.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mobile terminal MT follows a trajectory T. At location L<b>1</b> along the trajectory T, the mobile terminal MT determines that while it is within the coverage area of a first access point AP<b>1</b> and a second access point AP<b>2</b>, a network connection is established with AP<b>1</b> because at L<b>1</b>, the signal from AP<b>1</b> is stronger than the signal from AP<b>2</b>. Thus network access is initially provided by AP<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>2</b>, and the mobile terminal MT is within the coverage areas of AP<b>1</b>, AP<b>2</b> and AP<b>3</b>, the mobile terminal MT determines that the signal is strongest from AP<b>2</b>. Thus network access is handed off from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>2</b> (handoff <b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>3</b>, and the mobile terminal MT is within the coverage areas of AP<b>2</b>, AP<b>3</b> and AP<b>4</b>, the mobile terminal MT determines that the signal is strongest from AP<b>3</b>. Thus network access is handed off from AP<b>2</b> to AP<b>3</b> (handoff <b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>4</b>, and the mobile terminal MT is within the coverage areas of AP<b>3</b>, AP<b>4</b> and AP<b>5</b>, the mobile terminal MT determines that the signal is strongest from AP<b>4</b>. Thus network access is handed off from AP<b>3</b> to AP<b>4</b> (handoff <b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>5</b>, and the mobile terminal MT is within the coverage areas of AP<b>4</b>, AP<b>5</b> and AP<b>7</b>, the mobile terminal MT determines that the signal is strongest from AP<b>5</b>. Thus network access is handed off from AP<b>4</b> to AP<b>5</b> (handoff <b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>6</b>, and the mobile terminal MT is within the coverage areas of AP<b>5</b>, AP<b>6</b> and AP<b>7</b>, the mobile terminal MT determines that the signal is strongest from AP<b>6</b>. Thus network access is handed off from AP<b>5</b> to AP<b>6</b> (handoff <b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>7</b>, and the mobile terminal MT is within the coverage areas of AP<b>6</b>, AP<b>7</b> and AP<b>8</b>, the mobile terminal MT determines that the signal is strongest from AP<b>7</b>. Thus network access is handed off from AP<b>6</b> to AP<b>7</b> (handoff <b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>8</b>, and the mobile terminal MT is within the coverage areas of AP<b>7</b>, AP<b>8</b> and AP<b>9</b>, the mobile terminal MT determines that the signal is strongest from AP<b>8</b>. Thus network access is handed off from AP<b>7</b> to AP<b>8</b> (handoff <b>7</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>9</b>, and the mobile terminal MT is within the coverage areas of AP<b>8</b>, AP<b>9</b> and AP<b>10</b>, the mobile terminal MT determines that the signal is strongest from AP<b>9</b>. Thus network access is handed off from AP<b>8</b> to AP<b>9</b> (handoff <b>8</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, as the mobile terminal MT progresses along the trajectory T from L<b>1</b> to L<b>9</b>, there are a total of 8 handoffs performed when using the conventional approach for handing off.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">To minimize the frequency associated with access point handoff, exemplary embodiments employ techniques for selecting access points that are most likely to maximize duration of association. Among the various techniques for selecting among multiple APs contemplated by exemplary embodiments of the present invention, three exemplary techniques are discussed in detail below. These techniques are Lookahead, Lookback, and Track. The Lookahead approach involves an offline approach wherein the trajectory of the mobile terminal is known or may be assumed. The Lookback and Track approaches involve online approaches wherein the trajectory of the mobile terminal is unknown.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Lookahead Approach</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As discussed above, the Lookahead approach to AP selection is an offline approach where the trajectory of the mobile terminal is known or may be assumed. For example, the Lookahead approach may be used where the mobile terminal is moving along a knowable path, such as in a train along a track or an automobile along a highway. The mobile terminal's known trajectory need not be a straight line, all that is needed is that the trajectory be known or assumed. The trajectory of the mobile device may either be preprogrammed by a user or determined/estimated by the mobile device, for example, by analyzing a pattern of past AP association. Global positioning service technology and/or a mapping of the location of available APs may also be used in figuring out the trajectory of the mobile terminal, although this information is not required in all exemplary embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In performing the lookahead approach, handoff is triggered by the dropping off of signal strength below a predetermined threshold below which it is known that signal strength is undesirable. When the handoff is triggered, the mobile terminal may determine a list of available APs whose signal strength is above the predetermined threshold. For each available AP, the known and/or estimated trajectory is used to determine a duration value representing the extent of uninterrupted reception above the predetermined threshold either in terms of time (where velocity of the mobile terminal is known) or in terms of distance. Then, the available AP with the greatest measure of uninterrupted reception is selected and network access is handed off to the selected AP.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In determining the extent of uninterrupted reception above the predetermined threshold, proximity may be used as a proxy for reception strength, and reception strength above a predetermined threshold may be expressed as a maximum distance from a particular access point. Where additional data is available, such as obstructions and atmospheric conditions that may affect a signal's ability to carry, this data may be used to augment the calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Determining the extent of uninterrupted reception may be performed for discrete time slots of predetermined time intervals, for example, several seconds. Using the trajectory of the mobile terminal, the level of estimated reception for each available access point may be calculated for a predetermined number of time slots, for example 10 time slots.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, it may be determined for each available access point, what the distance will be between that access point and the mobile terminal at each time slot. If a particular AP is determined to be within the predetermined distance of the mobile terminal for all 10 future time slots, then the extent of uninterrupted reception for that AP is 10. If a particular AP is determined to be within the predetermined distance of the mobile terminal for the first 5 time slots and then beyond the predetermined distance for the next 5 time slots then the extent of uninterrupted reception for that AP is 6. However, if a particular AP is determined to be within the predetermined distance of the mobile terminal for the first 3 time slots, beyond the predetermined distance for the next 2 time slots and then back within the predetermined distance of the mobile terminal for the remaining 5 time slots, then the extent of uninterrupted reception for that AP is 3, because it is only within the first 3 time slots that uninterrupted reception from the initial time slot is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Accordingly, the AP with the longest measure of uninterrupted reception is selected and network access is handed off to the selected AP.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thus returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the Lookahead approach for AP selection may be used to minimize the number of handoffs. For example, at location L<b>1</b> along the trajectory T, the mobile terminal MT determined that it is within the coverage area of AP<b>1</b> and AP<b>2</b>. Based on the trajectory T, for AP<b>1</b>, reception will be present at L<b>1</b>, present at L<b>2</b>, and not present at L<b>3</b>. Thus, the extent of uninterrupted reception for AP<b>1</b> is 2. Meanwhile, for AP<b>2</b>, reception will be present at L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> and L<b>3</b>. Thus the extent of uninterrupted reception for AP<b>2</b> is 3. Because the extent of uninterrupted reception for AP<b>2</b> exceeds the comparable figure for AP<b>1</b>, AP<b>2</b> is selected and thus network access is initially provided by AP<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>2</b> and L<b>3</b>, no handoff is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>4</b>, and reception from AP<b>2</b> falls bellow the threshold level, the MT determines that it is within the coverage area of AP<b>3</b>, AP<b>4</b> and AP<b>5</b>. Based on an analysis similar to the analysis described above, AP<b>5</b> is selected for having the greatest extent of uninterrupted reception and handoff is performed to AP<b>5</b> (handoff <b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>5</b> and L<b>6</b>, no handoff is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>7</b>, and the reception from AP<b>5</b> falls bellow the threshold level, the MT determines that it is within the coverage area of L<b>6</b>, L<b>7</b> and L<b>8</b>. Based on an analysis similar to the analysis described above, AP<b>8</b> is selected for having the greatest extent of uninterrupted reception and handoff is performed to AP<b>8</b> (handoff <b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As the mobile terminal MT proceeds to L<b>8</b> and L<b>9</b>, no handoff is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Accordingly, as the mobile terminal MT progresses along the trajectory T from L<b>1</b> to L<b>9</b>, there are a total of 2 handoffs performed when using a Lookahead approach according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. This stands in contrast to the 8 handoffs used according to the conventional approach.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for performing AP handoff using a Lookahead approach according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. First, the mobile terminal may determine what APs are available (Step S<b>21</b>). Then, for each available AP, the mobile terminal may calculate the extent of uninterrupted reception based on a known or assumed trajectory (Step S<b>22</b>). The extent of uninterrupted reception may be calculated as the length of time and/or travel distance that the mobile terminal will remain within the coverage area of the particular AP without interruption, starting from the time and location where the mobile terminal determined what APs were available. The available AP with the greatest extent of uninterrupted reception may then be selected (Step S<b>23</b>). Where there are multiple APs with an identical greatest extent of uninterrupted reception, selection may be arbitrary from among the group of APs that share the greatest extent of uninterrupted reception. Alternatively, selection from among the group of APs that share the greatest extent of uninterrupted reception may be based upon which of the group of APs has the greatest signal strength. Where the AP is selected for the purposes of establishing initial network access, initial network access may be established with the selected AP. Where the AP is selected for the purposes of handing off network access, network access may be handed off to the selected AP (Step S<b>24</b>). After network access is established and/or handed off, the signal strength may be monitored to determine if the signal strength is within a predetermined threshold (Step S<b>25</b>). For as long as the signal strength is within the predetermined threshold (Yes, S<b>25</b>), no handoff is necessary and monitoring may continue (Step S<b>25</b>). When the signal strength falls below the predetermined threshold (No, S<b>25</b>), then the handoff process may be repeated at Step S<b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Lookback Approach</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As discussed above, the Lookback approach to AP selection is an online approach where the trajectory of the mobile terminal is unknown.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Even though the trajectory of the mobile terminal is unknown, exemplary embodiments of the present invention may provide techniques for minimizing the number of handoffs. The lookback approach works on the assumption that as the mobile terminal roams, an access point that has a recent history of covering the mobile terminal will be more likely to continue to cover the mobile terminal than an access point that has just begun to cover the mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">This concept may be described by example. The chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows how the lookback approach may be performed with respect to a particular example. In this example, it is assumed that the mobile terminal is traveling along an unknown trajectory. There are 12 potential APs numbered AP<b>1</b> through AP<b>12</b>. There are also 9 time slots. A time slot may be defined in a number of ways. For example, a time slot may be a fixed time interval. Alternatively, time slots may depend on the occurrence of a particular event, such as when a scan for available APs is performed. According to this example, every time the mobile terminal performs another scan for available APs, a new time slot has begun. Under some implementations of this approach, a new scan is performed whenever a handoff is required, however, there may be other events that trigger a scan as well.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an &#x201c;x&#x201d; indicates which APs are available at which time slots, for example, AP<b>1</b> is available to the mobile terminal at time slot <b>1</b>, while AP<b>12</b> is not available at time slot <b>1</b>. Square brackets &#x201c;[ ]&#x201d; are used to indicate which of the available APs is the associated AP at any given time slot.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Some time slots are considered to be &#x201c;marked&#x201d; time slots, these time slots receive an asterisk &#x201c;*&#x201d; in the &#x201c;MARK&#x201d; row. The concept of marking is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At time slot <b>1</b>, there is no previous association so an initial association is determined. The initial association may be determined according to either a random selection from among the available APs or by selecting the AP with the strongest signal. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, AP<b>2</b> is so selected and an initial association is begun.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The time slot in which an initial association is begun should be marked and thus time slot <b>1</b> is a marked time slot. As the mobile terminal roams, its position changes, and in time slot <b>2</b>, the associated AP, AP<b>2</b> is no longer available. Because the associated AP is no longer available, handoff is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The selection of the appropriate AP to handoff to is the subject of the lookback approach. According to the lookback approach, network access is handed off to an AP that is in the intersection of the set of currently available APs and the set of APs that were available at the last marked time slot. Where this set includes more than one AP, the selection from among this intersection set may either be arbitrary, according to the strongest signal, or according to any other means.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to the example shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at time slot <b>2</b>, the set of currently available APs is {AP<b>1</b>, AP<b>3</b>, AP<b>4</b>, AP<b>6</b>, AP<b>9</b>} and the set of APs that were available at the last marked time slot is {AP<b>1</b>, AP<b>2</b>, AP<b>3</b>, AP<b>4</b>, AP<b>5</b>}. Thus, the set of intersection is {AP<b>1</b>, AP<b>3</b>, AP<b>4</b>}. In this example, AP<b>1</b> is selected from among the intersection set.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An association may last until the associated AP is no longer available. In the example at time slot <b>3</b>, the currently associated AP is still available and thus association is maintained. However, at time slot <b>4</b>, AP<b>1</b> is no longer available and a new AP is selected for handoff. This time, the set of available APs is {AP<b>6</b>, AP<b>7</b>, AP<b>8</b>, AP<b>9</b>} and the set of APs available at the last marked time slot is {AP<b>1</b>, AP<b>2</b>, AP<b>3</b>, AP<b>4</b>, AP<b>5</b>}, thus the intersection set is null. According to this implementation of the lookback approach, when the intersection set is found to be null, the current time slot is marked.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When the current time slot is marked, the intersection of the currently available APs and the APs available at the most recently marked slot are identical and thus any available time slot may be selected. In this example, AP<b>6</b> is so selected. Then because AP<b>6</b> remains available at time slot <b>5</b>, no handoff occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">At time slot <b>6</b>, the associated AP is no longer available and thus a new AP is selected for handoff. The set of currently available APs is {AP<b>7</b>, AP<b>10</b>, AP<b>11</b>, AP<b>12</b>} and the set of APs available at the most recently marked time slot is {AP<b>6</b>, AP<b>7</b>, AP<b>8</b>, AP<b>9</b>}, thus the intersection set is {AP<b>7</b>}. Accordingly, AP<b>7</b> is selected to receive handoff. Throughout time slots <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>, AP<b>7</b> remains available and thus no further handoffs occur.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for performing AP handoff using a Lookback approach according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. When no prior association exists, an initial association may be made based on the presently available APs (Step S<b>40</b>). Selecting between the available APs may be arbitrary, may be based on strongest signal, or based on another mode of selection. Also in this step, the present time slot may be marked.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Association may continue for as long as the mobile terminal remains within the coverage area of the associated AP (Yes, Step S<b>41</b>). When the associated AP is no longer available (No, Step S<b>41</b>) then the set of currently available APs is determined (Step S<b>42</b>). Then it may be determined which of the set of available APs were also available at the most recently marked time slot (Step S<b>43</b>). This is the intersection of the presently available APs and the APs that were available at the most recently marked time slot.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If this intersection is a null set (Yes, Step S<b>44</b>) and there are no presently available APs that were also available at the most recently marked time slot, then the present time slot is marked (Step S<b>45</b>). Then the step of determining the intersection is performed again (Step S<b>43</b>) for the newly marked time slot.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the intersection is not a null set (No, Step S<b>44</b>), then an AP may be selected from among the intersection (Step S<b>46</b>). Where there are multiple APs in this set, the selection between the APs may be arbitrary, based on signal strength, or by some other approach.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Then, handoff may be performed to the selected AP (Step S<b>47</b>). The association with the selected AP may continue for as long as the selected AP is available (Yes, Step S<b>48</b>). When the selected AP is no longer available (No, Step S<b>48</b>), then the process may return to step S<b>42</b>. As described above, the associated AP may be considered available for as long as its signal strength remains above a predetermined threshold level.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The Lookback approach described above is offered as an example application of the Lookback approach. This approach may be modified in many ways. For example, in the approach discussed above, the marking is set when the intersection between currently available APs and APs that were available at the most recently marked time slot is null. This aspect may be changed and another approach to marking time slots may be used. For example, every time slot may be a marked time slot and thus the selected AP may be selected from among the intersection of the currently available APs and the APs that were available at the immediately previous time slot.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">While there may be exemplary situations where the Lookback approach provides comparable or perhaps even more frequent handoffs than the conventional approach, it is believed that on average, the Lookback approach provides fewer handoffs than the conventional approach in light of the real-world trajectories followed by pedestrians and vehicles that may be carrying mobile devices.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Track Approach</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Another online approach to AP selection is the Track approach where the trajectory of the mobile terminal is unknown. Wireless APs periodically send out beacons that are used to make their presence known. These beacons may allow mobile terminals to establish a connection with the APs. By listening for beacons, the mobile terminal may determine what APs are available at any given moment.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Even though the trajectory of the mobile terminal is unknown, exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be trained to recognize patterns of AP availability to estimate which of the available APs is likely to have the longest period of association with the mobile terminal as it roams and thus, by associating with the AP likely to have the longest period of association, the frequency of handoffs may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">One method for estimating a period of association is to use history data previously recorded by the mobile terminal as it roams. The history data may be collected by the mobile terminal by analyzing the set of available APs at set intervals and using this set of available APs to generate a location profile. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at location L<b>51</b>, only access point AP<b>56</b> is available. Thus the location profile is AP<b>56</b>. As the mobile terminal roams from location L<b>51</b> to location L<b>52</b> along the unknown trajectory T, AP<b>56</b>, AP<b>57</b> and AP <b>58</b> are all available. Thus the location profile becomes AP<b>56</b>, AP<b>57</b> and AP<b>58</b>. The transition from location profile &#x201c;AP<b>56</b>&#x201d; to location profile &#x201c;AP<b>56</b>, AP<b>57</b> and AP<b>58</b>&#x201d; is a transition state that may be recorded. Then, as the mobile terminal continues along its trajectory, it is observed that at location L<b>53</b>, AP<b>56</b> is no longer available while AP<b>57</b> and AP<b>58</b> continue to be available. Thus it is recorded that at the transition state from location profile &#x201c;AP<b>56</b>&#x201d; to location profile &#x201c;AP<b>56</b>, AP<b>57</b> and AP<b>58</b>,&#x201d; AP<b>56</b> has an association duration of &#xbd; interval. The association duration is said to be &#xbd; because it is known that association with AP<b>56</b> is available at L<b>51</b> and unavailable at L<b>52</b>, because it may not be known at precisely what point the AP becomes unavailable, it is sufficient to estimate the association duration to be &#xbd;.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Then, as the mobile terminal roams from location L<b>53</b> to location L<b>54</b>, it is observed that at location L<b>54</b>, neither AP<b>56</b> nor AP<b>57</b> are available but AP<b>58</b> remains available. Thus it is recorded that at the transition state from location profile &#x201c;AP<b>56</b>&#x201d; to location profile &#x201c;AP<b>56</b>, AP<b>57</b> and AP<b>58</b>,&#x201d; AP<b>57</b> has an association duration of 1.5 intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Then, as the mobile terminal roams from location L<b>54</b> to location L<b>55</b>, it is observed that at location L<b>55</b>, none of AP<b>65</b>, AP<b>57</b> or AP<b>58</b> is available. Thus it is recorded that at the transition state from location profile &#x201c;AP<b>56</b>&#x201d; to location profile &#x201c;AP<b>56</b>, AP<b>57</b> and AP<b>58</b>,&#x201d; AP<b>58</b> has an association duration of 2.5 intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The three measures of association duration are then recorded along with the details of the transition state. This information may then be used at a later time when the mobile terminal again encounters the transition state from location profile &#x201c;AP<b>56</b>&#x201d; to location profile &#x201c;AP<b>56</b>, AP<b>57</b> and AP<b>58</b>.&#x201d; Because this transition state is now a known state, the mobile terminal at location L<b>52</b> may analyze the history information and use this information to select from the available access points. By referring to the history information for the known state, the available AP with the longest association duration may be selected and handoff may be performed with the selected AP. For the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, AP<b>58</b> would be selected for handoff because at 2.5, it has the longest association duration</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for performing AP handoff using a Track approach according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. First, the mobile terminal may determine a list of available APs at a first location (Step S<b>61</b>). Then, after roaming to a second location, the mobile terminal may determine a list of available APs at the second location (Step S<b>62</b>). The transition from the first set of available APs to the second set of available APs may have previously been encountered by the mobile terminal, and at that previous encounter, history data pertaining to the association durations of each AP may have been collected. Accordingly, the relevant history data pertaining to the transition between the available APs at the first location and the available APs at the second location may be retrieved (Step S<b>63</b>). This history data may include association duration information for each available AP. The available AP with the greatest association duration may then be selected (Step S<b>64</b>). Where the AP is selected for the purposes of handing off network access, the network access may be handed off to the selected AP (Step S<b>65</b>). After network access is established and/or handed off, the signal strength may be monitored to determine if the signal strength is within a predetermined threshold (Step S<b>66</b>). For as long as the signal strength is within the predetermined threshold (Yes, S<b>66</b>), no handoff is necessary and monitoring may continue (Step S<b>66</b>). When the signal strength falls below the predetermined threshold (No, S<b>66</b>), then the handoff process may be repeated at Step S<b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Combination Approaches</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention may combine one or more of the above-described approaches. For example, all three of the above approaches may be selectively utilized depending on the available information. For example, the Lookahead approach may be used where the trajectory of the mobile terminal is known. If the trajectory of the mobile terminal is not known and appropriate history information is available, then the Track approach may be used. However, if neither the trajectory of the mobile terminal is known nor is there appropriate history information available, and at least the set of available APs for a prior time and/or location is known then the Lookback approach may be used. Where there is not enough information to employ the Lookback approach, for example, then the conventional strongest-signal approach may be used.</p>
