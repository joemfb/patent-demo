<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, slot machines are disclosed in United State Patent Application Publication No. 2003/013517, United State Patent Application Publication No. 2008/146314, United State Patent Application No. 2008/139294, and European Patent Application Publication No. 1376498. Such slot machines are played in such a manner that, when a player inserts a gaming medium such as a coin or a bill into an insertion slot of a slot machine and operates a spin button, a plurality of symbols are scroll-displayed in a symbol display area which is provided on a front face of a cabinet, and then, the respective symbols automatically stop.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As such slot machines, there exist slot machines in which a payment is paid out in a case where a combination of symbols which are displayed on a winning line is a predetermined combination; in a case where the number of symbols which are displayed in a symbol display area is a predetermined number; or alternatively, in a case where divided symbol images constitute one complete image.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In gaming machines which are represented by such conventional slot machines, a payment is paid out based on the symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area or the routine migrates to another game. Thus, there is a need to increase a display mode of the symbol display area in order to clearly display the contents of payments or a game migration state for a player.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in a case where symbols are displayed in the symbol display area by controlling spinning of spinning reels, only the symbols that are arranged on peripheral faces of the spinning reels are allowed to be displayed, thus making it impossible to increase the symbol display mode.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the present invention has been made in order to solve the conventional problem described above. It is an object of the present invention to provide a gaming machine and a control method of the gaming machine that is capable of diversifying the display mode of symbols by means of the spinning reels.</p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the gaming machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention is provided with: a multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> for individually illuminating the symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> from the back side; and a main CPU (controller) <b>71</b> starting a second game in a case where a pattern of specific symbols serving as a trigger for causing a basic game to migrate to a second game is displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The multiple color backlight <b>5</b> serves to illuminate with plural kinds of colors from the back side of a respective one of the symbols which are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the gaming machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention, in a second game, a predetermined effect image is displayed on the upper image display panel (display) <b>131</b>, thereby executing a tree climbing competition by a panda animation character (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>b</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>c</i>) to be described later).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the main CPU <b>71</b> executes a basic game in which symbols are stop-displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> by stoppage of the spinning reels <b>3</b> (<b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>e</i>) after the symbols have been scroll-displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> by spinning the spinning reels <b>3</b> (<b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>e</i>) (step S<b>1</b> and step S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Next, the main CPU <b>71</b> determines whether or not a pattern of specific symbols have been displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> in step S<b>2</b> (step S<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Herein, the pattern of specific symbols denotes a pattern of symbols serving as a trigger for causing the symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> to migrate from a basic game to a second game (e.g., a pattern in which three specific symbols <b>150</b> to be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>a</i>) are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Next, in a case where the main CPU <b>71</b> determines that a pattern of specific symbols is displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>, based on a result of the determination in step S<b>3</b>, the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from a basic game to a second game and then determines a magnification for a respective one of plural kinds of colors which are produced in a color displayable manner by means of a multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> (step S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Herein, the magnification for a respective one of plural kinds of colors which are produced in the color displayable manner by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> denotes a magnification (for example, five times, three times, two times) which is specified for a respective one of plural kinds of colors (for example, red, blue, green) which are produced in the color displayable manner by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Next, the main CPU <b>71</b> determines the light emitting color exerted by the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> at the back side of a respective one of the specific symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>, from among plural kinds of colors (for example, red, blue, green) which are allowed to be displayed in the color displayable manner by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> (step S<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">When the second game is started (e.g., when a tree climbing competition by a panda animation character is started), the main CPU <b>71</b> then causes the upper image display panel <b>131</b> to display the magnification for a respective one of plural kinds of colors which are produced in the color displayable manner by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b>, the magnification having been determined in step S<b>4</b> (step S<b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The magnification for a respective one of plural kinds of colors which are produced in the color displayable manner by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> is directed to a magnification image <b>153</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> (<i>b</i>) to be described later) which is displayed at five times in red, at three times in blue, or at two times in green, and is displayed on the upper image display panel <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Next, when the started second game completes (e.g., when the tree climbing competition by the panda animation character completes), the main CPU <b>71</b> then controls light emission of the light emitting color by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> at the back side of a respective one of the specific symbols with the color that has been determined in step S<b>5</b> (step S<b>7</b>). In this manner, the specific symbols are illuminated with the color that has been determined in step S<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Next, the CPU <b>71</b> executes payout processing of performing a payout of a number that is obtained by multiplying the magnification that corresponds to the color determined in step S<b>5</b> from among the magnifications for a respective one of the colors that are determined in step S<b>4</b> for a payment that corresponds to a pattern of specific symbols (step S<b>8</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">On the other hand, in a case where the main CPU <b>71</b> determines that the pattern of specific symbols is not displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> in step S<b>3</b>, the main CPU <b>71</b> determines whether or not the symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> form a predetermined combination, and based on a result of the determination, the main CPU <b>71</b> pays out a payment that corresponds to the formed combination of symbols (step S<b>8</b> and step S<b>9</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">As described above, the light emitting color exerted by the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> at the back side of a respective one of the specific symbols is determined from among plural kinds of colors which are produced in the color displayable manner, and then, light emission of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> is controlled with the determined color. Therefore, the illumination color of the specific symbols can be changed by making the light emitting colors of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> different from each other. Accordingly, there can be provided a gaming machine which is capable of diversifying the display mode of symbols by means of spinning reels <b>3</b> (<b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>e</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">[Explanation of Function Flow Diagram]</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The game processing according to the present the first embodiment has been described above. Next, basics function of the gaming machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a view illustrating a function flow of the gaming machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">&#x3c;Coin-Insertion/Start-Check&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">First, the gaming machine <b>1</b> checks whether or not a BET button has been pressed by a player, and subsequently checks whether or not a spin button has been pressed by the player.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">&#x3c;Symbol Determination&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Next, when a player presses a spin button, the gaming machine <b>1</b> extracts the random number values for symbol determination and then stops spinning of the spinning reels <b>3</b> (<b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>e</i>) on which plural kinds of symbols are arranged, thereby determining the symbols to be stop-displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> of the lower image display panel <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">&#x3c;Symbol Display&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Next, the gaming machine <b>1</b> scroll-displays symbols in the symbol display area <b>4</b> by spinning of the spinning reels <b>3</b> (<b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>e</i>) on which plural kinds of symbols are arranged, and then, stop-displays the symbols in the symbol display area <b>4</b> by stoppage of the spinning reels <b>3</b> (<b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>e</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The second game is then started, in a case where a pattern of specific symbols serving as a trigger for causing the routine to migrate from a basic game to a second game is stop-displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> (in a case where three specific symbols <b>150</b> to be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>a</i>) are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">&#x3c;Winning Determination&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">If symbols are stop-displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> by stoppage of the spinning reels <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>e </i>in the basic game, the gaming machine <b>1</b> then determines whether or not a combination of symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> is associated with a winning prize.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Herein, the gaming machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention determines that a combination of symbols of same kind is associated with a winning prize in a case where the number of symbols of same kind, which are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>, is a predetermined number or more (for example, three or more).</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In addition, if a pattern of specific symbols is stop-displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> (for example, a pattern in which three specific symbols <b>150</b> to be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>a</i>) are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>), the routine is caused to migrate from a basic game to a second game (a bonus game) and then the light emitting color exerted by the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> at the back side of a respective one of the specific symbols is determined from among plural kinds of colors (for example, red, blue, green) which are produced in a color displayable manner by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Further, in the second game, the tree climbing competition by the panda animation character (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>b</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>c</i>) to be described later) is executed based on the game data according to a magnification that corresponds to the determined color (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to be described later).</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">&#x3c;Payout&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In a case where the number of symbols of same kind displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> is a predetermined number or more in the basic game, the gaming machine <b>1</b> then awards a privilege according to the number of symbols of same kind to a player.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">For example, when a combination of symbols according to payout of coin is displayed in the basic game (when symbols of same kind are displayed in predetermined number or more in the symbol display area <b>4</b>), the gaming machine <b>1</b> pays out coins or the like of which number is associated with the number of symbols of same kind to a player.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In addition, the gaming machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention starts a second game (a bonus game) when a combination of symbols according to a trigger for causing the routine to migrate from a basic game to the second game is displayed (when three specific symbols <b>150</b> to be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>a</i>) are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">When the second game (the bonus game) then completes, coins or the like of which number is obtained by multiplying a magnification that corresponds to the color determined in the second game for a payment that corresponds to a pattern of specific symbols (e.g., a pattern in which three specific symbols <b>150</b> to be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>a</i>) are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>) are paid out to a player.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">When a combination of symbols related to a jackpot trigger is displayed, the gaming machine <b>1</b> pays out coins in an amount of jackpot to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The jackpot refers to a function which accumulates parts of coins used by players at the respective gaming machines <b>1</b> as the amount of jackpot and which, when the jackpot trigger has been established in any of the gaming machines <b>1</b>, pays out coins of the accumulated amount of jackpot to that gaming machine <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In each game, the gaming machine <b>1</b> calculates the amount (amount for accumulation) to be accumulated to the amount of jackpot and transmits to an external control device. The external control device accumulates to the amount of jackpot the amounts for accumulation transmitted from the respective gaming machines <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Further, in addition to the aforementioned benefits, the gaming machine <b>1</b> is provided with benefits such as a mystery bonus and insurance.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The mystery bonus is a bonus in which a predetermined amount of coins are paid out for winning of a lottery that is intended for the mystery bonus. When the spin button has been pressed, the gaming machine <b>1</b> extracts a random value for mystery bonus and determines whether or not to establish a mystery bonus trigger by lottery.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The insurance is a function provided for a purpose of relieving the player from a situation in which a bonus game (the second game) has not been played for long periods of time. In the embodiment of the present invention, the player can arbitrarily select whether or not to make the insurance effective. Making insurance effective requires a predetermined insurance-purchase amount to be paid in exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In the case where the insurance has been made effective, the gaming machine <b>1</b> starts counting the number of games. The gaming machine <b>1</b> conducts a payout of coins of the amount that is set for the insurance, when the number of counted games has reached a previously determined number of times without a large amount of payout relating to a bonus game (a second game) or the like being conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">&#x3c;Determination of Effects&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The gaming machine <b>1</b> conducts effect processing by means of image display by the upper image display panel (display) <b>131</b> and the lower image display panel (symbol display window) <b>141</b>, by means of output of light with the use of a lamp, or by means of output of a sound with the use of a speaker. The gaming machine <b>1</b> extracts a random value for effect and determines contents of the effects based on the symbols and the like determined by lottery.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">When the second game (the bonus game) is started, the gaming machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention determines a magnification (for example, five times, three times, two times) for a respective one of plural kinds of colors (for example, red, blue, green) which are produced in the color displayable manner by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> and then causes the upper image display panel (display) <b>131</b> to display the determined magnification (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>b</i>) to be described later).</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In addition, while the magnification for a respective one of the colors is displayed on the upper image display panel (display) <b>131</b>, the light emitting color exerted by the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> at the back side of a respective one of the specific symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> (the specific symbols <b>150</b> to be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>a</i>)) is determined from among plural kinds of colors (for example, red, blue, green) which are produced in a color displayable manner by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Then, when the started second game (the bonus game) completes, light emission of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> is controlled with the determined color that are produced in a color displayable manner by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In addition, based on game data (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to be described later) according to the magnification for a respective one of the colors which corresponds to the determined color, the tree climbing competition by the panda animation character is displayed on the upper image display panel (display) <b>131</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>b</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>c</i>) to be described later).</p>

<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The circuit configuration of the gaming machine <b>1</b> has been described above. Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>, the various data tables (table data) are described. The various data tables are stored in the memory card <b>54</b>, and when acquisition processing is started by means of the main CPU <b>71</b>, the tables are stored in the RAM <b>73</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">First, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a light emitting data table will be described. The light emitting color data table specifies: a state of a game to be executed in the gaming machine <b>1</b> relative to specific symbols (specific symbols <b>150</b> to be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>a</i>)); a plurality of identification numbers; and light emitting colors of the multiple color light emitting backlights <b>5</b> that correspond to the identification numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">The light emitting color data table is employed to determine the light emitting colors by means of the multiple color light emitting backlights <b>5</b> in a case where the specific symbols (the specific symbols <b>150</b> to be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>a</i>)) are illuminated from the back side by means of the multiple color light emitting backlights <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Specifically, in the case of a &#x201c;basic game&#x201d;, an identification number &#x201c;0010&#x201d; is specified. In addition, in the case of a &#x201c;second game&#x201d;, identification numbers &#x201c;0011&#x201d;, &#x201c;0012&#x201d;, and &#x201c;0013&#x201d; are specified.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">The light emitting colors exerted by the multiple color light emitting backlights <b>5</b> are specified for the identification numbers, respectively. Specifically, &#x201c;white&#x201d; is specified for the identification number &#x201c;0010&#x201d;: &#x201c;red&#x201d; is specified for &#x201c;0011&#x201d;; &#x201c;blue&#x201d; is specified for &#x201c;0012&#x201d;; and &#x201c;green&#x201d; is specified for &#x201c;0013&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">For example, in the &#x201c;basic game&#x201d;, since the identification number &#x201c;0010&#x201d; is selected, &#x201c;white&#x201d; is determined as the light emitting color. Therefore, in the basic game, the multiple light emitting backlight <b>5</b> emits light in &#x201c;white&#x201d;, and then, illuminates symbols including a specific symbol from the back side.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">In addition, in the case of the &#x201c;second game&#x201d;, any one of the identification numbers &#x201c;0011&#x201d;, &#x201c;0012&#x201d;, and &#x201c;0013&#x201d; is selected. Namely, in the case of the &#x201c;second game&#x201d;, any one of &#x201c;red&#x201d;, &#x201c;blue&#x201d; and &#x201c;green&#x201d; is determined as the light emitting colors.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">For example, in the &#x201c;second game&#x201d;, in a case where the identification number &#x201c;0012&#x201d; has been selected, &#x201c;blue&#x201d; is determined as the light emitting color, and thus, the multiple color light emitting back light <b>5</b> emits light in &#x201c;blue&#x201d;, and then, illuminates specific symbols from the back side.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a magnification data table will be described. The magnification data table specifies: a plurality of identification numbers; light emitting colors of the multiple color light emitting backlights <b>5</b> that correspond to the identification numbers; and magnifications to be determined in the second game.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">The magnification data table is employed to determine the light emitting color of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> at the back side of a respective one of the specific symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> (the specific symbols <b>150</b> to be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>a</i>)) in the second game, thereby indirectly determining a magnification that corresponds to the determined light emitting color.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">The light emitting colors exerted by the multiple light emitting backlight <b>5</b> are specified for the identification numbers, respectively. Specifically, &#x201c;white&#x201d; is specified for the identification number &#x201c;0010&#x201d;; &#x201c;red&#x201d; is specified for the identification number &#x201c;0011&#x201d;; &#x201c;blue&#x201d; is specified for the identification number&#x201c;0012&#x201d;; and &#x201c;green&#x201d; is specified for the identification number &#x201c;0013&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">In addition, for the identification numbers, the magnifications are specified for respective plural kinds of colors which are produced in a color displayable manner by means of the multiple light emitting backlight <b>5</b>. Specifically, &#x201c;five times&#x201d; is specified for &#x201c;red&#x201d;; &#x201c;three times&#x201d; is specified for &#x201c;blue&#x201d;; and &#x201c;two times&#x201d; is specified for &#x201c;green&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">For example, in the second game, with respect to the light emitting color of the multiple color light emitting back light <b>5</b> at the back side of a specific symbol that is displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>, in a case where &#x201c;red&#x201d; has been determined from among plural kinds of colors (red, blue, green) which are produced in the color displayable manner by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b>, the magnification is determined as &#x201c;five times&#x201d; in correspondence with the determined color.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Then, when the second game completes, the number that is obtained by multiplying a magnification which is determined for a payment that corresponds to a pattern of specific symbols (e.g., a pattern in which three specific symbols <b>150</b> to be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>a</i>) are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>) is paid out.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">In this way, in the magnification data table, a plurality of numeric values (magnifications) are associated with specific symbols in accordance with a combination of specific symbols and a plurality of colors of light emitted from the back side.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">Therefore, if the light emitting color of the light emitted by means of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> is determined in the second game, the magnification that is indicated by the light emitting color by means of the multiple light emitting backlight <b>5</b> can be determined in accordance with the magnification data table, based on the identification number of that light emitting color.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">In this way, according to the specific symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> and the light emitting color that is determined in order to illuminate the back side, a payment is given in association with the numeric value (magnification) that is obtained by referring to the magnification data table, so that the contents (magnification) of the payment to be given can be recognized by visually recognizing the color of a respective one of the symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a game data table will be described. The game data table specifies: a plurality of movie data to be executed in a second game; and a game result relative to the movie data.</p>

<p id="p-0310" num="0309">Specifically, as the results of the tree climbing competition to be executed as a second game (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>b</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>c</i>) to be described later), there are specified: movie data &#x201c;A&#x201d; and &#x201c;B&#x201d; indicating that a panda <b>152</b><i>a </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>c</i>) to be described later) is in a first place; movie data &#x201c;C&#x201d; and &#x201c;E&#x201d; indicating that a panda <b>152</b><i>b </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>c</i>) to be described later) is in a first place; and movie data &#x201c;D&#x201d; and &#x201c;F&#x201d; indicating that a panda <b>152</b><i>c </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (<i>c</i>) to be described later) is in a first place.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">For example, in a case where it is determined that the panda <b>152</b><i>a </i>is in the first place as the result of the tree climbing competition by the pandas according to the magnification that corresponds to the determined color in the second game, the movie data &#x201c;A&#x201d; or &#x201c;B&#x201d; is determined at random (by means of random number lottery), and then, the effect image of the tree climbing competition by the pandas, the image corresponding to the determined movie data, is displayed on the upper image display panel <b>131</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0353" num="0352">The main CPU <b>71</b> conducts coin-insertion/start-check processing which is described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> (step S<b>13</b>). In the process, input from the BET switch or the spin switch is checked.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">The main CPU <b>71</b> then conducts symbol lottery processing which is described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (step S<b>14</b>). In the processing, to-be stopped symbols are determined based on the random values for symbol determination.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">Next, the main CPU <b>71</b> conducts mystery bonus lottery processing (step S<b>15</b>). In the processing, lottery determining whether or not to establish a mystery bonus trigger is held. For example, the main CPU <b>71</b> extracts a random value for mystery bonus from the numbers in a range of &#x201c;0 to 99&#x201d;, and establishes the mystery bonus trigger when the extracted random value is &#x201c;0&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">The main CPU <b>71</b> conducts effect contents determination processing (step S<b>16</b>). The main CPU <b>71</b> extracts a random value for effect, and determines any of the effect contents from the preset plurality of effect contents by lottery. For example, based on the contents of effect determined by means of lottery, the upper image display panel <b>131</b> displays the &#x201c;PANDA&#x201d; character image <b>132</b> and the panda movie image <b>133</b>, when a basic game is started (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> (<i>a</i>)).</p>

<p id="p-0358" num="0357">That is, three symbols including the to-be stopped symbol are displayed in the symbol display region <b>4</b>. For example, when the to-be stopped symbol is the symbol associated with the code number of &#x201c;10&#x201d; and it is to be displayed to the upper region, the symbols associated with the respective code numbers of &#x201c;11&#x201d; and &#x201c;12&#x201d; are to be displayed to the respective upper central region, central region and lower region in the symbol display region <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">Next, the main CPU <b>71</b> conducts number-of-payouts determination processing which is described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> (step S<b>18</b>). In this process, the number of payouts is determined based on the number of symbols of same kind that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>, and then, the determined number of payouts is stored in the number-of-payouts storage area that is provided in the RAM <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">The main CPU <b>71</b> then determines whether or not the second game trigger has been established (step S<b>19</b>).

<p id="p-0492" num="0491">With respect to changing the light emitting color, for example, in a case where the light emitting color of symbols including a wild symbol is specified as white (a first color) in a basic game, when the routine migrates to the second game, the light emitting color of a respective one of the wild symbols is changed to red (a second color).</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0492">Next, the main CPU <b>71</b> controls light emission of the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b>, with the light emitting color that is obtained by changing, in step S<b>304</b>, the light emitting color exerted by the multiple color light emitting backlight <b>5</b> at the back side of a respective one of the wild symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> (step S<b>305</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0493">Next, the main CPU <b>71</b> executes a second game in which another spinning reel is spun in a state in which a spinning reel having a wild symbol displayed thereon is stopped, and after a predetermined period of time has elapsed, the spinning reel is stopped, whereby symbols are stop-displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> (step S<b>306</b>, step S<b>307</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0494">Next, the main CPU <b>71</b> determines whether or not a spinning reel other than the one having a wild symbol displayed thereon has been spun a predetermined number of times (whether or not the processing operations in step S<b>306</b> and step S<b>307</b> have been repeated a predetermined number of times), and then, the main CPU <b>71</b> pays out a payment that corresponds to a combination of symbols including the wild symbol, based on a result of the judgment (step S<b>308</b>, step S<b>309</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0495">On the other hand, in a case where the main CPU <b>71</b> determines that a pattern of wild symbols has not been displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> in step S<b>303</b>, the main CPU <b>71</b> determines whether or not the symbols that are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> form a predetermined combination, and then, the main CPU <b>71</b> pays out a payment that corresponds to the combination of the symbols, based on a result of the judgment (step S<b>309</b>, step S<b>310</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0496">After the payment has been paid out, the light emitting color is returned to the illumination color before changed in step S<b>304</b>.

<p id="p-0722" num="0721">Here, &#x201c;rearrangement&#x201d; means to establish arrangement again after the arrangement of the symbols is collapsed. &#x201c;Arrangement&#x201d; means that symbols are in a state to be visually recognizable to an external player.</p>
<p id="p-0723" num="0722">The base game is a game which runs on condition that a game value is bet, and pays a game value depending on an amount of the rearranged symbols <b>501</b>. In other words, the base game is a game which starts on the premise that a game value is consumed. The second game is synonymous with a bonus game and a feature game. The second game in the present embodiment is, as in the second embodiment, a game in which the free game, in which all the symbols displayed on the symbol display areas <b>4</b> become wild symbols in at least one of the spinning reels <b>3</b>, is repeated predetermined times (for example, twice). The free game is a game not on the premise that the game value is consumed.</p>
<p id="p-0724" num="0723">As described above, in the fourth embodiment, a plurality of conditions for the migration to the second game exist at least in the sense of internal processing. Thus, the method of migration to the second game is diversified for the player and the second game sometimes begins without player recognition. Therefore, the entertainment characteristic can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0725" num="0724">The second game in the present embodiment is, as in the second embodiment, a free game in which all the symbols displayed on the symbol display areas <b>4</b> become the wild symbols in at least one of the spinning reels <b>3</b> (hereafter, also called a &#x201c;three continuous wild second game&#x201d;). In the second embodiment, the second game is started on condition that, in the base game, all the symbols become the wild symbols <b>250</b> in any of the spinning reels <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> (<i>a</i>)); a further different condition is added to the condition described above in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0726" num="0725">First, about the symbol lottery processing which has been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a difference from the first embodiment will be described. In the following description, the spinning reels <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>e </i>are also referred to as first to fifth reels.</p>
<p id="p-0727" num="0726">The symbols are determined with equal probability in step S<b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>; but in the present embodiment, random number values are extracted and, at the same time, the symbols to be rearranged are determined with reference to a symbol table for the base game illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, any of code numbers of 00 to 21 is given to symbols which constitute each sequence of symbols of the first to fifth reels. Twenty-two specific ranges divided from a predetermined random number range (for example, 0 to 58) are correlated with each code number.</p>
<p id="p-0728" num="0727">For example, suppose that a randomly selected random number value in the second reel is the range of numerical value of the code of &#x201c;01&#x201d; (i.e., the random number value is 2). In this case, the gaming machine <b>1</b> controls the second reel such that a symbol corresponding to the code number of &#x201c;01&#x201d; is rearranged in the central region. That is, symbols corresponding to the codes of &#x201c;00,&#x201d; &#x201c;01&#x201d; and &#x201c;02&#x201d; are rearranged on the symbol display areas <b>4</b> of the second reel.</p>
<p id="p-0729" num="0728">The code numbers are correlated with weights. The weights indicate the size of the specific ranges. Thus, the symbol with the weight of 0 is not rearranged. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the specific ranges with the weight of 0 are indicated by hyphens. Note that the symbols are controlled not to be rearranged by setting the size of the specific range to 0 no matter what random number value is extracted, but the control is not limited thereto. For example, it is possible to determine the symbols not to be rearranged previously and to repeat the processing of extracting the random number value may be performed when the random number value in the specific ranges of the symbols is extracted. The symbol table for the base game is not limited to a single kind, but a plurality of symbol tables may exist to be changeable depending on the setting of the gaming machine <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0730" num="0729">As described above, the symbol table for the base game is stored in the storage unit of the gaming machine <b>1</b> as one of the plurality of kinds of data (&#x201c;symbol specific value data&#x201d;). In particular, the specific range of the symbol table for the base game is determined depending on the extracted random number value and then the code number of the symbol to be rearranged is determined. That is, the code number and/or the specific range are the symbol specific values with which the symbol is specified.</p>
<p id="p-0731" num="0730">Next, a three continuous wild second game start condition will be described. In the second embodiment, as described in step S<b>303</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the three continuous wild second game is started when the pattern of the wild symbols is displayed; but in the present embodiment, processing of determining start of the second game illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> is executed instead of the processing of step S<b>303</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0732" num="0731">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, in the processing of determining start of the second game, the main CPU <b>71</b> determines whether any of the symbol specific values of the first to fifth reels is first second game start data (S<b>3031</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0733" num="0732">Here, the first second game start data indicates data which satisfies a condition under which the second game is started only with the symbol specific value data. That is, it is meant that the result of the base game indicates the second game start condition. In the case of the present embodiment, the first second game start data is the symbol specific value data which indicates that all the symbols become the wild symbols <b>250</b> on any of the spinning reels <b>3</b> among all the symbol specific value data (hereafter, this mode will be referred to as &#x201c;three continuous wild&#x201d;). In particular, the first second game start data is the data indicating the code number of the central wild symbol among the three continuous wild symbols and/or indicating the specific range, and is stored in the storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0734" num="0733">As described above, in step S<b>3031</b>, the determination is made by comparing the first second game start data stored in the storage unit with the randomly selected symbol specific value data. If the symbol specific value is the first second game start data (S<b>3031</b>: YES), the processing proceeds to step S<b>304</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0735" num="0734">If, on the other hand, the symbol specific value is not the first second game start data (S<b>3031</b>: NO), it is determined whether the second second game start data satisfies the predetermined condition (S<b>3032</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0736" num="0735">Here, the second second game start data is the data acquired randomly based on the randomly selected symbol specific value. In the present embodiment, the second second game start data is the data of the rearranged symbols determined to be rearranged on all the symbol display areas <b>4</b> on the first to fifth reels.</p>
<p id="p-0737" num="0736">In particular, in the determination of step S<b>3032</b>, if the second second game start data, i.e., the rearranged symbols determined to be rearranged indicate that they do not establish a predetermined winning prize, it is determined that the second second game start data satisfies the predetermined condition. In the present embodiment, the predetermined winning prize indicates the winning prize serving as a trigger of the second game; for example, the triggers of the tree climbing competition described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> or the like in the first embodiment, the three continuous wild second game described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> or the like in the second embodiment, and the sugoroku game described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> or the like in the third embodiment. That is, it is determined whether the second second game start data satisfies the predetermined condition based on whether it is the mode which migrates to the second game. Note that the predetermined winning prize is not limited thereto and a part or all of the winning prizes for which payment is paid out may be included in the predetermined winning prize. If the second second game start data does not satisfy the predetermined condition (S<b>3032</b>: NO), the processing proceeds to step S<b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0738" num="0737">If, on the other hand, the second second game start data satisfies the predetermined condition, it is determined whether the second game start condition is established based on the second game start condition data which specifies the second game start condition (S<b>3033</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0739" num="0738">Here, the second game start condition data is one of a plurality of kinds of data stored in the storage unit, and is the data used when randomly selecting whether the second game start condition is established. In the present embodiment, the second game start condition data indicates a table of conditions under which the second game starts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> stored in the storage unit. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, two random number ranges divided from a random number extraction range (for example, 0 to 74) are correlated to the occurrence of the second game and to the losing of the second game.</p>
<p id="p-0740" num="0739">For example, if the randomly selected random number value is &#x201c;1,&#x201d; the random number value is included in the random number range of &#x201c;occurrence,&#x201d; then the second game start condition is established. If the randomly selected random number value is &#x201c;10,&#x201d; the random number value is included in the random number range of &#x201c;losing,&#x201d; then the second game start condition is not established. Each of the random number range is correlated with a weight. The weights indicate the size of the random number ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0741" num="0740">As described above, in step S<b>3033</b>, it is determined, through the random number value extraction, whether the second game start condition is established with reference to the table of conditions under which the second game starts. If the second game start condition is not established (S<b>3033</b>: NO), the processing proceeds to step S<b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0742" num="0741">If, on the other hand, the second game start condition is established (S<b>3033</b>: YES), processing of determining the three continuous wild reel is executed (S<b>3034</b>). In particular, the spinning reel <b>3</b> on which all the symbols become the wild symbols <b>250</b> is determined by the extraction of the random number values with reference to the three continuous wild reel determination table.</p>
<p id="p-0743" num="0742">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, the random number ranges are determined on the three continuous wild reel determination table for each mode of the three continuous wild reels (i.e., the pattern of which of the spinning reels <b>3</b> becomes the three continuous wild), and the three continuous wild reels are determined in the mode of the random number ranges corresponding to the random number value by extracting the random number values. For example, if the random number value is 90, the random number value is included in the random number range of &#x201c;only the second reel is the three continuous wild.&#x201d; Therefore, the second reel is determined to be the reel serving as the three continuous wild. After the three continuous wild reels are determined, the processing proceeds to step S<b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0744" num="0743">As described above, in the present embodiment, the main CPU <b>71</b> executes the processing of determining start of the second game instead of step S<b>303</b> in the second embodiment. If the spinning reels serving as the three continuous wild reels are determined in step S<b>3034</b>, control is made that three wild symbols <b>250</b> are displayed on the symbol display areas <b>4</b> on the spinning reel <b>3</b> in step S<b>306</b>. If there is a spinning reel <b>3</b> which newly becomes in the mode of the three continuous wild in the three continuous wild second game, control is made to keep the state of the three continuous wild also in the spinning reel <b>3</b> in the subsequent three continuous wild second games. The symbol table used for the determination of the rearranged symbol except the three continuous wild reels in the three continuous wild second games is not limited; for example, a symbol table for the second game and a symbol table for the base game may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0745" num="0744">Hereinafter, a gaming machine <b>1</b> according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0746" num="0745">Note that, since the gaming machine <b>1</b> in the fifth embodiment has substantially similar configuration or the like to those of the gaming machine <b>1</b> in the third embodiment (and the first embodiment which the third embodiment cites) of the present invention, description of the similar configurations will sometimes be omitted. The components similar to those of the gaming machine <b>1</b> in the third embodiment (and the first embodiment which the third embodiment cites) are denoted by the same reference numerals. Description of some of the processing will be omitted and the fourth embodiment will be cited.</p>
<p id="p-0747" num="0746">First, an outline of the gaming machine <b>1</b> in the fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described. A gaming machine <b>1</b> in the fifth embodiment is provided with: spinning reels <b>3</b> (<b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>e</i>) or the like as symbol display units on which a plurality of symbols are rearranged; an upper image display panel <b>131</b> as a second game display unit on which the second game is displayed; ROM <b>72</b>, RAM <b>73</b> or the like as storage units in which a plurality of kinds of data containing symbol specific value data used as symbol specific values each of which is correlated with each if a plurality of symbols is stored; and a main CPU <b>71</b> as a controller.</p>
<p id="p-0748" num="0747">The main CPU <b>71</b> executes the following processing:</p>
<p id="p-0749" num="0748">(a1) processing of controlling the spinning reels <b>3</b> so as to rearrange the symbols on the symbol display areas <b>4</b> by randomly selecting the symbol specific values;</p>
<p id="p-0750" num="0749">(a2) processing of rearranging symbols by the processing (a1) and running a base game which establishes a winning prize based on the rearranged symbols;</p>
<p id="p-0751" num="0750">(a3) processing of running the second game on the second game display unit using the result rearrangement of the symbols when a winning prize under a predetermined condition is established in the base game; and</p>
<p id="p-0752" num="0751">(a4) processing of rearranging the symbols, by randomly selecting symbol specific values, such that the result of the rearrangement of the symbols during the running of the second game does not establish a winning prize.</p>
<p id="p-0753" num="0752">Here, &#x201c;rearrangement&#x201d; means to establish arrangement again after the arrangement of the symbols is collapsed. &#x201c;Arrangement&#x201d; means that symbols are in a state to be visually recognizable to an external player.</p>
<p id="p-0754" num="0753">The base game is a game which runs on condition that a game value is bet, and pays a game value depending on an amount of the rearranged symbols <b>501</b>. In other words, the base game is a game which starts on the premise that a game value is consumed. The second game is synonymous with a bonus game and a feature game. The second game in the present embodiment is a sugoroku game in which a piece is moved on a sugoroku board with a plurality of grids based on the number of symbols <b>350</b> of a panda animation character rearranged by the spinning reels <b>3</b> on the upper image display panel <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0755" num="0754">As described above, since the symbols are not rearranged in the mode corresponding to the establishment of the winning prize during the running of the second game, the player can concentrate on playing the second game. Therefore, the entertainment characteristic can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0756" num="0755">First, about the second game processing which has been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, a difference from the third embodiment will be described. In the third embodiment, in step S<b>427</b> if a pattern of symbols (i.e., the predetermined or larger number of same symbols) which is considered as a winning prize in the base game is rearranged, the payment corresponding to the pattern of symbols may be paid out. That is, although the sugoroku game is runnable with a symbol table which is the same as the symbol table for the base game, the present embodiment is configured that the result of rearrangement of the symbols does not establish a winning prize even if the symbol specific values which specify the symbols to be rearranged are selected randomly by using a symbol table for the second game (i.e., symbol specific value data for the second game, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>) which is different from the symbol table for the base game (i.e., the symbol specific value data for the base game).</p>
<p id="p-0757" num="0756">That is, in the present embodiment, the random number values are extracted an, at the same time, symbols to be rearranged are determined with reference to the symbol table for the second game illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> in symbol lottery processing in step S<b>425</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, in the symbol table for the second game, any of code numbers of 00 to 21 is given to the symbols which constitute each sequence of symbols of the first to fifth reels. Twenty-two specific ranges divided from a predetermined random number range (for example, 0 to 71) are correlated with each code number.</p>
<p id="p-0758" num="0757">Suppose that, for example, the randomly selected random number value on the second reel is in a range of numerical value of the code of &#x201c;08&#x201d; of &#x201c;Trigger_A&#x201d; which corresponds to symbols <b>350</b> of a panda animation character (for example, the random number value is 22). In this case, the gaming machine <b>1</b> controls the second reel such that the symbols <b>350</b> of the panda animation character corresponding to the code number of &#x201c;08&#x201d; are rearranged in the central region. That is, symbols corresponding to the codes of &#x201c;07,&#x201d; &#x201c;08&#x201d; and &#x201c;09&#x201d; are rearranged on the symbol display areas <b>4</b> of the second reel.</p>
<p id="p-0759" num="0758">The code numbers are correlated with weights. The weights indicate the size of the specific ranges. Thus, the symbol with the weight of 0 is not rearranged. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, the specific ranges with the weight of 0 are indicated by hyphens. Note that the symbols are controlled not to be rearranged by setting the size of the specific range to 0 no matter what random number value is extracted, but the control is not limited thereto. For example, it is possible to determine the symbols not to be rearranged previously and to repeat the processing of extracting the random number value may be performed when the random number value in the specific ranges of the symbols is extracted. The symbol table for the second game is not limited to a single kind, but a plurality of symbol tables may exist to be changeable depending on the setting of the gaming machine <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0760" num="0759">In the second reel, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, &#x201c;1BAR,&#x201d; &#x201c;2B AR&#x201d; and &#x201c;3BAR&#x201d; have the possibility to be rearranged. However, setting of the symbol arrangement in the sequence of symbols and setting of the weights (i.e., the specific ranges) are made also in other reels so as not to establish of a winning prize which causes a payout. That is, the symbol specific values can be randomly selected such that the predetermined or larger numbers of these symbols are not rearranged.</p>
<p id="p-0761" num="0760">Although not illustrated, the weight (i.e., the size of the specific range) may be 0 about all the symbols of which result of rearrangement causes establishment of a winning prize.</p>
<p id="p-0762" num="0761">Next, processing of ending of the second game processing of the present embodiment will be described. Unlike the third embodiment, the second game processing in the present embodiment is ended under an end condition that the numbers of second games are completed (which corresponds to the determination of step S<b>431</b>) or the piece has been moved to reach a goal point.</p>
<p id="p-0763" num="0762">In other words, the gaming machine in the present embodiment is provided with spinning reels <b>3</b> (<b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>e</i>) or the like as symbol display units on which a plurality of symbols are rearranged, and a main CPU <b>71</b> as a controller. The main CPU <b>71</b> executes:</p>
<p id="p-0764" num="0763">(a1) processing of rearranging the symbols on the symbol display units and running the base game which is capable of establishing a winning prize based on the rearranged symbols;</p>
<p id="p-0765" num="0764">(a2) processing of running a second game (i.e., a sugoroku game) with a plurality of end conditions when a winning prize under a predetermined condition is established in a base game; and</p>
<p id="p-0766" num="0765">(a3) processing of ending this second game when any of the end conditions in the second game is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0767" num="0766">In particular, the second game includes a symbol rearrangement game in which the symbols are rearranged, and a progress game in which payment is made during the progress of a position of an end point based on the game result of the symbol rearrangement game. The time at which the symbol rearrangement game is repeated predetermined times and the time at which the second game reaches the position of the end point are considered as a plurality of end conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0768" num="0767">With reference to the flowchart of the second game processing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, a difference from the second game processing in the third embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0769" num="0768">First, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, the main CPU <b>71</b> executes the same processing as that in the third embodiment in step S<b>421</b> to step S<b>424</b>. Then, the main CPU <b>71</b> executes processing of storing the total number of grids in a storage area in which the number of remaining grid is stored (S<b>4241</b>). In particular, the total number of grids which the goal position but does not include the start position is stored in the storage area as the number of the remaining grids. Then, the same processing as that in the third embodiment is executed in step S<b>425</b> to step S<b>428</b>. The number of movement of the piece is subtracted from the remaining number of grids, and the calculation result is stored in the storage area in which the number of remaining grid is stored. Then, the same processing as that in the third embodiment is executed in step S<b>429</b> to step S<b>431</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0770" num="0769">If the number of the second game becomes 0 (S<b>431</b>: YES) in step S<b>431</b>, the processing proceeds to step S<b>433</b> and the processing which is the same as that in the third embodiment is executed. If, on the other hand, the number of second game is not 0 (S<b>431</b>: NO), it is determined whether the number of the remaining grids stored in the storage area in which the number of remaining grid is stored is 0 or smaller (S<b>432</b>). That is, if the number of the remaining grids is 0 or smaller, it is determined that the piece <b>351</b> has reached the goal point <b>354</b> in this game. Therefore, if the number of the remaining grids is 0 or smaller (S<b>432</b>: YES), the processing proceeds to step S<b>433</b> and the same processing as that in the third embodiment is executed. If, on the other hand, the number of the remaining grids is not 0 or smaller (S<b>432</b>: NO), it is determined that the piece <b>351</b> has not reached the goal point <b>354</b> and then the processing returns to step S<b>423</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0771" num="0770">In conventional gaming machines, there has been a problem that it is difficult to give variety to the game if mechanical spinning reels or video spinning reels, which are changeless, are used for the display of symbols. Therefore, a gaming machine <b>1</b> which is capable of not reducing the entertainment characteristic is provided in another embodiment of the present invention. This gaming machine <b>1</b> is provided with: spinning reels <b>3</b> or the like on which a plurality of symbols are rearranged; an upper image display panel <b>131</b> on which the second game is displayed; ROM <b>72</b>, RAM <b>73</b> or the like in which a plurality of kinds of data containing symbol specific value data used as symbol specific values each of which is correlated with each of a plurality of symbols is stored; and a main CPU <b>71</b> programmed to execute the following processing (a1) to processing (a4) in which:</p>
<p id="p-0772" num="0771">(a1) processing of rearranging the symbols on the symbol display units by randomly selecting the symbol specific values;</p>
<p id="p-0773" num="0772">(a2) processing of rearranging symbols by the processing (a1) and running a base game which establishes a winning prize based on the rearranged symbols;</p>
<p id="p-0774" num="0773">(a3) processing of running the second game on the second game display unit using the result rearrangement of the symbols when a winning prize under a predetermined condition is established in the base game; and</p>
<p id="p-0775" num="0774">(a4) processing of rearranging the symbols, by randomly selecting symbol specific values, such that the result of the rearrangement of the symbols during the running of the second game does not establish a winning prize.</p>
<p id="p-0776" num="0775">While the gaming machine and a control method of the gaming machine in figures of the embodiments of the present invention have been described heretofore, they are merely provided as specific examples and are not intended to limit the present invention in particular. Design modification is possible, if required, for a specific configuration such as means for solving the problem(s). Moreover, the effects described in the embodiment of the present invention are only the most preferable effects generated from the present invention and the effects to be caused by described in the embodiment of the present invention is not limitative thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0777" num="0776">For example, while the foregoing embodiments described a case in which the specific symbols are symbols <b>150</b> or panda animation character symbols <b>350</b> and the symbols that are allowed to be substituted by other symbols are wild symbols <b>250</b>, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0778" num="0777">In addition, if a basic game has been continuously played a predetermined number of times without a second game being played, in a case where a cumulative value of the jackpot amount is large, a random number range may be set so that a probability that specific symbols, i.e., the symbols that are allowed to be substituted by other symbols are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> becomes high in a basic game, or alternatively, in a case where the cumulative value of the jackpot amount is small, the random number range may be set so that the probability that specific symbols, e.g., the symbols that are allowed to be substituted by other symbols are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> becomes low.</p>
<p id="p-0779" num="0778">Further, in a case where a cumulative value of the jackpot amount is large, where a basic game has been continuously played a predetermined number of times without a second game being played a random number range may be set so that the number of times of base game played becomes relatively large. In this case, the random number range can be set in order to save a player from a situation that the second game has not been played for a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0780" num="0779">Furthermore, in a case where insurance is set to be effective, a random number range may be set so that a probability that specific symbols, e.g., the symbols that are allowed to be substituted by other symbols are displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b> becomes high in a basic game. In this case, the random number range can be set in order for a player to actively set insurance to be effective.</p>
<p id="p-0781" num="0780">Still furthermore, in a case where insurance is set to be effective, a random number range may be set so that the number of times of base game played is relatively large. In this case, the random number range can be set in order for a player to actively set insurance to be effective.</p>
<p id="p-0782" num="0781">Yet furthermore, while the foregoing embodiments described a case in which the shading portion <b>6</b> is formed in a rectangular shape, the shading portion is formed in a circular shape so as to thereby emit light to a symbol in a circular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0783" num="0782">Moreover, while the foregoing embodiments described a case in which the partition areas <b>7</b> are formed by means of the respective shading portions <b>6</b> (<b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>d</i>) into partitions, a respective one of which corresponds to one symbol, a plurality of partition areas may be configured so as to emit light to a plurality of symbols while they are provided so as to correspond to a plurality of symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0784" num="0783">Further, while the foregoing embodiments described a case in which a second game according to the first to third embodiments are individually executed, the present invention may be applied in such a manner that: a second game is determined randomly (determined by means of random number lottery), in a case where a pattern of specific symbols <b>150</b> serving as a trigger for causing the routine to migrate from a basic game to the second game has been displayed in the symbol display area <b>4</b>; and then the determined second game is executed. That is, the gaming machine may be configured to be capable of running any of the second games in the embodiments described above and the mode of the trigger of each second game is not restrictive.</p>
<p id="p-0785" num="0784">Although the symbol display units are mechanical spinning reels <b>3</b> in the present embodiment, the symbol display units are not limited thereto. For example, the symbol display units of a video display system on which the symbols are rearranged in a pseudo (i.e., virtual) manner on a display unit, such as a display, may be used.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0786" num="0785">The present invention is very effective in providing a gaming machine and a control method of the gaming machine which is capable of diversifying the display mode of symbols by means of spinning reels.</p>
