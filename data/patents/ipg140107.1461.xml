<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A seal assembly and method of forming a seal assembly provides a seal body having reduced strain during use, thereby increasing service life. The seal body may be formed within certain parameters, such as ranges of height-to-thickness and offset-to-height ratios, which have been found to reduce strain. Additionally or alternatively, the seal body may be modified from an initial configuration to a pre-strained configuration by axially displacing an inner section of the seal with respect to an outer section of the seal, which also reduces strain.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/349,369, filed May 28, 2010.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to seal assemblies used on flexible joints and methods for forming such seal assemblies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Flexible joints are used in a variety of apparatus, such as machines, to connect components that may move relative to one another. One type of flexible joint is a spherical joint, wherein two components are connected for compound movements by a semi-spherical bearing having a journal mounted therein. A pair of annular seal assemblies may be disposed on either side of the journal to protect the joint from debris or damage from the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sealing may be particularly advantageous when the joint is used in certain applications, such as on off-highway machines where the environment may include high levels of dust and debris. A mining truck, for example, may use a four bar link suspension to connect a rear axle to a frame. Spherical joints may be used at the opposite ends of each link to connect to either the frame or an axle housing, and each spherical joint, in turn, may use two seal assemblies to seal the journal. Accordingly, a four bar link suspension may include sixteen seal assemblies, with each seal assembly intended to withstand the potentially large deformations experienced during operation of the typically large-scale mining truck while protecting the journal from the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">During operation, the links may pivot to permit the axle housing to move relative to the frame. Pivoting of the links may cause relative rotational movement about a journal pin of each joint and pivotal movement transverse to the rotational movement. The seal assemblies deform during the transverse, pivotal movement which may curtail the service life of the seal assemblies. Conventional seal assemblies typically include a pair of inner and outer retaining rings with an elastomeric seal extending radially therebetween. Such a seal configuration has not shown a satisfactory service life when exposed to the pivotal movements experienced during operation of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some conventional seal assemblies attempt to reduce the amount of strain experienced during operation by radially swaging the seal. Radial swaging typically involves compressing the outer surface of the seal inwardly to pre-strain the seal. While radial swaging may effectively reduce some seal strain during operation, such strain reduction may be insufficient for certain applications where the seals may experience significant deformation, requires at least one extra step during manufacturing, and is overly costly.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to certain aspects of this disclosure, a seal assembly for sealing between a first component and a second component is provided having an inner surface coupled to the first component and defining a seal assembly axis, the inner surface defining an inner contact face, and an outer surface coupled to the second component, the outer surface defining an outer contact face. A seal body extends between the inner surface and the outer surface, the seal body including a body inner section extending outwardly from the inner surface, a body outer section extending inwardly from the outer surface, and a body center section extending between the body inner section and the body outer section, the seal body defining a generally S-shaped cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, the seal body has an initial configuration in which the inner contact face is spaced from the outer contact face by an initial offset distance I, wherein the initial offset distance I is approximately 3 to 22 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, the seal body defines a height H equal to a radial distance between the inner surface and the outer surface, and a thickness T equal to an average thickness of the body center section, wherein the seal body has a height-to-thickness ratio H/T of approximately 3 to 9.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, the height-to-thickness ratio H/T is approximately 5 to 8.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, the thickness T of the seal body is approximately 6 to 19 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, the offset distance I is approximately 5 to 16 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, a seal assembly for sealing between a first component and a second component includes an inner surface coupled to the first component and defining a seal assembly axis, an outer surface coupled to the second component, and a seal body extending between the inner surface and the outer surface, the seal body including a body inner section extending outwardly from the inner surface, a body outer section extending inwardly from the outer surface, and a body center section extending between the body inner section and the body outer section, the seal body defining a generally S-shaped cross-section. The seal body defines a height H equal to a radial distance between the inner surface and the outer surface, the body inner section includes a reference point A, and the seal body has an initial configuration and an installed configuration, wherein the body inner section is offset axially with respect to the body outer section so that the reference point A is displaced by an offset distance O between the initial configuration and the installed configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, the seal body further has an offset-to-height ratio O/H, wherein the offset-to-height ratio is 0.05 to 0.4.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, the offset-to-height ratio O/H is approximately 0.1 to 0.3.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, the offset-to-height ratio O/H is approximately 0.2.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, a connection joint is provided having a pin coupled to a first component, the pin defining a central axis, a bushing coupled to the pin and defining a center of rotation, and a second component. A seal assembly seals between the first component and the second component and includes an inner surface coupled to the first component, an outer surface coupled to the second component, and a seal body extending between the inner surface and the outer surface, the seal body including a body inner section extending outwardly from the inner surface, a body outer section extending inwardly from the outer surface, and a body center section extending between the body inner section and the body outer section, the seal body defining a generally S-shaped cross-section. The seal body defines a height H equal to a radial distance between the inner surface and the outer surface. The body center section defines a centroid C substantially located at a geometric center point of the body center section, the centroid C being disposed along a angular reference line L that intersects the central axis of the pin, the angular reference line L being disposed at an angle &#x3b1; with respect to the central axis of the pin. The centroid C is further located at a radial distance Y from the central axis of the pin.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, the angle &#x3b1; is approximately 51 to 61 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another aspect of the disclosure that may be combined with any of these aspects, a height-to-radial distance ratio H/Y is approximately 0.4.</p>

An optional operator cab <b>16</b> may be mounted on the front of the frame <b>12</b> above a power system enclosure such as an engine enclosure <b>18</b>. One or more power sources such as turbines, engines, batteries, fuel cells, or capacitors (not shown) may be housed within the engine enclosure <b>18</b> to provide power to a plurality of wheels <b>19</b>, which support the truck on the ground. A rear axle <b>20</b> may be coupled to and rotatable with the wheels <b>19</b>, and may be driven by the power source.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The rear axle <b>20</b> may be carried by an axle housing <b>22</b> suspended from the frame <b>12</b>. Optionally and as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the axle housing <b>22</b> may be coupled to the frame by a four bar link suspension including four links <b>24</b>. Each link <b>24</b> includes a first end pivotally coupled to the frame <b>12</b> and a second end pivotally coupled to the axle housing <b>22</b>. The four bar link suspension permits the rear axle <b>20</b> to move vertically and rotationally (as well as a limited amount of lateral movement) with respect to the frame <b>12</b> while reducing the amount of bending and twisting stresses that may be transmitted to the frame <b>12</b> during operation of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example in one coupling method, a mechanical link, such as a spherical joint, may be coupled to each end of each link <b>24</b>. The spherical joint provided on one end of the link <b>24</b> may join the link <b>24</b> to the frame <b>12</b>, while the spherical joint provided on an opposite end of the link <b>24</b> may join the link <b>24</b> to the axle housing. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the spherical joint <b>26</b> may include a pin <b>28</b> which extends between and is carried by a pair of lateral brackets <b>30</b> (illustrated in phantom lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for clarity) formed in either the frame <b>12</b> or the axle housing <b>22</b>. The joint <b>26</b> further includes a spherical bearing assembly <b>32</b> having an outer raceway <b>34</b> and an inner ball <b>36</b>. The raceway <b>34</b> and ball <b>36</b> have mating spherical bearing surfaces <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, respectively, having a common center of revolution at <b>42</b>. The raceway <b>34</b> may be of a split or two-piece construction to facilitate mounting of the ball <b>36</b>. The raceway <b>34</b> is mounted in a bore <b>44</b> formed in the link <b>24</b>. The raceway <b>34</b> may be retained within the bore <b>44</b> using any conventional means, such as a pair of snap rings <b>46</b> mounted on each side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The ball <b>36</b> has an inner cylindrical bearing surface <b>48</b> which receives the pin and rotatably and reciprocatably mounts the link <b>24</b> for rotational movement about and very limited axial movement along a central axis <b>50</b> of the pin <b>28</b>. The rotational movement may also occur between the mating spherical surfaces <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, however the spherical surfaces normally provide pivotal movement of the link <b>24</b> relative to the brackets <b>30</b> about the center <b>42</b> of the surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A pair of annular seal assemblies <b>52</b> is provided for sealing lubricant within the joint <b>26</b>. Each seal assembly <b>52</b> is mounted between the link <b>24</b> and the pin <b>28</b> on a respective one of the opposite sides of the spherical bearing assembly <b>32</b> to continuously seal the joint <b>26</b> during operation thereof. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each seal assembly <b>52</b> includes an outer mounting ring <b>54</b>, a body <b>56</b>, and an inner mounting ring <b>58</b>. The entire body <b>56</b> may have a unitary construction of a tough, wear resistant, resilient material. For example, the body <b>56</b> may be formed of a suitable elastomer, such as, for example, chloroprene, urethane, nitrile, or natural rubber. The outer and inner mounting rings <b>54</b>, <b>58</b> may be constructed from steel.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The inventors have found seal assembly configurations and a process for forming the seal assembly that significantly reduce strain in the seal body <b>56</b> during use, thereby increasing service life. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> provide enlarged cross-sectional views of an upper half of one seal body <b>56</b>. The seal body <b>56</b> includes a generally cylindrical inner surface <b>70</b> extending around a seal assembly axis <b>72</b> and coupled to the inner mounting ring <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The seal body <b>56</b> also includes a generally cylindrical outer surface <b>74</b> coupled to the outer mounting ring <b>54</b>. The inner surface <b>70</b> includes an inner contact face <b>71</b> and the outer surface <b>74</b> includes an outer contact face <b>75</b>. The inner and outer contact faces <b>71</b>, <b>75</b> are configured to engage portions of the spherical joint <b>26</b> when installed. An annular body inner section <b>76</b> extends outwardly from the inner surface <b>70</b> and an annular body outer section <b>78</b> extends inwardly from the outer surface <b>74</b>. A body center section <b>80</b> extends between the body inner section <b>76</b> and the body outer section <b>78</b>. The seal body <b>56</b> generally has an &#x201c;S&#x201d; shaped configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The S-shaped seal body <b>56</b> may have an initial configuration which allows it to reduce strain during operation while still sufficiently protecting and sealing the spherical joint <b>26</b> from debris. Based on testing and analysis, the inventors have found that the seal body <b>56</b> may be molded in an initial configuration in which the inner contact face <b>71</b> is spaced from the outer contact face <b>75</b> by an initial offset distance &#x201c;I&#x201d;. Modeling and analysis indicates that the initial offset distance &#x201c;I&#x201d; may be approximately 3 to 22 mm. The initial offset distance &#x201c;I&#x201d; may be in either axial direction. That is, the initial offset distance &#x201c;I&#x201d; may be in a negative axial direction (to the right as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) or a positive axial direction (to the left as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). The seal body <b>56</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> has an initial offset distance &#x201c;I&#x201d; in the negative axial direction. In addition to the range of initial offset distances &#x201c;I&#x201d; noted above, the initial offset distance &#x201c;I&#x201d; may be approximately 5 to 16 mm. Still further, the initial offset distance &#x201c;I&#x201d; may be approximately 11 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additionally or alternatively, the seal body <b>56</b> in the initial configuration may have a seal thickness that is sized proportionate to a seal cross-sectional height to reduce strain while maintaining a sufficient seal. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the seal height &#x201c;H&#x201d; is the radial distance between the inner surface <b>70</b> and the outer surface <b>74</b>. Accordingly, the height &#x201c;H&#x201d; is the span across which the seal body <b>56</b> extends between components. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also illustrates a web thickness &#x201c;T&#x201d; of the seal body <b>56</b>. The web thickness &#x201c;T&#x201d; is substantially equal to an average thickness of the body center section <b>80</b>. The inventors have found that seal bodies having a height-to-thickness ratio H/T of approximately 3 to 9 provide sufficient flexibility to permit movement of the spherical joint <b>26</b> while protecting the joint from debris and reducing strain within the seal body <b>56</b>. In some embodiments, the height-to-thickness ratio H/T is approximately 5 to 8.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally or alternatively, the S-shaped seal body <b>56</b> may be pre-strained by modifying it from the initial configuration into an installed configuration that further relieves strain during operation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the seal body <b>56</b> is shown in an initial configuration, which may be the shape in which the body <b>56</b> is initially formed or molded. In the initial configuration of the exemplary embodiment, the inner surface <b>70</b> is disposed at a first axial position along the seal assembly axis <b>72</b> with respect to the outer surface <b>74</b>. The body <b>56</b> may then be placed in a pre-strained configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. In the exemplary pre-strained configuration, the inner surface <b>70</b> is displaced axially to the left with respect to the outer surface <b>74</b>, as may be most readily apparent by comparing the initial position P<b>1</b> of reference point A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) to the offset position P<b>2</b> of reference point A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). The axial distance between positions P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> defines an offset distance &#x201c;O&#x201d;. As shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, movement of the inner surface <b>70</b> to the left as shown is a positive displacement, while movement to the right is a negative displacement. A ratio of the offset distance O to the seal body height H may be selected to reduce strain in the seal body <b>56</b>. More specifically, in certain embodiments the offset-to-height ratio O/H may be approximately 0.05 to 0.4. In other embodiments, the offset-to-height ratio O/H may be approximately 0.1 to 0.3. In further embodiments, the offset-to-height ratio O/H is approximately 0.2. The offset distance O may be in either the positive axial direction (to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) or the negative axial direction (to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The body <b>56</b> may be placed in the pre-strained configuration during assembly of the joint <b>26</b>. More specifically, with the body <b>56</b> in the initial configuration and the outer and inner mounting rings <b>54</b>, <b>58</b> attached, the inner mounting ring <b>58</b> may be moved laterally until it engages an inner surface stop, such as the side of the ball <b>36</b>. The outer ring <b>54</b> may then be slid into engagement with an outer surface stop, such as a counterbore <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) formed in the link <b>24</b>. The counterbore <b>45</b> may be sized for a press fit with the outer ring <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The inventors have identified yet another relationship which yields an S-shaped seal body <b>56</b> having reduced strain during operation. This relationship uses the relative position of the seal body <b>56</b> with respect to the ball center <b>42</b> and the height H of the seal body <b>56</b>. To identify the position of the seal body <b>56</b> relative to the ball center <b>42</b>, an angular reference line &#x201c;L&#x201d; is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> which extends from the ball center <b>42</b> to a centroid &#x201c;C&#x201d; substantially located at a geometric center point of the body center section <b>80</b>. The angular reference line L and the central axis <b>50</b> running through the center <b>42</b> form an angle &#x3b1; generally indicating a position of the seal body <b>56</b> with respect to the center <b>42</b>. Additionally, a radial distance &#x201c;Y&#x201d; of the seal body <b>56</b> is defined as the radial distance from the central axis <b>50</b> to the centroid C. According to certain embodiments, the inventors have found that the angle &#x3b1; should be approximately 51 to 61 degrees and a height-to-radial distance ratio H/Y should be approximately 0.4. In other embodiment, the angle &#x3b1; may be approximately 56 degrees while maintaining the height-to-radial distance ratio H/Y of approximately 0.4. Additionally, the thickness T of the seal body <b>56</b> may also be selected so that the height-to-thickness ratio H/T is approximately 5 to 8, as discussed above.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In general, the seal assemblies disclosed above may be used to protect movable joints. Movable joints may be used to connect components used on various types of apparatus and/or machines. For example, seal assemblies may be used to protect the spherical joints of an off-highway truck. The seal assemblies disclosed herein may provide extended service life during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The following provides details of exemplary embodiments suitable for large truck applications. The exemplary seal bodies may have a height H of approximately 56 mm, a thickness T of approximately 6 to 19 mm, and an offset distance O of approximately 3 to 22 mm in either the positive or negative axial direction. Additionally, the seal bodies may be positioned with respect to a ball center to have an angle &#x3b1; of approximately 56 degrees and a radial distance Y of approximately 130 mm. Accordingly, the exemplary seal bodies fall within the height-to-thickness ratio H/T, the offset-to-height ratio O/H, and the height-to-radial distance ratio and angle &#x3b1; ranges specified above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted on several of the exemplary large truck seal bodies specified above. According to the analysis, large truck seal bodies having the above specifications demonstrated sufficient flexibility, sufficient protection from debris, and reduced strain during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Additionally, various offset distances O were analyzed for a seal body having a height H of approximately 56 mm. The FEA indicated that axial displacement creates pre-strains in the body that better counteract the strains encountered during operation, thereby reducing the resulting stress levels in the body. The analysis indicated that axial displacement of approximately 3 to 22 mm in either axial direction provided advantageous pre-strain.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Seal bodies having multiple different thicknesses T were analyzed with varying offset distances O. More specifically, seal bodies having thicknesses T ranging from approximately 6 to 19 mm were analyzed under offset distances ranging from approximately 3 to 22 mm in either axial direction. It was surprisingly determined that, for each given thickness T, strain was minimized by roughly the same offset distance O. According to the analysis, an offset distance O of approximately 3 to 22 mm was advantageous. In other embodiments, an offset distance O of approximately 5 to 16 mm was advantageous. Still further, an offset distance O of approximately 11 mm provided advantageous strain reduction for each thickness T. Furthermore, strain was generally found to lower as the thickness T was reduced. In large truck applications, it was determined that a thickness T of approximately 10 to 15 mm provided sufficient strain reduction while maintaining sufficient thickness to protect against debris encountered in typical off-road conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">During the FEA, strains were estimated for two extreme seal body conditions. More specifically, models of the seal bodies were analyzed in positive and negative tilting conditions in which the outer surface is rotated approximately 6 degrees above horizontal and the outer surface is rotated approximately 6 degrees below horizontal, respectively. The resulting strains in the seal bodies were then determined and analyzed.</p>
