<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a dual-screen multi-computer control system and its management methods, and in particular, it relates to a multi-computer management device having a regular display screen and a touch-control display screen, and through the touch-control display screen controlling the computers connected to the multi-computer management system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional keyboard-video-mouse (KVM) switches currently on the market are often equipped with a user interface that typically includes a liquid-crystal display (LCD) screen combined with a fixed keyboard. When it is necessary for operations that need two independent LCD display screens, there are two approaches as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">(1) Dividing the original one LCD screen into two smaller independent LCD screens; or</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">(2) Connecting another LCD screen on the side of the original LCD screen such that the other LCD screen can be flipped to use in addition to the original LCD screen.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However there are drawbacks for the either of these approaches described above. For the first approach, the original one LCD screen is divided into two smaller independent LCD screens, which makes the operation window of each of the independently divided LCD screens much smaller, and is more likely to cause visual confusion to the user in operation. For the second approach, the other LCD screen has its own thickness, such that after the interface of the KVM switch having two LCD monitors is received in a rack, it will make the already small rack space more crowded. In addition, this interface arrangement also requires much wider space for flipping the LCD screens and it is not easy to use because the flipped width is much wider than the rack width.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To increase the efficiency of management and possibility of expansion of the user interface operation device of the KVM switch, the inventor after repeated deliberation has introduced the present invention dual-screen multi-computer management system and management method. The present invention provides a touch control display screen as a secondary screen, and displaying on the touch control display screen a simulated input interface to replace conventional fixed keyboard, to provide users with greater viewing area without requiring extra hardware space.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, not only the simulated input interface but also other subjects such as the monitoring and control images of multiple computers, user interface or shortcut bar of the KVM switch, etc., can be displayed on the touch control display screen. Moreover, if more input interfaces are needed to operate more advanced functions of KVM switches in the future, the added input interface can be directly displayed/simulated on the touch control display screen, thereby reduces the design complicity of arranging corresponding hardware buttons and the rack space needed and the costs incurred. Therefore, the touch control display screen provides great expansion flexibility and can be easily adapted to more powerful KVM switches.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a multi-computer management system. The multi-computer management system includes a multi-computer management device, a display module and a touch-control display module, wherein the multi-computer management device is electrically coupled with a plurality of computers. The plurality of computers include a first computer and a second computer, the first computer and the second computer having a first image and a second image respectively. The multi-computer management device receives the first image and the second image. The display module is electrically coupled to the multi-computer management device to receive the first image from the multi-computers management device and display the first image. The touch control display module is electrically coupled to the multi-computer management device to receive the second image from the multi-computers management device and display the second image.

In addition, the first extension mechanism <b>121</b> and the second extension mechanism <b>122</b> may be arranged in parallel or perpendicular to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B</figref>, <b>5</b>C and <b>5</b>D, there are illustrated the various positions of the user interface operation module <b>13</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</figref>, display module <b>131</b> can be moved by the first extension mechanism <b>121</b> to the outside of the rack <b>11</b>, independent of the touch control display module <b>132</b>, and then flipped up/open into a working position, whereas shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the touch control display module <b>132</b> may then be moved by the second extension mechanism <b>122</b> to the outside of the rack <b>11</b> so that it can be used by a user to input instructions, where the touch control display module <b>132</b> can also be further flipped down into a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, there is shown a diagram illustrating one operation mode of the display module <b>131</b> and the touch control display module <b>132</b> of the user interface operation module <b>13</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the user interface operation module <b>13</b> is electrically coupled to the multi-computer management device <b>14</b> (not shown) and the plurality of computers (not shown), where the display module <b>131</b> receives a first image A of a first computer of the plurality of computers through the multi-computer management device <b>14</b> and displays the first image A on its display screen. The display screen of the touch control display module <b>132</b> is divided into a first display area <b>133</b> and a second display area <b>134</b>. The touch control display module <b>132</b> is capable of displaying image representing at least one of the plurality computers. It is noted that the image displayed on the touch control display module <b>132</b> can be the outputted image such as desktop image of the corresponding computer, or simply a represented icon image. In the present embodiment, the touch control display module <b>132</b> receives the first image A of the first computer and a second image B of a second computer of the multiple of computers through the multi-computer management device <b>14</b>, and displays the first image A and the second image B in the first display area <b>133</b>. The touch control display module <b>132</b> also displays a graphical keyboard <b>611</b> and a graphical touch panel <b>612</b> in the second display area <b>134</b>. In addition to the graphical keyboard <b>611</b> and graphical touch panels <b>612</b>, the touch control display module <b>132</b> may also display a graphical touch pad, a graphical control bar, a simulated hand-writing input pad, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, through the graphical keyboard <b>611</b> and/or the graphical touch panel <b>612</b>, a user can enter a first external instruction to control the first computer, where the actual operation image of the first computer (i.e., the first image A) is displayed in the first display area <b>131</b>. Moreover, since the touch control display module <b>132</b> simultaneously displays both the first image A and second image B, the user can monitor the second computer while control the first computer, such that the user may switch to the second computer as the operation computer at any time through the multi-computer management device <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, switching the operation computer to the second computer may be accomplished by inputting a second external instruction, which may be inputted through the graphical keyboard <b>611</b> such as defined hot key, and/or the graphical touch panel <b>612</b>, or simply by touching the second image B displayed. Depending on the user's needs, the touch control display module <b>132</b> may simultaneously display the second image B and a third image C of a third computer of the multiple of computers, a fourth image D of a fourth computer of the multiple of computers, a fifth image E of a fifth computer of the multiple of computers, . . . , or through the switching instruction switch the second image B displayed on the touch control display module <b>132</b> to any one of the third image C, the fourth image D, the fifth image E . . . or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, there is shown a flow chart illustrating the process of the control operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, when the touch control display module <b>132</b> receives an external instruction, first the input position of the external instruction is determined and confirmed (Step <b>62</b>). When the external instruction is recognized to be input from the graphical keyboard <b>611</b> (Result <b>63</b>), the external instruction will be converted into the corresponding key codes (Step <b>631</b>). The corresponding key codes are input to the first computer of the plurality of computers through the multi-computer management device <b>14</b>, in order to control/operate the first computer (Step <b>632</b>). If the external instruction is recognized to be input from the graphical mouse (Result <b>64</b>), the external instruction will be converted to simulate the corresponding movement of a mouse (Step <b>641</b>). The corresponding movements of the mouse are input to the first computer of the plurality of computers through the multi-computer management device <b>14</b>, in order to control/operate the first computer (Step <b>632</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, if the external instruction is recognized as to be input at an image of a computer displayed on the touch control display module <b>132</b> (not the image of the computer currently being controlled displayed on the display module <b>131</b>) (Result <b>65</b>), the multi-computer management device <b>14</b> will switch the computer currently being controlled to the computer corresponding to the computer image displayed at the input position, and then display the image of the switched-to computer on the display module <b>131</b>. For example, when the input position of an external instruction is recognized and confirmed to be at the second image B, the multi-computer management device <b>14</b> will switch the operation computer from the first computer to the second computer, and cause the second image B to be displayed on the display module <b>131</b>, to complete the switching action (Step <b>652</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, in another practical embodiment, when a user wants to switch operation computer, the user may also input an external instruction through the graphical keyboard <b>611</b> or graphical mouse <b>612</b>, such that after steps <b>631</b> or <b>641</b> the external instruction is executed by the multi-computer management device <b>14</b> to switch the current operation computer from the first computer to the second computer and cause the second image B to be displayed on the display module <b>131</b>, to complete the switching action (i.e., to perform the actions of Step <b>652</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is shown a diagram illustrating another operation mode of the display module <b>131</b> and the touch control display module <b>132</b> of the user interface operation module <b>13</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, user interface operation module <b>13</b> is still electrically coupled to the multi-computer management device <b>14</b> (not shown) and the plurality of computers (not shown). Through the multi-computer management device <b>14</b>, the display module <b>131</b> receives and displays a first image A of a first computer of the plurality of computers, and touch control display module <b>132</b> and displays a second icon image B, a third icon image C, a fourth icon image D, a fifth icon image E, and sixth icon image F and a seventh icon image E of the corresponding second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh computers of the plurality of computers, and the touch control display module <b>132</b> further displays a graphical control bar <b>613</b>, to control the multi-computer management device <b>14</b>. It is noted that the icon image displayed on the touch control display module can be the outputted image such as desktop image from the corresponding computer, or simply a represented pattern or picture image representing the corresponding computer.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Through the operation mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a user can simultaneously monitor the second through the seventh computers, and can touch-select any one of the icon images B, C, D, E, F and G to switch the operation computer to the computer corresponding to the selected icon image and cause the display module <b>131</b> to display the image output from the switched-to computer. Alternatively, the user may use the graphical control bar <b>613</b> to input a switching instruction to switch the operation computer, or replace the second through the seventh images B, C, D, E, F and G to the eighth through the thirteen images H, I, J, K, L and M, in order to monitor the status of the eighth through the thirteen computers, or perform further switching actions.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">From the above description it can be seen that the prevent invention replaces the conventional fixed keyboard with a simulated input interface displayed on the touch control display module, thereby not only reduces the trouble of stocking fixed keyboards and spaces occupied by the hardware of the multi-computer management equipment, but also increases the displaying area of the user interface operation module so that more computers may be monitored without interfering with the main display (i.e., the image displayed by the display module) and system operation. In addition, the simulated input interface may be switched as needed between multiple display interface modes or simultaneously displayed to provide more suitable or intuitive input methods and present a more user-friendly operation interface. Furthermore, new display interface or graphical keys can be freely added to the touch control display module, which makes it easily expandable to perform more advanced functions of multi-computer management devices and reduces complexity in system design.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Moreover, when the simulated input interface includes a graphical keyboard, the graphical keyboard can be switched between input methods for languages of different countries, so that when the manufacturer ships its products to a different country, it only needs to switch the input method of the graphical keyboard for the languages of that country through software, thereby completely solving the problems of having to stock or assemble keyboards for different languages.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although examples of the preferred embodiments of the present invention system and method are shown and described in detail above, the present invention is not limited to the specifics described herein. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modification and variations can be made in the system and method of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations that come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
