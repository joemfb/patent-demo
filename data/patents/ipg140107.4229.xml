<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some applications, it would be favourable to be able to prevent circuit boards from abuse. For example, there is a need to protect the information in ICs in any business model where a IC containing device is given to the consumer at a reduced price with the obligation to use that device only with services from a certain provider. One already existing example for this kind of business model is the Simlock Cellphone&#xae; where the device is programmed to be only functioning using the Simcard from a specific provider. Similar need for protection exists for pay-per-use business models or receiving content over mass distributed channels, e.g. Cable and Satellite Pay TV.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the following description, same elements or elements corresponding to each other in terms of functionality are given the same reference numbers, and a repetitive description of same is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a system <b>10</b> comprising a circuit board <b>12</b> having several integrated circuits <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>mounted thereon and comprising a plug portion <b>16</b> at a circumferential portion of the circuit board <b>12</b>. The plug portion <b>16</b> has external electrodes <b>18</b> formed thereon so as to form an external interface to an external device such as the motherboard of a computer, when the circuit board <b>12</b> has been plugged into a respective slot (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Integrated circuits <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>are mounted onto a mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>12</b>. A surface <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the circuit board <b>12</b> being opposed to the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>may, or may not serve as a mounting surface for further integrated circuits (not shown) as well.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Exemplarily, merely two integrated circuits <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as being mounted to the circuit board <b>12</b>. However, additional integrated circuits may be mounted to the circuit board <b>12</b> in a portion of the circuit board <b>12</b> not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, merely integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>may be mounted on the circuit board <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the integrated circuits <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>are shown as packaged chips being directly mounted onto the circuit board <b>12</b> via external contacts <b>20</b>. However, as will be shown in the following embodiments, it is also possible that an integrated circuit is part of a chip module comprising a chip support substrate having one or several chips with an integrated circuit mounted thereon on a first side, and having external contacts for a connection to the circuit board <b>12</b> on an opposing surface. Similarly, although the external contacts <b>20</b> are shown as conductor legs extending from a side surface of the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, same could also be implemented as terminal pads on a mounting surface of the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>defining the footprint thereof and facing the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In particular, the integrated circuits <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>are mounted to the circuit board such that the external electrodes <b>20</b> thereof are electrically connected to contact pads <b>22</b> disposed on the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>12</b>. For example, the external contacts <b>20</b> are soldered to the contact pads <b>22</b>. Alternatively, an electrically conductive adhesive may be used to achieve mechanical and electrical connection between the external contacts <b>20</b> and the contact pads <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The circuit board <b>12</b> comprises conductor lines interconnecting contact pads <b>22</b> and electrodes <b>18</b> so as to form an electrical circuit for performing a certain functionality. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the circuit board <b>12</b> is exemplarily a multi-layer circuit board with conductor lines extending internally thereto, between the layers of the circuit board <b>12</b> and with through holes providing electrical contact between conductor lines, contact pads <b>22</b> and electrodes <b>18</b>, respectively. However, as a precautionary measure only, it is noted that the present invention may also be applied to a circuit board <b>12</b> having conductor lines interconnecting the contact pads <b>22</b> disposed on the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Among the integrated circuits <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>b </i>is, for example, a processor being able of executing computer programs running thereon. The integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>may comprise an encryption unit that participates in the cooperation of the integrated circuits <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>in connection with, for example, a functionality of interest of the circuit board <b>12</b>, such that the functionality is not activateable or is defective, when the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>has been removed. In this regard, the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>should be protected as it is described in the following. Alternatively or additionally, the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>could participate in the desired functionality of the circuit board <b>12</b> such that the data being transmitted via the external contacts <b>20</b> of the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>should be protected from a spy out or a manipulation from outside. Such data could, for example, relate to the duration of usage of the desired functionality of the circuit board <b>12</b> or other pay per use data. In this regard, the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>could also be an integrated circuit that should be protected from outside. In the following, embodiments for providing this protection will be described. It should be noted that the encryption unit for the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>may comprise an asymmetric or a symmetric encryption unit. For example, the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>may implement a RSA or an elliptic curve algorithm. Alternatively, the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>may implement an AES, DES, or Triple-DES algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As a protection means, the system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a cover <b>24</b> connected to the circuit board and covering, for example, at least the external contents <b>20</b> against a manipulation of the data communicated via the external contacts <b>20</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cover <b>24</b> comprises a protective cap <b>26</b> comprising a top surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>and a sidewall <b>26</b><i>b</i>. As shown in the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the protective cap <b>26</b> is affixed to the circuit board, such that the sidewalls <b>26</b><i>b </i>encircle the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>including the external contacts <b>20</b> and the contact pads <b>22</b> of the circuit board <b>12</b> to which they are connected, and such that the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>is enclosed by the protective cap <b>26</b> and the circuit board <b>12</b>, and any external access to the external contacts <b>20</b> is prohibited by the protective cap <b>26</b>. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the protective cap <b>26</b> comprises anchoring pins <b>28</b> extending through respective holes <b>30</b> in the circuit board <b>12</b>, so as to support or provide for the affixation of the protective cap <b>26</b> to the circuit board <b>12</b>. The protective cap <b>26</b> may be affixed to the circuit board such that the protective cap <b>26</b> is electrically isolated from any conductive part of the circuit board <b>12</b> such as from the conductor lines, the contact pads <b>22</b>, and the electrodes <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As will be described in more detail below, the cover <b>24</b> will not necessarily have to be implemented as a protective cap <b>26</b> having anchoring pins <b>28</b>. However, preferably, the cover <b>24</b> is affixed to the circuit board <b>12</b> in an irreversible fashion, i.e. such that it is not possible to remove the cover <b>24</b>, without destroying the circuitry of the circuit board <b>12</b>, including the integrated circuits <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, and the conductor lines interconnecting the contact pads <b>22</b>. Even more preferably, the relationship between the labour necessary to remove the cover <b>24</b> from the circuit board <b>12</b> and the damage to the circuitry of the circuit board <b>12</b> resulting therefrom should be such, that the costs for the removal and the repair exceed a prospective gain associated with the removal due to, for example, the manipulation of the pay per use data communicated to the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>to <b>2</b><i>e</i>, various embodiments for a pair of a hole <b>30</b> and a respective pin <b>28</b> are shown, so as to illustrate how this pair of hole <b>30</b> and anchoring pin <b>28</b> may contribute to, or provide for the &#x201c;irreversible&#x201d; affixation of the protective cap to the circuit board <b>12</b>. In these figures, the circuit board <b>12</b> is exemplarily shown as a two-layer board comprising a first layer <b>31</b><i>a </i>and a second layer <b>31</b><i>b</i>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, hole <b>30</b> is a blind hole extending from mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>to an interface <b>12</b><i>c </i>between layer <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b</i>. Preferably, a cross-section of the anchoring pin <b>28</b> is adapted to a cross-section of hole <b>30</b> such, that the anchoring pin <b>28</b> is stuck in hole <b>30</b>, as illustrated by arrow <b>32</b>. The mechanical removal of anchoring pin <b>28</b> out of hole <b>30</b> should exert sufficient force on the circuit board <b>12</b> to destroy the circuitry of the circuit board <b>12</b>, such as, for example, interrupt conductor lines interconnecting contact pads <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, the length of the blind hole <b>30</b> may be shorter. In accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>the blind hole <b>30</b> extends from mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>to a portion of the first layer <b>31</b><i>a </i>from the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the portion being internal to this layer <b>31</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c </i>it is possible that the anchoring pin <b>28</b> is held in the blind hole <b>30</b> by means of an adhesive <b>34</b>. To this end, for example, adhesive <b>34</b> is filled into the blind hole <b>30</b> before inserting anchoring pin <b>28</b> into blind hole <b>30</b>, whereby some of the adhesive <b>34</b> is eventually displaced from blind hole <b>30</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>. Thereafter, a curing of the adhesive <b>34</b> could take place. For instance, the adhesive is selected such that it hardens by way of an irreversible hardening process in contrast to, for example, solder which is reversibly releasable by heating same to above its melting temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferably, the adhesive <b>34</b> is selected such that same results in a stable mechanical connection between anchoring pin <b>28</b> and circuit board <b>12</b>, so as to guarantee an irreversible anchoring of pin <b>28</b> in hole <b>30</b>. Moreover, adhesive <b>34</b> is preferably selected such that same, in its hardened state, is substantially chemical inert. That is, adhesive <b>34</b> should withstand chemical substances, such as etch solutions and the like, at least to the extent that removing the adhesive <b>34</b> to release anchoring pin <b>28</b> from hole <b>30</b> unavoidably leads to a destruction of the circuitry implemented on circuit board <b>12</b> by, for example, interrupting conductor lines of the circuit board <b>12</b> connecting some of the contact pads <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d</i>, it is also possible that hole <b>30</b> is a blind hole extending from mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>beyond the interface between layers <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>e</i>, hole <b>30</b> could even be a through hole extending from mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>to the opposing surface <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the circuit board <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>f</i>, in other to support the irreversible insertion of the anchoring pin <b>28</b> in hole <b>30</b>, the distal end <b>38</b> of the anchoring pin <b>28</b> could be formed as a portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>having a greater diameter than a remaining proximal portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the anchoring pin <b>28</b>. This could be achieved by, for example, mechanically deforming the distal end <b>36</b> of anchoring pin <b>28</b>. Then, the anchoring pin <b>28</b> is inserted into hole <b>30</b>. The larger diameter portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>enlarges the forces necessary in order to remove anchoring pin <b>28</b> out of hole <b>30</b>, thereby increasing the likelihood that the circuit board <b>12</b> and its circuitry respectively, are destroyed by this removal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>g</i>, it is also possible that, in case of hole <b>30</b> being a through hole, the securing of the anchoring pin <b>28</b> in hole <b>30</b> could be achieved from the opposing surface <b>12</b><i>b </i>by, for example, solder <b>38</b> in case of the anchoring pin <b>28</b> being of metal.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be noted that the material of the protective cap <b>26</b> could be chosen from, for example, metal, ceramic, glass or plastic. In any case, it is preferred that the protective cap shows a high resistance against sawing, rasping, mechanical shocks and the like. Thus, it should be stable, and rigid without being brittle. Moreover, the material should be chemically inert so that a chemical attack on the protective cap <b>26</b> is likely to result in a destruction of the circuitry of the circuit board <b>12</b>. For example, in order to achieve access to manipulate data on external contacts <b>20</b> of integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a</i>, a potential attacker has to remove the protective cap <b>26</b>. However, since the sidewall <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the protective cap is anchored in circuit board <b>12</b>, this removal will unavoidably or will likely lead to a destruction of the circuit board <b>12</b> such that same is rendered useless. For example, in case of the material of the protective cap <b>26</b> being steel or an Al<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3 </sub>ceramic or a highly-filled epoxy resin, a removal of the protective cap <b>26</b> by means of chemical substances such as solvents, acids and bases is not possible without concurrently etching away the conductor lines of the circuit board <b>12</b>, rendering the circuit board <b>12</b> useless. An attempt to mechanically achieve access to the external contacts <b>20</b> for manipulation such as, for example, by means of a polishing or milling attack, leads to tension and shearing stresses on the anchoring surface of the protective cap <b>26</b> within the circuit board material what, in turn, damages the conductor lines of the circuit board <b>12</b><i>a </i>such that, again, the board <b>12</b> becomes useless.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>shows a part of a circuit board <b>12</b> with two exemplarily shown conductor lines <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>extending internally to the circuit board <b>12</b>. A chip module <b>42</b> comprising a chip support <b>44</b> having chips <b>14</b> mounted thereon, is mounted to the circuit board by means of solder connections such as solder bumps <b>46</b>. In particular, external contacts of the chips <b>14</b> are electrically connected to the solder connections <b>46</b> via bond wires <b>48</b> and conductor paths (not shown) of the chip support, thereby connecting the chips <b>14</b> with some of the conductor lines of the circuit board which could be, but not necessarily, the conductor lines <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the circuit board <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, the cover <b>24</b> also comprises a protective cap <b>26</b>, as it was the case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Moreover, the protective cap <b>26</b> also comprises anchoring pins <b>28</b> extending into circuit board <b>12</b>. However, according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, one of the anchoring pins <b>28</b> only partially extends into the circuit board <b>12</b>, whereas the other anchoring pin <b>28</b> solely extends from the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>through the circuit board <b>12</b> to the opposing surface <b>12</b><i>b</i>, where the distal end of this anchoring pin is anchored to the circuit board <b>12</b> by means of solder <b>38</b>. In other words, the circuit board <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>has a through hole for allowing one of the anchoring pins <b>28</b> to pass through the circuit board <b>12</b> to the opposing surface <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and a blind hole extending from the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>to a plane of the circuit board <b>12</b> where one <b>40</b><i>a </i>of the conductor lines laterally extends internally to the circuit board <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>c</i>, an example of the protective cap <b>26</b> is shown in more detail. As shown therein, the incoming pins <b>28</b> could have a round or circular cross-sectional shape. Moreover, the incoming pins <b>28</b> could be an integral part of the protective cap <b>26</b>. For example, the protective cap <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c </i>is made of thin steel and, in its anchored state, protectively surrounds the multi-chip module <b>42</b> from the outside like a cave.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated by the left hand anchoring pin <b>28</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, an anchoring pin may abut to one of the conductor lines to be mechanically and, eventually, electrically connected therewith. The latter connection could be achieved by, for example, an adhesive as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>, or solder. In other words, the circuit board <b>12</b> could have a blind hole at which one of the conductor lines <b>40</b><i>b </i>is exposed, and in to which the anchoring pin <b>28</b> is to be inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should be noted that the sensitivity of the anchoring surface against mechanical stress is adjustable via the geometric parameter of the pin diameter, the distance of the anchoring pin to a respective conductor line as well as material selected. In this regard, a diameter of the anchoring pin is preferably greater than 0.1 times the thickness of the circuit board. A possible arrangement of the holes relative to the conductor lines will be exemplarily discussed in more detail with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">However, prior thereto, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>show an example of a protective cap <b>26</b> comprising anchoring pins <b>28</b> according to which the anchoring pins <b>28</b> have a roughened outer surface or anchoring surface thereby forming hook portions which achieve an increased stability of adhesion to the circuit board <b>12</b>, when inserted into same, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>which shows the state in which the protective cap has been affixed to the circuit board <b>12</b>, the insertion of the anchoring pin <b>28</b> into a hole of the circuit board <b>12</b> will tend to put the hook portions <b>50</b> against the side surface of the anchoring pin <b>28</b>. Nevertheless, the hook portions <b>50</b> will increase the force necessary in order to remove the anchoring pin <b>28</b> out of the circuit board <b>12</b>, preferably such that the removal unavoidably leads to the destruction of the circuit board <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c</i>, it has already been noted that it is preferable that holes <b>30</b> or at least one hole in the circuit board is placed in the vicinity of or even borders on conductor lines of the circuit board, contributing to the circuitry of the circuit board. Examples for such placement are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>shows a hole <b>30</b>. In particular, hole <b>30</b> is shown as being a through hole. However, as already noted with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>to <b>2</b><i>g</i>, hole <b>30</b> may also be a blind hole. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>also shows a conductor line <b>40</b> running internally to the circuit board <b>12</b> in a plane between layers <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b</i>. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, conductor line <b>40</b> is exemplarily connected to a contact pad <b>22</b> arranged on the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>through a via <b>52</b>. The contact pad <b>22</b> may be one to which the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>to be protected or the chip module <b>42</b> including the same, respectively, is mounted and thus is within the protected area within the cover <b>24</b>. However, the contact pad <b>22</b> may also be one of the contact pads <b>22</b> not being covered by cover <b>24</b>. Additionally, the conductor line <b>40</b> may not be connected directly to one of the contact pads, but merely via another conductor line of the circuit board <b>12</b>. In any case, preferably, the conductor line <b>40</b> is part of the circuitry of the circuit board <b>12</b>, such that a certain functionality of this circuit board <b>12</b> does not work if the conductor line <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>is interrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, hole <b>30</b> is placed in the vicinity of conductor line <b>40</b>. The lateral distance d is preferably smaller than 1 mm and even more preferably smaller than 100 &#x3bc;m, so as to guarantee the interruption of conductor line <b>40</b> in case of a removal of the anchoring pin (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>) inserted into hole <b>30</b>. As already noted above, distance d could even vanish, such that hole <b>30</b> borders the conductor line <b>40</b>. In case of an electrically conductive anchoring pin, a conductor line <b>40</b> could even have a discontinuity at the location of the hole <b>30</b>, with the discontinuity being bridged by the anchoring pin inserted into hole <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>shows an example where the circuit board <b>12</b> is a three-layer circuit board composed of three layers <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, and <b>31</b><i>c</i>, wherein a part <b>54</b> of hole <b>30</b> extending through the middle layer <b>31</b><i>b </i>serves as a via connecting a first conductor line <b>40</b><i>a </i>running in a plane between layers <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b</i>, and a conductor line <b>40</b><i>b </i>running in a plane between layers <b>31</b><i>c </i>and <b>31</b><i>b</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>, it is possible that the inner wall <b>56</b> in at least portion <b>54</b> is, covered with a conductive film connecting both conductor lines <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>prior to inserting the anchoring pin (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>) into hole <b>30</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the anchoring pin <b>28</b> may be made of a conductive material and serve as an electrical connection between conductor lines <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>in the inserted state. By this measure, the conductor lines <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>are disconnected in case of the anchoring pin being removed from hole <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the above embodiments, the protective cap had anchoring pins extending into the circuit board for irreversible affixation to the circuit board. In the following, with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>d</i>, embodiments are described where the affixation of the protective cap to the circuit board is achieved by adhesive. In these embodiments no portion of the protective cap extends into the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>shows an arrangement where a single chip module <b>42</b> is mounted to the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>of a circuit board <b>12</b>. As described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, the chip module <b>42</b> comprises a chip support <b>44</b> supporting a chip <b>14</b> to be protected, the chip <b>14</b> being connected to conductor lines (not shown) of the circuit board <b>12</b> via bond wires <b>48</b> and solder connections <b>46</b>. Instead of solder connections <b>46</b>, electrically conductive adhesive may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In order to prohibit any external access to, for example, the bond wires <b>48</b> a cover <b>24</b> covers the whole chip module <b>42</b>, as well as the contact pads (not shown), to which connections <b>46</b> are connected. As in the foregoing examples, cover <b>24</b> comprises a protective cap <b>26</b>. However, no anchoring pin protrudes from the seat area <b>60</b> of cap <b>26</b> at the distal end of the sidewalls <b>26</b><i>b </i>facing circuit board <b>12</b>. Rather, the seat area <b>60</b> of protective cap <b>26</b> abuts to the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>within a closed band thereof surrounding a mounting area of the chip module <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The protective cap <b>26</b> is affixed to the circuit board <b>121</b> by means of adhesive <b>62</b>. As mentioned above with respect to adhesive <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>, adhesive <b>62</b> preferably provides a strong adhesion between cap <b>26</b> and circuit board <b>12</b>, and shows preferably a high resistance towards chemical substances. In particular, the adhesive may be an irreversible hardening adhesive such as an irreversible hardening resin. Additionally, the protective cap <b>26</b> may be affixed to the circuit board such that the protective cap <b>26</b> is electrically isolated from any conductive part of the circuit board <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, it is preferred that conductor lines (not shown) of the circuit board <b>12</b> extending internally to the circuit board <b>12</b> are in the vicinity of the seat area <b>60</b> and, in particular, adhesive <b>62</b>, both in terms of lateral distance and vertical depth. For example, in the case of a multi-layer substrate <b>12</b>, conductor lines crossing seat areas <b>60</b> should run in interfaces between layers of the circuit board <b>12</b> nearest to, or at least near to mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a</i>, rather than opposing surface <b>12</b><i>b</i>, thereby increasing the likelihood of an interruption of these conductor lines in the case of removal of the protective cap <b>26</b> by force.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, the adhesive <b>62</b> is liable to an attack by means of chemical substances from outside. Therefore, in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, a recess <b>64</b> is formed in the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>so as to be overlapped by the seat area <b>60</b> of the protective cap <b>26</b> in the affixed state. The adhesive <b>62</b>, affixing the protective cap <b>26</b> to the circuit board <b>12</b> is provided in the recess <b>64</b>. By this measure, chemical substances for releasing the adhesion connection between the protective cap <b>26</b> and the circuit board <b>12</b> may not easily be brought into contact with adhesive <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In accordance with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c</i>, compared to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, a recess or step <b>66</b> is formed in an edge between an inner surface <b>68</b> of the sidewall <b>26</b><i>b </i>and the seat area or seat surface <b>60</b>, wherein the adhesive <b>62</b> is arranged in this recess <b>66</b> in order to provide for the mechanical connection between the protective cap <b>26</b> and the circuit board <b>12</b>. Similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, the adhesive <b>62</b> arranged in recess <b>66</b> is protected against chemical attacks from outside.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In accordance with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d</i>, the enclosed space between the protective cap <b>26</b> and the circuit board <b>12</b> is almost completely filled with the adhesive <b>62</b>, the adhesive <b>62</b> contacting the inner surface <b>68</b> of sidewall <b>26</b><i>b</i>, the inner surface of ceiling <b>26</b><i>a</i>, as well as the portion of the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>encircled by seat area <b>60</b>, thereby achieving the mechanical connection between the protective cap <b>26</b> and circuit board <b>12</b>, and being, concurrently, protected against chemical attacks from outside.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the embodiments described above, cover <b>24</b> comprised a protective cap made up of, for example, metal, ceramics, glass, or plastic. Differing therefrom, in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>to <b>7</b><i>d</i>, a coverage of the externally accessible connection structure to connect the integrated circuit to be protected, such as the external contact <b>20</b>, the bond wires <b>48</b> and the solder connections <b>46</b>, respectively, is achieved by resin which is, for example, non-conductive. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a </i>shows, for example, an integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>being mounted on a mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>of a circuit board <b>12</b>, wherein the external contacts <b>20</b> of the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>are completely covered by a resin <b>70</b> being disposed on the external contact <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>, the resin <b>70</b> preferably not only completely covers the external contacts <b>20</b>, but also adheres to mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>as well as the outer surface of integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, resin <b>70</b> may be an adhesive and could comply with the abovementioned requirements with respect to a strong adhesion and/or chemical resistance. Resin <b>70</b> prevents an external access to the external contacts <b>20</b> and guarantees that the circuit board <b>12</b> and its circuitry are destroyed upon a forcible removal of the resin <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Differing from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a </i>where the disposal of resin <b>70</b> was restricted to portions through which the external contacts <b>20</b> extended, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b </i>resin <b>70</b> is completely disposed over the whole integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a</i>, including the external contacts <b>20</b>, so as to cover both the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the external contacts <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c </i>shows recesses <b>72</b> formed in the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>12</b>, in an area where resin <b>70</b> adheres to the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a</i>, in order to increase the adhesion force by which resin <b>70</b> is affixed to mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>d </i>shows protrusions <b>74</b> protruding from the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>in the area of the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>where resin <b>70</b> touches or adheres to mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>so as to increase the adhesion force. Of course, it is possible to mix up protrusions <b>74</b> and recesses <b>72</b> in order increase the adhesion force, and/or to use just one protrusion/recess. Of course it is possible to combine the embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>to <b>7</b><i>d </i>with any other of the aforementioned embodiments with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref><i>d</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example, shows a cover <b>24</b> comprising both a protective cap <b>26</b> of, for example, a rigid material as well as a resin <b>70</b> covering the external contacts <b>20</b>, the protective cap <b>26</b> protecting or enclosing both the resin <b>70</b>, as well as integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a</i>. For example, the resin <b>70</b> may take up more than 50% of the space enclosed by the protective cap <b>26</b> and circuit board <b>12</b> and surrounding the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>such that the resin <b>70</b> contacts the protective cap <b>26</b> from inside similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d</i>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the holes in the circuit board <b>12</b> for accommodating the anchoring pins <b>28</b> of the protective cap <b>26</b> abut to the internal conductor lines <b>40</b> of the circuit board <b>12</b>, and the resin <b>70</b> does not completely cover the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a</i>. However, as already described above, these examples may be modified as indicated above.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The above-described embodiments may be modified in various ways. With respect to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref><i>d</i>, for example, it is noted that the protective cap <b>26</b> itself may be completely covered by a stabilizing globe top <b>80</b>, so as to avoid an unintentional destruction of the circuit board due to, for example, hitting the protective cap <b>26</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Moreover, with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it is noted with respect to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref><i>b</i>, that just one anchoring pin may be provided as well. The anchoring pins may also not necessarily have to have an aspect ratio according to which the vertical length, i.e. the length along which the anchoring pin is inserted into the hole, is greater than the greatest lateral extension of the anchoring pin. As it is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for example, the distal end portion of the sidewall <b>26</b><i>b </i>itself may be used as an anchoring portion extending into the circuit board <b>12</b>. To this end, a trench like hole <b>30</b> is formed in the mounting surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>12</b>, the trench like hole encircling the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a </i>including the external contacts <b>20</b> and the respective contact pads <b>22</b>, so as to conform with the circumference or seat area of the sidewall <b>26</b><i>b</i>, and allow an insertion of the distal end portion as an anchoring portion <b>28</b> into hole <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the description of the above embodiments, the description mostly related to the already assembled state. However, according to another embodiment, the aforementioned protective cap comprising the anchoring pin or portion, respectively, has not yet been inserted into the respective hole. Accordingly, the protective cap and circuit board form a kit. During a fabrication or a protection step, the already mounted integrated circuit may be protected by means of the protective cap with eventually, as described above, using adhesive or soldering. Moreover, various ways in order to dispose the aforementioned resin on top of the external contacts and/or the integrated circuit to be protected are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In any case, the above embodiments prevent the portions where a manipulator may access the signals of interest to/from the integrated circuit, on the circuit board against being exposed by means of simple chemical or physical preparation. In particular, the above embodiments protect an integrated circuit or a chip module to the extent that a respective preparative attack for exposing the terminals of the integrated circuit either involves overheads or costs in an unattractive amount that exceeds the value of the computer system, or that such a preparative attack unavoidably leads to the destruction of the board surface, rendering the board useless. Thus, the above embodiments may be used to protect integrated circuit from removal from the circuit board without destroying the board. Thus, a device containing the integrated circuits may be given to a consumer at, for example, a reduced price with the obligation to use that device only with services from a certain provider. For example, the device including one of the above circuit boards could be programmed to be only functional using circuitry from a specific provider residing inside the integrated circuit <b>14</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While the foregoing has been particularly described with reference to particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various other changes in the forms and details may be made without departing from the broader spirit and scope thereof. It is to be understood that various changes may be made in adapting to different embodiments without departing from the broad concept disclosed herein, and comprehended by the claims that follow.</p>
