In the experiment, an ITO film was formed as a transparent conductive film on the second semiconductor layer <b>20</b>. At this time, specimens of the ITO films the thicknesses of which are different were manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the formation of the transparent conductive film, a target of ITO was used and an inert gas atmosphere substantially not including oxygen was used. Immediately after the transparent conductive film is formed, the transparent conductive film is, for example, amorphous. Alternatively, immediately after the transparent conductive film is formed, the transparent conductive film is, for example, in a state where an amorphous portion and a polycrystalline portion are mixed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">After forming the transparent conductive film, the transparent conductive film was processed into a predetermined shape. Then, the residue at the time of the processing was evaluated by observing the level of residue using an optical microscope or a scanning electron microscope.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">After that, the transparent conductive film was subjected to heat treatment. This causes the transparent conductive film to be into a polycrystalline state. The heat treatment was performed under the condition of presence of oxygen. Specifically, the heat treatment was performed in an atmosphere including air.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">By changing the sputtering conditions for formation of the transparent conductive film, the grain diameter in the transparent conductive film after the heat treatment changes. Specifically, in the experiment, electric power used at the time of sputtering was changed when forming the transparent conductive film.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Then, the grain diameter of the transparent conductive film after the heat treatment was measured. Furthermore, after the heat treatment, the contact resistance between the transparent conductive film and the second semiconductor layer <b>20</b> was measured.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref> are microscopic photo images of the transparent conductive film.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref> correspond to first to third specimens SP<b>1</b> to SP<b>3</b>, respectively. For the first to third specimens SP<b>1</b> to SP<b>3</b>, electric power at the time of sputtering is different. As shown in these Figures, the buffer layer <b>6</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>20</b> (GaN layer) are formed sequentially on the sapphire substrate <b>5</b> and a transparent conductive film <b>50</b><i>f </i>is formed further thereon. In these Figures, a grain boundary <b>50</b><i>gb </i>of the transparent conductive film <b>50</b><i>f </i>is shown by an arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, in the first specimen SP<b>1</b>, the intervals between the grain boundaries <b>50</b><i>gb </i>are narrow. The average grain diameter in the first specimen SP<b>1</b> is 134 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, in the second specimen SP<b>2</b>, the intervals between the grain boundaries <b>50</b><i>gb </i>are wider than those in the first specimen SP<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, in the third specimen SP<b>3</b>, the intervals between the grain boundaries <b>50</b><i>gb </i>are wider than those in the second specimen SP<b>2</b>. The average grain diameter in the third specimen SP<b>3</b> is 224 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As described above, it is possible to control the average grain diameter of the transparent conductive film <b>50</b><i>f </i>by the manufacturing conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> are graphs illustrating the characteristics of the semiconductor light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a relationship between a contact resistance R<b>1</b> between the transparent conductive film and the second semiconductor layer <b>20</b> and a grain diameter d of the transparent conductive film. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the contact resistance R<b>1</b> is expressed by relative values. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a relationship between a processability index PA of the transparent conductive film and the grain diameter d of the transparent conductive film. Here, the grain diameter d is an average diameter of a plurality of grains in the transparent conductive film. A case where the processability index PA is 1 corresponds to a case where the residue is hardly observed. Then, the greater the processability index PA, the more the residue exists. It is desirable for the processability index PA to be small. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows a relationship between the processability index PA of the transparent conductive film and a thickness t of the transparent conductive film.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, when the grain diameter d of the transparent conductive film is great, the contact resistance R<b>1</b> is high. When the grain diameter d is small, the contact resistance R<b>1</b> is low. From this result, it is desirable for the grain diameter d to be small from the viewpoint of the contact resistance R<b>1</b>. In particular, when the grain diameter d is 150 nm or less, the effect of reduction in the contact resistance R<b>1</b> becomes remarkable.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, when the grain diameter d of the transparent conductive film is great, the processability index PA is small and the residue is little. When the grain diameter d is small, the processability index PA is great, that is, the residue is much.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the smaller the thickness t of the transparent conductive film, the smaller the processability index PA is, and this is desirable. When the thickness t is great, it is desirable for the grain diameter d to be 150 nm or more from the viewpoint of processability.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, when the thickness t of the transparent conductive film is small, the processability index PA is small and the residue is small. When the thickness t is great, the processability index PA is great, that is, the residue is great. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, when the thickness t is 100 nm or less, the processability index PA is small, and this is desirable. Furthermore, when the thickness t is 50 nm or less, the processability index PA is small, substantially 1, and a state where residue hardly occurs can be obtained. Here, it is difficult to visually inspect the degree of processing of a film having a thickness of 50 nm or less and thus, data of a stacked film in which transparent conductive films having the processability index of 1 and the grain diameter d of 230 nm are stacked is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The configuration of the embodiment is determined based on the characteristics found by the result of the experiment conducted by the inventors of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">That is, the second average grain diameter d<b>2</b> is smaller than the first average grain diameter d<b>1</b> and is 150 nm or less. Thus, a low contact resistance and high processability can be obtained. Specifically, it is desirable for the second average grain diameter d<b>2</b> to be 10 nm or more and 150 nm or less. When the second average grain diameter d<b>2</b> is less than 10 nm, the transmittance is reduced by scattering of light at the grain boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">On the other hand, the first average grain diameter d<b>1</b> is greater than the second average grain diameter d<b>2</b>. Thus, excellent processability can be obtained. Specifically, the first average grain diameter d<b>1</b> is greater than 150 nm and 1 &#x3bc;m or less. When the first average grain diameter d<b>1</b> exceeds 1 &#x3bc;m, for example, distortion is applied to the second conductive layer <b>52</b> and the contact resistance becomes high. In particular, it is desirable for the first average grain diameter d<b>1</b> to be greater than 150 nm and 500 nm or less. This makes it possible to maintain high transmittance in the first conductive layer <b>51</b>. Furthermore, high processability can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">From the result illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the thickness of the second conductive layer <b>52</b> is set to 100 nm or less. It is more desirable for the thickness of the second conductive layer <b>52</b> to be 50 nm or less. Thus, still higher processability can be obtained. It is desirable for the thickness of the second conductive layer <b>52</b> to be 1 nm or more. Thus, a low contact resistance can be obtained. If the thickness of the second conductive layer <b>52</b> is less than 1 nm, there may be a case where the contact resistance becomes high.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">It is desirable for the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>51</b> to be 50 nm or more and 400 nm or less. If the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>51</b> is less than 50 nm, the resistance of the transparent electrode <b>50</b> (the first conductive layer <b>51</b> and the second conductive layer <b>52</b>) becomes too high. If the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>51</b> is greater than 400 nm, for example, the light extraction efficiency becomes easily reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Furthermore, by appropriately setting the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>51</b> and the thickness of the second conductive layer <b>52</b> to the above values, it is possible to reduce the volume resistivity of the transparent electrode <b>50</b> (the first conductive layer <b>51</b> and the second conductive layer <b>52</b>). This allows more excellent electrical characteristics to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the transparent electrode <b>50</b>, a phenomenon of interference of light occurs. Consequently, by adjusting the thickness (and the refractive index) of the transparent electrode <b>50</b>, a high transmittance can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The thickness t of the transparent electrode <b>50</b> is designed so that the transmittance of light emitted to the top surface becomes maximum (reflectance becomes minimum). Hereinafter, the result of a simulation of a relationship between the thickness t, the refractive index, and the reflectance of the transparent electrode <b>50</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph illustrating the characteristics of the semiconductor light emitting device according to the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The horizontal axis of the graph represents the thickness t of the transparent electrode <b>50</b>. The vertical axis represents reflectance Rf. In the graph, the result of simulation of the reflectance Rf when refractive index n of the transparent electrode <b>50</b> is changed within the range of 1.90 to 2.20. In the simulation, the device structure is a stacked structure of a p-type GaN layer, an ITO layer, a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer (refractive index n=1.45), a resin layer (refractive index n=1.4) and the wavelength of light is set to 450 nm. That is, the configuration used in the simulation corresponds to a configuration in which a resin layer is further provided on an insulating layer <b>60</b> (SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer) in a semiconductor light emitting device <b>111</b>, to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the reflectance Rf changes depending on the thickness t and the refractive index n of the transparent electrode <b>50</b>. The refractive index of ITO with a low resistivity is 1.9 or more and 2.0 or less. Consequently, from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when ITO with a low resistivity is used as the transparent electrode <b>50</b>, it is desirable to set the thickness t (sum of the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>51</b> and the thickness of the second conductive layer <b>52</b>) either to more than 150 nm and 200 nm or less, or to 260 nm or more and 330 nm or less. This allows the low reflectance Rf to be obtained. That is, a high transmittance can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">It is desirable to set the thickness of the second conductive layer <b>52</b> either to a value more than 150 nm and 200 nm or less, which is the thickness t of the transparent electrode <b>50</b>, minus the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>51</b>, or to a value of 260 nm or more and 330 nm or less, which is the thickness t of the transparent electrode <b>50</b>, minus the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Thus, the optically excellent characteristics can be further obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">For example, as a first reference example, the configuration can be supposed for the transparent electrode <b>50</b>, in which a stacked film of a film by the vacuum evaporation method and a film by the spray thermal decomposition method is used. This makes a film in which the grain diameters differ from one another to be formed. However, a layer by the vacuum evaporation method has a low density and low thermal durability. Therefore, the first reference example has a practical problem.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As a second reference example, the configuration can be supposed for the transparent electrode <b>50</b>, in which a stacked film of a film by the vacuum evaporation method and a film by the sputtering method is used. At this time also, the layer by the vacuum evaporation has a low density and low thermal durability.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">On the contrary to this, in the embodiment, the first conductive layer <b>51</b> and the second conductive layer <b>52</b> are formed by the sputtering method. Then, by changing the conditions (for example, electric power) at the time of sputtering, the grain diameter of the first conductive layer <b>51</b> is changed into the grain diameter of the second conductive layer <b>52</b>. Therefore, in the embodiment, the density of the film is high and the thermal durability is high. Furthermore, as described above, the grain diameter (the second average grain diameter d<b>2</b>) of the second conductive layer <b>52</b> is determined by the characteristics found by the inventors of the invention. This makes it possible to provide a semiconductor light emitting device having an electrode excellent in the electrical characteristics and processability.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The film forming method of a transparent conductive film such as ITO includes the electron beam evaporation method, the sputtering method, and the sol-gel method. According to the experiment of the inventors, when forming ITO with a low volume resistivity, the film formation by the sputtering method is effective.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">When forming an ITO film by sputtering, it is possible to obtain an amorphous ITO film by setting power low in film formation in an atmosphere substantially not including oxygen. This allows an ITO film excellent in processability to be obtained. However, in the amorphous ITO film, there is a tendency for the contact resistance for the GaN layer to become high. On the contrary, if power is high at the time of film formation, the contact resistance becomes low, however, microcrystals are contained in the film, resulting in the cause of residue. That is, the processability is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the embodiment, by appropriately setting the configuration of the first conductive layer <b>51</b> and the second conductive layer <b>52</b>, highly excellent electrical characteristics and high processability are obtained at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In the embodiment, the second conductive layer <b>52</b> has a function to obtain excellent contact characteristics. When the second average grain diameter d<b>2</b> of the second conductive layer <b>52</b> is small, the area of close adhesion with the second semiconductor layer <b>20</b> becomes large and the resistance is reduced. It is desirable for the second average grain diameter d<b>2</b> to be, for example, 10 nm or more and 50 nm or less. The first conductive layer <b>51</b> has a function to reduce the resistance for energization. It is desirable for the volume resistivity of the first conductive layer <b>51</b> to be low. The greater the first average grain diameter d<b>1</b>, the less the grain boundary scattering becomes. Thus, the conductivity is increased. It is desirable for the first average grain diameter d<b>1</b> of the first conductive layer <b>51</b> to be 300 nm or more and 500 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Hereinafter, an example of a method of manufacturing the semiconductor light emitting device <b>110</b> will be described.

That is, in an Ar atmosphere, an amorphous ITO film including a comparatively large amount of microcrystal is formed. Here, the concentration of oxygen during the period of film formation is adjusted so that the composition of the ITO film becomes oxygen-deficient.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, a second film f<b>2</b>, which forms the first conductive layer <b>51</b>, is formed on the first film f<b>1</b> in an atmosphere of a noble gas by the sputtering method using second electric power smaller than the first electric power (step S<b>120</b>).

<p id="p-0138" num="0137">By subjecting the first film f<b>1</b> and the second film f<b>2</b> to heat treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere, oxygen is taken in the film. This causes a crystal grow.

The first portion <b>51</b><i>p </i>is in contact with the third conductive layer <b>53</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>20</b> between the third conductive layer <b>53</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>20</b>. The second portion <b>51</b><i>q </i>is not covered with the third conductive layer <b>53</b> and covers at least a part of the second conductive layer <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The contact resistance between the first conductive layer <b>51</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>20</b> is higher than the contact resistance between the second conductive layer <b>52</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>20</b>. Thus, the contact resistance at the first portion <b>51</b><i>p </i>of the first conductive layer <b>51</b>, which is in contact with the second semiconductor layer <b>20</b>, is high. Therefore, light emission at the light emitting part <b>30</b> corresponding to the first portion <b>51</b><i>p </i>is suppressed. That is, light emission at the second portion <b>51</b><i>q </i>where the contact resistance is low is promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">That is, light emission at the first portion <b>51</b><i>p </i>corresponding to the third conductive layer <b>53</b> having a lower transmittance (having light shielding or reflecting property) is suppressed. Thus, the light extraction efficiency is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In the semiconductor light emitting device <b>112</b> also, the second conductive layer <b>52</b> includes a polycrystal having the second average grain diameter d<b>2</b> of 150 nm or less, which is smaller than the first average grain diameter d<b>1</b>. This makes it possible to provide a semiconductor light emitting device having an electrode with excellent electrical characteristics and processability.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">According to the embodiment, a semiconductor light emitting device having an electrode excellent in electrical characteristics and processability and a method of manufacturing the same are provided.</p>
