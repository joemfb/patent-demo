<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0128115, filed on Dec. 15, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a semiconductor device fabrication technology, and more particularly, to a method for fabricating a semiconductor device with buried gates (BG).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the size of semiconductor devices becomes smaller, it becomes more difficult for the semiconductor devices to have diverse device properties and fabricate such the semiconductor devices. In particular, under the design rule of 40 nm or less, the semiconductor device reaches the technical limitations in forming a gate structure, a bit line structure, and/or a contact structure. Even if the structure is formed, desired device properties may not be obtained. Therefore, the technology of forming buried gates (BG) by burying gates in a substrate is being developed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating a method for fabricating a conventional semiconductor device including buried gates.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a hard mask pattern <b>12</b> including a pad oxide layer <b>12</b>A and a hard mask polysilicon layer <b>12</b>B stacked therein is formed over a substrate <b>11</b>, and an isolation layer <b>13</b> for defining an active region <b>14</b> is formed using the hard mask pattern <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, after the hard mask pattern <b>12</b> is removed, a cleaning process is performed. Subsequently, a conductive layer <b>15</b> for forming landing plugs is deposited over a groove from which the hard mask pattern <b>12</b> removed, and a planarization process is performed until the surface of the isolation layer <b>13</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, trenches <b>16</b> are formed by selectively etching the conductive layer <b>15</b>, the active region <b>14</b>, and the isolation layer <b>13</b>, and at the same time, landing plugs <b>15</b>A are formed. Buried gates are formed by sequentially forming a gate insulation layer (not shown) on the surface of the trenches <b>16</b>, forming a gate electrode <b>17</b> that fills a portion of each trench <b>16</b>, and a sealing layer <b>18</b> that fills the other portion of each trench <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Subsequently, an inter-layer dielectric layer <b>19</b> is formed over the substrate <b>11</b>, and then storage node contact plugs <b>22</b>, that is in contact with the landing plugs <b>15</b>A by penetrating through the inter-layer dielectric layer <b>19</b>, and bit lines <b>25</b>, that are in contact with the landing plugs <b>15</b>A and are buried in the inter-layer dielectric layer <b>19</b>, are formed. In the drawing, the reference numeral <b>21</b> denotes storage node contact holes, and the reference numeral &#x2018;<b>23</b>&#x2019; denotes a damascene pattern. The reference numeral &#x2018;<b>24</b>&#x2019; denotes bit line spacers, and the reference numeral &#x2018;<b>26</b>&#x2019; denotes a sealing layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, since the landing plugs <b>15</b>A are formed before the bit lines <b>25</b> and the storage node contact plugs <b>22</b> are formed in the conventional semiconductor device, the landing plugs <b>15</b>A may be lost in the course of forming the damascene pattern <b>23</b> and the storage node contact holes <b>21</b>, thus increasing contact resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also, when the storage node contact holes <b>21</b> are formed, the landing plugs <b>15</b>A are lost and thus a short circuit may occur between the storage node contact plugs <b>22</b> of the active region <b>14</b> and other active regions adjacent to the active region <b>14</b> in the longitudinal direction. This occurs because the conductive layer <b>15</b> for forming landing plugs fills the groove from which the hard mask pattern <b>12</b> is removed. To be specific, the height of the landing plugs <b>15</b>A is decided based on the height H<b>1</b> or H<b>2</b> of the isolation layer <b>13</b> protruding from the substrate <b>11</b>, and the isolation layer <b>13</b> protruding from the substrate <b>11</b> is lost during the removal process of the hard mask pattern <b>12</b>, the cleaning process, and the planarization process that are carried out before the landing plugs <b>15</b>A are formed, and as a result, the height of the isolation layer <b>13</b> is decreased (H<b>1</b>&#x2192;H<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The decrease in the height of the landing plugs <b>15</b>A is caused by the loss of the isolation layer <b>13</b> and may be prevented by increasing the thickness of the hard mask pattern <b>12</b> in consideration of the height of the isolation layer <b>13</b> that is lost in the course of forming the conductive layer <b>15</b> for forming landing plugs. However, when the thickness of the hard mask pattern <b>12</b> is increased, the level of the process difficulty in forming isolation trenches for the isolation layer <b>13</b> is increased and at the same time process margin is decreased as well. Moreover, since the height of the active region <b>14</b> including the hard mask pattern <b>12</b> is increased when the isolation trenches are formed, the active region <b>14</b> may lean/slant.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described below in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The present invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. Throughout the disclosure, like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various figures and embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The drawings are not necessarily to scale and in some instances, proportions may have been exaggerated in order to clearly illustrate features of the embodiments. When a first layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; a second layer or &#x201c;on&#x201d; a substrate, it not only refers to a case where the first layer is formed directly on the second layer or the substrate but also a case where a third layer exists between the first layer and the second layer or the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Disclosed hereafter is a method for fabricating a semiconductor device with buried gates that may prevent an increase in contact resistance that results from the loss of landing plugs, prevent a short circuit from occurring between storage node contact plugs and active regions, and prevent active regions from leaning during a process of forming an isolation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2I</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating a method for fabricating a semiconductor device with buried gates in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a hard mask pattern <b>32</b> including a pad oxide layer <b>32</b>A and a hard mask polysilicon layer <b>32</b>B stacked therein is formed over a substrate <b>31</b>. The hard mask polysilicon layer <b>32</b>B substantially functions as an etch barrier, and the pad oxide layer <b>32</b>A enhances the adhesion between the hard mask polysilicon layer <b>32</b>B and the substrate <b>31</b>, e.g., a silicon substrate. Here, when a polysilicon thin film is directly formed over a silicon substrate, peeling of the polysilicon thin film may occur due to poor adhesion between the polysilicon thin film and the silicon substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The hard mask pattern <b>32</b> may be formed to have such a thickness H<b>1</b> that it may protect active regions <b>34</b> from leaning during a subsequent process of forming isolation trenches. Also, the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> may be formed to have such a thickness H<b>1</b> that it may prevent another active region <b>34</b> adjacent to a storage node contact hole in the longitudinal direction of the active region <b>34</b> from being exposed during the subsequent process of forming the storage node contact holes. For example, the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> may be formed to have a thickness H<b>1</b> ranging from approximately 600 &#x212b; to approximately 1500 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Subsequently, isolation trenches for defining the active regions <b>34</b> are formed by using the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> as an etch barrier and etching the substrate <b>31</b>, and then an isolation layer <b>33</b> is formed by filling the isolation trenches with an insulation material.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, trenches <b>35</b> crossing the active regions <b>34</b> and the isolation layer <b>33</b> are simultaneously formed by selectively etching the hard mask pattern <b>32</b>, the active regions <b>34</b>, and the isolation layer <b>33</b>. Here, the trenches <b>35</b> may be formed as a line-type pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Subsequently, a gate insulation layer (not shown) is formed on the surface of the trenches <b>35</b>, and then a gate electrode <b>36</b> filling a portion of each trench <b>35</b> is formed. Here, the gate electrode <b>36</b> may be a metallic layer including a metal layer, a metal oxide layer, a metal nitride layer, and/or a metal silicide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Subsequently, a sealing layer <b>37</b> is formed over the gate electrode <b>36</b> to fill the other portion of each trench <b>35</b>, and then a planarization process is performed until the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Through the above-described process, buried gates including the trenches <b>35</b>, the gate insulation layer (not shown), the gate electrode <b>36</b>, and the sealing layer <b>37</b> may be formed.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, an etch stop layer <b>38</b> is formed over the substrate <b>31</b>. The etch stop layer <b>38</b> protects the understructure from being damaged during a subsequent process of forming storage node contact holes and damascene pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Subsequently, a capping layer <b>39</b> is formed over the etch stop layer <b>38</b>. Although not illustrated in the drawing, after the formation of the capping layer <b>39</b>, a peripheral gate is formed in a peripheral region. Here, the difference between floor levels of the cell region and the peripheral region may be prevented from being caused and stability of the peripheral gate formation process may be increased since the peripheral gate formation process is performed while landing plugs are not formed in the cell region. Here, when the landing plugs are formed in the cell region before the formation of the peripheral gate, the difference between the floor/bottom levels of the cell region and the peripheral region is caused due to the difference of pattern density. Such difference between the cell region and the peripheral region may destabilize operations in the subsequent process.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Subsequently, an inter-layer dielectric layer <b>40</b> is formed over the capping layer <b>39</b>. Here, the inter-layer dielectric layer <b>40</b> may be formed to cover the entire surface of the substrate <b>31</b> and then a planarization process is performed until the upper surface of a peripheral gate (not shown) is exposed. The inter-layer dielectric layer <b>40</b> may be an oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, storage node contact holes <b>41</b> are formed to expose the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> by sequentially etching the inter-layer dielectric layer <b>40</b>, the capping layer <b>39</b>, and the etch stop layer <b>38</b>. Here, since an over-etch process is performed to secure bottom critical dimension (CD) and prevent the occurrence of &#x201c;contact not open&#x201d;, a portion of the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> may be lost.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The storage node contact holes <b>41</b> may be formed in any one shape selected from the group consisting of a hole type, a bar type, and a line type.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, the active regions <b>34</b> are exposed by removing the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> under the storage node contact holes <b>41</b>. Here, when the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> is removed, the pad oxide layer <b>32</b>A and the hard mask polysilicon layer <b>32</b>B may be removed individually to protect adjacent structures from being lost.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">To be specific, the hard mask polysilicon layer <b>32</b>B may be selectively removed through a dry etch process using a gas containing fluorine without damaging an adjacent structure. The pad oxide layer <b>32</b>A may be removed through a dry etch process or a wet etch process. Here, when the pad oxide layer <b>32</b>A is removed through a wet etch process, a protective layer (not shown) may be formed on the sidewalls of each storage node contact hole <b>41</b> in the form of spacers in order to prevent the sidewall of the storage node contact hole <b>41</b> from being deformed by an etch solution.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, storage node contact plugs <b>42</b> having direct contact with the active regions <b>34</b> are formed by filling the extended storage node contact holes <b>41</b>A with a conductive material. The storage node contact plugs <b>42</b> may be formed as a single layer by filling the extended storage node contact holes <b>41</b>A with a silicon layer. Also, the storage node contact plugs <b>42</b> may be formed as a stacked layer by forming a silicon layer to fill a portion of each extended storage node contact hole <b>41</b>A and then filling the other portion of the extended storage node contact hole <b>41</b>A over the silicon layer with a metallic layer. Here, the silicon layer may be formed as a polysilicon layer or an epitaxial silicon (Si) layer through a Selective Epitaxial Growth (SEG) process.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Meanwhile, before the storage node contact plugs <b>42</b> are formed, an impurity may be ion-implanted into the active regions <b>34</b> exposed through the extended storage node contact holes <b>41</b>A in order to decrease the contact resistance between the storage node contact plugs <b>42</b> and the active regions <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Subsequently, a damascene pattern <b>43</b> exposing the remaining hard mask pattern <b>32</b> is formed by selectively etching the inter-layer dielectric layer <b>40</b>, the capping layer <b>39</b>, and the etch stop layer <b>38</b>. Here, as an over-etch process is performed to secure bottom CD and prevent the occurrence of &#x201c;contact not open,&#x201d; a portion of the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> under the damascene pattern <b>43</b> may be lost. The damascene pattern <b>43</b> may be formed as a line pattern that is stretched in a direction crossing the buried gates.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Subsequently, bit line spacers <b>44</b> are formed on both sidewalls of the damascene pattern <b>43</b>. The bit line spacers <b>44</b> may be formed through a series of processes of depositing an insulation layer along the surface of a structure and performing a blanket etch process, such as an etch-back process.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, the active regions <b>34</b> are exposed by removing the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> under the damascene pattern <b>43</b>.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, bit line contact plugs <b>45</b> filling a portion of the damascene pattern <b>43</b> and being in contact with the active regions <b>34</b> are formed. Here, the bit line contact plugs <b>45</b> may be formed of a silicon layer, and the silicon layer includes a polysilicon layer or an epitaxial silicon layer. When the bit line contact plugs <b>45</b> are of a polysilicon layer, the bit line contact plugs <b>45</b> may be formed by depositing a polysilicon layer and performing an etch-back process. When the bit line contact plugs <b>45</b> are of an epitaxial silicon layer, the bit line contact plugs <b>45</b> may be formed by performing a selective epitaxial growth process.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The bit line contact plugs <b>45</b> are formed before the formation of bit lines because the bit lines are typically formed of a metallic layer. To be specific, when the bit lines formed of a metallic layer have direct contact with the active regions <b>34</b>, the metal material originating from the bit lines may diffuse into the substrate <b>31</b> and deteriorate the operation properties of the semiconductor device. Therefore, it is desirable to form the bit line contact plugs <b>45</b> before the bit lines are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>, bit lines <b>46</b> filling a portion of the inside of the extended damascene pattern <b>43</b>A are formed. The bit lines <b>46</b> may be formed of a metallic layer.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The method for fabricating a semiconductor device in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, which is described above, may form the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> to have a low thickness H<b>1</b> in the initial stage of forming the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> because the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> is removed after the storage node contact holes <b>41</b> and the damascene pattern <b>43</b> are formed. Through this method, the active regions <b>34</b> may be protected from leaning during a process of forming the isolation layer <b>33</b>. Also, since the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> is removed after the storage node contact holes <b>41</b> and the damascene pattern <b>43</b>A are formed, an increase in contact resistance resulting from the loss of landing plugs when the storage node contact holes <b>41</b> and the damascene pattern <b>43</b> are formed may be prevented. Also, since the hard mask pattern <b>32</b> remains under the storage node contact holes <b>41</b> when the storage node contact holes <b>41</b> are formed, a short circuit may be prevented from occurring between the adjacent active regions <b>34</b> and the storage node contact plugs <b>42</b>.</p>
