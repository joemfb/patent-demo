<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A low-cost hurricane and earthquake resistant house structure includes a rounded shape external wall constructed of a plurality of circumferentially adjacent wall segments, each secured to an adjacent structural vertical stud secured to the ground via a shock absorber. Each wall segment includes a plurality of blocks located and secured on top of one another. A foundation groove receives at least a portion of a lowest block of each wall segment therein, and spaced from inside foundation walls. An aerodynamic roof is secured to the vertical studs, and a floor is mounted on shock absorbers on the ground and connected to the wall with a flexible material.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to buildings and is more particularly concerned with a house or building with a low-cost hurricane and earthquake resistant structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is well known in the art of buildings to have the structure, or part thereof, made to be hurricane and/or earthquake resistant. However, these structures are generally so costly than only commercial or office buildings can afford to incorporate them, or even luxury villas or the like. None of these house structures are capable of being built locally directly in devastated areas where access to inexperienced labor and minimum use of expensive machining is a reality.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When nature disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and the like, happen, it is not rare to see that a significant amount of typical houses or homes are at least partially, if not totally, destroyed since the owner of these houses cannot afford to include special structures to make them resistant to the nature disasters.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved low-cost hurricane and earthquake resistant house.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore a general object of the present invention to provide an improved low-cost hurricane and earthquake resistant house.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An advantage of the house of the present invention is that it has an aerodynamic shape that makes the air resistance, drag and lift forces will be drastically lower compared to the other more conventional shapes of the house construction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another advantage of the house of the present invention is that it has a structure with lateral and frontal stability to strong winds because the circular wall is freely inserted in the ground with the support of the groove and rigid poles.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further advantage of the house of the present invention is that it has a vertical stability of the structure during hurricane because of the weight of the structure and aerodynamic shape of the roof and the in ground shock absorbers of the poles.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another advantage of the house of the present invention is that it has a good resistance to an earthquake because of the fact that the outside wall is inserted in the ground with the help of a concrete groove and shock absorbing poles rather than being anchored. This earthquake resistance is enhanced because the floor and the wall are structurally independent from one another and will produce independent movement on the respective shock absorbers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another advantage of the house of the present invention is that it has technologies that enable a fast reliable construction, typically directly in devastated areas, at low cost of materials, minimum use of machining tools and unskilled labor. The materials typically used for the fabrication of wall blocks are preferably locally found in nature for low cost and improved strength and resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet a further advantage of the house of the present invention is that it has an aerodynamic roof shape that minimizes the effect of winds, especially high velocity winds, on the structure of the house. Such an aerodynamic roof, when being concave, further allows the collection of rain water for recycling as well as an opening for air intake and exhaust from the house.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an aspect of the present invention there is provided a low-cost hurricane and earthquake resistant house, said house comprising:

        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">the wall being partially located inside a foundation groove.</li>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">With reference to the annexed drawings, in most of which many parts have voluntarily been omitted for clarity purposes, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be herein described for indicative purpose and by no means as of limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, there is schematically shown an embodiment <b>10</b> of a low-cost hurricane and earthquake resistant house in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">The structure of the house <b>10</b> includes a round shaped aerodynamic, typically circular (or elliptical) wall <b>12</b> (when seen from the top) formed of a plurality of vertical wall segments <b>13</b> located adjacent one another. Elongated rigid vertical structural studs <b>14</b> (poles or posts) or the like, encapsulated in the wall <b>12</b> and supported at their base with respective shock absorbers <b>16</b> (of any type usually known in the art) at least partially inserted in the ground <b>18</b> act as a support for the wall <b>12</b> of the house <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Typically, there is a support stud <b>14</b> between adjacent wall segments <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">A foundation structure <b>20</b> in a form of circular (or elliptical) pattern <b>22</b>, typically grooved, acts as a support for the wall <b>12</b> of the house <b>10</b>. A gap between the internal and external surfaces of the wall <b>12</b> and the corresponding facing internal surface of the groove <b>22</b>, or pattern, is required to prevent any direct external environmental stress onto the wall structure <b>12</b>, especially during earthquakes and the like natural disasters, and allow the free support of the wall structure <b>12</b>. Obviously, this gap could be filled with any soft insulating and/or isolating material or the like which would not transmit any load from the foundation structure <b>20</b> to the wall <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">Similarly, the studs <b>14</b>, to reach the corresponding shock absorbers <b>16</b>, typically freely extend through the foundation structure <b>20</b> without directly contacting the structure <b>20</b> to allow for relative movement there between in case of earthquakes or the like natural disaster and thermal expansion and contraction differentials. Obviously, the space between the studs <b>14</b> and the foundation structure <b>20</b> could be filled with a relatively flexible material insert <b>22</b>&#x2032; or the like that essentially closes the space while keeping the two structurally disconnected from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">Fiber-formed (or the like) flexible container <b>23</b>, or outer-shell, with poured concrete-type settable filler and horizontal <b>26</b> and vertical <b>28</b> elongated members or rods (at least one of each, preferably two of each one) extending at least partially there through acts as a construction block <b>24</b>, of a typically quadrilateral prism shape, preferably a rectangular right prism shape (as a conventional brick) which is held together (with another upper and/or lower block <b>24</b>) by cement <b>30</b> and reinforced by clamping joints <b>32</b> between elongated members <b>26</b> and the adjacent studs <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. The blocks <b>24</b>, one example being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, are preferably made on-site to form successive rows, starting with the lowest row, as bricks in a brick wall. When the radius of the wall structure <b>12</b> is relatively small, the blocks <b>24</b>&#x2032; may have a generally trapezoidal right prism shape (as a segment of an annulus), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, to ensure a substantially constant outside-to-inside spacing between adjacent lateral blocks <b>24</b>&#x2032;. To ensure the proper shape of the block <b>24</b>, <b>24</b>&#x2032;, the flexible container <b>23</b>, <b>23</b>&#x2032; can be formed inside a rigid container <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>&#x2032; acting as a forming structure during setting of the concrete inside the flexible outer-shell <b>23</b>, <b>23</b>&#x2032;, before being extracted therefrom. Each wall segment <b>13</b> is formed of a plurality of blocks <b>24</b> located and secured on top of one another. To this end, the upper portion of the vertical elongated members <b>28</b> of a lower block <b>24</b> typically slightly fit into a lower portion of the corresponding vertical member <b>28</b> of the superjacent block <b>24</b> which do not protrude downwardly there from.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">In order to have a stronger structure, each block <b>24</b> may contain reinforcing material, of the same material than the outer-shell <b>23</b> or any other similar material, as a block composite fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">Although not specifically shown, the clamping joints <b>32</b> and spaces between construction blocks <b>24</b> are typically filled with concrete settable material or the like to enhance the strength, durability and aesthetic of the wall <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">An aerodynamic roof <b>34</b> is built on specific supports (not shown) inserted on the upper ends of the studs <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">Vegetation like grass <b>35</b> or the like or photovoltaic cells <b>37</b> can be placed on the surface of the roof <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) to absorb the energy of the sun and produce vegetation or electricity for the house <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">Windows <b>36</b>, preferably curved or multi-planar or segmented (although not necessarily required), are placed to locally conform to the outside shaped surface <b>38</b> of the wall <b>12</b> in order to provide water proof contact and aerodynamic quality of the overall external wall <b>12</b>. The also preferably curved, and preferably sliding (could also be hinged), doors <b>38</b> are also placed to locally conform to the outside surface <b>38</b> of the wall <b>12</b> in order to provide water proof contact and aerodynamic quality to outside wall <b>12</b> of the house <b>10</b>. Although not shown, similar windows and doors could be used on the inside of the wall <b>12</b> of the house <b>10</b> for enhanced security.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">The floor <b>40</b> is typically supported above the ground <b>18</b> with shock absorbing mechanisms <b>42</b> or the like, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, such that the floor <b>40</b> is not directly anchored to the ground <b>18</b> or to the wall <b>12</b>. For an increased stability, the outer periphery of the floor <b>40</b> is typically connected to an outer floor support foundation <b>21</b> located adjacent and inside of the foundation structure <b>20</b> supporting the wall structure <b>12</b>, and spaced therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">The gap between the edges of the floor <b>40</b> and inside surface <b>44</b> of the wall <b>12</b> is typically filled with flexible water proof material structure <b>46</b>, such as membranes or the like, to prevent water and humidity from flowing there through, and prevent any to access there through to insects, small animals and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">Inside separate walls (not shown) are typically suspended from the ceiling <b>34</b> or erected from the floor <b>40</b> to divide inside space of the house <b>10</b> into separate rooms. Similarly, sanitary and kitchen equipment (not shown) can be chosen and installed from a variety of equipment available or could be custom build.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">Ventilation (not shown) could be provided by wall vents, roof vents or ground vents (not shown). The design and construction of these vents shall not decrease the aerodynamic quality of the house <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">The shock absorbers <b>16</b>, and the shock absorbing mechanism <b>42</b>, are made of a filer material that relatively rigid, not destructible over time and/or weather conditions (no fatigue and/or deformation over time, over the life expectancy of the house <b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The above technology elements could be used for a small aerodynamic circular one wall house (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or large aerodynamic circular multi walls house in accordance with the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is shown one (embodiment <b>10</b>&#x2032;) of many examples of a large house with two circular walls, one inside wall <b>12</b>&#x2032; and one outside wall <b>12</b> thus creating doughnut (circular or elliptical annular) shaped roof <b>34</b>&#x2032; and house <b>10</b>&#x2032; with a large inside open yard <b>48</b>. In such a house <b>10</b>&#x2032;, same conforming curved windows <b>36</b>&#x2032; and doors (not shown) could be used on the inside wall <b>12</b>&#x2032; of the house <b>10</b>&#x2032; for enhanced security.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">Another example of an embodiment <b>10</b>&#x2033; of an elliptical house of the present invention with an aerodynamic roof <b>34</b>&#x2033; is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The concave roof <b>34</b>&#x2033; is typically terminated at its bottom, or lowest (closest to the floor) region, typically the central region thereof, with a central drain <b>50</b> that, in addition to enable collecting of water in a water reservoir <b>54</b> and the like, preferably located outside (as indicated by the broken pipe) of the house perimeter below the ground level with proper water pumping mechanism and water outlet (not shown), via a drain pipe <b>52</b>. The drain <b>50</b> is typically supported by an internal wall structure <b>56</b> (or drain pipe structure) that also provides an additional support for the roof <b>34</b>&#x2033;, as well as a proper location for any additional convenience (not shown) piping (venting and plumbing) as air intake, air exhaust and air conditioning there through, and electrical wiring and the like. The internal wall structure <b>56</b> typically includes the same components connected thereto as the external wall structure <b>12</b>, namely an inner foundation structure <b>20</b>&#x2032; with corresponding structural vertical studs <b>14</b>&#x2032; and shock absorbers <b>16</b>&#x2032;, an inner floor support foundation <b>21</b>&#x2032;, flexible material insert <b>22</b>&#x2032;, and flexible water proof material structure <b>46</b>&#x2032; at the inner periphery of the floor <b>40</b>.</p>
