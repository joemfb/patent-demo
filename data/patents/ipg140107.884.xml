<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A lip substrate applicator kit includes upper and lower applicators adapted to facilitate the application of lip substrates onto the upper and lower lips of a wearer. The lip substrates typically includes an image layer featuring one or more of a variety of colors, graphic designs and text elements. Edges of the applicators may be pre-cut to ensure that the applied substrate presents a symmetrical and clean appearance at the vermillion borders of the wearer's lips. Each applicator includes an adhesive layer, a peel layer and a guide layer. The guide layer has a guide pattern configured to aid a user in trimming excess portions from the applicator generally along a curved pathway, so that the substrate may be customized to fit the lips of the wearer. The kit may include a die cut applicator sheet from which the upper and lower applicators are die cut, suspended and detachable.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/296,507 filed Nov. 15, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/476,197, filed on Apr. 15, 2011, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/529,790, filed on Aug. 31, 2011, the contents of each of which are incorporated by this reference in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to kits and methods for securing articles to human lips, particularly where such articles are intended to perform a cosmetic or decorative role, or to deliver substances to the lips over an extended period of time.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lip cosmetics have been used since ancient times. They are commonly used to accentuate the natural color of the lips, thereby increasing the sexual attractiveness of the wearer. They may also be used to provide a more fashionable, prominent or eccentric appearance. Conventional lip cosmetics typically take the form of oils, waxes and emollients, and generally present only a single, solid color. The average wearer does not have the time, budget or expertise to use conventional lip cosmetics to produce the appearance of complex colorations or graphic designs. Moreover, conventional lip cosmetics such as lipsticks can rapidly wear or smear due to common activities such as eating, drinking and kissing. What is needed is a cost-effective and easy-to-apply lip cosmetic application means which can provide lips with a limitless set of colors and graphic patterns, ensure a longer-lasting and more durable result, and present clean, symmetrical edges that follow the natural borders of the wearer's lips.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One or more deficiencies of the prior art are addressed by a lip substrate applicator kit, which typically includes an upper applicator and a lower applicator. The upper and lower applicators may each be die cut, suspended and detachable from a single die cut applicator sheet. In certain embodiments, a single die cut applicator sheet may include multiple upper and lower applicators.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An upper applicator may be flexible and have an upper edge and an opposing upper waterline edge, both of which may extend between an upper right end and an upper left end. The upper edge may be generally arcuate, substantially symmetrical about an upper axis and have a concave portion substantially symmetrical about the upper axis. The upper waterline edge may be generally arcuate in the same direction as the upper edge</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The upper applicator may include an upper lip substrate, an upper adhesive layer an upper peel layer and an upper guide layer. The upper lip substrate may have an upper first face and an upper second face. The upper adhesive layer may be disposed generally at the upper first face. The upper peel layer may be peelably affixed to the upper adhesive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The upper guide layer may have an upper bond face and an upper guide face. The upper bond face may be releasably bonded to the upper second face such that the upper guide layer is releasable from the upper second face upon application of water to the upper guide layer. The upper guide face may include an upper guide pattern arranged as a visual reference to aid a user in trimming excess portions from the upper applicator generally along an upper pathway. The upper pathway may be substantially symmetrical about the upper axis and curved toward the upper edge.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A lower applicator may be flexible and have a lower edge and a lower waterline edge, each of which extends between a lower right end and a lower left end. The lower edge may be generally arcuate and substantially symmetrical about a lower axis. The lower waterline edge may be generally arcuate in the same direction as the lower edge.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The lower applicator may include a lower lip substrate, a lower adhesive layer, a lower peel layer and a lower guide layer. The lower lip substrate may have a lower first face and a lower second face. The lower adhesive layer may be disposed generally at the lower first face. The lower peel layer may be peelably affixed to the lower adhesive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The lower guide layer may have a lower bond face and a lower guide face. The lower bond face may be releasably bonded to the lower second face such that the lower guide layer is releasable from the lower second face upon application of water to the lower guide layer. The lower guide face may include a lower guide pattern arranged as a visual reference to aid a user in trimming excess portions from the lower applicator generally along a lower pathway. The lower pathway may be substantially symmetrical about the lower axis and curved toward the lower edge.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The lip substrates may include image layers which present any number of colors, patterns, graphic designs and text elements. In certain embodiments, the adhesive layers may include glitter particles, and at least portions of the respective lip substrate may be substantially transparent, thereby allowing the glitter particles to be viewable therethrough. In further such embodiments, the image layers may include a mix of opaque portions and transparent portions, thereby presenting more intricate graphic designs with an interspersed glitter effect.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to the drawings, like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding features throughout the several views. Embodiments of a lip substrate applicator kit are shown generally at <b>20</b>, and may comprise one or both of an upper applicator <b>22</b> and a lower applicator <b>52</b>. References to &#x201c;left&#x201d; and &#x201c;right&#x201d; may generally correspond to the perspective of a wearer who is applying the lip substrates to themselves, or to whom the lip substrates are being applied.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> for illustration, the upper applicator <b>22</b> is flexible and has an upper edge <b>24</b> extending between an upper right end <b>26</b> and an upper left end <b>28</b>. The upper edge <b>24</b> may be generally arcuate and substantially symmetrical about an upper axis <b>30</b>. An upper applicator <b>22</b> typically includes an upper lip substrate <b>32</b>, an upper adhesive layer <b>38</b>, an upper peel layer <b>40</b>, and an upper guide layer <b>42</b>. The upper lip substrate <b>32</b> may have an upper first face <b>34</b> and an upper second face <b>36</b>. The upper adhesive layer <b>38</b> may be disposed generally at the upper first face <b>34</b>. The upper peel layer <b>40</b> may be peelably affixed to the upper adhesive layer <b>38</b>. The upper guide layer <b>42</b> may have an upper bond face <b>44</b> and an upper guide face <b>46</b>. The upper bond face <b>44</b> may be releasably bonded to the upper second face <b>36</b> such that upon application of a liquid such as water to the upper guide layer <b>42</b>, the upper guide layer <b>42</b> becomes releasable from the upper second face <b>36</b>. The upper guide face <b>46</b> may include an upper guide pattern arranged to aid a user in trimming (e.g., using scissors) the upper applicator <b>22</b> generally along an upper pathway (as shown, for example, at <b>50</b>). The upper pathway may be substantially symmetrical about the upper axis <b>30</b> and may be curved toward the upper edge <b>24</b>. The guide pattern is generally used as a visual aid by a user to facilitate their trimming of the upper guide layer <b>22</b>. In embodiments, the upper guide pattern may be arranged generally along the upper pathway <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>9</b> for illustration, the lower applicator <b>52</b> is flexible and has a lower edge <b>54</b> extending between a lower right end <b>56</b> and a lower left end <b>58</b>. The lower edge <b>54</b> may be generally arcuate and substantially symmetrical about a lower axis <b>60</b>. A lower applicator <b>52</b> typically includes a lower lip substrate <b>62</b>, a lower adhesive layer <b>68</b>, a lower peel layer <b>70</b>, and a lower guide layer <b>72</b>. The lower lip substrate <b>62</b> may have a lower first face <b>64</b> and a lower second face <b>66</b>. The lower adhesive layer <b>68</b> may be disposed generally at the lower first face <b>64</b>. The lower peel layer <b>70</b> may be peelably affixed to the lower adhesive layer <b>68</b>. The lower guide layer <b>72</b> may have a lower bond face <b>74</b> and a lower guide face <b>76</b>. The lower bond face <b>74</b> may be releasably bonded to the lower second face <b>66</b> such that upon application of a liquid such as water to the lower guide layer <b>72</b>, the lower guide layer <b>72</b> becomes releasable from the upper second face <b>66</b>. The lower guide face <b>76</b> may include a lower guide pattern arranged as a visual reference to aid a user in trimming (for example, excess portions <b>126</b>) from the lower applicator generally along a lower pathway (as shown, for example, at <b>80</b>). The lower pathway may be substantially symmetrical about the lower axis <b>60</b> and may be curved toward the lower edge <b>54</b>. In embodiments, the lower guide pattern may be arranged generally along the lower pathway <b>80</b>. As illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>10</b>, an upper guide pattern may generally define a multiplicity of curved upper trim paths extending from proximate the upper left end <b>28</b> for aiding a user in evenly trimming at least an excess portion from the upper applicator generally along a selected one of the curved upper trim paths. Each of the curved upper trim paths are typically substantially symmetrical about the upper axis <b>30</b> and curved in the same direction as the upper edge <b>24</b>. As illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>11</b>, respective analogous structures may be included in a lower guide pattern as well.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the upper and lower edges (<b>24</b> and <b>54</b>, respective) may each be bifurcated by their respective axis (<b>30</b> and <b>60</b>), thereby defining a right side and a left side of their respective applicator. The curved trim paths of the respective applicator may extend from the right side to the left side.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In embodiments, the upper and lower guide layers may be comprised of a paper stock backing paper with a silicone release coating applied to it. On top of the release coating is generally a transfer film which may be comprised of, for example, a gelatin, or other polyvinyl materials such as polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). In embodiments, the release film allows the guide layer to be released from the lip substrate upon the application of water to the guide face of the guide layer. The water typically takes several seconds to soak through the guide layer and trigger the release.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In certain embodiments of a lip substrate applicator kit, the upper edge <b>24</b> has a concave portion <b>82</b> which is substantially symmetrical about the upper axis <b>30</b>. This concave portion <b>82</b> is intended to closely match the size and shape of a Cupid's bow <b>136</b> of the upper lip <b>130</b> of a wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In preferred embodiments, the upper lip substrate <b>32</b>, upper adhesive layer <b>38</b> and upper guide layer <b>42</b> each have outermost lateral perimeters which are substantially identical in shape and size, and which are in substantial alignment with each other (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>). Similarly, in embodiments, the lower lip substrate <b>62</b>, lower adhesive layer <b>68</b> and lower guide layer <b>72</b> each have outermost lateral perimeters which are substantially identical in shape and size, and which are in substantial alignment with each other. This preferred adaptation helps ensure that the person applying the lip substrates is able to accurately align the upper edge <b>24</b> and lower edge <b>54</b> to the upper vermilion border <b>120</b> and lower vermilion border <b>128</b>, respectively. As a result, the corresponding edges of each lip substrate end up being applied in the proper position and alignment on the respective lip.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In certain embodiments of a lip substrate applicator kit <b>20</b>, the upper applicator <b>22</b> has an upper waterline edge <b>84</b> disposed generally opposite of the upper edge <b>24</b> and extending between the upper right end <b>26</b> and the upper left end <b>28</b>. The upper waterline edge <b>84</b> is typically generally arcuate in the same direction as the upper edge <b>24</b>. In the same or further embodiments, the lower applicator <b>52</b> has a lower waterline edge <b>86</b> disposed generally opposite of the lower edge <b>54</b> and extending between the lower right end <b>56</b> and the lower left end <b>58</b>. The lower waterline edge <b>86</b> is typically generally arcuate in the same direction as the lower edge <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In particular embodiments, the upper guide pattern includes an upper right trim guide <b>88</b> proximate the upper right end <b>26</b>, an upper left trim guide <b>90</b> proximate the upper left end <b>28</b>, and an upper center trim guide <b>92</b> generally at the upper axis <b>30</b>. Similarly, the lower guide pattern may include a lower right trim guide <b>94</b> proximate the lower right end <b>56</b>, a lower left trim guide <b>96</b> proximate the lower left end <b>58</b>, and a lower center trim guide <b>98</b> generally at the lower axis <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In certain embodiments which include the aforementioned trim guides, the upper right trim guide <b>88</b>, upper left trim guide <b>90</b>, and upper center trim guide <b>92</b> each comprise a multiplicity of trim guide markings (shown, for example, at <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) extending at progressively greater distances from the upper waterline edge <b>84</b>. Correspondingly, the lower right trim guide <b>94</b>, lower left trim guide <b>96</b>, and lower center trim guide <b>98</b> may each comprise a multiplicity of trim guide markings <b>100</b> extending at progressively greater distances from the lower waterline edge <b>86</b>. These markings allow each individual wearer to more easily determine what portions of the applicator are excess portions (see, for example, at <b>126</b>) which can be trimmed away prior to applying the lip substrate, thereby resulting in a customized fit for any wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> for illustration, a preferred embodiment of a lip substrate applicator kit <b>20</b> further comprises a die cut applicator sheet <b>102</b> from which the upper applicator <b>22</b> and lower applicator <b>52</b> are each die cut and suspendedly detachable therefrom. In certain such embodiments, a multiplicity of upper applicators and lower applicators may each be die cut and suspendedly detachable from the same die cut applicator sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> for illustration, in certain embodiments, each of the adhesive layers (upper and lower) have an adhesive thickness <b>104</b> which is greater proximate respective right ends and left ends than proximate their respective axis. This helps the upper or lower lip substrate remain affixed to the lip to which it is applied, largely by compensating for the fact that there is less contact surface area available between the lip and the lip substrate toward the corners <b>122</b> of the wearer's mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> for illustration, in preferred embodiments, the upper lip substrate <b>32</b> comprises an upper image layer <b>106</b> adapted to produce an upper image viewable from a viewing position outward of the upper second face <b>36</b> when the upper guide layer <b>42</b> is released therefrom. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, correspondingly, the lower lip substrate <b>62</b> may comprise a lower image layer <b>110</b> adapted to produce a lower image viewable from a viewing position outward of the lower second face <b>66</b> when the lower guide layer <b>72</b> is released therefrom. It is typical for the entire lip substrate, including the respective image layer, to consist essentially of one or more ink layers which have been printed, for example, onto the bond face of the respective guide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In certain embodiments, the upper lip substrate <b>32</b> comprises an upper color barrier <b>114</b> between the upper image layer <b>106</b> and the upper first face <b>34</b>. The upper color barrier <b>114</b> may be adapted to substantially block the color of the upper lip <b>130</b> of a wearer from being viewable from a viewing position outward of the upper second face <b>36</b> when the upper guide layer <b>42</b> is released therefrom. Similarly, the lower lip substrate <b>62</b> may comprise a lower color barrier <b>116</b> between the lower image layer <b>110</b> and the lower first face <b>64</b>. The lower color barrier <b>116</b> is adapted to substantially block the color of the lower lip <b>132</b> of a wearer from being viewable from a viewing position outward of the lower second face <b>66</b> when the lower guide layer <b>72</b> is released therefrom. The color barriers may be a thin layer of opaque white ink.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Applicants have determined that the upper and lower color barriers can be printed thinly enough such that, prior to application of the lip substrate to the lip of a wearer, the image layer is largely viewable through the color barrier from a viewing position outward of the first face of the lip substrate. Because the color barrier is printed while the lip substrate is in its fully expanded form, and because the lip substrate is applied to the lip while the lip is in substantially expanded form (e.g., while the mouth is in open dropped jaw configuration), the color barrier becomes even more opaque, and therefore more effective, as the lips return to their normal relaxed state (generally as a result of the contraction of the lip substrate along with the lip to which it has been applied).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> for illustration, in preferred embodiments, the upper image layer <b>106</b> may extend laterally substantially throughout (i.e., in a direction substantially as indicated at <b>118</b>) the upper lip substrate <b>32</b>. Likewise, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, for example, the lower image layer <b>110</b> may extend laterally substantially throughout the lower lip substrate <b>62</b>. It is presently envisioned that the lip substrates may each comprise layers in addition to or other than the image layers and color barrier layers described herein. For example, a substantially transparent protective gloss layer may be included in the lip substrates between the respective image layer and second face. In addition to possibly providing an enduring gloss effect for the wearer, such a layer might also, for example, provide further protection against gradual erosion of certain materials and colors present within the image layers as the wearer engages in eating, drinking, kissing or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In particular embodiments, glitter particles may be suspended generally within the respective adhesive layer. In such embodiments, the respective lip substrate may be substantially transparent, allowing the glitter particles to be viewable from a viewing position outward of the second face when the guide layer is released therefrom. With the lip substrate acting largely as a substantially clear protective layer, this approach may provide for a longer-lasting, more comfortable and more attractive appearance of glittered lips while preventing the glitter particles from wearing away or presenting an undesirable rough outer surface. In a method for applying such glittered embodiments, among other embodiments, it may be preferred to position the mouth of the wearer in a relaxed &#x201c;O&#x201d; or &#x201c;oooh&#x201d; configuration as opposed to, for example, an &#x201c;ahh&#x201d; configuration, in order to produce a more optimal applied result.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In embodiments, the upper image and lower image may be, for example, substantially one or more of the following: metallic, glittered, homogeneously colored or fluorescent. Combinations of these characteristics are envisioned as well. Further, in certain embodiments, the upper image and lower image may comprise a graphic pattern selected from the group consisting of fishnet, lace, polka dots, checkerboard, leopard skin, tiger stripes, zebra stripes, snakeskin, rainbow and skull &#x26; crossbones. These patterns can incorporate any of a number of color variations as well. In addition, at least one of the upper image and lower image may include text. The wearer depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, for example, is shown having applied an upper lip substrate <b>32</b> and a lower lip substrate <b>62</b> in which the upper and lower images comprise a fishnet graphic pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In most preferred embodiments, the upper peel layer <b>40</b> and lower peel layer <b>70</b> are generally light permeable such that the upper image and lower image, respectively, are substantially visible therethrough. In many cases, the peel layers are made of a transparent film.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In certain embodiments, the upper adhesive layer <b>38</b> and lower adhesive layer <b>68</b> may contain a substance for delivery of the substance to the tissue of the lips of a wearer of the upper lip substrate <b>32</b> and lower lip substrate <b>62</b>. This substance may be, for example, selected from the group consisting of a moisturizer, a vitamin, a pharmaceutical and nicotine. By way of example, applicants have determined that a quantity of vitamin E can be added to the adhesive layers without significantly affecting their performance.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A method for applying an upper lip substrate <b>32</b> to the upper lip <b>130</b> of a wearer may comprise one or more of the following steps:

<p id="p-0050" num="0067">In certain methods of producing a lip substrate applicator, the step of printing may be performed by way of offset printing, and the step of applying may performed by way of screen printing. In particular methods, the step of applying may be performed by way of screen printing such that the adhesive layer has a thickness which is greater proximate the left end and said right end than proximate said axis. In the same or alternate methods, the adhesive layer may contain glitter particles suspended therein, and at least a portion of the substrate may be substantially transparent, thereby allowing at least a portion of the glitter particles to be viewable through the lip substrate from a position outward of the second face with the guide layer removed therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0068">In certain embodiments of the method for producing lip substrate applicator, the step of printing is performed by way of offset printing (typically at high resolutions such as 300 dpi or greater). Further, the step of applying the adhesive layer may be performed by way of screen printing (for example, at 180 holes/square inch). In further such embodiments, the step of applying may be performed by way of screen printing such that the adhesive layer has a thickness which is greater proximate the left end and the right end than proximate the axis. By way of example, the portions of the adhesive layer at the outer &#x2153; of the applicator may be applied at 160 holes/square inch, rather than the 180 holes/square inch, thereby resulting in a greater adhesive thickness at those locations.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0069">Applicators and methods in accordance with the present invention are designed to provide a wearer with an inexpensive yet novel lip cosmetic which grabs attention, lasts for 4-8 hours, does not smudge or stain, is easy to apply and remove, and is customizable to fit just about any size lips.</p>
