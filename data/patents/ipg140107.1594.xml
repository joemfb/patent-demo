<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 7,416,456 is hereby incorporated herein by reference and discloses an automatic trim control system that changes the trim angle of a marine propulsion device as a function of the speed of the marine vessel relative to the water in which it is operated.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disclosures of U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,234,853; 7,267,068; and 7,467,595 are hereby incorporated herein by reference and disclose methods and apparatuses for maneuvering multiple engine marine vessels.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This disclosure derives from the present inventors' research and development of systems and methods for maneuvering marine vessels. Through experimentation, the inventors have determined that prior art systems and methods for maneuvering marine vessels often position one or more marine propulsion devices at inefficient and/or ineffective trim angles during certain operational modes. For example, the present inventors have determined upon initiation of docking modes, when a joystick or other input device is utilized to request transverse, rotational, or reverse movements of the marine vessel, the marine propulsion devices are often oriented at a trim angle such that reverse thrusts of the devices impact the hull of the marine vessel. The inventors have determined that this creates inefficiency in the operation of the system. This type of deficiency also occurs during other operational modes, such as upon initiation of stationkeeping modes wherein the marine propulsion devices are oriented to maintain a global position of the marine vessel, and upon initiation of reverse modes wherein the propulsion devices provide reverse thrusts to achieve reverse translation of the marine vessel. The present inventors have realized that during modes when reverse thrust is utilized, and especially during modes when a plurality of propulsion devices are splayed inwardly, fully trimming down the propulsion devices can result in an inefficient and possibly ineffective use of reverse thrust. Similarly, trimming the plurality of propulsion devices too far upwardly away from vertical underutilizes the thrusts, thus resulting in inefficiency. Upon this realization, the present inventors determined that it would be beneficial to provide systems and methods that automatically trim the one or more marine propulsion devices to an optimal trim angle when reverse thrusts from the propulsion devices are or will be requested.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one example disclosed herein, a system for maneuvering a marine vessel comprises an input device for requesting a reverse thrust of a marine propulsion device and a control circuit that, based upon the request for the reverse thrust from the input device, controls movement of the marine propulsion device into a trim position wherein the marine propulsion device provides a reverse thrust that is not impeded by a hull of the marine vessel. Optionally, the input device can comprise a joystick.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example disclosed herein, a system for maneuvering a marine vessel comprises a marine propulsion device that provides at least a reverse thrust with respect to the marine vessel. The propulsion device is vertically pivotable between at least a first trim position and a second trim position, wherein the hull of the marine vessel impedes the reverse thrust of the propulsion device in the first trim position to a larger degree than when the propulsion device is in the second trim position. A control circuit controls the propulsion device to move into the second trim position when the reverse thrust of the propulsion device is requested.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further example, the propulsion device in the first trim position defines a reverse thrust vector in a direction that intersects with the hull and the propulsion device in the second trim position defines a reverse thrust vector in a direction that does not intersect with the hull of the marine vessel. In a further example, the propulsion device in the first trim position is at a greater trim angle from vertical than when the propulsion device is in the second trim position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, the control circuit can control operation of the propulsion device according to an operational mode that requests the reverse trust. For example, the operational mode can comprise a stationkeeping mode wherein the control circuit controls operation of the marine propulsion device to maintain a global position of the marine vessel; a docking mode wherein the control circuit controls operation of the propulsion device to achieve a transverse or rotational movement of the marine vessel; or a reverse mode wherein the control circuit controls operation of the propulsion device to achieve reverse translation of the marine vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further example, a method of maneuvering a marine vessel, the method comprises operating a control circuit to process a request for reverse thrust of a marine propulsion device associated with the marine vessel; and controlling with the control circuit the marine propulsion device to move into a trim position wherein the marine vessel does not impede the reverse thrust.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further example, a method of maneuvering a marine vessel comprises operating a control circuit to process a request for reverse thrust of a marine propulsion device associated with the marine vessel; and controlling with the control circuit the marine propulsion device to move from a first trim position to a second trim position, wherein the marine vessel impedes the reverse thrust in the first trim position to a larger degree than when the propulsion device is in the second trim position.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, the control circuit <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) is shown in simplified schematic form and has a plurality of command control sections <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>located at a helm <b>19</b> of the marine vessel <b>12</b> that communicate with respective engine control sections <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>associated with each marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, steering control sections <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b </i>associated with steering actuators <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>for steering each marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, and trim control sections <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, associated with trim actuators <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b </i>for changing the trim angles of each marine propulsion device. However, the control circuit <b>14</b> can have any number of sections (including for example one section) and can be located remotely from or at different locations in the marine vessel <b>12</b> from that shown. For example, the trim control sections <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b </i>can be co-located with and/or part of the engine control sections <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Other similar modifications of this type can be made. It should also be understood that the concepts disclosed in the present disclosure are capable of being implemented with different types of control systems including systems that acquire global position data and real time positioning data, such as for example global positioning systems, inertial measurement units, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, certain types of input devices such as a joystick <b>22</b>, a steering wheel <b>24</b>, a shift/throttle lever <b>26</b>, a keypad <b>35</b> and a touchscreen <b>28</b> are described. It should be understood that the present disclosure is applicable with other numbers and types of input devices such as video screens, keyboards, voice command modules, and the like. It should also be understood that the concepts disclosed in the present disclosure are able to function in a preprogrammed format without user input or in conjunction with different types of input devices, as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Further equivalents, alternatives and modifications are also possible as would be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, a marine vessel <b>12</b> having two (i.e. first and second) marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>is described; however the concepts in the present disclosure are applicable to marine vessels having any number of marine propulsion devices. Configurations with one or more marine propulsion devices are contemplated. For example, parts of this disclosure and claims refer to &#x201c;a propulsion device&#x201d;. These descriptions are intended to equally apply to arrangements having &#x201c;one or more propulsion devices.&#x201d; The concepts in the present disclosure are also applicable to marine vessels having any type or configuration of propulsion device, such as for example electric motors, internal combustion engines, and/or hybrid systems configured as an inboard drives, outboard drives, inboard/outboard drives, stern drives, and/or the like. The propulsion devices can include any different type of propulsor(s) such as propellers, impellers, pod drives, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a marine vessel <b>12</b> is schematically illustrated and has first and second marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, which in the example shown are outboard internal combustion engines. Again, the number of propulsion devices can vary from that shown. The marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are each rotatable in clockwise and counterclockwise directions through a substantially similar range of rotation about respective first and second steering axes <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>. Rotation of the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>is facilitated by conventional steering actuators <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Steering actuators for rotating marine propulsion devices are well known in the art, examples of which are provided in the incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 7,467,595. Each marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>creates propulsive thrust in both a forward and reverse direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show both marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>providing reverse thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b</i>; however it should be recognized that either or both propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>could instead provide forward thrusts.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are aligned in a longitudinal direction L to thereby define thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>extending in the longitudinal direction L. The particular orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is typically employed to achieve either a forward or backward movement of the marine vessel <b>12</b> in the longitudinal direction L or a rotational movement of the marine vessel <b>12</b> with respect to the longitudinal direction L. Specifically, application of both thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>forwardly in the longitudinal direction L (i.e. oppositely of the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) causes the marine vessel <b>12</b> to move forward in the longitudinal direction L. Conversely, application of thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>reversely in the longitudinal direction L (such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) causes the marine vessel <b>12</b> to move reversely in the longitudinal direction L. Further, opposite application of respective thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>(i.e. one forwardly and one reversely) causes rotation of the marine vessel <b>12</b> about a center of turn <b>28</b> for the marine vessel <b>12</b> and with respect to the longitudinal direction L. In this example, reverse application of thrust <b>32</b><i>a </i>and forward application of thrust <b>32</b><i>b </i>causes clockwise rotation of the marine vessel <b>12</b> about the center of turn <b>28</b>, whereas forward application of thrust <b>32</b><i>a </i>and reverse application of thrust <b>32</b><i>b </i>causes counter-clockwise rotation of marine vessel about the center of turn <b>28</b>. Various other maneuvering strategies and mechanisms are described in the incorporated U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,234,853; 7,267,068; and 7,467,595.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this example, the center of turn <b>28</b> represents an effective center of gravity for the marine vessel <b>12</b>. It will be understood by those having ordinary skill in the art that the location of the center of turn <b>28</b> is not, in all cases, the actual center of gravity of the marine vessel <b>12</b>. That is, the center of turn <b>28</b> can be located at a different location than the actual center of gravity that would be calculated by analyzing the weight distribution of the various components of the marine vessel. Maneuvering a marine vessel <b>12</b> in a body of water results in reactive forces exerted against the hull of the marine vessel <b>12</b> by the wind and the water. For example, as various maneuvering thrusts are exerted by the first and second marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>the hull of the marine vessel <b>12</b> pushes against the water and the water exerts a reaction force against the hull. As a result, the center of turn identified as <b>28</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> can change in response to different sets of forces and reactions exerted on the hull of the marine vessel <b>12</b>. This concept is recognized by those skilled in the art and is referred to as the instantaneous center of turn in U.S. Pat. No. 6,234,853 and as the instantaneous center in U.S. Pat. No. 6,994,046.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are rotated out of the aligned position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> so that the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>and resultant thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>are not aligned in the longitudinal direction L. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are splayed inwardly and operated so as to provide thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>that each intersect with the center of turn <b>28</b>. In this orientation, all movement of the marine vessel <b>12</b> would occur without rotation of the marine vessel <b>12</b> about the center of turn <b>28</b>. In addition to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, various other unaligned positions and relatively different or the same amounts of thrust of the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are possible to achieve one or both of a rotational movement and movement of the marine vessel <b>12</b> in any direction, including transversely to and along the longitudinal direction L. For example, the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>do not have to be similarly oriented and could splay outwardly instead of inwardly to achieve desired movement of the vessel <b>12</b>. As stated above, various other maneuvering strategies and mechanisms necessary to achieving same are described in the incorporated U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,234,853; 7,267,068; and 7,467,595.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The marine vessel <b>12</b> also includes a helm <b>19</b> where a user can input commands for maneuvering the marine vessel <b>12</b> via one or more input devices. As discussed above, the number and type of input devices can vary from the example shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the input devices include the joystick <b>22</b>, steering wheel <b>24</b>, shift and throttle lever <b>26</b>, a touchscreen <b>28</b> and keypad <b>35</b>. Rotation of the steering wheel <b>24</b> in a clockwise direction requests clockwise rotation or yaw of the marine vessel <b>12</b> about the center of turn <b>28</b>. Counterclockwise rotation of the steering wheel <b>24</b> requests counterclockwise rotation or yaw of the marine vessel <b>12</b> about the center of turn <b>28</b>. Forward pivoting of the shift and throttle lever <b>26</b> away from a neutral position requests forward gear and requests increased throttle. Rearward pivoting of the shift and throttle lever <b>26</b> away from a neutral position requests reverse gear and requests increasing rearward throttle. Actuation of the touchscreen <b>28</b> and keypad <b>35</b> inputs user-requested operational mode selections to the control circuit <b>14</b>, as will be discussed further herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A schematic depiction of a joystick <b>22</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. The joystick <b>22</b> includes a base <b>38</b>, a shaft <b>40</b> extending vertically upwardly relative to the base <b>38</b>, and a handle <b>42</b> located on top of the shaft <b>40</b>. The shaft <b>40</b> is movable, as represented by dashed line arrow <b>44</b> in numerous directions relative to the base <b>38</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the shaft <b>40</b> and handle <b>42</b> in three different positions which vary by the magnitude of angular movement. Arrows <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> show different magnitudes of movement. The degree and direction of movement away from the generally vertical position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents an analogous magnitude and direction of an actual movement command selected by a user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a top view of the joystick <b>22</b> in which the handle <b>42</b> is in a central, vertical, or neutral, position. The handle <b>42</b> can be manually manipulated in a forward F, reverse R, port P or starboard S direction to provide actual movement commands into F, R, P, S directions or any other direction therebetween. In addition, the handle <b>42</b> can be rotated about the centerline <b>50</b> of the shaft <b>40</b> as represented by arrow <b>52</b> to request rotational movement or yaw of the vessel <b>12</b> about the center of turn <b>28</b>. Clockwise rotation of the handle <b>42</b> requests clockwise rotation of the marine vessel <b>12</b> about the center of turn <b>28</b>, whereas counterclockwise rotation of the handle <b>42</b> requests counterclockwise rotation of the vessel about the center of turn <b>28</b>. Various other joystick structures and operations are described in the incorporated U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,234,853; 7,267,068; and 7,467,595.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> are schematic side views of the marine vessel <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>(only <b>16</b><i>b </i>is shown in side view) in a fully lowered trim position. The trim position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a position that is conventionally utilized during initial forward acceleration (or launch) of the marine vessel <b>12</b> until full forward translation wherein the vessel <b>12</b> is on-plane. During such initial forward acceleration, the propulsor <b>47</b> (in this example a propeller) rotates forwardly to provide forward thrust shown in dashed line at F to propel the marine vessel forwardly. When the marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>is at this conventional trim position for accelerating into forward translation of the marine vessel <b>12</b>, the propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>provides forward thrusts F that are angled with respect to the vertical direction V. Once the marine vessel <b>12</b> is in full forward translation and on plane, the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are typically trimmed back out of the trim position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, usually back past the vertical axis V to a slightly raised trim position that achieves, for example, optimal speed or fuel economy or other desired performance characteristics. Once the marine vessel <b>12</b> is thereafter slowed to a stop, the trim angle of the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>typically does not change. In other words, the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>remain in the trim position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> if the vessel <b>12</b> was slowed before it was on plane and in full forward translation or remain in the trimmed-up position away from vertical if the vessel <b>12</b> was slowed from full forward translation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when a reverse thrust <b>32</b><i>b </i>is requested after the marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>has been left in the trimmed down position, the thrust <b>32</b><i>b </i>is still angled as shown at A with respect to vertical V. Depending on the amount of the angle A, the reverse thrust <b>32</b><i>b </i>will engage with or intersect with the hull <b>13</b> of the marine vessel <b>12</b> such that the hull <b>13</b> impedes the thrust <b>32</b><i>b</i>. The present inventors have realized that this results in inefficient thrust. As described further below, the rotational angle of the marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>about the vertical axis V (or steering axis <b>30</b><i>b</i>, as described above) and the particular shape of the hull <b>13</b> will determine whether the reverse thrust <b>32</b><i>b </i>engages with the hull <b>13</b> when the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are in the trimmed down position, and to what extent. For example, many marine vessels have a keel portion that extends downwardly into the water and therefore when the marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>is rotated into the trim and splayed positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, the reverse thrust <b>32</b><i>b </i>is more likely to intersect with the hull <b>13</b> of the marine vessel <b>12</b>, thus resulting in inefficiency of thrust.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, the inventors have recognized that when the vessel <b>12</b> is in full forward translation and the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are rotated away from the first position and past vertical V, once the vessel stops, the devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are left in a slightly raised trim position (away from vertical) and consequently are not efficiently oriented to utilize the full force of a reverse thrust.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts the propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>at an optimal trim position (with respect to the fully trimmed-down position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and the trimmed-up position discussed above). In the trim position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the reverse thrust <b>32</b><i>b </i>extends in a direction that does not intersect with the hull <b>13</b> of the marine vessel <b>12</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the trim angle of the marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>is such that the reverse thrust <b>32</b><i>b </i>does not intersect with the hull <b>13</b> of the marine vessel <b>12</b> during any rotational orientation of the marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>about the steering axis <b>30</b><i>b</i>, such as the orientations depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, or otherwise. Further, the trim angle of the marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>is such that reverse thrusts <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>are not trimmed too far up away from vertical so as to efficiently achieve reverse or rotational movement. As can be seen by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>in the trim position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is at a greater trim angle A from the vertical direction V than when the propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>is in the trim position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the trim position is substantially perpendicular to vertical V. This is an optional orientation and in other examples, the marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be acutely or obtusely angled with respect to the vertical direction V and still avoid intersection with (and thus interference by) the hull <b>13</b>. The preferred angle of trim can vary and can be determined based, in part, upon the particular geometry of the hull and the particular rotational angle of the propulsion device about its steering axis. In general, it has been found to be preferable to limit the impact of the hull on the reverse thrust by angling the reverse thrust. Generally, however, the optimal trim position can be selected so as to provide the most effective utilization of thrust.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the input devices <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>35</b> communicate with control circuit <b>14</b>, which in the example shown is part of a control circuit area network <b>54</b>. It is not required that the input devices <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>35</b> communicate with the control circuit <b>14</b> via the control circuit area network <b>54</b>. For example, one or more of these items can be connected to the control circuit by hard wire or wireless connection. The control circuit <b>14</b> is programmed to control operation of marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>; steering actuators <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b</i>; and trim actuators <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b </i>associated therewith. As discussed above, the control circuit <b>14</b> can have different forms. In the example shown, the control circuit <b>14</b> includes a plurality of command control sections <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>located at the helm <b>19</b>. A command control section <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>is provided for each marine propulsion device <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The control circuit <b>14</b> also includes an engine control section <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>located at and controlling operation of each respective propulsion device <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, a steering control section <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b </i>located at and controlling operation of each steering actuator <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b</i>, and a trim control section <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b </i>located at and controlling operation of each trim actuator <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b</i>. In another example, the trim control sections <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b </i>can be part of and located with the engine control sections <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Each control section has a memory and processor for sending and receiving electronic control signals, for communicating with other control circuits in the control circuit area network <b>54</b>, and for controlling operations of certain components in the system <b>10</b> such as the operation and positioning of marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>and related steering actuators <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>and trim actuators <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b</i>. Examples of the programming and operations of the control circuit <b>14</b> and its sections are described in further detail below with respect to non-limiting examples and/or algorithms. While each of these examples/algorithms includes a specific series of steps for accomplishing certain system control functions, the scope of this disclosure is not intended to be bound by the literal order or literal content of steps described herein, and non-substantial differences or changes still fall within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the example shown, each command control section <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>receives user inputs via the control circuit area network <b>54</b> from the joystick <b>22</b>, steering wheel <b>24</b>, shift and throttle lever <b>26</b>, touch screen <b>28</b> and keypad <b>35</b>. As stated above, the joystick <b>22</b>, steering wheel <b>24</b>, shift and throttle lever, and keypad <b>35</b> could instead be wired directly to the CCM <b>18</b><i>a </i>instead of via the control circuit area network <b>54</b>. Each command control section <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>is programmed to convert the user inputs into electronic commands and then send the commands to other control circuit sections in the system <b>10</b>, including the engine control sections <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>; steering control sections <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b </i>and trim control sections <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>. For example, when the shift and throttle lever <b>26</b> is actuated, as described above, each command control section <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>sends commands to the respective engine control sections <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>to achieve the requested change in throttle and/or shift. Rotation of the shift and throttle lever <b>26</b> in an aftward direction will enable a &#x201c;reverse mode&#x201d; wherein reverse thrust is requested of the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>to achieve reverse movement of the marine vessel <b>12</b>. Further, when the steering wheel <b>24</b> is actuated, as described above, each command control section <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>sends commands to the respective steering control sections <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b </i>to achieve the requested change in steering. When the joystick <b>22</b> is moved out of its vertical position, each command control section <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>sends commands to the respective engine control section <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>and/or steering control section <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b </i>to achieve a movement commensurate with the joystick <b>22</b> movement. When the handle <b>42</b> of the joystick <b>22</b> is rotated, each command control section <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>sends commands to the respective steering control section <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b </i>to achieve the requested vessel yaw or rotation. Movement of the joystick <b>22</b> out of its vertical position effectively engages a &#x201c;joystick mode&#x201d; wherein the control circuit <b>14</b> controls operation and positioning of the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>based upon movement of the joystick <b>22</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Actuation of the touchscreen <b>28</b> and/or keypad <b>35</b> can enable a &#x201c;stationkeeping mode&#x201d;, wherein the control circuit <b>14</b> receives inputs from a GPS receiver <b>37</b> and thereby controls the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>and related steering actuators <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>to maintain a selected global position of the marine vessel <b>12</b>. Stationkeeping mode is well described in the art, such as the herein incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 7,267,068, and therefore is understood by those having ordinary skill in the art. An example of a suitable GPS receiver is the Maretron GPS200; however, other types of GPS receivers are available and would work with the systems and methods described herein.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As stated herein above, the present disclosure derives from the present inventors' research and development of systems and methods for maneuvering marine vessels. Through experimentation, the inventors have determined that prior art systems and methods for maneuvering marine vessels often position marine propulsion devices at inefficient and/or ineffective trim angles during certain operational modes. For example, the present inventors have determined that during &#x201c;docking modes&#x201d;, when a joystick or similar input device is utilized to achieve transverse movements of the marine vessel <b>12</b>, the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are often oriented towards a center of turn <b>28</b> of the marine vessel <b>12</b> and set at a trim angle such that the reverse thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>impact the hull <b>13</b> of the marine vessel <b>12</b>. For example, typical control systems leave the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>at the trim angle utilized during the last operation of the marine vessel <b>12</b>. If the marine vessel <b>12</b> is slowed immediately after acceleration, the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are typically left at the trim angle A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Conversely, if the marine vessel <b>12</b> is slowed and stopped from full forward translation, the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are typically at a trimmed-up position, away from vertical V. Thereafter, if the operator of the vessel <b>12</b> requests movement of the marine vessel that requires reverse thrust <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b</i>, the reverse thrust will be inefficiently utilized because the trim angle of the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>is not efficiently set. The inventors have determined that this creates inefficiency in the operation of the system. This type of deficiency can occur during operational modes of the system, such as in stationkeeping mode wherein the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are oriented to maintain a global position of the marine vessel <b>12</b>, and reverse mode wherein the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>provide reverse thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>to achieve reverse translation of the marine vessel <b>12</b>. Upon this realization, the present inventors determined that it would be beneficial to provide a system that automatically trims the marine propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>to a more optimal or efficient trim angle when reverse thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>from the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are requested.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> has thus been configured to control the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>to move into an optimal (e.g. a second) trim position, such as for example the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, wherein reverse thrusts from the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>do not intersect with the hull <b>13</b> of the marine vessel <b>12</b>. The control circuit <b>14</b> is programmed to control the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>to move into the second trim position when a reverse thrust of the respective propulsion device <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>is requested. Movement of the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be linked such that the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are trimmed in unison. Alternately, movement of the propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be independent and can independently depend upon whether a reverse thrust is requested from that particular device. In one example, the control circuit <b>14</b> is programmed to control the respective propulsion devices <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>to move from a first trim position such as the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> wherein the propulsion device <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>defines reverse thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>that intersect with the hull <b>13</b> (or from, for example, a trimmed-up position with respect to vertical V) to a second trim position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) wherein the reverse thrusts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>does not intersect with the hull <b>13</b>.</p>
