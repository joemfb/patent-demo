<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosed subject matter relates to controlling a spatial property such as divergence in a regenerative ring amplifier of a high power deep ultraviolet excimer two-stage light source.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gas discharge lasers are used in photolithography to manufacture semiconductor integrated circuits. As semiconductor manufacturing has progressed to requiring smaller and smaller feature sizes (that is, the minimum feature size used to fabricate the integrated circuit), the design and performance of these lasers has improved. For example, gas discharge lasers have been redesigned to provide shorter wavelength and narrower bandwidth to support higher resolution, to provide higher powers to enable higher throughput, and to stabilize performance parameters such as dose, wavelength, and bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Excimer lasers are one type of gas discharge laser used in photolithography that can operate in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region at high average output power to generate nanosecond pulses at reduced spectral bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some cases, these lasers are designed with a dual chamber design having first and second chambers to separate the functions of providing narrow spectral bandwidth and generating high average output pulse energy. The first chamber is called a master oscillator (MO) that provides a seed laser beam and the second chamber is called a power amplifier (PA) or a power oscillator (PO). A master oscillator typically includes a gain medium in which amplification occurs and an optical feedback mechanism such as an optical resonator. The power amplifier typically includes a gain medium in which amplification occurs when pumped with the seed laser beam from the master oscillator. If the power amplifier is designed as a regenerative ring resonator then it is described as a power ring amplifier (PRA) and in this case, enough optical feedback can be provided from the ring design. The power amplifier receives the seed laser beam from the MO. The MO chamber enables fine tuning of parameters such as the center wavelength and the bandwidth at relatively low output pulse energies. The power amplifier receives the output from the master oscillator and amplifies this output to attain the necessary powers for output to use in photolithography. The dual chamber design can be referred to as a MOPA, MOPO, or MOPRA, depending on how the second chamber is used.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some general aspects, a deep ultraviolet light source includes a master oscillator producing a seed light beam; a regenerative ring amplifier receiving the seed light beam from the master oscillator and outputting an output light beam, the regenerative ring amplifier including a set of optical components that define a plane of a closed ring; and a divergence control device within the master oscillator or between the master oscillator and the regenerative ring amplifier and configured to reduce a divergence of the output light beam along a normal direction, the normal direction being perpendicular to the plane of the ring.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Implementations can include one or more of the following features. For example, the divergence control device can include a normal direction beam expander between the master oscillator and the regenerative ring amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The master oscillator can include an output coupler through which the seed light beam exits the master oscillator, and the divergence control device includes the output coupler, which is an optical device that is convex in the normal direction.

The refractive optical element can have a concave curvature along the normal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The divergence control device can include an optical device that is convex in the normal direction and a beam-limiting aperture arranged in the normal direction to limit the beam in the normal direction. The divergence control device can be between the master oscillator and the regenerative ring amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another general aspect, a method is described for controlling a divergence of an output light beam in a normal direction that is perpendicular to a plane of a ring of a regenerative ring amplifier. The method includes producing a seed light beam by supplying current to electrodes on sides of a gain medium of a master oscillator; supplying current to electrodes on sides of a gain medium of a regenerative ring power amplifier that includes a set of optical components that define a plane of the ring; directing the seed light beam through an input/output optical coupler of the regenerative ring power amplifier; outputting an output light beam from the regenerative ring amplifier through the input/output optical coupler; and reducing a divergence of the output light beam along a normal direction, the normal direction being perpendicular to the plane of the ring, by modifying the seed light beam prior to directing the seed light beam through the input/output coupler of the regenerative ring amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other general aspects, a method includes producing a seed light beam traveling along its own optical axis direction, and having a value for a spatial property taken along a first transverse direction that is defined in a plane perpendicular to its own optical axis direction and a value for the spatial property taken along a second transverse direction that is defined in the plane perpendicular to its own optical axis direction and is perpendicular to the first transverse direction; directing the seed light beam through a regenerative ring amplifier that includes a set of optical components that define an optical plane of the ring; outputting an output light beam from the regenerative ring amplifier, the output light beam traveling along its own optical axis direction, and having a value for the spatial property taken along a first transverse direction that is defined in a plane perpendicular to its own optical axis direction and a value for the spatial property taken along a second transverse direction that is defined in the plane perpendicular to its own optical axis direction and is perpendicular to the first transverse direction; and transforming the value of the spatial property in the first and second transverse directions of the seed light beam to thereby transform the value of the spatial property in the first and second transverse directions of the output light beam.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a photolithography system <b>100</b> includes a deep ultraviolet light source <b>110</b> such as an excimer light source that outputs a pulsed light beam <b>160</b> (which can be a laser beam) that is directed to a lithography exposure apparatus <b>165</b> after being sent through a beam delivery system <b>161</b> and an interface device <b>163</b>. The light source <b>110</b> is designed as a dual chamber architecture that includes a master oscillator system <b>154</b> that produces a seed light beam <b>124</b>, a power amplification system (PA) <b>130</b>, shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, that receives the seed light beam <b>124</b> from the master oscillator system <b>154</b> and outputs the pulsed light beam <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The master oscillator system <b>154</b> includes a master oscillator <b>112</b>, an optional line center analysis module <b>120</b> that receives an output from an output coupler <b>118</b> of the master oscillator <b>112</b> and performs diagnostic tests on the light output, and a beam modification optical system <b>122</b> that modifies the size or shape of the seed light beam as needed to form the seed light beam <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The power amplification system <b>130</b> can be configured as a regenerative ring resonator that includes a set of optical components that define a plane of the ring, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. Thus, the resonator can be planar, in which all of the optical components are arranged to produce a beam that travels within and is constrained within a two dimensional plane. The plane of the ring can be defined within a stationary coordinate system by the directions <b>200</b>, <b>205</b>, and the normal direction <b>210</b> is a direction that is perpendicular to the plane of the ring defined by directions <b>200</b>, <b>205</b>. Other coordinate systems can be used to define the plane of the ring. In some implementations, the plane of the ring can be horizontal to the surface of the earth and the normal direction <b>210</b> can be perpendicular to the surface of the earth.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The other coordinate system that needs to be considered is the optical axis coordinate system that travels with the path of the pulsed light beam <b>160</b>. The optical axis coordinate system includes an optical axis direction <b>400</b>, and two transverse spatial directions <b>405</b>, <b>410</b>. The direction <b>405</b> can generally extend along the plane of the ring defined by directions <b>200</b>, <b>205</b>, and the direction <b>410</b> that can be normal or perpendicular to the plane of the ring and thus is generally parallel with the stationary direction <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Generally, the seed light beam <b>124</b> and the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> have spatial properties along a direction transverse to the optical axis direction. For example, one spatial property exhibited by the seed light beam <b>124</b> and the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> is the divergence of the beam, which is a measure of how fast the beam expands in one of the transverse directions. It is possible that a particular spatial property (such as the divergence) of the seed light beam <b>124</b> along a first transverse direction is not within a desired range while the particular spatial property (for example, the divergence) of the seed light beam <b>124</b> along a second transverse direction is within the desired range. Moreover, the spatial property of the seed light beam <b>124</b> along the first transverse direction and along the second transverse direction can be entrained (that is, transferred) in the oscillation within the power amplification system <b>130</b>, and thus, if the spatial property in the first transverse direction is out of desired range in the seed light beam <b>124</b>, such undesirable spatial property can be amplified in the oscillation within the power amplification system <b>130</b>. It is possible to attenuate the undesirable spatial property within the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> by modifying the spatial property of the seed light beam <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In view of this, the light source <b>110</b> includes a spatial property control device <b>152</b> (for example, a divergence control device <b>152</b>) positioned within the master oscillator system <b>154</b> (or external to the power amplification system <b>130</b>). In the following examples, the spatial property that is described is the beam divergence, but it is possible that other spatial properties can be modified using the control device <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Thus, the divergence control device <b>152</b> can be located within the master oscillator <b>112</b> or between the master oscillator <b>112</b> and the power amplification system <b>130</b> (for example, within the beam modification optical system <b>122</b>). The divergence control device <b>152</b> is configured to modify (for example, reduce) a divergence of the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> along the normal direction <b>210</b> or <b>410</b>. The divergence control device <b>152</b> can be an optical device that passively alters the divergence. For example, the divergence control device can include one or more of a refractive optical device, a reflective optical device, a beam blocking device, and an absorbing device. In the following implementations, the divergence control device <b>152</b> is not located within the power amplification system <b>130</b>. Thus, the divergence of the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> output from the power amplification system <b>130</b> is controlled with a device <b>152</b> that is not within the power amplification system <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the divergence of the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> is a measure of how fast the beam <b>160</b> expands in one of the directions <b>405</b>, <b>410</b> that is transverse to the optical axis <b>400</b> of the beam <b>160</b> in the far field from a minimum near field profile size. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the divergence can be taken along the direction <b>410</b>, which is perpendicular to the optical axis of the beam <b>160</b> and also perpendicular to the plane of the ring. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the divergence can be taken along the direction <b>405</b>, which is also perpendicular to the optical axis of the beam <b>160</b> but is within the plane of the ring. Thus, the divergence of the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> is an angular measure of the increase in beam diameter along a transverse direction at a distance from the minimum near field profile size of the pulsed light beam <b>160</b>. In some implementations, the minimum near field profile size can be near an input/output optical coupler of the power amplification system <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The divergence of the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> can be measured or considered at components within the lithography exposure apparatus <b>165</b>, at the beam delivery system <b>161</b>, or at the interface device <b>163</b>. It is important to control the divergence of the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> at one or more of these locations. Before a full discussion of the divergence control using the device <b>152</b>, more details about the photolithography system <b>100</b> are provided with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The photolithography system <b>100</b> includes a control system <b>170</b> that is connected to components of the light source <b>110</b> as well as the lithography exposure apparatus <b>165</b> to control various operations of the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The master oscillator <b>112</b> enables fine tuning of parameters such as the center wavelength and the bandwidth at relatively low output pulse energies. The power amplification system <b>130</b> receives the output from the master oscillator <b>112</b> and amplifies the output to attain the necessary powers in the light beam <b>160</b> for output to use in the lithography apparatus <b>165</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The master oscillator <b>112</b> includes a discharge chamber <b>114</b> having two elongated electrodes <b>115</b>, a gain medium that is a gas mixture, and a fan for circulating gas between the electrodes <b>115</b>. A resonator is formed between a line-narrowing module <b>116</b> on one side of the discharge chamber <b>114</b> and the output coupler <b>118</b> on a second side of the discharge chamber <b>114</b>. The line-narrowing module <b>116</b> can include a diffractive optic such as a grating that finely tunes the spectral output of the discharge chamber <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The gas mixture used in the discharge chamber <b>114</b> can be any suitable gas for producing a light beam at the required wavelength (ultraviolet) and bandwidth. For example, for an excimer source, the gas mixture typically contains a noble gas (rare gas) (for example, argon, krypton, or xenon) and a halogen (for example, fluorine or chlorine), apart from helium and/or neon as buffer gas. Specific examples of the gas mixture include argon fluoride (ArF), which emits light at a wavelength of about 193 nm, krypton fluoride (KrF), which emits light at a wavelength of about 248 nm, or xenon chloride (XeCl), which emits light at a wavelength of about 351 nm. The excimer gain medium (the gas mixture) is pumped with short (for example, nanosecond) current pulses in a high-voltage electric discharge by application of a voltage to the elongated electrodes <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The power amplification system <b>130</b> includes a beam modification optical system <b>132</b> that receives the seed light beam <b>124</b> from the master oscillator <b>112</b> and directs the light beam <b>124</b> through a discharge chamber <b>140</b>, and to a beam turning optical element <b>150</b> where the direction of the light beam is modified so that it is sent back into and through the discharge chamber <b>140</b> toward the optical system <b>132</b>. If the power amplification system <b>130</b> is designed as a regenerative ring resonator, then the light beam is directed through the power amplification system <b>130</b> to form a circulating and regenerative path.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The discharge chamber <b>140</b> includes a pair of elongated electrodes <b>141</b>, a gain medium that is a gas mixture, and a fan for circulating the gas mixture between the electrodes <b>141</b>. In the regenerative ring resonator design, the seed light beam <b>124</b> is amplified by repeatedly passing through the discharge chamber <b>140</b>. The optical system <b>132</b> provides a way (for example, an optical coupler such as a partially-reflecting mirror, discussed below) to in-couple the seed light beam <b>124</b> and to out-couple a portion of the amplified radiation from the ring resonator to form the output pulsed light beam <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The output pulsed light beam <b>160</b> can be directed through a bandwidth analysis module <b>162</b>, where various parameters of the beam <b>160</b> can be measured. The output pulsed light beam <b>160</b> can also be directed through a pulse stretcher, where each of the pulses of the output pulsed light beam <b>160</b> is stretched, for example, in an optical delay unit, to adjust for performance properties of the light beam that impinges the lithography apparatus <b>165</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The control system <b>170</b> is connected to various components of the light source <b>110</b>. For example, the control system <b>170</b> is coupled to the electrodes <b>115</b>, <b>141</b> within the master oscillator <b>112</b> and the power amplifier <b>130</b>, respectively, for controlling the respective pulse energies of the master oscillator <b>112</b> and the power amplification system <b>130</b>, and also for controlling the pulse repetition rates, which can range between about 1000 and 12,000 Hz or greater. The control system <b>170</b> therefore provides repetitive triggering of the discharges in the chamber of the master oscillator <b>112</b> and the discharges in the chamber of the power amplification system <b>130</b> relative to each other with feedback and feed-forward control of the pulse and dose energy. The output pulsed light beam <b>160</b> can have an average output power of between a few watts and hundreds of watts, for example, from about 40 W to about 200 W. The irradiance (that is, the average power per unit area) of the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> at the output can be at least about 60 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>or at least about 80 W/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The control system <b>170</b> is connected to one or more actuators within the line-narrowing module <b>116</b> so that it can act to adjust the properties of optical components within the line-narrowing module <b>116</b> to thereby control the bandwidth or wavelength of the seed light beam <b>124</b>. The control system <b>170</b> can be connected to the line center analysis module <b>120</b> or to any other metrology systems that measure properties of the seed light beam <b>124</b> to enable further analysis of these properties. The information from such metrology systems can therefore be used to adjust the inputs to, for example, the master oscillator <b>112</b> or the power amplification system <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Typically, the output power of the light source <b>110</b> is calculated at 100% duty cycle (that is, the continuous firing of the electrodes in the master oscillator <b>112</b> and the power amplification system <b>130</b> of the light source <b>110</b>) at a nominal pulse repetition rate and a nominal pulse energy. Thus, for example, at a nominal pulse repetition rate of 6000 Hz and a 15 mJ nominal pulse energy, the output power of the light source <b>110</b> (which is the power of the light beam <b>160</b>) is 90 W. As another example, at a nominal pulse repetition rate of 6000 Hz and a 20 mJ nominal pulse energy, the output power of the light source <b>110</b> (which is the power of the light beam <b>160</b>) is 120 W.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the following examples, the power amplification system <b>130</b> is designed as a regenerative ring resonator. In such a design, a standard tilted double-pass optical path through the discharge chamber <b>140</b> is closed with the use of an optical coupler <b>234</b> to form a recirculating resonant structure that enables regenerative amplification of the seed light beam pulse from the master oscillator <b>112</b>. The optical path is closed if the light beam that exits (for example, the pulsed light beam <b>160</b>) the optical coupler <b>234</b> intersects the light beam <b>124</b> that enters (for example, the seed light beam <b>124</b>) the optical coupler. The seed light beam <b>124</b> from the master oscillator <b>112</b> is directed through the optical coupler <b>234</b>, which is a partially reflecting mirror (and can be referred to as an input/output coupler) and serves as both the entrance into the ring resonator and also the exit from the ring resonator. The optical coupler <b>234</b> can have a reflectivity of between about 10% to about 60%; to form an oscillation cavity that allows the pulse intensity to build up during the oscillation through the excited gain medium in the discharge chamber <b>140</b> between the electrodes during the electrical discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The light beam that travels through the optical coupler <b>234</b> toward the discharge chamber <b>140</b> of the power amplification system <b>130</b> is reflected from a reflecting optic such as a mirror <b>236</b>. The mirror <b>236</b> can have a high reflectivity, for example greater than about 90% at or near the center wavelength of the light beam for the desired polarization at the angle of incidence used. The light beam reflected from the mirror is directed through the discharge chamber <b>140</b> and toward the beam turning optical element <b>150</b>, which in this implementation is a prism <b>250</b>. The light beam reflected from two surfaces of the prism <b>250</b> reenters the discharge chamber <b>140</b> along another path and back toward the optical coupler <b>234</b>, where, as discussed above, it intersects the seed light beam <b>124</b> entering the power amplification system <b>130</b>. Some of this return light beam (coming from the discharge chamber <b>140</b>) is reflected back into the ring resonator while some of the light beam (coming from the discharge chamber <b>140</b>) is transmitted through the optical coupler <b>234</b> as the output pulsed light beam <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The beam turning optical system <b>150</b> is an optical system made of one or more precision devices having precision optical materials such as materials having a crystalline structure such as calcium fluoride (CaF2) and also includes precision optically finished faces. Although a prism <b>250</b> is shown in these examples, the beam turning optical system <b>150</b> can be any combination of one or more optical devices that receive the light beam and change the direction of the light beam so that it is transmitted back into the discharge chamber <b>140</b>. Thus, in other implementations, the beam turning optical system <b>150</b> can include a plurality of mirrors arranged to reflect the light beam back into the discharge chamber <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, the light beam that is reflected from the mirror <b>236</b> through the discharge chamber <b>140</b> is usually compressed before entering the discharge chamber <b>140</b> so that it can substantially match the transverse size of the gain medium in the discharge chamber <b>140</b>. If the light beam is compressed before entering the discharge chamber <b>140</b>, then it is also expanded as it exits the discharge chamber <b>140</b>. In order to perform the compression and expansion, a beam magnification/de-magnification system <b>238</b> is positioned between the discharge chamber <b>140</b> and the mirror <b>236</b> and optical coupler <b>234</b>. The beam magnification/de-magnification system <b>238</b> can include any number of optical elements such as prisms to perform the compression and expansion of the beam. The design of the system <b>238</b> is discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The pulsed light beam <b>160</b> can be directed through a system aperture for further control of the beam profile and size, and from the system aperture it is directed through the beam delivery system <b>161</b>, which modifies optical properties of the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> to prepare it to be delivered to the lithography exposure apparatus <b>165</b>. For example, the beam delivery system <b>161</b> can include filters, attenuators, beam expanders, mirrors, and sensors. The pulsed light beam <b>160</b> is guided through the interface device <b>163</b>, which can be an aperture sized to select a spatial portion of the beam profile for use in the lithography exposure apparatus <b>165</b>. For example, the interface device <b>163</b> can be a slit.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As the pulsed light beam <b>160</b>, which is output from the beam delivery system <b>161</b> through the interface device <b>163</b>, enters the lithography exposure apparatus <b>165</b>, it is directed through optics <b>167</b> that modify the beam such as a reticle (or mask) that filters the beam, and that modified beam is projected onto a prepared wafer <b>169</b>. In this way, a chip design is patterned onto a photoresist that is then etched and cleaned, and the process repeats. The lithography exposure apparatus <b>165</b> can be an immersion system or a dry system, depending on the application.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, one particular implementation of the beam magnification/de-magnification system <b>238</b> is shown. This system <b>238</b> includes first prism <b>242</b>, second prism <b>244</b>, and third prism <b>246</b>. The first prism <b>242</b> and the third prism <b>246</b> act together to compress the incoming light beam <b>124</b>, and the third prism <b>246</b> also aligns the incoming light beam with both windows of the discharge chamber <b>140</b>. The third prism <b>246</b> shifts the outgoing light beam (which has been reflected by the prism <b>250</b> back through the discharge chamber <b>140</b>) to the second prism <b>244</b>, which shifts the light beam to the optical coupler <b>234</b>. The third prism <b>246</b> and the second prism <b>244</b> act together to magnify or expand the outgoing light beam, the one that exits the discharge chamber <b>140</b> toward the optical coupler <b>234</b>, to match the transverse size of the seed light beam <b>124</b>. The outgoing light beam impinges upon the optical coupler <b>234</b> at the surface through which the seed light beam <b>124</b> crosses, and it is either transmitted through the optical coupler <b>234</b> to form the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> or it is reflected back into the ring resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">All of the optical components (such as the optical coupler <b>234</b>, the mirror <b>236</b>, the prisms <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, <b>250</b>, and the chamber windows) are typically crystalline structures that are able to transmit very high pulse energy light or laser pulses at very short wavelengths (deep ultraviolet wavelengths) with minimal losses. For example, the components can be made of calcium fluoride (CaF2), magnesium fluoride (MgF2), or fused silica.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The following discussion uses the terms &#x201c;beam profile,&#x201d; &#x201c;near field,&#x201d; and &#x201c;far field&#x201d; to describe some of the optical effects noticed within the system <b>100</b>. The term &#x201c;beam profile&#x201d; is the distribution of energy in position across a direction that is transverse to the beam propagation direction (such as, for example, the optical axis <b>400</b> of the pulsed light beam <b>160</b>). The &#x201c;near field&#x201d; beam profile refers to the distribution of electromagnetic energy in the vicinity of an object (for example, an aperture or a mask) that changes a shape of the beam. The &#x201c;far field&#x201d; beam profile is the distribution of electromagnetic energy far away from the object.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As mentioned above, the divergence of the output light beam <b>160</b> along the normal direction <b>210</b> (which is parallel with the direction <b>410</b>), can be controlled by using the divergence control device <b>152</b>. One way to determine the divergence properties of the light beam as it travels through the power amplification system <b>130</b> is to measure the divergence of the light beam output from the power amplification system <b>130</b> while it is in free-running mode, which means that there is no injected signal (seed light beam <b>124</b>) from the master oscillator system <b>154</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, in free-running mode, the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>B </sub>of the output pulsed light beam <b>160</b> along the direction <b>405</b> that is in the plane of the ring (defined by directions <b>205</b> and <b>200</b>) can be below about 0.5 milliradian (or about 0.03&#xb0;), for example, about 0.2 milliradian (or about 0.01&#xb0;). On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>of the output pulsed light beam <b>160</b> along the direction <b>410</b> (which is parallel with the normal direction <b>210</b>) can be as high as 2 milliradian (or about 0.1&#xb0;). For clarity, the depictions of these angles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are highly exaggerated to show the concepts.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It was noticed by experiment that the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>of the light beam along the normal direction <b>210</b> or <b>410</b> while in free-running mode is dramatically reduced (for example, to around 65% of a geometrically limited value) when the regeneration of the ring resonator is highest, which happens when the ring resonator is truly closed (the output light beam exactly overlaps the input light beam at the optical coupler <b>234</b>. On the other hand, when the power amplification system <b>130</b> is fed with the injected signal (the seed light beam <b>124</b> from the master oscillator system <b>154</b>), the energy of the output light beam <b>160</b> greatly depends on the direction at which the output light beam <b>160</b> exits the power amplification system <b>130</b>, and in particular the direction as measured from the plane of the ring.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>of the light beam <b>160</b> along the normal direction <b>210</b> can be too high in free-running mode, it is possible to adjust the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>by adjusting properties of the seed light beam <b>124</b> that is input into the power amplification system <b>130</b>. Additionally, it may be important to adjust the parameters of the light beam <b>160</b> such as the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>along the normal direction <b>210</b> depending on the geometry of the interface device <b>163</b>. If the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>is too large, then it can be possible that too much of the light beam is blocked at the interface device <b>163</b> along the normal direction <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an exemplary photolithography system <b>100</b> is shown in which the divergence control device <b>152</b> is placed in a generic location within the beam modification optical system <b>122</b>, which includes all optical components between the master oscillator <b>112</b> and the power amplification system <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the divergence control device <b>152</b> can be a beam expander <b>852</b> placed in the path of the light beam as it travels from the master oscillator <b>112</b> toward the power amplification system <b>130</b>. The beam modification optical system <b>122</b> can also include other optical components <b>857</b> such as reflective or refractive optical devices for controlling other aspects of the light beam.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this example, the beam expander <b>852</b> acts to expand the beam profile of the seed light beam <b>124</b> along the normal direction <b>210</b> using a pair of prisms <b>853</b>, <b>855</b> and a light aperture <b>856</b> that rejects divergences significantly greater than what is desired. When injected with the seed light beam <b>124</b>, and with the addition of the beam expander <b>852</b> within the master oscillator system <b>154</b>, the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>of the output light beam <b>160</b> in the far field can be reduced by 50% of the value of the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>of the output light beam <b>160</b> that is obtained without the beam expander <b>852</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As another example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the divergence control device <b>152</b> can include an image-rotating optical system <b>952</b>, which, in this case is a dove prism, and a half-wave retarder <b>956</b> to rotate the beam by 90 degrees while maintaining proper orientation of the polarization with respect to the ring resonator of the power amplification system <b>130</b>. In this way, the divergence of the output light beam <b>160</b> is reduced by swapping the two divergences of the seed light beam <b>124</b>. The two divergences of the seed light beam <b>124</b> are similarly defined as those of the output light beam <b>160</b>; the normal divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b> is taken along the perpendicular direction to the plane of the ring and the non-normal divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b> is taken along a direction that is within the plan of the ring and also transverse to the optical axis of the seed light beam <b>124</b>. It turns out that the normal divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b> can be several times larger (for example, two-four times larger) than the non-normal divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b>. In one example, the normal divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b> can be greater than 1 milliradian while the non-normal divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b> can be less than 0.5 milliradian. The goal of the image-rotating optical system <b>952</b> is to swap these two divergences so that the smaller of the two is directed along the normal direction prior to injection into the power amplification system <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Even though the larger of the two would be directed along the plane of the ring in this scenario, it does not adversely impact the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>B </sub>of the output light beam <b>160</b> taken along the direction <b>405</b> in the plane of the ring and transverse to the optical axis <b>400</b> because the ring resonator has a smaller angular acceptance along the plane of the ring and does not sustain oscillation in such a large angular band. Note also that the free-running divergence &#x3b8;<sub>B </sub>along the direction <b>405</b> was naturally lower than the free-running divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>along the normal direction <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When running in injection mode in which the seed light beam <b>124</b> is injected into the power amplification system, and when using the image-rotating optical system <b>952</b> within the master oscillator system <b>154</b>, the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>of the output light beam <b>160</b> in the far field can be reduced by 50% of the value of the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>of the output light beam <b>160</b> that is obtained without the image-rotating optical system <b>952</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The beam modification optical system <b>122</b> in this example can also include other optical components <b>957</b> such as reflective or refractive optical devices for controlling other aspects of the light beam. Moreover, another image-rotating optical system <b>952</b> that could be used is an out-of-plane periscope.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, in another example, the divergence control device <b>152</b> can be within the line-narrowing module <b>116</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the line-narrowing module <b>116</b> typically includes optical elements such as prisms <b>1001</b>, <b>1002</b>, <b>1003</b>, <b>1004</b> and a diffractive element such as a grating <b>1006</b>. One or more of these optical elements can be fixed to an actuator, which is connected to the control system <b>170</b>. For example, the actuator can be a rotational motion device or stepper motor. The position and/or angle of one or more of the optical elements can be adjusted relative to the other optical elements of the module <b>116</b> to adjust a center wavelength (coarsely or finely or both) and/or a bandwidth of the seed light beam <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the divergence control device <b>152</b> can be a modified version of one of the optical elements of the line-narrowing module <b>116</b>. For example, the divergence control device <b>152</b> can be a prism <b>1152</b> selected from among the prisms <b>1001</b>, <b>1002</b>, <b>1003</b>, or <b>1004</b>, in which a cylindrical concave curvature is added to a surface <b>1153</b> of the prism <b>1152</b>. The curvature is along the direction that is normal to the plane of the ring. The addition of such curvature can reduce the divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b> along the direction that is normal to the plane of the ring by 25%, which causes a reduction in the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>of the output light beam <b>160</b> along the normal <b>410</b> direction.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the surface <b>1153</b> can have a radius of curvature of between about 10-50 meters. The size of the radius of curvature selected for the surface <b>1153</b> is selected to provide enough of a reduction in the divergence. The exemplary values noted herein can be determined based on one or more properties of the photolithography system <b>100</b>. The depiction of the radius of curvature of the surface <b>1153</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is exaggerated for clarity. While prism <b>1001</b> was selected to be modified with the curvature, it is possible that one of the other prisms <b>1002</b>, <b>1003</b>, <b>1004</b> could be modified instead.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, in another implementation, the divergence control device <b>152</b> is a modified version of the output coupler <b>118</b> of the master oscillator <b>112</b>. Specifically, as shown in FIGS. <b>12</b>B and <b>13</b>A-D, the output coupler <b>1252</b> has been modified to have a cylindrical convex curvature on a surface <b>1253</b> that faces the master oscillator <b>112</b> and thus faces the resonator that is formed between the output coupler <b>1252</b> and the line-narrowing module <b>116</b>. The curvature is along the direction <b>210</b> that is normal to the plane of the ring. The addition of such curvature can reduce the divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b> along the direction <b>210</b> that is normal to the plane of the ring by 25%, which causes a reduction in the divergence &#x3b8;<sub>A </sub>of the output light beam <b>160</b> along the normal <b>410</b> direction.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, as shown, the surface <b>1253</b> can have a radius of curvature of between about 10-50 meters. The size of the radius of curvature selected for the surface <b>1253</b> is selected to provide enough of a reduction in the divergence. The exemplary values noted herein can be determined based on one or more properties of the photolithography system <b>100</b>. The depiction of the radius of curvature of the surface <b>1253</b> in the drawings is exaggerated for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The beam limiting apertures placed within the path of the seed light beam <b>124</b> can act to restrict light along the normal direction <b>210</b>, and therefore a smaller range of angles of the rays of the seed light beam <b>124</b> are supported. Such beam limiting apertures can be at the output of the master oscillator, between the output coupler <b>118</b> and the power amplification system <b>130</b>, or at other locations that are suitable. Optical rays of the seed light beam <b>124</b> that have divergences that are significantly greater than zero are rejected by such beam limiting apertures inside the cavity of the master oscillator <b>112</b>. As a result, optical rays of the seed light beam <b>124</b> that are parallel with the optical axis of the seed light beam <b>124</b> have a longer cavity life and therefore a higher intensity. The increased angular selectivity of the laser cavity of the master oscillator <b>112</b> (due to the modifications within the line-narrowing module <b>116</b> or to the output coupler <b>118</b>) leads to a reduced divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b> in the normal direction <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The reduction in the divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b> can be characterized by measuring the size (the beam profile) of the seed light beam <b>124</b> after it has been focused with a lens to an image plane. The measurement is performed in the image plane that represents the minimum spot size for the seed light beam <b>124</b> as determined by the focus of the lens.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some implementations, the divergence control device <b>152</b> can transform (or swap) the direction of the divergences in the seed light beam <b>124</b> so that the divergences in the pulsed light beam <b>160</b> are thereby modified. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, for example, the divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b> taken along a first transverse direction can be swapped for the divergence of the seed light beam <b>124</b> taken along a second transverse direction (which is perpendicular to the first transverse direction) prior to injection into the power amplification system <b>130</b>. Some ways in which this can be done include: modifying the relative geometrical arrangement of the master oscillator system <b>154</b> and the power amplification system <b>130</b>; or placing one or more rotating optical elements <b>152</b> between the master oscillator system <b>154</b> and the power amplification system <b>130</b> that perform the transformation. The rotating optical elements can rotate the near field or rotate the polarization state (or perform both rotations).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The rotating optical element can include an image-rotating optical element that rotates the entire seed light beam <b>124</b> by 90&#xb0; prior to injection into the power amplification system <b>130</b>. Or, the rotating optical element can include a polarization rotating optical element. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, the image-rotating optical element is a dove prism <b>1552</b> inserted within the path of the seed light beam <b>124</b> as it travels from the master oscillator system <b>154</b> toward the power amplification system <b>130</b>. The dove prism <b>1552</b> can be mounted at any angle &#x3b8;<sub>P </sub>relative to the first and second transverse directions of the light beam <b>124</b> to enable the degree of rotation &#x3b8;<sub>T </sub>needed for the transformation.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As another example, the image-rotating optical element is an out-of-plane periscope inserted within the path of the seed light beam <b>124</b> as it travels from the master oscillator system <b>154</b> toward the power amplification system <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, in another implementation, the divergence control device <b>152</b> is positioned within the power amplification system <b>130</b>. In this example, the divergence control device <b>152</b> includes a rotating optical element within the regenerative ring amplifier and is configured to reduce a divergence of the output light beam <b>160</b> along a normal direction <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The rotating optical element can be an image-rotating optical element that rotates the entire beam by 90&#xb0; on each round-trip through the ring. Or, the rotating optical element can be a polarization rotating optical element. The image-rotating optical element can be a dove prism or an out-of-plane periscope inserted within the power amplification system <b>130</b> between the optical coupler <b>234</b> and the beam turning optical element <b>150</b>. Alternatively, the divergence control device <b>152</b> can be incorporated into the design of a component within the power amplification system <b>130</b>. For example, the image-rotating optical element can be the beam turning optical element <b>150</b> or the arrangement of the beam turning optical element <b>150</b>, the optical coupler <b>234</b>, and the mirror <b>236</b> can be configured as an out-of-plane periscope.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, in some implementations, the image-rotating optical element is placed between the optical coupler <b>234</b> and the mirror <b>236</b>. It might be advantageous to place the image-rotating optical element in a location within the ring at which the light beam is closest to a square shape so that after it is rotated by 90&#xb0; it does not get clipped to blocked in other locations of the ring. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, in other implementations, the image-rotating optical element is placed between the prism <b>244</b> and the optical coupler <b>234</b>.
