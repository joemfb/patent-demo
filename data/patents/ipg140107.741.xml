<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Samples of hydrocarbon are obtained with a coring tool. An analysis of some thermal or electrical properties of the core samples may be performed downhole. The core samples may also be preserved in containers sealed and/or refrigerated prior to being brought uphole for analysis. The hydrocarbon trapped in the pore space of the core samples may be extracted from the core samples downhole. The extracted hydrocarbon may be preserved in chambers and/or analyzed downhole.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/852,390, filed Sep. 10, 2007, which is a non-provisional application of co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/845,332, filed Sep. 18, 2006, the entire contents of both being hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates broadly to evaluating hydrocarbon trapped in the pores of an underground formation. More particularly, this invention relates to obtaining and evaluating hydrocarbon samples with a coring tool.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. State of the Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">&#x201c;Heavy oil&#x201d; or &#x201c;extra heavy oil&#x201d; are terms of art used to describe very viscous crude oil as compared to &#x201c;light crude oil&#x201d;. Large quantities of heavy oil can be found in the Americas, in particular, Canada, Venezuela, and California. Historically, heavy oil was less desirable than light oil. The viscosity of the heavy oil makes production very difficult. Heavy oil also contains contaminants and/or many compounds which make refinement more complicated. Recently, advanced production techniques and the rising price of light crude oil have made production and refining of heavy oil economically feasible.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Heavy oil actually encompasses a wide variety of very viscous crude oils. Medium heavy oil generally has a density of 903 to 906 kg&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, an API (American Petroleum Institute) gravity of 25&#xb0; to 18&#xb0;, and a viscosity of 10 to 100 mPa&#xb7;s. It is a mobile fluid at reservoir conditions and may be extracted using for example cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS). Extra heavy oil generally has a density of 933 to 1,021 kg&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, an API gravity of 20&#xb0; to 7&#xb0;, and a viscosity of 100 to 10,000 mPa&#xb7;s. It is a fluid that can be mobilized at reservoir conditions and may be extracted using heat injection techniques, such as cyclic steam stimulation, steam floods, and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) or solvent injection techniques such as vapor assisted extraction (VAPEX). Tar sands, bitumen, and oil shale generally have a density of 985 to 1,021 kg&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, an API gravity of 12&#xb0; to 7&#xb0;, and a viscosity in excess of 10,000 mPa&#xb7;s. They are not mobile fluids where the formation temperature is approximately 10&#xb0; C. (in Canada), and must be extracted by mining. Hydrocarbons with similar densities and API gravities, but with viscosities less than 10,000 mPa&#xb7;s can be partially mobile where the formation temperature is approximately 50&#xb0; C. (in Venezuela).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">From this discussion, it becomes apparent that production techniques may vary significantly depending, amongst other things, on the density or API gravity of the oil, and its viscosity. Thus, knowledge of the composition or the physical properties of heavy oils would provide valuable insight as to the viability of various production strategies that might be utilized to extract heavy oil and/or bitumen from the formation. Therefore, it would be desirable to obtain a sample of the formation oil, with or without solid suspension (mostly sand) and preferably without drilling fluid, in order to gain this knowledge. If a sample is available, it may be analyzed uphole or downhole and a production strategy may be derived from the results of this analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the past, sampling tools, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,860,581 and 4,936,139 have been proposed for taking samples of formation fluid. In the case of light oil, formation fluids are sampled by delivering a tool downhole and simply extracting formation fluid by applying a pressure differential to the formation wall. However, heavy oil may not easily be sampled in this way, as explained in further details below.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Indeed, the efficiency of fluid sampling as performed with conventional sampling tools depends usually on the rate of fluid flow from formation rock. More specifically, the flow rate Q of fluid from formation rock is given by Equation 1 where &#x394;p is the pressure difference applied by the sampling tool, k is the permeability of the formation, and &#x3b7; is the fluid viscosity.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Q&#x221d;&#x394;p&#xb7;k/&#x3b7;&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As seen from Equation 1, the flow rate can be increased by increasing the pressure difference or the permeability or by decreasing the viscosity. The magnitude of the pressure difference is limited by the sampling tool (a maximum of approximately 50 MPa) and the consolidation of the formation, i.e. how large a pressure difference can be maintained before the formation collapses. In addition, other than fracturing and/or acidizing the formation, there is not much that can be done to increase the permeability. A possible method of sampling heavy oil would be to increase the hydrocarbon mobility by injecting a solvent. However, this might be unpractical when the solvent can not diffuse in the oil.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, even if a representative sample were obtained downhole, bringing it uphole could cause an unknown change in the physical characteristics of the sample. Because of the environment in which heavy oil and bitumen are found, samples taken downhole can change when brought to the surface for analysis. Such changes include the evaporation of potentially volatile components such as methane, ethane, and propane; the precipitation of waxes or asphaltenes; the contamination by wellbore fluids; etc.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">From the foregoing it will be appreciated that there are many challenges to obtaining and analyzing representative formation hydrocarbon samples when these hydrocarbons have a very low mobility.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is therefore an object of this disclosure to provide tools and methods for evaluating a reservoir, and particularly, although not exclusively, reservoir containing hydrocarbon having a very low mobility. Hydrocarbon samples of the reservoir are obtained with a coring tool.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with one aspect of the disclosure, a method for evaluating an underground formation includes conveying a coring tool to the formation, receiving a core sample in the tool, extracting at least a portion of the hydrocarbon from the core sample in the tool, and analyzing at least a portion of the extracted hydrocarbon.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a method for evaluating an underground formation includes conveying a coring tool to the formation, obtaining a core sample from the formation, placing at least a portion of the core sample into a processing chamber, at least partially flooding the core sample, extracting fluid from the core sample, and analyzing at least a portion of the core.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a method for evaluating an underground formation includes delivering a coring tool to the formation, obtaining a core sample from the formation, and receiving the sample in the tool.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An exemplary version of the tools according to this disclosure is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The tool string <b>11</b> may be used for capturing a core <b>23</b> at the location of interest <b>25</b>. The core usually contains at least some pristine formation hydrocarbon trapped in the pores of the rock/formation. This is particularly true if the hydrocarbon has a very low mobility. Therefore, the tool string <b>11</b> is capable of obtaining a sample representative of the formation hydrocarbon. Ideally, the core provides an aliquot of the formation hydrocarbon having a composition which well represents the important characteristics of the reservoir. The tool string <b>11</b> is further capable of analyzing this aliquot downhole or preserving it for a surface analysis as further detailed below. The tool string <b>11</b> is further capable of analyzing some of the properties of the core that are pertinent to the mobilization of the hydrocarbon in the reservoir in which the core has been formed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For the sake of clarity, only a few details are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In wireline well logging, one or more tools containing sensors for taking geophysical measurements are connected to a wireline <b>13</b>, which is a power and data transmission cable that connects the tools to a data acquisition and processing apparatus <b>15</b> on the surface. The tools connected to the wireline <b>13</b> are lowered into a wellbore <b>17</b> to obtain hydrocarbon samples from the area surrounding the wellbore. The wireline <b>13</b> supports the tools by supplying power to the tool string <b>11</b>. Furthermore, the wireline <b>13</b> provides a communication medium to send signals to the tools and to receive data from the tools.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The tools <b>31</b>, <b>41</b>, <b>51</b>, <b>61</b>, <b>71</b>, and <b>81</b> are typically connected via a tool bus <b>93</b> to a telemetry unit <b>91</b> which in turn is connected to the wireline <b>13</b> for receiving and transmitting data and control signals between the tools and the surface data acquisition and processing apparatus <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Commonly, the tools are lowered in the wellbore and are then retrieved by means of the wireline <b>13</b>. While in the wellbore <b>17</b>, the tools collect and send data via the wireline <b>13</b> about the geological formation through which the tools pass, to the data acquisition and processing apparatus <b>15</b> at the surface, usually contained inside a logging truck or a logging unit (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The wireline tool string <b>11</b>, as implemented in one embodiment, contains a control section <b>51</b>, a fluid storage section <b>61</b>, a side-wall coring tool <b>71</b>, a core analysis section <b>31</b>, a core storage section <b>41</b>, and a storage cooling section <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The side-wall coring tool <b>71</b> is operable to acquire multiple side-wall core samples during a single trip into the wellbore. When the side-wall coring tool <b>71</b> is lowered into a wellbore <b>17</b> to a depth of interest <b>25</b>, the coring bit <b>21</b> acquires a side-wall core <b>23</b> from the wellbore <b>17</b>. One or more brace arm <b>26</b> is used to stabilize the coring tool <b>71</b> in the wellbore <b>17</b> when the coring bit <b>21</b> is functioning. The side-wall coring tool <b>71</b> may convey the core <b>23</b> to the core analysis section <b>31</b>, or to the core storage section <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The core analysis section <b>31</b> comprises in one embodiment at least one sensor <b>35</b> for performing tests on the core sample <b>23</b>. The sensor <b>35</b> is connected via the tool bus <b>93</b> to the telemetry unit <b>91</b> for transmission of data to the data acquisition and processing apparatus <b>15</b> at the surface via the wireline <b>13</b>. In another embodiment, the core analysis section comprises a core processing chamber <b>37</b> for extracting formation fluid from the core sample, and optionally for performing tests on the extracted fluid. Extraction might require the use of a solvent, or the use of heat. Extraction might also require the use of a grinder.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The extracted fluid may be conveyed into a fluid storage chamber <b>63</b> disposed in the fluid storage section <b>61</b>. The fluid storage section may comprise a fluid transfer means <b>67</b>, such as a bidirectional pump, for circulating fluid between the fluid storage section <b>61</b> and the core analysis section <b>31</b>. Additionally, downhole sensors (not shown) provided in conjunction with the fluid storage section <b>61</b> could be used to analyze extracted hydrocarbons and to determine physical properties such as density, viscosity, and phase borders as well as chemical composition. For example, these downhole sensors may provide spectroscopic measurements, as is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The core storage section <b>41</b> is capable of storing a plurality of cores. In one embodiment, each core is individually sealed from wellbore fluids in an individual container <b>43</b>. Individual containers may be used to advantage for obtaining at the surface a fluid captured within the core <b>23</b> that is representative of the reservoir fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, the core storage section <b>41</b> is maintained at a desirable temperature by the core cooling section <b>81</b>. Cooling may again be used to advantage for obtaining at the surface a fluid captured within the core <b>23</b> that is representative of the reservoir fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The control section <b>51</b> controls some operations of the tools <b>61</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>41</b> or <b>81</b>, either from commands received from the data acquisition and processing apparatus <b>15</b>, or from a surface operator (not shown). Alternatively, the control section <b>51</b> may control some operations of the tools <b>61</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>41</b> or <b>81</b> utilizing closed-loop algorithms implemented with a code executed by a controller (not shown) disposed in the control section <b>51</b>. Thus, a signal generated by one or more downhole sensors may be analyzed, and one or more downhole actuators may be piloted based on the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically depicts a wireline tool, it will be appreciated from the following discussion of the different embodiments, the tools or the methods according to the invention are not limited to wireline deployment, but may be deployed in any other conventional manner such as via coiled tubing, drill pipe, etc. In addition, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a side wall coring tool, the tools or the methods according to the invention are not limited to side wall coring tools, but may be implemented in any other coring tools known to those skilled in the art, such as in-line coring tool for example.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to one aspect of this disclosure, the tool <b>11</b> extracts downhole an aliquot of hydrocarbon for chemical analysis, as further detailed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C. In one exemplary application, the tool <b>11</b> is utilized in a reservoir containing bitumen or heavy oil. Bitumen and heavy oil usually contain significant quantities of asphaltenes which constitute the highest molar mass of the hydrocarbon material. Asphaltenes comprise polar molecules and are soluble in aromatic solvents but not in alkane solvents. Asphaltenes are also &#x201c;self-associating&#x201d; and form aggregates which increase hydrocarbon viscosity. Thus, knowledge of the chemical structure and molar fraction of asphaltenes in a formation hydrocarbon material would provide valuable insight as to the viability of various production strategies that might be utilized to extract heavy oil and/or bitumen from the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a downhole tool <b>110</b> is shown schematically deployed in a wellbore <b>112</b> of a formation F containing for example heavy oil or bitumen. The apparatus is provided with a coring tool <b>116</b>, similar to the coring tool <b>71</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The coring tool <b>116</b> includes a coring bit <b>124</b>, similar to the coring bit <b>21</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to obtain core samples from locations about F&#x2032;. The cores <b>132</b> are retracted into the tool as shown schematically by the arrow <b>133</b>. As shown schematically by the arrow <b>135</b>, the cores are placed in a processing chamber <b>134</b>, similar to the processing chamber <b>37</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. According to this embodiment, the core is processed to separate formation rock from reservoir fluid. The rock may be analyzed, e.g. by spectrometry, for characterizing at least partially its elemental composition. As an example, the existence of some trace elements may be useful for determining what geologic processes formed the rock, e.g. volcanic, sedimentation, etc. After the reservoir fluid is separated from the rock, and the rock may be ejected from the chamber <b>134</b> as shown schematically by <b>127</b>, or may be stored into the tool as further detailed below. The extracted reservoir fluid is delivered to a sample retrieval chamber <b>138</b>, similar to the fluid storage chamber <b>63</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, via a flowline <b>139</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a portion of the coring apparatus <b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> in more details. The coring apparatus <b>116</b> comprises a coring assembly <b>125</b> disposed next to an aperture <b>117</b> in the housing of the coring tool <b>116</b>. The coring assembly <b>125</b> can be pivoted into a coring position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). The coring assembly <b>125</b> includes a coring bit <b>124</b> that can be rotated within and extended from the coring assembly <b>125</b> and into the formation wall. The coring assembly is used to cut and sever a core, as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the core <b>132</b> may further be captured by the tool. The coring bit <b>124</b> and the core are retracted into the coring assembly <b>125</b>. The coring assembly <b>125</b> is pivoted into the core ejection position. A core pusher <b>126</b> may slide through the coring assembly <b>125</b> and through the coring bit <b>124</b> for ejecting the core, for example into the processing chamber <b>134</b>. The processing chamber <b>134</b> receives the core <b>132</b> through an inlet <b>134</b><i>a</i>. The core <b>132</b> may transit (with means not shown) within the processing chamber <b>134</b> to an outlet <b>134</b><i>b </i>of the processing chamber <b>134</b>, and may be disposed for example into a dump chamber <b>145</b>. The dump chamber may be filled with air or other convenient buffer fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the processing chamber comprises valves <b>140</b>, <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, disposed along the processing chamber. The valves provide a fluid lock between the wellbore <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) and the dump chamber <b>145</b>. As the core is captured within the drill bit <b>124</b>, the core is usually surrounded by wellbore fluid. Before the core is ejected into the processing chamber, the valve <b>141</b> is closed and the valve <b>140</b> is open. As the core is introduced into the processing chamber <b>134</b>, the wellbore fluid may be evacuated from the processing chamber through the flow line <b>146</b>, disposed between the processing chamber and the wellbore. The valves <b>140</b> and <b>143</b> are then closed, isolating thereby the core from the wellbore fluid. Thus, the processing chamber may be sealed from the wellbore fluid. The valve <b>141</b> may then be opened, allowing the core <b>132</b> to slide into the processing chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The fluid trapped in the core <b>132</b> may be separated from the core. The core may be ground into pieces with a grinder or mill <b>150</b>, disposed in the processing chamber <b>134</b>. The methods of separating the reservoir fluid from the formation rock may include mobility enhancement techniques. These techniques include delivering heat to the ground core, for example using a heater <b>151</b>. The heater <b>151</b> may be a resistive heater, a radio or micro-wave source directed at the sample, an ultrasonic source, or a chemical reactor. Alternatively or additionally, the mobility enhancement techniques include delivering a solvent, such as a polar liquid, to the ground core. In this example, additional tool components such as solvent storage containers <b>153</b> and membranes <b>154</b> to separate reservoir fluid solute from solvent may be required. The semi-permeable membrane <b>154</b> solely permits passage of the solvent. Other separation methods could be used so long as they do not subject the formation substance sample to conditions that could result in degradation. For example, the separation of solute from solvent may be accomplished by distillation at ambient or below ambient pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The fluid that has been separated from the ground core may be analyzed with a viscosity sensor <b>161</b>, or with a spectrometer <b>163</b>, disposed along the flowline <b>139</b>. The fluid may be discarded in the wellbore (not shown) or stored in the chamber <b>138</b> for later analysis in an uphole facility. Alternatively, the hydrocarbon in the core cuttings may be analyzed before the fluid is separated from the ground core.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to an alternative embodiment of reservoir sample collection and grinding, a drill and auger (Archimedes screw) fitted with a collection hopper may be used. Samples collected with this apparatus consist of a mixture of hydrocarbon and crumbled rock.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a downhole tool <b>210</b> deployed in a wellbore <b>212</b> of a formation F. The tool is equipped with a coring module <b>216</b> which includes a coring bit <b>224</b> for extracting core samples from location F&#x2032; in formation F. The coring module may be similar to the coring module <b>71</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the coring bit <b>224</b> is optionally surrounded by an annular packer or seal <b>225</b>. The annular packer <b>225</b> establishes an exclusive fluid communication between a portion of the wellbore wall and internal components of the downhole tool <b>210</b>. Thus, using the coring module <b>216</b>, the hydrocarbon viscosity may be reduced by injecting a solvent into the formation at location F&#x2032;. The injection fluid may be passed through a flowline <b>239</b> connected to a storage and/or processing module (similar to the fluid storage section <b>61</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). From the foregoing, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the coring module <b>216</b> can also be used to collect flowable fluid directly from the formation and pass that fluid via a flowline <b>239</b> or another flow line (not shown) to the storage and/or processing module.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the coring bit <b>224</b> is preferably arranged to swivel from horizontal to vertical so that core holders (<b>300</b>, <b>300</b>&#x2032;, described in more detail hereinafter) containing the cores (e.g. <b>302</b>, <b>302</b>&#x2032;) can be stored in a vertical storage rack <b>226</b> which is illustrated as being located below the coring module <b>216</b>. The core holders <b>300</b> and <b>300</b>&#x2032; may later be stored in the storage vessel <b>282</b>, similar to the storage section <b>41</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref> show the downhole tool <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> in more details. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref> show one implementation of the storage rack <b>226</b> and core holders <b>300</b>, <b>300</b>&#x2032;. In this embodiment, the downhole tool is capable of flushing the captured cores, as explained below. For facilitating the flushing, the mobility of the fluid trapped in the pores of the captured core may be enhanced with various means, including providing heat and providing a solvent. The fluid extracted from the core may be stored in a downhole storage chamber and brought back at the surface for analysis. Alternatively, sensors, such has vibrating sensor <b>251</b>, may provide the density and the viscosity of the flushed fluid at a plurality of temperatures. Moreover, the flushing operation may be controlled based on the measurements performed by a sensor, such as optical sensor <b>252</b>, as further detailed below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the downhole tool <b>210</b> is shown when the coring module <b>216</b> is in the coring position. The coring bit <b>224</b> is rotated and extended into the formation F, cutting thereby the core <b>302</b> about the location F&#x2032; in the formation F. The coring operation continues until the core <b>302</b> has a sufficient length. Next, the core <b>302</b> is severed from the formation F. Note that while coring, the core holder <b>300</b> is secured in the downhole tool <b>210</b> with means not shown, and is disposed for receiving the core <b>302</b> when the core pusher <b>230</b> slides vertically through the coring module <b>216</b> and the core bit <b>224</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). The core holder <b>300</b> is located on top of another core holder <b>300</b>&#x2032;, containing another core <b>302</b>&#x2032;, captured previously by the downhole tool <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the downhole tool <b>210</b> is shown when the coring module <b>216</b> is in the ejection position with the core pusher <b>230</b> being in the extended position. The core pusher is used for ejecting the core <b>302</b> from the coring bit <b>224</b>, and introducing the core <b>302</b> into the core holder <b>300</b>. The core pusher <b>230</b> may further be used for displacing the core holder <b>300</b> downward, from a receiving position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) to a testing position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In this embodiment, the core pusher <b>230</b> is provided with a seal <b>232</b>, such as an O-ring, disposed at a distal end of the core pusher. The seal <b>232</b> is adapted for sliding tightly into an opening of the core holders. Thus, the top of the core <b>302</b> may be hermetically isolated from the wellbore fluid as the distal end of the core pusher <b>230</b> is introduced into the core holder <b>300</b>. The core pusher <b>230</b> is also provided with a flow line <b>239</b><i>a</i>, that may be in fluid communication with a fluid actuation device, such as a pump, and a fluid storage chamber. The fluid storage chamber may be filled at the surface with a flushing fluid, and may be used for conveying the flushing fluid downhole. The core pusher <b>230</b> may be provided with a porous layer <b>233</b>, affixed to the distal end of the core pusher and proximate to an outlet of the flow line <b>239</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the flushing fluid may be passed through the flow line <b>239</b><i>a</i>, diffuse through the porous layer <b>233</b>, and be injected into the core <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The core holder <b>300</b>, <b>300</b>&#x2032; are each provided with at least one conduit <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>&#x2032;, disposed at a lower end of the core holder. The core holder <b>300</b>, <b>300</b>&#x2032; may optionally include a porous layer <b>311</b>, <b>311</b>&#x2032; respectively, affixed to the core holder and located proximate an inlet of the conduit <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>&#x2032;. In the testing position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), an outlet of the conduit <b>310</b> is located about a seal <b>250</b>, such as an O-ring, disposed on the storage rack <b>226</b>. The seal <b>250</b> establishes an exclusive fluid communication between an interior of the core holder <b>300</b> and a flow line <b>239</b><i>b </i>of the downhole tool <b>210</b>. Thus, formation fluid trapped in the pores of the core <b>302</b> may flow through a porous layer <b>311</b>, exit the core holder <b>300</b> through the conduit <b>310</b>, and be collected by the downhole tool <b>210</b> via the flow line <b>239</b><i>b</i>. The collected fluid may be analyzed in situ with sensors <b>251</b> and/or <b>252</b> disposed on the flow line <b>239</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively or additionally, the collected fluid may be stored in a fluid storage chamber located in the downhole tool <b>210</b>, and may be retrieved at the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, a selectively extendable packer <b>240</b> is mounted in an interior of the storage rack <b>226</b>. The extendable packer <b>240</b> may be a compression packer for example. The extendable packer <b>240</b> is shown in a retracted position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> and in an extended position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. In the retracted position, the extendable packer is adapted for facilitating the downward displacement of the core holder <b>300</b>. In the extended position, the packer <b>240</b> is adapted for applying a pressure on a lateral surface (preferably deformable) of the core holder <b>300</b>. By applying a pressure on the lateral surface of the core holder, flushing fluid flow bypass around the core <b>302</b> may be reduced. In other words, flushing fluid may not easily flow between the flow line <b>239</b><i>a </i>and the conduit <b>310</b> without diffusing through the core <b>302</b>. Thus, the flushing fluid migrates through the rock of the core <b>302</b>, and pushes the formation fluid towards the flow line <b>239</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the case the core <b>302</b> contains a hydrocarbon with very low mobility, the downhole tool <b>210</b> may be provided with one or more mobility enhancement means. For example, the storage rack may include a heat source <b>241</b>. The heat source is preferably well thermally coupled to the core <b>302</b>. In another example, heat is provided by the flow line <b>239</b><i>a </i>in the form of a hot flushing fluid, such as hot water. Alternatively a heat source, such as a resistive coil, may be disposed at the distal end of the core pusher <b>230</b>. In yet another example, the flushing fluid is a solvent that, when mixed with the core hydrocarbon, reduces its viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">An optical sensor <b>252</b> may be provided on the flow line <b>239</b><i>b</i>. The optical sensor may be used to advantage for monitoring the flushing process, amongst other uses. The flushing fluid is preferably clear (colorless): examples of flushing fluid include water, toluene, dichloroethane, dichloromethane, etc. . . . A clear flushing fluid provides a strong optical contrast with oil, which is typically dark in color. This contrast makes the detection of the presence of flushing fluid in the flow line <b>239</b><i>b </i>possible. When flushing fluid is detected in sufficient quantity or concentration in the flow line <b>239</b><i>b</i>, the flushing operation may be terminated. It should be appreciated that the flushing fluid may not displace the hydrocarbon in a piston-like manner, so the first detection of flushing fluid does not necessarily mean all the hydrocarbon has been removed. Then, the first detection of flushing fluid does not trigger automatically the termination of the flushing operation. In addition, when the flushing fluid and the oil are not miscible, slugs of oil may be selectively routed to a fluid storage chamber. The termination of the flushing process may also be determined from the volume of flushing fluid introduced in the core holder. For example, the flushing operation may be terminated when the volume of the injected fluid is in excess of one fourth of the core volume.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A density and viscosity sensor <b>251</b> may also be provided for measuring the density and viscosity of the extracted fluid. Optionally, the sensor <b>251</b> is coupled to a temperature sensor (not shown separately) so that data points representing the extracted fluid viscosity as a function of temperature are made available, for example to a surface operator. These data may be used for heating and sampling the formation F with a conventional sampling tool.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the flushing of the core <b>302</b> is finished, or as desired, the core pusher <b>230</b> is retracted back into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. A new core holder <b>300</b>&#x2033;, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, is then made available for receiving a new core, as indicated by arrows <b>260</b>. Operations may be repeated at the same depth of interest or at another depth, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. If desired, the core may be stored. Alternatively, the core may be ground into pieces (e.g. together with its holder), using a grinder similar to the grinder <b>150</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, and ejected into the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It should be understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>, <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C are shown for illustration purposes. In particular, while a side-wall coring tool is depicted, fluid extraction can similarly be achieved with an in-line coring tool. For example, a portion of the core located in the core barrel may be flushed and the formation fluid captured into one or more fluid storage chambers and/or analyzed downhole. The flushing process may also be enhanced by delivering heat or solvent, for example, to the core located in the core barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, the invention is not limited to reservoirs having a hydrocarbon fluid with low or very low mobility, such as heavy oil, bitumen or oil shale reservoirs. For example, the disclosed methods and apparatuses may be used to advantage for evaluating any underground formation, and in particular formations where drilling fluid invasion does not preclude reservoir hydrocarbon in the captured cores. In this case, the hydrocarbon may be extracted or analyzed downhole from captured cores. Otherwise, the most mobile or volatile components of the reservoir hydrocarbon contained initially in the core may leave it as the core is brought up to surface, thus compromising a subsequent analysis of the reservoir hydrocarbon in a laboratory.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, the disclosure is not limited to extracting hydrocarbons by grinding or flushing a core. Other extraction mechanisms, such as lowering the pressure or increasing the temperature may be used, in particular for initiating a phase transition (vaporization) of a portion of the hydrocarbon trapped the core. Still further, the disclosure is not limited to the use of one particular solvent and/or the use of a particular mechanism for providing heat for increasing the mobility of hydrocarbon trapped in a core. Various solvents may be carried downhole, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, nitrogen, toluene, dichloroethane and delivered to the core, as needed. Heat may alternatively be generated downhole by an exothermic reaction, ultrasonic emitters, etc. . . .</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to another aspect of this disclosure, the tool <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is capable of performing downhole tests on the core <b>23</b>. For example, the tool <b>11</b> may be capable of measuring the dielectric constant of the core, as further described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. In one exemplary application, the tool <b>11</b> is utilized for evaluating a reservoir containing a hydrocarbon that may be heated with electro-magnetic waves in the radio or microwave range. The frequency of absorption may change significantly from a reservoir to another. The absorption of electro-magnetic waves may be inferred from the measurement of the dielectric constant at a plurality of frequencies. Thus, knowledge of the formation dielectric constant as a function of frequency would provide valuable insight as to the viability of heating strategies based on electro-magnetic radiations. Also, the tool <b>11</b> may be capable of measuring the thermal properties of the core, as further described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In another exemplary application, the tool <b>11</b> is utilized in a reservoir containing a hydrocarbon having a mobility that can be increased by heating the formation. These reservoirs usually have significant variation in thermal properties. Taking into account the finite heating power available, the thermal properties have a large impact on the speed at which a given volume of oil can be heated above a temperature threshold, e.g. large thermal diffusivity being favorable. Thus, knowledge of the thermal diffusivity of a formation, amongst other formation characteristics, would provide valuable insight as to the viability of heating strategies that might be utilized to mobilize hydrocarbon in the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a sensor capable of measuring the dielectric constant of a core is provided. The value of the dielectric constant provided by the sensor may be used, for example, to determine a frequency range suitable for heating the formation with electro-magnetic waves, as further detailed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a portion of a core pusher <b>330</b> and core holders <b>300</b><i>a</i>, <b>300</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; according to this disclosure. The core pusher <b>330</b> and the core holders <b>300</b><i>a</i>, <b>300</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>may be used as part of the downhole tool <b>210</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the core holder <b>300</b><i>a </i>is stacked on top of a core holder <b>300</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>, in a configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. For example, the core holders <b>300</b><i>a </i>and <b>300</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>may be disposed in a storage rack (not shown), similar to the storage rack <b>226</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A distal end <b>370</b> of the core pusher <b>330</b> is adapted for ejecting a core <b>302</b> from a coring bit and engaging the core <b>302</b> into the core holder <b>300</b><i>a</i>, in a similar way as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. The distal end <b>370</b> comprises a conductive (e.g. metallic) cap <b>357</b>, configured for electrical coupling with an opening <b>380</b> of the core holder <b>300</b><i>a</i>. The distal end <b>370</b> may further comprise one or more small conduit <b>312</b> for facilitating the expulsion of wellbore fluid as the distal end is introduced in the core holder. The distal end <b>370</b> of the core pusher <b>330</b> is provided with two antennae <b>350</b> and <b>351</b>, e.g. semi circular loops, connected to electronics in the downhole tool via wires <b>339</b>. The other side of the antennae is electrically coupled, e.g. welded, to the cap <b>357</b>. The antennae are disposed around a conductive (e.g. metallic) core <b>356</b>, and are embedded into a tore <b>355</b> having a low magnetic susceptibility. For example, the tore <b>355</b> may be made of plastic material. The conductive core <b>356</b> is made preferably flush with the tore <b>355</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The core holder <b>300</b><i>a </i>is adapted for receiving the core <b>302</b>. The core holder <b>300</b><i>a </i>is further configured for providing, in combination with the cap <b>357</b>, a conductive enclosure around the core <b>302</b> and the antennae <b>350</b>, and <b>351</b>. Thus, the core holder <b>300</b><i>a </i>is preferably made of conductive material (e.g. metal). Optionally, the core holder <b>300</b><i>a </i>may comprise one or more conduit <b>310</b><i>a </i>for evacuating the wellbore fluid as the core <b>302</b> is inserted into the core holder <b>300</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is apparent that the core holder <b>300</b><i>a </i>and the core pusher end <b>370</b> are configured as to behave like an electro-magnetic resonator. The cavity of the resonator includes the core <b>302</b>, therefore, the core dielectric constant may determine at least in part the resonance frequencies of this resonator. Thus, the resonance frequencies of the resonator may be characterized and the core dielectric constants may be computed from the characterization. For example, a microwave vector analyzer is coupled to the antennae <b>350</b> and <b>351</b> via the wires <b>339</b>, for measuring the complex transmission and reflection coefficients of the cavity, as a function of frequency. The microwave vector analyzer may be operated in the radio to microwave frequency range, in particular between approximately one kilohertz and approximately one gigahertz. A plurality of resonances are detected from the transmission and reflection coefficients. The resonance frequencies and their associated quality factors are related to an inductance characteristic L of the cavity and to two capacitance characteristics C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>2 </sub>of the cavity. The inductance characteristic L and the capacitance characteristic C<sub>1 </sub>are related to the tore <b>355</b> and may be measured in a laboratory. The capacitance C<sub>2 </sub>is related to the complex dielectric constant &#x2208; of the core <b>302</b>, and its length l. Thus, knowing the inductance characteristic L, the capacitance characteristics C<sub>1 </sub>and the core length l, it possible to compute the complex permittivity of the core at the detected resonance frequencies, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a graph comprising the calculated value of the complex dielectric constant &#x2208; of the core, as measured for example with the sensor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The complex dielectric constant &#x2208; comprises a real part &#x2208;&#x2032; and an imaginary part &#x2208;&#x2033; plotted along the y axis, as a function of frequency F plotted along the x axis. Using the sensor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the real part of the dielectric constant of the core is computed at a plurality of resonance frequencies, and shown by numeral <b>401</b><i>a</i>, <b>401</b><i>b</i>, <b>401</b><i>c </i>. . . <b>401</b><i>k</i>, <b>401</b><i>l</i>. The imaginary part of the dielectric constant of the core is also computed, and shown by numeral <b>401</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>, <b>401</b>&#x2032;<i>b </i>. . . <b>401</b>&#x2032;<i>k</i>, <b>401</b>&#x2032;<i>l</i>. These points define a first cure <b>411</b> and a second curve <b>411</b>&#x2032;. These curves may be used to determine a range <b>421</b>, at which the formation (in which the core has been formed) efficiently propagates and absorbs electro-magnetic waves and converts the electro-magnetic energy into heat.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Hereafter it is assumed in this analysis that the captured core is representative of the formation surrounding the location from which the core has been taken. If that is not the case, corrections may be applied to the measurement on the core for better representing the formation characteristics. Preferably, the frequency range <b>421</b> is at a low frequency. At low frequencies, the electro-magnetic waves propagate deeper in the formation, and may thereby heat a larger volume of formation. However, the frequency range <b>421</b> should be at a high enough frequency so that the imaginary part of the dielectric constant (shown by the curve <b>411</b>&#x2032;) has sufficient amplitude. At the frequencies where the imaginary part of the dielectric constant has high amplitude, the formation absorbs the electro-magnetic waves and converts them into heat.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In one example, the techniques described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> are used in a reservoir containing heavy oil. As well known in the art, heavy oils usually contain a significant portion of asphaltenes. Oils containing asphaltenes have a dielectric constant that varies significantly with many parameters, such as frequency, pressure and temperature. Thus, the dependency of the dielectric constant of heavy oil is generally unknown. This dependency can be measured in situ, preferably at the reservoir pressure and temperature, with the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The knowledge of the dependency of the dielectric constant as a function of frequency can be utilized in real time, for example for determining a frequency range at which the reservoir oil may transmit and absorbs electro-magnetic waves. Thus, an electro-magnetic tool (not shown), optionally part of the tool string <b>11</b>, may be tuned accordingly for heating the formation F (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As the temperature of the formation increases, the mobility of the heavy oil also increases, and a conventional sampling tool may be used for capturing a sample of mobilized oil in a storage chamber and/or analyzing the formation oil in situ.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that measurements of the dielectric constant of cores may be useful even if the fluid trapped in the core is not heavy oil. For example, a core may be flushed with various fluids downhole and the impact on the core dielectric constant may be computed. The results may be used to advantage in an earth formation model, for correlating oil saturations to electro-magnetic measurements. Alternatively or additionally, dielectric constant characteristics measured downhole may be used for evaluating production strategies involving electro-magnetic heating.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an alternate embodiment of a sensor for measuring thermal characteristics of a core is disclosed. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a sensor capable of measuring the thermal diffusivity and/or the volumetric heat capacity of the core is affixed to the core pusher <b>530</b>. The value of the thermal diffusivity and/or the volumetric heat capacity provided by the sensor may be used, for example, to determine a thermal model of the formation. A thermal model of the formation may in turn be used for evaluating the performance of a heating tool coupled to the formation, the performance of a production scheme, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a portion of a core pusher <b>530</b> and core holders <b>300</b><i>b</i>, <b>300</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;, that may be used as part of the downhole tool <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). The core holder <b>300</b><i>b </i>is adapted for receiving the core <b>302</b>. The core holder <b>300</b><i>b </i>may be configured for providing a thermally insulated enclosure around the core <b>302</b>. Alternatively, the storage rack <b>226</b> holding the core holder <b>300</b><i>b </i>and <b>300</b>&#x2032;<i>b </i>may be configured for providing a thermal insulation around a lateral surface of the core holder <b>300</b><i>b</i>. Optionally, the core holder <b>300</b><i>b </i>may comprise one or more conduit <b>310</b><i>b </i>for evacuating the wellbore fluid as the core <b>302</b> is inserted into the core holder <b>300</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A distal end <b>570</b> of the core pusher is adapted for ejecting a core <b>302</b> from a coring bit and engaging the core <b>302</b> into the core holder <b>300</b><i>b </i>through an opening <b>580</b> of the core holder <b>300</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). The distal end <b>570</b> of the core pusher <b>530</b> is provided with a resistive wire <b>550</b>, e.g. a platinum wire, embedded in a ceramic block <b>555</b>. The resistive wire <b>550</b> is connected at three locations <b>551</b>, <b>552</b> and <b>553</b>, to electronics in the downhole tool via wires <b>539</b><i>a</i>, <b>539</b><i>b</i>, and <b>539</b><i>c </i>respectively. The distal end <b>570</b> also comprises a cap <b>557</b>, preferably made of a material having a low thermal conductivity. The distal end <b>570</b> may further comprise one or more small conduit <b>512</b> for facilitating the expulsion of wellbore fluid as the distal end is introduced in the core holder.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In operation, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may be utilized as follows. In one example, a large electric current is controllably flowed through the wire <b>550</b> for a short duration, for example between locations <b>551</b> and <b>553</b>. The current pulse may produce a transient heat source. Preferably, one of the core holder <b>300</b><i>b </i>and the storage rack <b>226</b> prevent heat diffusion across the lateral surface of the core holder <b>300</b><i>b</i>. Preferably again, the cap <b>557</b> prevents the diffusion of heat above the core <b>302</b>. Thus, heat energy produced by the wire diffuses predominantly in the ceramic and in the core.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one embodiment, the resistance of the wire <b>550</b> is correlated to its temperature, and a Wheatstone bridge may be used for measuring the resistance of the wire <b>550</b> after the current pulse has been generated. The resistance of the wire between location <b>551</b> and <b>552</b>, R<sub>1</sub>(t), is measured at a plurality of time samples and recorded. Additionally, the resistance of the platinum wire between location <b>551</b> and <b>553</b>, R<sub>2</sub>(t), may be measured at a plurality of time samples and recorded. The thermal diffusivity of the core &#x3ba;, equal to the ratio of the thermal conductivity &#x3bb; by the volumetric heat capacity C<sub>p </sub>may be inferred from the measured values of R<sub>1</sub>(t) and R<sub>2</sub>(t) utilizing an inversion model. The inversion model may be determined by using Finite Element Analysis modeling, and/or using procedures similar to those described for the measurement of the thermal conductivity of a molten metal with a hot wire described in Int. J. Thermophys 2006, vol 27, pages 92-102. Also, the volumetric heat capacity C<sub>p </sub>may be inferred from the measured values of R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>after stabilization, and the calculated heat energy generated during the current pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">While methods using a thermally insulated (adiabatically enclosed) core in a container have been described, the volumetric heat capacity or thermal diffusivity may be measured even if heat losses out of the core are significant. However, it may be useful to take heat losses into account in the analysis. For example, heat losses may be calibrated in a controlled environment and the calibration may be used when interpreting downhole measurements. Also, while techniques using a transient heat source have been described, a steady state heat source may alternatively be used for determining the heat capacity and the thermal diffusivity. Further, instead of using the resistance of a platinum wire for measuring a temperature indicative of the temperature field in the core, one or more temperature sensor, distinct from a heat source, may be implemented. Still further, while techniques using two measurements of the wire resistivity are useful to minimize end-effects, that is, the finite length of the wire, from the interpretation, a single measurement of the wire resistivity may be sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The thermal diffusivity and volumetric heat capacity of the core is usually representative of the thermal diffusivity and volumetric heat capacity of the formation from which it has been extracted. The knowledge of the thermal diffusivity of the formation, amongst other characteristics, may be used to advantage for evaluating thermal production of the hydrocarbon contained in the formation F, such as production by steam injection, by resistive heating, etc. In particular, this knowledge may be useful for determining a method of heating the formation and sampling the formation fluid with a conventional sampling tool.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">According to yet another aspect of this disclosure, the tool string <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may further be configured for individually sealing each core sample in its own container. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>A, and <b>9</b>B illustrate individually sealed core sample containers which are based on the core holders that may be provided by the tool string <b>11</b>. The sealing methods described hereafter preserve the petrophysical characteristics of core samples taken from formations when the samples would otherwise undergo contamination by wellbore fluids while being brought to the surface. The sealing methods are also useful in situations where the seals prevent or minimize loss of the hydrocarbon trapped in the core samples.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a cylindrical core holder <b>300</b> is illustrated in section. The core holder <b>300</b> surrounds a core sample <b>302</b> containing formation hydrocarbon trapped in the pores of the formation rock. The core holder <b>300</b> has a closed end <b>304</b> and the opposite end <b>305</b> is normally open to receive the core sample from the coring bit. According to this embodiment, after the core sample <b>302</b> is captured in the core holder <b>300</b>, a seal cap <b>306</b> is applied to seal the open end <b>305</b>. This effectively creates a sealed vessel. In some cases, one or more elastomeric cap <b>306</b> is provided in the downhole tool and may be inserted in the open end of the core holder. In other cases, a liquid resin or other polymer may be delivered at the top of the core by the downhole tool, using for example the flowline <b>239</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, and may be cured downhole. The sealed core holder <b>300</b> may then be placed in storage (e.g. <b>41</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, according to this embodiment, an annular seal <b>308</b> is provided at the closed end <b>304</b> of the core holder <b>300</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, it will be appreciated that the storage rack(s) <b>226</b> are arranged to stack core holders <b>300</b>, <b>300</b>&#x2032;, etc. end to end. Thus, when core holder <b>300</b> is stacked against core holder <b>300</b>&#x2032; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the seal <b>308</b> of the core holder <b>300</b> is interposed between the closed end <b>304</b> of the holder <b>300</b> and the wall of the core holder <b>300</b>&#x2032; located near the open end <b>305</b>&#x2032; of the core holder <b>300</b>&#x2032;. The seal <b>308</b> may be formed from an elastomer and may be an O-ring. It will be noted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> that both core containers <b>300</b> and <b>300</b>&#x2032; are provided with seals <b>308</b>, <b>308</b>&#x2032;. Many core holders can be stacked end to end in a storage rack. Optionally, one or more seal cap <b>306</b>, <b>306</b>&#x2032; may be provided in addition to the annular seals <b>308</b>, <b>308</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> show another embodiment for sealing individually a core in its own container. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the closed end <b>354</b> of core holder <b>300</b><i>d </i>is machined to form an interlocking step which is dimensioned to mate with the open end <b>305</b>&#x2032; of another similarly configured core holder such as the core holder <b>300</b>&#x2032;<i>d </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. The step <b>354</b> is also advantageously provided with an annular elastomeric seal (e.g. O-ring) <b>358</b> (<b>358</b>&#x2032;).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the step <b>354</b> with seal <b>358</b> of the core holder <b>300</b><i>d </i>interlocks with the open end <b>305</b>&#x2032; of the core holder <b>300</b>&#x2032;<i>d</i>. Optionally, the open end <b>305</b>&#x2032; (<b>305</b>) may also be provided with a seal, thereby providing a double seal between core holders. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in this embodiment, the topmost core holder, e.g. <b>300</b><i>d </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, will be left with an open end <b>305</b>. If desired, this situation may be remedied by sealing the open end <b>305</b> in the manner described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Alternatively, a cap having a step like the steps <b>354</b> (<b>354</b>&#x2032;) may be provided to seal the open end <b>305</b> of the core holder <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Independently of the embodiment used to achieve individually sealed cores, storage for up to fifty core holders (each containing a 38 mm diameter by 100 mm long core) may be provided in the tool string <b>11</b>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that fifty cores of such dimension, assuming a formation porosity of 20%, will yield approximately 1.2 liters of formation hydrocarbon. This volume of fluid is usually sufficient for providing an analysis of the chemical structure of the fluid and/or representative values of fluid physical properties.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">According to yet another aspect of the disclosure, core samples and/or fluid samples may be refrigerated via one or more refrigeration units. For example, cores of heavy oil, extra heavy oil or bitumen may be preserved by cooling the cores to approximately 0&#xb0; C. and maintaining them at or below that temperature until they arrive at a surface facility. The cooling is intended to immobilize the liquid hydrocarbon by increasing its viscosity. The cooling temperature is not limited to 0&#xb0; C. but may be adjusted based on the oil viscosity characteristics as a function of temperature. In another example, cores of methane hydrate may be preserved by cooling the cores to approximately &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. and maintaining them at or below that temperature. The cooling is intended to minimize phase transitions of the methane hydrate, e.g. methane sublimation. The temperature is not limited to &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. but may be adjusted based on the phase diagram of methane hydrate. In another example, the samples containing light oil or gases may be preserved by cooling the samples to approximately &#x2212;185&#xb0; C. and maintaining them at or below that temperature. The cooling is intended to decrease evaporation of potentially volatile components (such as methane, ethane, propane, etc.), by keeping them preferably in a phase less mobile than gas, that is liquid or solid. The temperature may be adjusted based on the (solid+liquid) and/or the (liquid+gas) phase transition temperatures of the sampled oil.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows a tool <b>410</b> deployed in a wellbore <b>412</b> of a formation F containing heavy oil for example. The tool <b>410</b> is fitted with a coring module <b>416</b>, similar to the coring module <b>71</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The coring module <b>416</b> includes a coring bit <b>424</b>, similar to the coring bit <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to obtain cores from locations about F&#x2032;. The cores <b>402</b> are retracted into the tool as shown schematically at <b>432</b> and placed in a core storage section <b>434</b>. Alternatively, the cores may be processed to separate formation hydrocarbon from rock. In the latter case, the rock may be ground into pieces and ejected into the wellbore <b>412</b> as shown by <b>427</b>. In the case where the hydrocarbon is separated from the rock, the hydrocarbon is transferred to fluid storage chamber <b>438</b> via a flowline <b>439</b>. Core samples and/or fluid samples are refrigerated via one or more refrigeration units shown schematically as <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows one implementation of the tool <b>410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> in more details. According to this embodiment, the rails upon which the core holders rest are cooled. Rails <b>500</b>, <b>501</b> are disposed in the storage section <b>434</b> and utilized for holding a plurality of core, <b>302</b>, <b>302</b>&#x2032;, <b>302</b>&#x2033;, etc. The cores may be provided with core holders such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B. The rails are fabricated to include a flowline (not shown) which runs through the rails. In the storage section, the rails are made of a material having a high thermal conductivity so that heat may be drawn from the cores. Coolant from a refrigeration system <b>440</b> is circulated through the rails <b>500</b>, <b>501</b> with a pump <b>449</b>, as indicated by arrows <b>502</b>. Thus, the tool <b>410</b> is capable of cooling the cores. It should be appreciated that although two rails are depicted, any number of rails may be used. Furthermore, while the rails <b>500</b>, <b>501</b> are depicted as straight rails, rails having for example a helical shape may also be used. Optionally, an insulating enclosure <b>504</b>, such as a Dewar flask, may be provided in the storage section <b>434</b> for reducing the flux of heat towards the stored cored <b>300</b>, <b>300</b>&#x2032;, <b>300</b>&#x2033;, etc. . . .</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the refrigeration system <b>440</b> comprises a heat pump <b>442</b> having a cold end <b>441</b> in thermal communication with the rails <b>500</b>, <b>501</b>. For example, a heat exchanger (not shown) may be disposed between the rails <b>500</b>, <b>501</b> and the cold end of the heat pump <b>442</b>. The heat pump <b>442</b> also comprises a hot end <b>443</b> that is in thermal communication with the wellbore fluid via one or more opening <b>444</b> in a housing <b>417</b> of the tool <b>410</b>. Heat absorbed by the heat pump is dissipated in the wellbore fluid. Preferably, the heat pump <b>442</b> is implemented as a thermoacoustic cooling system such as that disclosed in previously incorporated [20.3041]. A thermoacoustic cooling system uses a loudspeaker to generate high acoustic pressure waves at a resonant frequency of a cavity to compress (and decompress) a refrigerant. When the refrigerant is decompressed by the loudspeaker, it cools down and moves toward the cold end. Conversely, when the refrigerant is compressed by the loudspeaker, it heats up and moves toward the hot end. When the refrigerant oscillates back and forth, heat is transferred from the cold end <b>441</b> of the heat pump <b>442</b> to the hot end <b>443</b> of the heat pump, optionally through a stack of thermally conductive plates disposed between the cold and hot ends of the heat pump. However, other kind of heat pump or heat sink may be used in the tool <b>410</b>, including thermoelectric refrigerator, refrigerator functioning by isentropic gas expansion, heat pump or heat sinks based on enthalpy of phase transition, refrigerator utilizing a magneto-caloric effect, and the like. For example, the heat pump <b>442</b> may be implemented with a Stirling refrigeration system. Thus, while particular types of refrigerators have been disclosed, it will be understood other types of refrigeration apparatus may be used instead.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, another implementation of the tool <b>410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is shown into more details. In this example, the insulating enclosure <b>504</b> can be selectively sealed from the wellbore fluid with a fluid lock comprising valves <b>591</b> and <b>592</b>. The valves <b>591</b> and <b>592</b> are sequentially operated as to introduce a captured core <b>432</b> successively in a lock chamber <b>593</b> (as illustrated for the core <b>300</b>) and in the storage section <b>434</b> (as illustrated for the cores <b>300</b>&#x2032;, <b>300</b>&#x2033;). The cooling fluid is circulated from an end of the cooling flowline <b>501</b>&#x2032;, in the insulating enclosure <b>504</b> and around the cores, and then to one end of the cooling flow line <b>500</b>&#x2032;, as indicated by the arrows <b>502</b>. Thus the entire storage section <b>434</b>, including the stored cores, may be maintained at a desired temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In substitution to the two refrigeration methods detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B and 10C</figref>, other refrigeration methods may alternatively be used. For example, each core holder (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9B</figref>) can be fitted with a small refrigeration system such as a thermoelectric (Peltier Effect) refrigeration system. In this case, the core holder may include two dissimilar metals. A direct current may be coupled to the core holder, decreasing thereby the temperature at the metal junction and cooling the core.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a method of evaluating a reservoir according to yet another aspect of this disclosure is illustrated via a simplified flow chart. Starting at <b>600</b>, a tool assembly is lowered into the wellbore. The assembly may include one or more of the embodiments described above. The embodiments described above may be combined in any suitable way. For example, individually sealable core holder may be provided together with a refrigerating system, sensor for measuring core characteristics may be combined with devices for core flushing, and so on. Optionally, other tools such as conventional formation fluid sampling tools, heating tool, formation evaluation tools, etc, may be provided in the tool assembly. Furthermore, it will be understood that the tools of the disclosure may be additionally provided with functionalities known in the art that were not described here for the sake of clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The coring tool is next located at a first selected depth at <b>610</b>, which corresponds to a zone of potential interest. This selected depth may be the bottom of the wellbore in the case when an in-line coring tool is used. Usually, the reservoir at the selected depth contains a hydrocarbon of low mobility, such as heavy oil, extra heavy oil, bitumen, oil shale. However, some embodiments disclosed therein may be used to advantage in more conventional hydrocarbon reservoir, e.g. containing light oil. Thus, the coring tool could be useful in evaluating formations which contain hydrocarbons with a wide variety of viscosities. Also, the coring tool may be used in other hydrocarbon reservoirs such as methane hydrate reservoirs or coal bed methane reservoirs.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The coring tool is activated at <b>620</b> to obtain a core sample from the first zone of potential interest and the core sample is preferably captured in the tool at <b>630</b>. The depth at which a core sample is obtained may be recorded, together with an identifier of the core sample. Typically, the core sample is introduced in a core holder. However, while specific structures have been disclosed for sealing samples in core holders, it will be recognized that other sealing apparatus might be appropriate. Also, the coring tool may not provide core holders, as well known in the art. The core sample may be tested to determine whether or not it is damaged (integrity tests). Integrity tests may include density measurements, or other measurement known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Next, the method may branch to one or more of the steps <b>640</b>, <b>643</b>, <b>646</b>, and be repeated any number of times, as desired. For example, the core thermal or electrical properties may be measured (step <b>643</b>), and the hydrocarbon may be extracted from the core (step <b>640</b>). Optionally, the extracted hydrocarbon may be analyzed with a sensor disposed in the tool assembly. The core thermal or electrical properties may be measured again after the core has been flushed (step <b>643</b>). It should be understood that other combinations are within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring now to step <b>640</b>, the hydrocarbon may be extracted from the core, if desired. For example, the core may be flushed. The operation of step <b>640</b> may be repeated until a sufficient volume of fluid has been extracted. The remaining cores may be stored in the tool assembly, or discarded in the wellbore, e.g. ground and ejected from the tool. Also, the extraction or the analysis of the hydrocarbon in the core may be achieved by grinding the core as disclosed above.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Mobilizing the hydrocarbon trapped in the core may be necessary for flushing the core when the core has been formed in a methane hydrate reservoir or a heavy oil reservoir. Thus, the hydrocarbon extraction in step <b>640</b> may be assisted with heating. For example, heat may be provided to the core by irradiating the core with electro-magnetic waves in the radio or microwave range. Alternatively the core may be heated with a resistive element applied to a core surface. The core may also be submitted to ultrasonic waves capable of increasing its temperature by mechanical dissipation. Also, the core may be flushed with steam or a hot fluid, for example a hot fluid generated downhole by an exothermic reaction between two reactants conveyed in separated storage tanks in the tool assembly. These heating methods may be applied individually or in combination for mobilizing the hydrocarbon trapped in the core.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition or in substitution to heat, a solvent conveyed in the tool assembly may be provided for assisting the extraction of the hydrocarbon from the core at step <b>640</b>. In some cases a solvent may be used for extracting heavy oil or bitumen from the cores. As known in the art, bitumen and extra heavy oil usually contain significant quantities of asphaltenes which constitute the highest molar mass of the oil. Asphaltenes comprise polar molecules and are soluble in aromatic solvents but not in alkane solvents. Thus to prevent asphaltene precipitation, the solvent is preferably a polar solvent or an aromatic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring now to step <b>650</b>, the formation fluid may be analyzed. In particular, the viscosity may be measured downhole at various temperatures. This information may be of importance for evaluating a thermal recovery process for the reservoir. In some cases, this information may be used for sampling the reservoir using a heater and a conventional sampling tool disposed in the same tool assembly as the coring tool. Next, the analyzed fluid may be dumped in the wellbore or preserved in a fluid storage tank (step <b>660</b>) disposed in the tool assembly for further analysis at the earth surface.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Turning now to step <b>660</b>, the fluid may be stored in a fluid tank in the tool assembly. When the fluid is extracted with a solvent or with a fluid not miscible with the hydrocarbon, the solvent and the hydrocarbon may be separated downhole. The solvent may be recycled in the tool assembly for consecutive operations. The hydrocarbon may be stored in a separate container. Preferably, the fluid stored in a storage tank is kept in single phase, using methods known in the art or using refrigerator systems disclosed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">If desired the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may include tests of the core sample's electrical and/or thermal properties at step <b>643</b>. Electrical property tests may include determining the dielectric constant at one or more frequencies. Thermal property tests may include tests for thermal diffusivity, e.g. hot wire tests as disclosed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring now to step <b>653</b>, one or more of the electrical properties measured at step <b>643</b>, the thermal properties measured at step <b>643</b>, and the fluid properties (e.g. viscosity as a function of temperature) measured at step <b>650</b>, may be used in a formation model for determining if the fluid may be recovered by a heating process. In particular, the energy, the time or the power required for mobilizing the oil in a given volume of formation may be estimated. Temperature profiles in the formation may further be estimated and the maximum temperature may be compared to the temperature at which irreversible change may occur in the formation fluid (e.g. oil cracking). Thus, the viability of large scale production scheme or the feasibility of a conventional sampling assisted with heat delivered to the formation may be estimated. In particular, it may be determined if the tool assembly command enough power for mobilizing a sufficient volume of hydrocarbon. Also, it may be determined if the heating process may lead to sampled hydrocarbon whose chemical composition is not representative of the hydrocarbon in the reservoir, e.g. if thermal cracking has occurred prior to sampling. At step <b>663</b>, a sampling operation determined at least in part from the analysis of the recovery process detailed above may be performed with tools conveyed in the same tool assembly as the coring tool or otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">If desired the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may include preserving the core at step <b>646</b>. Preserving the core may be achieved with refrigerating the core, sealing the core or a combination of sealing and refrigerating. Other preservation methods may be used in addition to the preservation methods described above. For example, a buffer fluid may be provided between the core and the core holder, usually prior to sealing the core holder. Examples of buffer fluids include gels, cements, and polymers. Thus, the reservoir fluids trapped in the pores of the cores at the time the core was formed may remain in the core as the core is brought back to the earth surface.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">At step <b>656</b>, the cores are brought to the earth surface. In some cases, temperature sensors are used to monitor a temperature in storage sections of the tool assembly and may sense the temperature of the core or the fluid samples. The temperature may be used for controlling the heat pump and/or the refrigerant fluid pump conveyed in the tool assembly, for example to achieve a desired temperature as the samples are retrieved from the wellbore.</p>
