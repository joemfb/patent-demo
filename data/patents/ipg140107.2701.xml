<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the National Phase of international Application No. PCT/EP2010/001328, filed Mar. 3, 2010, which designated the U.S. and that International Application was published under PCT Article 21(2) in English, and claims priority to European Application No. 09003063.6, filed Mar. 3, 2009, all of which applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to pharmaceutical and cosmetical compositions as well as medical articles comprising a protease, termed debrilase, from <i>Lucilia sericata </i>for use in wound conditioning and skin care. Debrilase was identified using the larval transcriptome, i.e. mRNA preparations and conversion into cDNA, and prepared using recombinant techniques and subsequent expression in suitable host cells. The protease of the invention has fibrinolytic, ca seinolytic and PAR-2 (protease-activated receptor 2) activating activity. In one embodiment, compositions comprising debrilase are provided for the cleaning of slow or non-healing wounds from necrotic cells, tissue and fibrin cuffs, known as debridement. In another embodiment cosmetic uses of debrilase in the field of skin care and smoothening are proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention further relates to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a serine protease having the ability to cleave fibrin and casein, which is a nucleic acid molecule encoding the serine protease comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 as well as to nucleic acid molecules encoding precursors or fragments of said serine protease. Furthermore, it relates to a nucleic acid molecule comprising or consisting of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 and a nucleic acid molecule encoding a serine protease the amino acid sequence of which is at least 77%, more preferred at least 80%, even more preferred at least 85% and most preferred at least 90% identical to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3. Any of the above nucleic acids, wherein T is replaced by U are also within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this specification, a number of documents including patent applications and manufacturer's manuals are cited. The disclosure of these documents, while not considered relevant for the patentability of this invention, is herewith incorporated by reference in its entirety. More specifically, all referenced documents are incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual document was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Wound healing has three distinct phases: (1) inflammation; (2) cell migration and proliferation; and (3) remodelling. In the inflammatory phase proteases are released by cells of the immune system. Various lymphokines are secreted from neutrophils and macrophages that modulate the next phase of the wound healing. The second phase is designated proliferation phase and includes fibroblast migration, proliferation and the synthesis of new extracellular matrix molecules. These events appear to occur in a definite order where extracellular matrix molecules including fibronectin, collagen and proteoglycans are secreted into the granulation bed. The inflammatory phase peaks at 3 days. The second phase of wound healing normally peaks at approximately one to two weeks after injury and is followed by a much longer third phase of tissue remodelling that begins within weeks and may last several months. During the remodelling phase, the connective tissue matrix matures as the disorganized collagen fibers are replaced by thicker, more aligned collagen molecules. This tissue remodelling eventually contributes to the tensile strength of the wound and is sometimes accompanied by scar formation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A skin lesion virtually always involves an injury of the blood vessels. Wound healing therefore also comprises the process of coagulation, being a complex process by which blood forms clots. It is an important part of hemostasis whereby a damaged blood vessel wall is covered by a platelet and fibrin containing clot to stop bleeding and begin repair of the damaged vessel. Disorders of coagulation can lead to an increased risk of hemorrhage and/or thrombosis. Coagulation is initiated almost instantly after an injury to the blood vessel has damaged the endothelium. Platelets immediately form a hemostatic plug at the site of injury (primary hemostasis). Secondary hemostasis occurs simultaneously where coagulation factors in the blood plasma respond in a complex cascade to form fibrin strands which strengthen the platelet plug. The coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis has two pathways, the contact activation pathway (formerly known as the intrinsic pathway) and the tissue factor pathway (formerly known as the extrinsic pathway) both leading to fibrin formation. It is now known that the primary pathway for the initiation of blood coagulation is the tissue factor pathway. The pathways are a series of reactions, in which a zymogen (inactive enzyme precursor) of a serine protease and its glycoprotein co-factor are activated to become active components that then catalyze the next reaction in the cascade, ultimately resulting in cross-linked fibrin. The coagulation factors are generally serine proteases, except for FVIII and FV which are glycoproteins and Factor XIII which is a transglutaminase. The coagulation cascade is classically divided into three pathways. The tissue factor and the contact activation pathway both activate the &#x201c;final common pathway&#x201d; of factor X, thrombin and fibrin.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Fibrin is a protein involved in the clotting of blood. It is a fibrillar protein that is polymerised to form a hemostatic plug or clot&#x2014;in conjunction with platelets&#x2014;over a wound site. Fibrin is made from its zymogen fibrinogen, a soluble plasma glycoprotein that is synthesised by the liver. In the coagulation cascade the zymogen prothrombin is activated to the serine protease thrombin, which is responsible for converting fibrinogen into fibrin. Fibrin is then cross linked by factor XIII to form a clot.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Plasmin proteolytically cleaves fibrin into fibrin degradation products which inhibits excessive fibrin formation. Plasmin is generated by proteolytic cleavage of plasminogen, a plasma protein synthesized in the liver. This cleavage is catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) which is synthesized and secreted by the endothelium. Plasminogen is entrapped during clot formation and is slowly activated when the wound has stopped bleeding and the clot is broken down.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disintegration of the clot during wound healing is an important step to allow for matrix formation and remodelling as described above. It is thought that one potential cause for slow healing or chronic wounds is a lack of fibrinolysis. So called &#x201c;fibrin cuffs&#x201d;, consisting of fibrin, laminin, fibronectin, tenascin, collagen and leucocytes hamper the exchange of nutrients, growth factors and gas, leading to anoxia, ulcus formation and preventing angiogenesis. The proteolytic dissolution of these &#x201c;fibrin cuffs&#x201d; supports neovascularisation, invasion of leucocytes, migration of fibroblasts, formation of a new epithelium and induces cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, the healing of wounds is delayed by the presence of pus, tissue debris, bacteria, and exudates which can be removed by debridement agents.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Debridement is defined as the removal of non-vital tissue from wounds. In chronic wounds, debridement means the elimination of necrosis as well as the clearing away of wound dressings, foreign bodies, and other non-vital substances. Sufficient debridement represents one basic prerequisite for a non-delayed wound-healing process. In addition to treating the causal factors for delayed wound healing, debridement should be the first step in an adequate phase-adapted wound-bed preparation for chronic wounds. Different methods for debridement in chronic wounds have been described such as surgery, maggot therapy, laser, ultrasound, hydrotherapy, wet-to-dry method, autolysis, proteolytic enzymes, osmotic or chemical debridement.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Debridement agents rapidly digest necrotic tissue without injury to living cells, thereby speeding up the healing processes. The search for such debridement agents has included the employment of a wide variety of plant and animal materials, such as maggots or blowfly larvae, but also of enzymes like papain, bromelain and ananain from plant origin (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,548,556, EP 0194647 B1, U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,621), proteases from microbial origin (e.g. protease from <i>Vibrio </i>spec., U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,881; thermolysin from <i>Bacillus </i>spec., WO 03/088993 A1, US 2003/0198632 A1) and from animals (e.g. trypsin and chymotrypsin from fish, U.S. Pat. No. 6,846,485). Some debriding enzymes function as protease-inhibitors either within the coagulation cascade (thrombin inhibitory nexin-1 (PN-1), U.S. Pat. No. 5,112,608) or in the acute-phase-reaction (alpha1-antitrypsin. U.S. Pat. No. 6,262,020). The primary purpose of debriding enzymes is to clean a wound of all of the various necrotic tissue elements and to thin out tenacious exudative secretions. Appropriately applied proteolytic enzymes cleanse infected surfaces of their inflammatory exudate without harming the living tissues. They facilitate the drainage of areas of located purvulent, sanguineous and fibrinous accumulations, promote the liberation of hidden bacteria rendering them accessible to the immune defence system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The enzymatic action of debriding enzymes can be utilised for non-healing wounds (e.g. Lobmann et al., Proteases and the diabetic foot syndrome: Mechanisms and therapeutic Implications. Diabetes Care 28 (2005), 461-471), but they can also be of benefit for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and eczema and the like, and less severe skin conditions, such as wrinkles, acne and dry skin, as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,524,136; 5,439,935; 5,441,740; 5,554,366; 5,853,705 and 6,780,444. Commercial products comprising such enzymes are also available, e.g. Accuzyme&#xae; (papain) and Granulex&#xae; (trypsin), the application of which is limited for debridement of wounds.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There has been a continuing effort to find better wound debridement enzymes. Some of the criteria for a highly preferred wound debridement enzyme are at least one and preferably more such as all of the following: it should be capable of rapid digestion of fibrin, denatured collagen, elastin and exudate; it should spare normal appearing human skin tissues; it should be non-toxic and non-irritating to wounds; it should be easily prepared, stable and readily applicable. As an example, stable concentrated enzymatic compositions suitable for storage under ambient conditions, while maintaining enzymatic activity and kits comprising enzymatic compositions are described in WO 2007/074454 A2.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Several approaches for dealing with chronic wounds comprise the use of dressings keeping the wound moist to support the viability of cells of the immune system infiltrating the wound.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For wound management, the use of proteases, i.e. exo- and endopeptidases, as well as the use of protease inhibitors was proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A silicone-based device for controlled release of enzymes for the proteolytic debridement of wounds was described by Bott et al. (A silicone-based controlled-release device for accelerated proteolytic debridement of wounds, Wound Repair Regen. (2007) 15: 227-35) using a protease of the subtilisin family. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 7,368,128 describes a dressing for sustained release of debriding enzymes consisting of an absorbent material layer and a degradable polymeric material.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For centuries, maggots were known to have beneficial effects on wounds. The method of Maggot Debridement Therapy (MDT) was adopted and routinely used in the United States throughout the 1930s and early 1940s, but MDT was replaced with the introduction of penicillin and modern surgical procedures (Child F S, Roberts E F. The treatment of chronic osteomyelitis with live maggots. <i>New York State J Med </i>1931; 31: 937-43; Teich S, Myers R A M. Maggot therapy for severe skin infections. <i>South Med J </i>1986; 79: 1153-5; Church J C T. Larvae therapy in modern wound care: A review. <i>Primary Intention </i>1999; May: 63-8; Sherman R A, Hall M J R, Thomas S. Medicinal maggots: An ancient remedy for some contemporary afflictions. Ann Rev Entomol 45 (2000): 55-81, Courtenay, M. et al., Larva therapy in wound management, J. R. Soc. Med. 93 (2000): 72-74).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Application of maggots to a wound is frequently perceived as unpleasant and even painful by the patient. Nevertheless, the larvae of different insect species are utilised for the cleaning and healing of conventionally untreatable wounds. Maggots of certain fly species feed on necrotic tissue and through this debriding activity assist the healing of chronic soft-tissue wounds, such as pressure and venous stasis ulcers, diabetic foot infections, and postoperative wounds, which are resistant to surgical or antibiotic intervention (Sherman R A, 1998, Maggot debridement in modern medicine. Infect Med 15: 651-6, Sherman R A, Hall M J R, Thomas S., 2000, Medicinal maggots: An ancient remedy for some contemporary afflictions. Ann Rev Entomol 45: 55-81).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Medicinal maggots exert three main actions: 1) they debride (clean) wounds by dissolving the dead (necrotic), infected tissue; 2) they disinfect the wound, by killing bacteria; and 3) they stimulate wound healing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Horobin et al. (2006) describe MDT with <i>Lucille sericata </i>larvae or green bottle fly maggots which are applied to chronic wounds to aid healing by triggering fibroblast migration and matrix remodelling (Horobin et al., Promotion of human dermal fibroblast migration, matrix remodelling and modification of fibroblast morphology within a novel 3D model by <i>Lucilia sericata </i>larval secretions, J Invest Dermatol. 126: 1410-1418). Previously, they have characterized certain enzymatic activities present within maggot excretions/secretions (ES) (Horobin et al. 2003, Maggots and wound healing: an investigation of the effects of secretions from <i>Lucille sericata </i>larvae upon interactions between human dermal fibroblasts and extracellular matrix components. Br. J. Dermatol. 148: 923-933).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The bactericidal activity of secretions from <i>Lucille sericata </i>maggots towards typical wound colonizers such as <i>Micrococcus luteus </i>and <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>was shown using third instar larvae (Daeschlein, G. et al., 2007, In vitro antibacterial activity of <i>Lucilia sericata </i>maggot secretions, Skin Pharmacol. Physiol. 20: 112-115).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Interactions between fibroblasts and the surrounding extracellular matrix play a crucial role in tissue formation, influencing fibroblast proliferation, migration, and tissue remodelling. The postulated mechanisms by which maggots enhance tissue formation within wounds may be via the promotion of fibroblast motility, acceleration of extracellular matrix remodelling and coordination of cellular responses, providing for a wider distribution of viable fibroblasts. It was shown that <i>L. sericata </i>ES-products promoted fibroblast migration upon a fibronectin-coated surface and that this was related to the degradation of fibronectin by serine proteases within maggot excretion/secretions (Chambers et al. 2000, Degradation of extracellular matrix components by defined proteinases from the greenbottle larva <i>Lucilia sericata </i>used for the clinical debridement of non-healing wounds, Brit J Dermatol. 148: 14-23).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A large and diverse family of serine protease genes was identified in first instar larval cDNA of the sheep blowfly, <i>Lucilia cuprina </i>(Elvin et al. 1994, An estimate of the number of serine protease genes expressed in sheep blowfly larvae (<i>Lucille cuprina</i>)&#x201d; Insect Molecular Biol 3: 105-115). Two chymotrypsin-like proteases were purified from the ES-products of first instar larvae of <i>Lucille cuprina </i>(Casu et al. 1994, Excretory/secretory chymotrypsin from <i>Lucilia cuprina</i>: purification, enzymatic specificity and amino acid sequence deduced from mRNA, Insect Molecular Biol 3: 201-211). Various protease inhibitors active against both trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like serine proteases were used to characterize gut proteases from <i>Lucilia cuprina </i>by in vitro feeding assays (Casu et al. 1994, Isolation of a trypsin-like serine protease gene family from the sheep blowfly <i>Lucille cuprina</i>, Insect Molecular Biol 3: 159-170). Significant larval growth retardation, was observed on feeding first instar larvae with trypsin inhibitors, particularly soybean trypsin inhibitor. Feeding of chymostatin, a specific chymotrypsin inhibitor, resulted in no significant growth retardation. This information suggests that trypsin-like serine proteases are probably the major gut digestive enzymes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Chambers et al. (2003, Degradation of extracellular matrix components by defined proteinases from greenbottle larva <i>Lucilia sericata </i>used for the clinical debridement of non-healing wounds, British J. Dermatol 148: 14-23) describe proteases with activities against fibrin and extracellular matrix components in first to third instar larvae of the greenbottle fly <i>Lucille sericata</i>. They found the highest specific activity in excretions of the early larval stages (first and second instar). Proteases with chymotrypsin and trypsin-like activities contained in larval excretory/secretory (ES) products are thought to contribute to wound debridement by removal of necrotic tissue. Three classes of proteolytic enzyme were detected in the secretions using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled casein as a model substrate: serine proteinases (pH optima 8-9) of two different subclasses (trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like), aspartyl proteinase (pH optimum 5) and a metalloproteinase (pH optimum 9) with exopeptidase characteristics. Using skin-relevant ECM components as substrates <i>L. sericata </i>ES products solubilized fibrin clots and degraded fibronectin, laminin and acid-solubilized collagen types I and III.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Despite these results, until today scientists and medical doctors seek for the active principle behind the huge amount of proteolytically active proteins in the larvae. It is known that larval secretions are capable of degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM)/wound components, fibronectin, laminin and collagens I, III, IV and V. These macromolecules are found in the slough of chronic wounds and also make up the &#x201c;fibrin cuffs&#x201d; that are predominant in chronic ulcers. The degradation of laminin and fibronectin by larval secretions is inhibited by PMSF, but not significantly by APMSF or by the metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline. The activity of the larval secretions exhibit a pH optimum of 8.0-8.5 (Chambers et al. 2000, Degradation of extracellular matrix components by defined proteinases from the greenbottle larva <i>Lucilia sericata </i>used for the clinical debridement of non-healing wounds, Brit J. Dermatol. 148: 14-23), which is not consistent with the wide pH-range from acidic to basic in chronic wounds. Therefore, there is a need for debriding enzymes with activity in a much more extensive pH-range as that described for the larval secretions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In U.S. Pat. No. 7,144,721 B1 it is speculated that the main proteolytic activity in larval secretions is a serine proteinase activity and that there are two types of serine proteinase activity present; one derived from a chymotryptic enzyme and one derived from a tryptic enzyme. US 2008/0108551 A1 provides evidence that degradation of the extracellular matrix is an important step in protease mediated wound healing by <i>Lucilia sericata</i>. In said application a serine protease and a metalloprotease isolated from <i>Lucilia sericata </i>excretory/secretory products are postulated, which degrade the extracellular matrix component fibronectin or increase cell migration, respectively. Apparently, the resulting biologically active degradation products of fibronectin promote wound healing. In WO 2007/138361 A3 a chymotrypsin from <i>Lucilia sericata </i>larvae for use in the treatment of wounds is disclosed. Further proteins which are apparently involved in wound healing like a nuclease (WO 2007/122424 A2) and a ligand for the toll-like receptor (US 2005/0053597 A1) were identified in the secretion products of larvae from <i>Lucilia sericata. </i></p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Despite the progress made in recent years in the development of debridement compositions, it would still be desirable to provide clearly defined debridement compounds or compositions comprising defined components with at least similar if not improved properties as compared to the above discussed prior art materials. This aim could e.g. be achieved by identifying the active principle responsible for improved wound healing provided by maggots. Such compounds would also be useful for cosmetic applications.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The term &#x201c;serin protease&#x201d; characterizes proteins having proteolytic activity as belonging to a subgroup the members of which comprise a serine in their active centre which together with histidine and aspartate forms the catalytic triad common to most serine proteases (Rawlings, N. D., Barrett, A. J. (1994). Families of serine peptidases. <i>Meth. Enzymol. </i>244:19-61). Serine-proteases are classified as hydrolases and belong to the EC numerical classification scheme subgroup 3.4.21. The proteins encoded by the nucleic acid molecule of the invention may either themselves exhibit the proteolytic activity of a serine protease (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 4) or after further maturation or activation (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 2 or 6), e.g. by proteolytical processing; see also the discussion of the propeptide of the invention below. Proteolytical processing may include the cut-off of a signal peptide from a pre-propeptide (e.g. the pre-propeptide having SEQ ID NO: 2) and the further proteolytical processing of the propeptide (e.g. the propeptide having SEQ ID NO: 6) by proteolytic cleavage.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The term &#x201c;signal peptide&#x201d; as used herein defines a short amino acid sequence (preferably, 3-60 amino acids long) that directs the transport of a protein to a particular cell compartment and preferably to the endoplasmic reticulum.</p>

An amino acid stretch of 30 amino acids and less than 30 amino acids would normally only be called peptide but not a polypeptide. Depending on the circumstances, the term &#x201c;protein&#x201d; or &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; herein may denote the mature protein (e.g. the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 or a amino acid sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3), the propeptide (e.g. the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or a amino acid sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5) or the pre-propeptide (e.g. the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or a amino acid sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1). Polypeptides may further form oligomers consisting of at least two identical or different molecules. The corresponding higher order structures of such multimers are, correspondingly, termed homo- or heterodimers, homo- or heterotrimers etc. Furthermore, peptidomimetics of such proteins/polypeptides where amino acid(s) and/or peptide bond(s) have been replaced by functional analogues are also encompassed by the invention. Such functional analogues include all known amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids, such as selenocysteine. The terms &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;protein&#x201d; and &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; also refer to naturally modified polypeptides/proteins and peptides where the modification is effected e.g. by glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and similar modifications which are well known in the art.</p>

In other terms, using an alignment, for two or more sequences or subsequences the percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same (e.g. 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% identity) may be determined, when the (sub)sequences are compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a window of comparison, or over a designated region as measured using a sequence comparison algorithm as known in the art, or when manually aligned and visually inspected. This definition also applies to the complement of a test sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Amino acid sequence analysis and alignment in connection with the present invention was carried out using the NCBI BLAST algorithm (Stephen F. Altschul, Thomas L.

The same holds true for the classes of basic, aromatic or aliphatic amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The term &#x201c;degenerate&#x201d; in accordance with the present invention refers to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Degeneracy results because a triplet code designates 20 amino acids and a stop codon. Because four bases exist which are utilized to encode genetic information, triplet codons are required to produce at least 21 different codes. The possible 4<sup>3 </sup>possibilities for bases in triplets give 64 possible codons, meaning that some degeneracy must exist. As a result, some amino acids are encoded by more than one triplet, i.e. by up to six. The degeneracy mostly arises from alterations in the third position in a triplet. This means that nucleic acid molecules having a different sequence than that specified above, but still encoding the same polypeptide lie within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The problem often encountered when wounds do not heal in an appropriate time is the removal of &#x201c;fibrin cuffs&#x201d; and necrotic tissue to enable infiltration of fibroblasts and therefore the onset of the wound healing process. The present inventors have surprisingly found that the serine protease encoded by the nucleic acid of the present invention has excellent properties to prepare the wound for natural healing by dissolving these fibrin cuffs. It is a biologically active serine protease which is believed to be the major active principle of the wound healing activity of <i>Lucilia sericata</i>. The enzyme is also referred to herein as &#x201c;debrilase&#x201d;, referring to its suggested use for the debridement of wounds.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The larvae of <i>Lucilia sericata </i>are generally used in clinical practice as living organisms to treat wounds which are resistant to conventional treatment. Since the maggot therapy is rather unpleasant to many patients and the secretions of the insects are far from being a defined pharmaceutical composition the present inventors set out to identify at least one of the active principles of wound debridement by a molecular approach.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The generation of a cDNA-library from mRNA (the transcriptome) of second instar larvae fed on blood agar led to the identification of a nucleic acid encoding a trypsin-like protease and the corresponding amino acid sequence expressed with high abundance which is likely to be the major protease involved in wound debridement by larvae of <i>Lucilia sericata</i>. The enzyme was not found in cDNA libraries derived from mRNA isolated from 5 days old larvae (third instar). This corresponds to the decrease of debriding activity with increasing larval stages (Chambers et al. 2003).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The screening of said libraries for proteolytic activity on casein yielded several cDNA sequences encoding proteases in the transcriptome of second instar larvae induced by blood-substrate. Analysis of cDNA-sequences in the library of induced second instar larvae led to the identification of proteases only present in the cDNA library generated from second instar larvae but not in the transcriptome of larvae in the later stage (third instar). Some of the proteases found exhibited nucleic acid sequence similarity to phosphochymotrypsin, trypsin or chymotrypsin, respectively. No metallo-, threonine-, cysteine-, aspartic acid- or glutamic acid type proteases were found.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a first agar plate screening on skim milk several cDNA clones were found to secrete enzymes with caseinoloytic activity but only one exhibited activity also on a fibrin containing substrate.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Nucleic acid sequence analysis revealed three serine-type proteases and two trypsin-type proteases with high abundance within the mRNA of induced larvae. The trypsin-type proteases revealed fibrinolytic and caseinolytic activity. Amino acid sequence analysis of one of the fibrinolytic proteases which corresponds to debrilase represented by amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 4 and encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 showed a protein sequence identity of 76.1% to a trypsin-like protease from <i>Sarcophaga </i>sp. as closest similarity to known enzymes using NCBI BLAST algorithm (Stephen F. Altschul, Thomas L. Madden, Alejandro A. Sch&#xe4;ffer, Jinghui Zhang, Zheng Zhang, Webb Miller, and David J. Lipman (1997), &#x201c;Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs&#x201d;, Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402). Debrilase was found to be expressed with high abundance, thus it is likely to be the major protease involved in wound debridement by larvae of <i>Lucilia sericata</i>. Debrilase is expressed and translated as pre-propeptide including a signal peptide and propeptidic amino acids (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). The activation of the enzymatic activity is accomplished by cleaving-off the signal peptide and by further cleaving the propeptide thereby generating the mature protein (SEQ ID NO. 4) of debrilase, wherein the propeptide is apparently further cleaved by autoproteolysis. The mature protein is preferably encoded by the nucleic acid molecule consisting of SEQ ID NO. 3. The mature debrilase has the ability to cleave fibrin and casein. Its activity can be inhibited completely by PMSF (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and APMSF (4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). No inhibition was detected using inhibitors for metallo-, threonine-, cysteine- or aspartic acid type proteases. This shows that the protein is a serine protease and has trypsin-like activity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is known that progressive wound conditions encompass a wide pH range (Greener B et al 2005. Proteases and pH in chronic wounds. J Wound Care; 14(2)). In another detailed study, 247 pH values in 39 patients with chronic wounds of varying origins were analysed over a period of 12 months, detecting values from 5.45 to 8.65 (Dissemond, J. et al., 2003, pH-Wert des Milieus chronischer Wunden, Untersuchungen im Rahmen einer modernen Wundtherapie, Der Hautarzt 54, No. 12, 959-965). Debrilase is highly stable and active in a pH range of 5-10 which makes it suitable in the application on chronic wounds exerting the wide pH range as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, in a cellular receptor activation assay debrilase was found to have the ability to activate protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR 2). PAR 2 is a member of the large family of 7-transmembrane receptors that couple to guanosine-nucleotide-binding proteins. PAR 2 is also a member of the protease-activated receptor family. It is activated by trypsin, but not by thrombin. Trypsin accomplishes the proteolytic cleavage of the receptors extracellular amino terminus and the new amino terminus functions as a tethered ligand and activates the receptor. PAR 2 plays an important role in inflammation and pain, in fibroblast proliferation (Asano-Kato et al., Tryptase increases proliferative activity of human conjunctival fibroblasts through protease-activated receptor-2, Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci., 2005 46(12):4622-6) and in formation of connective tissue contributing to wound healing (Borensztajn K. et al., 2008, Factor Xa stimulates proinflammatory and profibrotic responses in fibroblasts via protease-activated receptor-2 activation, 1: Am J Pathol. 172(2):309-20). Thus, the trypsin-like enzyme of the invention by cleaving the tethered ligand activates the receptor which then triggers biochemical processes involved in promoting wound healing. For example, it is envisaged that debrilase can be utilised advantageously for dissolving &#x201c;fibrin cuffs&#x201d; which are frequently observed on non-healing wounds, for removing necrotic tissue and for triggering a receptor mediated cascade of immune and cellular responses.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">This is the first description and characterization after recombinant expression of a protease from <i>Lucilia sericata </i>with fibrinolytic, caseinolytic and PAR 2-activating activity and a wide pH-range of its enzymatic activity on the molecular level. It is envisioned that debrilase and fragments thereof with debrilase activity have the ability to prepare and pre-treat slow-healing or chronic wounds to make them susceptible for natural healing processes and/or conventional medical treatment by debriding the wound, i.e. removal of dead tissue and dissolution of fibrin cuffs. Furthermore, cosmetic used are envisaged which involve skin treatments to improve skin appearance or texture. Application of the propetide to a wound will lead to a conversion to the mature protein by enzymatic cleavage.</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The debridement process as well as dressing changes may give rise to pain for the patient, and thus it may be preferred to incorporate a pain-relieving agent such as an analgesic or an anaesthetic compound in the dressing of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The dressing of the present invention may further comprise debriding compositions other than enzymes, which may have additive or synergistic debriding effect. An example of such a compound may be urea.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The invention also relates to an antibody or fragment or derivative thereof specifically binding to the serine protease of the invention, or a fragment thereof or the propeptide or pre-propeptide of the serine protease of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">An antibody according to the present invention specifically binds to the serine protease (debrilase) as described in detail herein above or fragments thereof having the activity of debrilase as described above or the propeptide or pre-propeptide of the serine protease of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The antibody of the present invention can be, for example, polyclonal or monoclonal. The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; also comprises derivatives or fragments thereof which still retain the binding specificity. Such fragments comprise, inter alia, Fab fragments, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, Fv fragments or scFv derivatives. Techniques for the production of antibodies and fragments thereof are well known in the art and described, e.g. in Harlow and Lane &#x201c;Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual&#x201d;, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988 and Harlow and Lane &#x201c;Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual&#x201d; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1998. These antibodies can be used, for example, for immunoprecipitation or affinity purification of debrilase or fragments thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The antibody of the invention also includes embodiments such as chimeric, single chain and humanized antibodies. Various procedures are known in the art and may be used for the production of such antibodies and/or fragments. Further, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies specific for debrilase or fragments thereof etc. described above. Also, transgenic animals may be used to express humanized antibodies specific for debrilase or fragments thereof. Most preferably, the antibody of this invention is a monoclonal antibody. For the preparation of monoclonal antibodies, any technique that provides antibodies produced by continuous cell line cultures can be used. Examples for such techniques include the hybridoma technique (K&#xf6;hler and Milstein Nature 256 (1975), 495-497), the trioma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor, Immunology Today 4 (1983), 72) and the EBV-hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc. (1985), 77-96). Surface plasmon resonance as employed in the BIAcore system can be used to increase the efficiency of phage antibodies which bind to an epitope of the compounds described above (Schier, Human Antibodies Hybridomas 7 (1996), 97-105; Malmborg, J. Immunol. Methods 183 (1995), 7-13). It is also envisaged in the context of this invention that the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; comprises antibody constructs that may be expressed in cells, e.g. antibody constructs which may be transfected and/or transduced via, amongst others, viruses or plasmid vectors. Once the antibody according to the present invention has been obtained, the antibody itself or the DNA encoding it can be sequenced providing for the information to recombinantly produce the antibody of the invention in small or large scale. Methods of the production of a recombinant antibody are known to the person skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The term &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d;, interchangeably used with &#x201c;specifically interacts with&#x201d;, in accordance with the present invention means that the antibody does not or essentially does not cross-react with an epitope of similar structure. Cross-reactivity of a panel of antibodies under investigation may be tested, for example, by assessing binding of said panel of antibodies under conventional conditions to the epitope of interest as well as to a number of more or less (structurally and/or functionally) closely related epitopes. Only those antibodies that bind to the epitope of interest in its relevant context (e.g. a specific motif in the structure of a protein) but do not or do not essentially bind to any of the other epitopes are considered specific for the epitope of interest and thus to be antibodies in accordance with this invention. Corresponding methods are described e.g. in Harlow and Lane, 1988 and 1999, loc cit.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">2 days old maggots from the green bottlefly (<i>Lucilia sericata</i>) were purchased from BioMonde (BioMonde, 22885 Barsb&#xfc;ttel, Germany). Isolation of total RNA was done after feeding for 24 hours (second instar stage) on blood-agar (1.5% (w/v) agar containing 10% bovine blood) to enhance production of proteases and after 3 days when the production of enzymes is markedly decreased in the third instar stage (Chambers et al. 2000, Degradation of extracellular matrix components by defined proteinases from the greenbottle larva <i>Lucilia sericata </i>used for the clinical debridement of non-healing wounds, Brit J Dermatol. 148: 14-23). For isolation of total-RNA 3 larvae (ca. 30 mg) were shock frozen with liquid nitrogen and pulverised mechanically. RNA was isolated using the kit &#x201c;Total RNA Isolation, NucleoSpin RNA II&#x201d; (purchased from Macherey-Nagel, 52313 Duren, Germany) yielding 47 &#x3bc;g total RNA.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Generation of an <i>E. coli </i>cDNA Library from Total RNA Isolated from Larvae of <i>Lucilia sericata </i></p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The generation of a cDNA-library from said <i>Lucilia sericata </i>RNA was accomplished according to the &#x201c;SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit User Manual&#x201d; (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). In vitro packaging of the final ligation reaction and subsequent transformation in <i>E. coli </i>XL-1 Blue resulted in 1.5&#xd7;10E6 primary plaque forming units.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Colony forming units resulted from mass excision described above were screened on agar media containing 2% skim milk under selective conditions. Expression of heterologous proteases was driven by the vector comprising inducible P<sub>lac </sub>promoter.

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Isolation and Purification of Debrilase Protein from <i>E. Coli </i>Culture Expression Culture</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In order to obtain enzyme samples of the debrilase containing sufficient enzymatic activity for a characterisation of the enzyme either the cDNA clone expressing the corresponding protease or a more suited expression construct set up in a typical expression vector like e.g the pET26b-vector (Novagen) and a suitable expression host like e.g. <i>E. coli </i>Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) were used. For the construction of the expression constructs, the corresponding debrilase genes were PCR amplified to introduce unique restriction enzyme recognition sequences upstream and downstream of the open reading frame (ORF) which allowed to ligate the genes encoding the protease with the expression vector e.g. pET26b in a definite way. The restriction enzyme recognition sequences were chosen on the basis of their absence in the coding region of the debrilase gene and could be e.g. NdeI, HindIII, EcoRI, XhoI. The absence of unwanted second site mutations due to erroneous amplification by the polymerase was confirmed by sequencing of the cloned amplicon.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The cDNA clones or the expression constructs were used to inoculate e.g. 200 ml of culture medium complemented with the appropriate antibiotic in a 1 l Erlenmayer flask. LB-medium and antibiotics in the following concentration were used: 100 &#x3bc;g/ml ampicillin, 25 &#x3bc;g/ml kanamycin, chloroamphenicol 12.5 &#x3bc;g/ml. The initial optical density (OD<sub>580</sub>) was adjusted to 0.05 and the cells grown at a temperature of 28&#xb0; C. on a gyratory shaker. When the optical density reached the value of about 1 the expression from the lac-promoter of pTriplEx2 (Clontech) or from the T7-promoter of vectors from the pET-vector series e.g. pET26 was induced by addition of IPTG in the concentration of 20 &#x3bc;M-500 &#x3bc;M. Cells were harvested 4 to 20 h after induction by centrifugation. The cell sediment was resuspended in 5 ml 1&#xd7;PBS, pH 7.0 and the cells disrupted by ultrasonication.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0130">To identify fibrinolytic activity in extracts of casein degrading clones a solid agar assay was used. For this, a solution A containing 200 mg agarose, 87 mg NaCl and 3 mg CaCl<sub>2 </sub>were added to 10 ml 0.1 M Tris pH7.4 and incubated at 50&#xb0; C. To a second solution B containing 10 ml 0.9% NaCl and 100 mg Fibrin (Sigma F3879), 20 &#x3bc;l Plasminogen (2 units/mg, Sigma P7397) e added and pre-incubated at 50&#xb0; C. Both solutions were combined with 12 &#x3bc;l Thrombin (175-350 NIH units, Sigma T4265) and spread on agar plates using micro-well forming devices.

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">To identify fibrinolytic activity in casein degrading clones a solid agar assay was used. Therefore a medium A consisting of 10 ml 2&#xd7; Luria Bertani containing 200 mg agarose, 87 mg NaCl and 3 mg CaCl<sub>2 </sub>was incubated at 50&#xb0; C.

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Liquid Phase Activity Assay and Inhibitory Profiling</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Quantification of proteolytic activity was conducted by a fluorescence assay in 96-well plates with BODIPY-FL-Casein (Molecular Probes) used as substrate. Hereby, on the undigested substrate casein the labelling molecules are in close contact to each other and therefore fluorescence is suppressed by a quenching mechanism. In case of hydrolysis these molecules separate from each other and fluorescence can be excited at 485 nm and measured at 520 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">A standard assay contained 5 &#x3bc;g/ml BODIPY-FL-Casein in 100 &#x3bc;l PBS buffer and a series of dilutions of protease extract. Samples were incubated for 60 min at 37&#xb0; C. and fluorescence was measured using a spectrophotometer (NovoStar, BMG LABTECH, Offenburg, Germany), applying the following parameters: excitation 485 nm, emission 520 nm, gain 5, one cycle, 10 flashes. Serine protease inhibitors APMSF (4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and PMSF (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) were used for testing the specificity of the isolated protease.

<p id="h-0010" num="0000"><i>Pichia pastoris </i>Expression Culture</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Heterologous expression of the serine protease of the invention, i.e. debrilase was carried out in the methylotrophic yeast <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, which is classified as a GRAS-organism by the Food and Drug Administration and is therefore established for pharmaceutical production processes. For expression an integrative vector system was used, providing a methanol inducible promoter. The native signal peptide of debrilase (&#x201c;MFRFVALFAFVSCALA&#x201d;) (SEQ. ID. NO:7) was substituted by the vector encoded-factor signal sequence from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>to facilitate efficient secretion in <i>Pichia. </i></p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Fermentation was carried out in mineral medium with glycerol as sole carbon source in the first batch phase, fed batch mode was started after consumption of initial batch glycerol. Induction of heterologous expression was initiated by supplementation of methanol as inducer/carbon source and sorbitol as additional non-inhibiting feed during gene expression.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Stationary growth of the culture was reached after batch/fed-batch (FB) phase leading to an Optical Density of about 600. Induction was initiated by adding MeOH. To prevent heterologous enzyme from being activated autocatalytically at this point, process temperature was decreased from 30&#xb0; C. to 20&#xb0; C. Expression of debrilase was supported in the end phase of the process by feeding. Autocatalytic activation of the propeptide was achieved by increasing the pH of the culture medium from 5.5 to 6.8, during the purification procedure (see below).</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Purification of Debrilase Protein from <i>Pichia pastoris </i>Culture Expression Culture</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Purification was carried out by affinity chromatography using serine protease inhibitor benzamidine coupled to sepharose carrier material (GE Healthcare). After removal of unbound protein purified the serine protease of the invention was harvested by competitive elution using buffer with addition of free benzamidine. SDS PAGE of the downstream procedure is visualized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. After subsequent dialysis against citrate storage buffer the purified protein was lyophilized and displayed as white dry powder.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">For Edman sequencing the blot was fitted into the sample preparation cartridge. For determination of the amino acid sequence the protein sequencer Procise 492 (Applied Biosystems) was used. Reagents and protocols were applied as advised by the manufacturer. The resulting chromatograms were analysed using appropriate software (Applied Biosystems). Prior to each sample a standard sample and a blank were run.</p>

The resulting colonies harbour the intrinsic plasmids excised from the phage vector.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The heterogeneity of the plasmid library was tested by isolation of forty plasmids from representative clones. In fact, every plasmid harboured an insert and these inserts showed complete diversity in size. In total, 3&#xd7;10E5 cfu were screened on solid media containing 2% skim milk under selective conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">By isolation and sequencing of plasmid DNA from sixteen of these halo-forming colonies a pre-propeptide sequence of a protease with 76% identity on the amino acid level to a trypsin-like enzyme from <i>Sarcophaga bullata </i>was identified (SEQ ID NO: 2).</p>

Cells harbouring plasmids with the identified protease showed clear zones around the colony after over night incubation at 37&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Fibrinolytic activity in cell free crude extracts was determined using buffered agar medium containing fibrin.

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The activity of debrilase as agonist of PAR 2 was monitored over time in a cell based fluorescence assay by use of a wild type HEK293 cell line endogenously expressing human PAR2. In brief, 1 day prior to performing the assay, HEK293 cells expressing human PAR2 were plated onto 96-well, black-walled, assay plates, at a density of 45,000 cells per well. Using a 96-well microplate reader (FlexStation&#xae;, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.), the change of the cellular calcium concentration was monitored by use of the calcium sensitive fluorescent dye fluo-4 (excitation 494 nm, emission 516 nm). The PAR 2 agonist trypsin (8 nM) was used as positive control. The dye-loaded cells in plates were placed into the fluorescence microplate reader to monitor fluorescence (excitation 488 nm, emission 520 nm) change after the addition of 50 &#x3bc;l assay buffer (118 mM NaCl; 4.7 mM KCl; 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>; 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>4.2 mM NaHCO<sub>2</sub>; 1.3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>; 10 mM HEPES (pH: 7.4)) supplemented with an agonist. Calcium mobilization was quantified as the change of peak fluorescence (&#x394;F) over the baseline level (F). Data were expressed as the mean S.E. of the &#x394;F/F value (=RFU, relative fluorescence units) of replicated independent samples. The analysis was done with the software of the FlexStation&#xae;.</p>
