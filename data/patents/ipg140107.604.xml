<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pot, and more particularly, to a hollow pot with a space defined therein so as to store water in the space to provide the plant sufficient water.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A conventional pot for plant generally is made by pottery clay, porcelain or plastic, and includes a single layer with the inside and the outside. A hole is defined in the bottom of the pot which has an open top so that soil is put in the pot via the open top. The plant is planted in the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, people in the modern world are busy and may not able to regularly water the plant and some people thought that the more water to the plant, the healthier the plant will be so that more than needed water is poured to the pot and the water that cannot be absorbed by the soil leaks from the hole in the bottom of the pot. The water and the soil that leak from the hole of the pot directly drop to the floor and form dark spots which are difficult to clean up. If the pot is located at a higher position, the leakage may generate noise. In the daytime, the temperature in the pot increases so that the humidity and temperature are trapped in the soil so that the roots of the plant are easily decayed. Besides, if the owner leaves for couple of days, the plant will be dead because no water is supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention intends to provide a hollow pot for plant and has a space defined between inner and outer layers of the pot, and water is stored in the space so as to adjust temperature and humidity in the soil efficiently. In consequence, the hollow pot will be able to solve these problems and benefit to more manufacturers and consumers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a hollow pot which comprises a pot unit and a connection unit. The connection unit is a hollow unit and installed to inner surface of a mold set before pressurized air is introduced in the mold set and before the mold set is closed. A probe is inserted into the mold set and blows the plastic material in the mold set. The plastic material expands and contacts against the inner surface of the mold set and seals the connection holes of the connection unit. The plastic material located outside of the connection holes is forced and pushed into the connection holes due to pressure difference by continuously introducing air into the mold set. The plastic material is extended and broken to match upon the connection holes of the connection unit. The plastic material is solidified to form the pot unit. The pot unit is air-tightly connected to the connection unit, and the conjunction area of the connection unit communicates with the space in the pot unit. The hollow pot is made by two different materials and by way of air blow molding. There will be not necessary to drill after the pot is made and no extra machining is needed. The transparent window is connected to the outer layer of the pot unit so that the level of liquid in the space is observed via the transparent window.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, the liquid in the space of the pot moves upward via the path due to siphon effect so that the soil in the reception area absorbs the water. The pressure of inside the space is lower than the atmosphere so that the pressure is supplied into the space via the path to let the water in the space to move upward to automatically water the soil. Therefore, the soil of the pot is always supplied by small amount of water and the humidity of the soil is proper for the roots of the plant. The special arrangement allows the owners of the plant to travel for a period of days while the soil is supplied sufficient water.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention will become more obvious from the following description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings which show, for purposes of illustration only, a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When planting a plant <b>80</b>, the soil <b>85</b> is put in the reception area <b>13</b> and does not cover the first connection hole <b>20</b> of the path A to ensure that the space <b>12</b> communicates with outside of the pot unit <b>1</b>. The liquid <b>83</b> such as water is poured into the water introducing unit <b>3</b> and the water is guided by the conjunction area <b>32</b> and stored in the space <b>12</b>. When the level of the liquid <b>83</b> is higher than the through hole <b>133</b>. The surface tension of the liquid <b>83</b> moves the liquid <b>83</b> upward by the siphonic effect and the liquid <b>83</b> is absorbed by the soil <b>85</b>. The liquid is stopped pouring into the pot unit <b>1</b> until the space <b>12</b> is filled with the liquid <b>83</b>. The seal unit <b>6</b> is used to seal the water introducing unit <b>3</b>, an enclosed area is formed between the sealed water introducing area <b>3</b> sealed by the seal unit <b>6</b> and the through hole <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the plant <b>80</b> uses the water in the soil <b>85</b>, the pressure in the space <b>12</b> is smaller than the atmosphere so that the air outside of the pot unit <b>1</b> enters into the space <b>12</b> via the path A which is the pipe <b>2</b>, the pressure pushes the level of the liquid <b>83</b> downward until the liquid <b>83</b> in the space <b>12</b> begins to move upward via the through hole <b>133</b> by the siphon effect to keep the soil <b>85</b> wet. Accordingly, the soil <b>85</b> in the reception area <b>13</b> maintains a certain level of humidity and the root of the plant is protected. The flow speed of the liquid <b>83</b> that <b>83</b> flows from the space <b>12</b> to the reception area <b>13</b> of the soil <b>85</b> can also be adjusted to keep the soil to be wet. Therefore, the owner of the plant <b>80</b> does not need to water the plant <b>80</b> while travelling.</p>
