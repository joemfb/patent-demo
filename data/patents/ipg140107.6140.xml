<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Integrated circuit layout (IC layout) is the representation of an integrated circuit in terms of planar geometric shapes (or polygons) which correspond to the patterns of metal, oxide, or semiconductor layers that make up the components of the integrated circuit. When the interaction of the many chemical, thermal, and photographic variables are known and carefully controlled, the performance and size of a final integrated circuit depends largely on the positions and interconnections of these planar geometric shapes. In earlier days, layout engineers did IC layout by hand using opaque tapes and films. More modernly, layout engineers do IC layout with the aid of software tools including layout editors or electronic design automation (EDA) applications. The manual operation of choosing and positioning the planar geometric shapes is informally known as &#x201c;polygon pushing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Once the IC layout is complete, it is: (a) translated into an industry standard binary format such as Graphic Data System II (GDSII) stream format; (b) processed using transformational operations including set operations and geometric operations such as Boolean operations on polygons and sizing operations (e.g., expansion and shrinkage); and (c) verified, e.g., using verification processes such as Design Rule Checking (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verification. Then the IC layout is transferred to a semiconductor foundry in a step sometimes referred to as &#x201c;tape-out&#x201d;. Ultimately, the semiconductor foundry uses data resulting from the IC layout to generate the photolithographic photomasks that control semiconductor device fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It will be appreciated that an error in an IC layout and its resulting photomask can be extremely costly in terms of both time and resources. Consequently, there is a need to catch any errors in an IC layout as early as possible, including errors with regard to transformational operations. The embodiments described below include functionality for catching such errors, along with additional functionality which is widely applicable to this and other fields.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an example embodiment, an EDA application creates a physical parameterized cell (PCell) from a CAD (computer-aided design) database that relates the PCell to a collection of expected mask layers. The EDA application auto-places the an identifying text label with a physical PCell and converts the physical PCell and the text label to a format (e.g., GDSII stream format) that represents the physical PCell and the text label as a sequence of drawn layers. The EDA application generates and stores an equation that performs transformational operations on the drawn layers to create a sequence of derived layers, where the sequence of derived layers define a collection of logical mask layers. The EDA application then executes the equation and compares a resulting derived layer to the expected mask layers, if the derived layer interacts with the derived layer for the text label. Finally, if the compared derived layer varies from the expected mask layers, the EDA application reports a variance based on the text label, to assist the user of the EDA program in adjusting the equation.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the example embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the example embodiments may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, process operations and implementation details have not been described in detail, if already well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a flowchart diagram of a high-level process for designing and manufacturing an IC, in accordance with an example embodiment. The process starts in operation <b>2</b> with a design for an integrated circuit produced by a hardware engineer who creates HDL (hardware description language) files containing the desired circuitry description. In operation <b>4</b>, the HDL files become an input to CAD processing which typically involves parsing the HDL, synthesizing a netlist, placing and routing, timing analysis, and assembly. Operation <b>6</b> of the process is tape-out, which takes as input a binary file (e.g., in GDSII stream format). In operation <b>8</b>, the tape-out output is used to create a photomask for the photolithograpy which takes place operation <b>10</b>, along with the other operations involving programming and manufacture of the IC device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a flowchart diagram of a process for automatically verifying logical operations on a GDSII representation of a photomask, in accordance with an example embodiment. It will be appreciated that this process might be performed as part of a computer-aided design (CAD) flow, such as the CAD flow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in conjunction with an EDA application (or tool) having a graphical user interface (GUI), e.g., a software program which runs on a general or special-purpose computer. In an example embodiment, the EDA application might be a toolchain that includes Altera's Quartus&#xae; II and third-party tools.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the first operation <b>101</b> of the process, an EDA application generates a physical parameterized cell (PCell) from a CAD database that relates the physical PCell to a collection of expected mask layers. Here it will be appreciated that a physical PCell comprises programming code (e.g., a macro) to generate a physical representation (e.g., layout drawing) of an electronic component, showing the physical structure of the latter inside an IC, based on the values of input parameters (e.g., dimensions such as width and length). That is to say, the physical PCell code generates (draws) the actual shapes of the mask design for the IC, based on the input parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the second operation <b>102</b> of the process, the EDA application creates a file in GDSII stream format in which a text label identifying the PCell is auto-placed with the PCell. Here it will be appreciated that the GDSII stream format enables the description of objects such as planar geometric shapes (e.g., polygons) and text labels using attributes that include layer and data type. In the third operation <b>103</b>, the EDA application generates an equation that performs geometric operations on the layers (also referred to as &#x201c;drawn layers&#x201d;) to create derived layers, also in GDSII stream format, which define logical (as opposed to actual) mask layers. In the fourth operation <b>104</b>, the EDA application executes the equation to obtain the derived layers. As explained below, this operation might be performed by an eLOP (electronic logic operation) system. In the fifth operation <b>105</b> of the process, the EDA application automatically extracts (e.g., using a custom CAD flow) a derived layer and some or all of its dimensions, if that derived layer interacts with the derived layer for the text label identifying the physical PCell, where &#x201c;interacts&#x201d; includes (a) touching the derived layer for the text label or (b) being above or below the derived layer for the text layer. In the sixth operation <b>106</b>, the EDA application electronically compares the extracted layer and its dimensions to the expected mask layers and their dimensions. Then in the seventh operation <b>107</b>, the EDA application reports a variance based on the identifying text label, if the comparison indicates that a variance has occurred. Using this variance report, the user of the EDA application can adjust the equation that performs the geometric operations on the drawn layers.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As described above, the EDA application creates a file in GDSII stream format in operation <b>102</b> of the process. In alternative example embodiments, other suitable file formats might be used, including OASIS&#xae; (Open Artwork System Interchange Standard) and CIF (Caltech Intermediate Format). Also, as described above, the EDA application generates an equation that performs geometric operations in operation <b>103</b> of the process. However, in alternative example embodiments, the equation might perform other transformations such as set operations such as union, intersection, complement, Cartesian product, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As described above, the EDA program executes the equation in operation <b>104</b>, remotely using the eLOP system in an example embodiment. An eLOP system has been developed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and is described in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2008/0022254. It is sometimes also referred to as &#x201c;remote mask database check&#x201d;. However, in an alternative example embodiment, the EDA program might use one of its own software modules to execute the equation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a GUI view displaying a database table whose columns indicate expected mask layers in NMOS (n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor) transistors, in accordance with an example embodiment. It will be appreciated that this figure relates to operation <b>101</b> of the process described above. As depicted in the figure, a GUI view <b>201</b> displays a database table <b>202</b> whose rows describe numbered devices that are NMOS transistors (e.g., devices whose Device Type is &#x201c;TN&#x201d;). Thus, Device No. 30 is an NMOS transistor named &#x201c;Transistor 30&#x201d; that corresponds to a PCell whose name <b>203</b> is &#x201c;TNG45DS&#x201d;. As shown by the binary flags in the columns towards the right of the database table, this device/PCell includes various expected mask layers such as mask layer G shown in database table column <b>204</b>. Here it will be appreciated that a value of 1 for a binary flag indicates the expected presence of the mask layer in the device/Pcell and a value of 0 for the binary flag indicates the expected absence of the mask layer in the device/Pcell.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating the auto-placement of text labels with physical PCells for NMOS transistors, in accordance with an example embodiment. It will be appreciated that this figure relates to operation <b>102</b> of the process described above. Table <b>301</b> at the top of the figure depicts a hierarchy of NMOS transistors (e.g., TN). According to the hierarchy, NMOS transistors can be either &#x201c;Inside DNW&#x201d; or &#x201c;No DNW&#x201d;. Here it will be appreciated that DNW stands for &#x201c;Deep N-Well&#x201d;. In turn, the NMOS transistors that are &#x201c;Inside DNW&#x201d; can be &#x201c;G-Transistor&#x201d;, &#x201c;LP-Transistor&#x201d;, or &#x201c;IO Transistor&#x201d;, where &#x201c;G&#x201d; stands for generic, &#x201c;LP&#x201d; stands for low power, and &#x201c;IO&#x201d; stands for input/output. Likewise, the NMOS transistors that are &#x201c;No DNW&#x201d; can be &#x201c;G-Transistor&#x201d;, &#x201c;LP-Transistor&#x201d;, or &#x201c;IO Transistor&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in Table <b>301</b>, TNG45DS is the NMOS transistor that is &#x201c;Inside DNW&#x201d; and that is a G device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an explanation of terminology for this transistor. According to that explanation, &#x201c;T&#x201d; stands for transistor, &#x201c;N&#x201d; stands for NMOS, &#x201c;G&#x201d; stands for generic, &#x201c;45&#x201d; stands for 45 nm process (per the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors), &#x201c;D&#x201d; stands for DNW, and &#x201c;S&#x201d; stands for &#x201c;SVT&#x201d; (standard threshold voltage). Diagram <b>302</b> in the figure shows an indentifying text label <b>303</b> (including the characters &#x201c;D&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d;) juxtaposed with its corresponding polygons, following generation of the PCell for TNG45DS and auto-placement of the text label.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing an example equation that performs geometric operations on drawn layers, in accordance with an example embodiment. This equation is merely meant to be illustrative as to the complexity of such equations; the derived layers resulting from the geometric operations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> would not be useful in a real design for an IC. It will be appreciated that this figure relates to operation <b>103</b> of the process described above. Such operations are well-known in the art and are described in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,139,997, which is incorporated herein by reference. The geometric operations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> include both Boolean operations on polygons (e.g., AND, NOT, OR, etc.) and sizing operations (e.g., expansion and shrinkage). The polygons are expressed in terms of GDSII stream format, e.g., &#x201c;(80:14)&#x201d;, where the first number indicates a layer and the second number indicates a data type. As noted above, other formats such as OASIS&#xae; might be used in alternative example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating the drawn layers and the derived layers for an NMOS transistor, in accordance with an example embodiment. It will be appreciated that this figure relates to operations <b>102</b>-<b>105</b> of the process described above. The drawn layers <b>501</b> relate to a physical PCell, e.g., for a TNG45S (an NMOS transistor that is &#x201c;No DNW&#x201d; and that is a G-transistor), and are stored in a GDSII file, as indicated in the figure. Also as indicated in the figure, the drawn layers <b>501</b> include the text label &#x201c;DA5&#x201d;, which has been auto-placed. The derived layers <b>502</b> result from execution of an equation involving geometric operations on the drawn layers <b>501</b> such as the equation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It will be appreciated that some of these geometric operations were sizing operations which increased the size of some of the polygons in the drawn layers <b>501</b>. As indicated in the figure, the derived layers <b>502</b> also include the text label &#x201c;DA5&#x201d;, which might been auto-placed prior to transmission of the input GDSII file to an eLOP system, in an example embodiment. In an alternative example embodiment, the text label &#x201c;DA5&#x201d; might have been subsequently auto-placed following receipt of the output GDSII file from the eLOP system. Also shown in the figure is a table <b>503</b> which shows results of automated measurements (e.g., 0.298) taken on dimensions (e.g., X-Dir) of the derived layers (e.g., eLOP layer (6;50)) that interact with the text label (&#x201c;DA5&#x201d;) layer, where &#x201c;interact&#x201d; includes (a) touching the derived layer for the text label or (b) being above or below the derived layer for the text layer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the derived layers that interact with the derived layer for a text identifier, in accordance with an example embodiment. It will be appreciated that this figure relates to operation <b>105</b> of the process described above. The figure depicts the derived layers relating to a device/PCell, including a derived layer that includes an identifying text label &#x201c;DA9&#x201d;, e.g., the so-called &#x201c;ID layer&#x201d;. As noted in the figure, an EDA application extracts and measures the layers that interact with the ID layer, where &#x201c;interact&#x201d; includes (a) touching the ID layer or (b) being above or below the ID layer. If a derived layer has no interaction with the ID layer, the EDA application does not extract and measure the derived layer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram showing a table with (a) expected mask layers and (b) expected dimensions for a poly (PO) layer and a thin oxide (OD) layer in various NMOS and PMOS (p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor) transistors, in accordance with an example embodiment. It will be appreciated that this figure relates to operation <b>106</b> of the process described above. The figure is composed of three tables. Table <b>701</b> might be used by an EDA program to verify that the derived mask layers in a device/PCell which is a G-transistor correspond to the expected mask layers. As indicated in the table's legend, a binary flag of 1 indicates that a mask layer (e.g., OD, PO, etc.) is expected for a particular device, whereas a binary flag of 0 indicates that a mask layer is not expected. It will be appreciated that these binary flags might be implemented in a bit vector for fast comparison via a bitwise operation (e.g., AND) with a bit vector that records the derived layers that were extracted by the EDA application. Table <b>702</b> might be used by an EDA program to verify the correspondence between an expected dimension (e.g., 0.298) and an actual dimension in a derived OD layer in various devices (G and NMOS, G and PMOS, LP+ and NMOS, LP+ and PMOS, I/O and NMOS, I/O and PMOS). Table <b>703</b> might be used by an EDA program to verify the correspondence between an expected dimension (e.g., 0.12) and an actual dimension in a derived PO layer in various devices (G and NMOS, G and PMOS, LP+ and NMOS, LP+ and PMOS, I/O and NMOS, I/O and PMOS). As indicated by the last column in both tables <b>702</b> and <b>703</b>, no errors (0.00%) or variances are expected.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram illustrating an automated detection of a variance in a derived OD layer, in accordance with an example embodiment. The drawn layers in the input layout <b>801</b> include six polygons identified symbolically (rather than in GDSII stream format) as OD<b>1</b>, OD<b>2</b>, OD<b>3</b>, OD<b>4</b>, OD<b>5</b>, and OD<b>6</b>. However, two of these polygons, e.g., OD<b>2</b> and OD<b>5</b>, are missing from the derived layers in the output layout <b>802</b> received from the eLOP system. Using the process described above, an EDA application might discover the missing polygons and report a variance that identified their location in terms of their layers and data types.</p>
