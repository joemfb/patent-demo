<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Magnetostriction is a property of ferromagnetic materials that causes them to change shape when subjected to a magnetic field. Magnetostrictive materials can convert magnetic energy into kinetic energy, or the reverse, and are used to build various actuators and sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Magnetostrictive sensors have been developed for nondestructive materials testing that make use of magnetostrictive properties of the material under inspection. Magnetostrictive sensors designed for testing ferromagnetic materials can also be made to work for testing nonferromagnetic metals by attaching a ferromagnetic material to the material being tested at areas where the sensors are to be placed. This may be achieved, for example, by coating the surface of the material to be tested with a coat of ferromagnetic material or by bonding a ferromagnetic medium such as wire or ribbon to the surface of the material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The combination of a magnetized magnetostrictive material and an excitation coil produces a magnetostrictive sensor (MsS) probe. For active non-destructive testing, elastic waves are launched and reflected echoes of the waves from defects such as corrosion or cracks are detected. A typical application of an MsS probe is for inspecting pipes and tubes, the primary structural members used in various industries to transport gaseous or liquid products. Various MsS probes have been designed to generate longitudinal waves in rods and cables, torsional waves in pipes, and shear horizontal waves in plates.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As indicated in the Background, MsS (magnetostrictive sensor) guided wave probes have been developed for testing plate structures, and do so by generating shear horizontal waves. These probes are well suited for monitoring structures with wall thicknesses up to 25 mm, but their principle of operation limits their operation on thicker structures. In order to apply MsS technology to thicker structures, a sensor capable of generating a surface guided wave is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The following description is directed to an MsS sensor for monitoring thick-walled structures. The sensor detects corrosion and surface breaking cracks using an ultrasonic pitch-catch technique. As explained below, the sensor has a pair of probes (transmitter probe and receiver probe), which may be placed adjacent to each other along the wave propagation axis or may be separated by some distance on the inspection surface.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Previously developed MsS probes use a time varying magnetic field, and have a thin ferromagnetic strip and an electrical coil. The strip is mechanically bonded to the test structure and is magnetized. The electrical coil is placed over the strip, and an alternating current pulse is applied to the coil. The current induces a time-varying magnetic field, which produces a time-varying strain in the ferromagnetic strip. As a result, ultrasonic waves are generated by the probe and are mechanically coupled into the test structure. Both the type and frequency of the generated waves depend upon the frequency of the applied current, the orientation of the driving forces caused by the magnetic fields induced by the probe, and the wall thickness of the material being inspected.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate an MsS probe <b>100</b> in accordance with the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a top plan view of the probe housing <b>101</b> with its lid removed from the top of the probe. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional side view of the probe <b>100</b>, to illustrate its major components.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For testing thick-walled structures, probe <b>100</b> relies on the generation of a wave with a wavelength much smaller than the thickness of the inspected structure. An objective is to couple the wave to only one surface of the inspected structure. To generate the surface wave, both a time-varying magnetic field and a time-invariant magnetic field are induced within a ferromagnetic strip <b>102</b>, which serves as the ultrasonic actuator of the probe <b>100</b>. The time-invariant field is induced nominally through the thickness of the strip <b>102</b>. The time-varying field is induced nominally parallel to the surface of the strip <b>102</b> and along the wave propagation axis.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a complete MsS sensor <b>300</b> has two probes <b>100</b>, and is shown in place on the surface of a thick walled structure for detecting defects in the structure wall. The surface under test is generally planar. A first probe <b>100</b> (transmitter) transmits a surface wave at a given frequency. An example of a typical frequency is 500 kHz. A second probe <b>100</b> (receiver) detects the transmitted wave and subsequent reflections, and is designed to produce the greatest possible signal response to the detected signals.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An MsS instrumentation unit <b>301</b> is used for providing driver (activation) signals to the transmitter probe <b>100</b>, and for receiving surface wave (response) signals from the receiver probe <b>100</b>. The instrumentation unit <b>301</b> has appropriate circuitry for performing these functions, and may also have hardware and software for performing analysis and reporting of the received signals. In operation, a reference waveform may be subtracted from each subsequent monitoring waveform to produce a differential waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the transmitter probe <b>100</b> and the receiver probe <b>100</b> each have five major elements: (i) a thin ferromagnetic strip <b>102</b> with a large coefficient of magnetostriction, (ii) a set of permanent magnets <b>103</b> to bias the ferromagnetic strip, (iii) an electronic coil <b>104</b> to drive a time-varying magnetic field in the ferromagnetic strip, (iv) a capacitor <b>105</b> to match the input impedance of the probe to the impedance expected by the probe driver instrument, and (v) a housing <b>101</b> to house the other probe elements and minimize the effect of external electromagnetic noise.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The probe elements (ii) through (iv) are enclosed in housing <b>101</b>. A top plate <b>101</b><i>a </i>is part of housing <b>101</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the magnets <b>103</b>, coil <b>104</b>, and strip <b>102</b> are generally rectangular and planar, with a thickness much smaller than their length or width. They are arranged in layers, with the strip <b>102</b> being exposed on the bottom of housing <b>101</b> so that strip <b>102</b> can be placed against the surface being tested.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An example of a suitable material for strip <b>102</b> is an iron cobalt (FeCo) alloy. The ferromagnetic strip <b>102</b> may be adhered to the inspection surface, using an adherent such as epoxy.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The transmitter probe <b>100</b> and receiver probe <b>100</b> may be nearly identical in construction, with the exception of the electronic coil <b>104</b> and the impedance-matching capacitor <b>105</b>. The receiver probe <b>100</b> requires a large number of windings within the coil <b>104</b> and relatively high characteristic impedance in order to produce a large voltage response to a detected signal. The transmitter probe <b>100</b> requires a much lower characteristic impedance to generate the surface wave.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of the coil <b>104</b>. An example of a suitable coil <b>104</b> to generate surface waves for use in ultra-high frequency applications is a meanderline coil. The coil <b>104</b> is modular and multilayer, to satisfy the requirements of both probes. Each coil layer is printed on a flexible kapton sheet with one contact on either side of the sheet. The receiver probe <b>100</b> uses two coils <b>104</b> stacked vertically to form a single series multi-layer coil, whereas the transmitter probe <b>100</b> uses a single coil <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An example of suitable coil dimensions is 102 mm&#xd7;25 mm (4 inches&#xd7;1 inch). The coil <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a single layer 500 kHz meanderline coil. It has four meanderline repetitions, each with four wire traces.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The coil <b>104</b> in both the transmitter probe <b>100</b> and the receiver probe <b>100</b> behaves essentially as an inductor. The ferromagnetic strip <b>102</b> behaves as an inductor core. Therefore, the impedance of the coils <b>104</b> has a very large imaginary component. To match the impedance of the probes <b>100</b> to the impedance values expected by the MsS driver instrument, the transmitter capacitor <b>105</b> has a capacitance that will place the transmitter coil in series resonance, and the receiver capacitor <b>105</b> has a capacitance that will place the receiver coil in parallel resonance. Examples of typical capacitance values are 27 nF and 9 nF for the transmitter and receiver capacitors, respectively. The transmitter coil can drive the largest possible current due to an applied voltage, and the receiver coil can drive the largest possible voltage due to an induced current. This allows both probes <b>100</b> to perform with optimum efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The remaining elements are identical for both probes <b>100</b>. The bias magnets <b>103</b> are placed over the coil <b>104</b>, which is placed over strip <b>102</b>, relative to the surface being tested. The magnetic bias field generated by magnets <b>103</b> is generally perpendicular to the surface being tested, and passes nominally through the thickness of strip <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, probe <b>100</b> has three magnets <b>103</b>. The magnets are grade N42 neodenium iron boron magnets <b>103</b>, measuring 38.1 mm&#xd7;19.1 mm&#xd7;6.4 mm [1.5 in&#xd7;0.75 in&#xd7;0.25 in]. The north-to-south field direction is aligned through the 6.4 mm thickness of each magnet <b>103</b>. The magnet <b>103</b> in the center is oriented with the poles opposite the direction of the adjacent (side) magnets <b>103</b>. Alternatively, two magnets with their respective poles placed in opposite orientations could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The body of the probe housing <b>101</b> is composed of aluminum, and a carbon steel top plate <b>101</b><i>a </i>is included on the probe. The enclosure <b>101</b> serves to maintain the positioning of the other probe elements, and doubles as an electronic noise shield. Various other noise-shielding materials may be used for housing <b>101</b> and lid <b>101</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a normalized radiation pattern of the transmitter probe through the thickness of the inspection surface. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the wave propagation properties of two MsS probes <b>100</b> were characterized on a 50 mm thick carbon steel plate. The majority of the energy generated by the transmitter probe travels as a surface wave and is bounded within the first 1.5 wavelengths {8.9 mm [0.35 in]} of the plate surface. Most of the remaining energy is transmitted as a bulk wave at a 16&#xb0; incidence relative to the plate surface.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the primary lobe is bounded between an incidence angle of 82&#xb0; and 90&#xb0;. A significant secondary lobe is observed to peak at roughly 74&#xb0;. This secondary lobe propagates as a bulk wave.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a detection map, resulting from experimental testing to determine the defect detection sensitivity of the sensor to a defect measuring 12.5 mm [0.49 in] deep, 42.5 mm [1.67 in] long, and 200 &#x3bc;m [7.9 mils] wide. The testing was conducted with the transmitter probe and receiver probe separated by 100 mm, and with the receiver probe centered on the wave propagation axis.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The useful detection zone of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> assumes a 10 cm [3.93 in] separation between the transmitter probe (blue circle) and the receiver probe (red circle). The area of the detection zone that is deemed reliable is bounded by a black outline. At a distance of 2 m [6.56 ft], the useful detection zone is roughly 16 cm [6.3 in] wide. At the widest point, {1.35 m [4.43 ft]} the zone is roughly 24 cm [9.45 in] wide. The near field of the probe, which extends roughly 44 cm [17.32 in] from the transmitter probe, is not depicted.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In experimental use, a sensor <b>300</b> comprising a pair of probes <b>100</b> has been shown to propagate a surface guided wave on structures exceeding 25 mm in thickness and have been demonstrated for crack detection. The sensor <b>300</b> has been shown to be capable of detecting large cracks exceeding 1 cm in depth and 4 cm in length at distances up to 2 meters from the receiver probe, and can detect cracks as small as 1 mm in depth and 1 cm in length at distances less than 1 m from the receiver probe. The sensor <b>300</b> is designed to monitor the structural integrity of thick-walled structures, such as dry storage cask systems for nuclear waste, pressure vessels in the chemical and petrochemical industries, nuclear containment shells, and structural plating on oil tankers.</p>
