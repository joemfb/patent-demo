<heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATION INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to and the benefit of German patent application no. 10 2009 045 428.4, which was filed in Germany on Oct. 7, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a manufacturing method for a micromechanical component. The present invention also relates to a micromechanical component. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a manufacturing method for a sensor device having the displaceable mass of the micromechanical component as the sensitive element and such a sensor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An acceleration sensor is frequently configured as a capacitive acceleration sensor. Such a capacitive acceleration sensor typically includes an actuator electrode, which is placed on a displaceable mass, and a stator electrode, which is fixedly connected to a mounting of the acceleration sensor. During acceleration of the capacitive acceleration sensor, a displacement movement of the displaceable mass causes a change in a distance between the electrodes. The acceleration of the acceleration sensor is ascertainable by analyzing a voltage applied between the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The electrodes of a capacitive acceleration sensor may be configured as comb structures. As an alternative thereto, US 2008/0142914 A1 describes an acceleration sensor having actuator plate electrodes, which are placed on a diaphragm. Stator plate electrodes are fixedly connected to the mounting of the acceleration sensor adjacent to the actuator plate electrodes. In order to obtain a sufficient change in a curve of the diaphragm during acceleration of the acceleration sensor, a displaceable mass, which is configured as an inertial mass, is attached to the diaphragm.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The exemplary embodiments and/or exemplary methods of the present invention provides a manufacturing method for a micromechanical component having the features described herein, a manufacturing method for a sensor device having the features described herein, a micromechanical component having the features described herein, and a sensor device having the features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The manufacturing methods are easily executable in silicon microsystem technology. The ability to execute the manufacturing method is not restricted to structuring the displaceable mass out of a silicon substrate, however. As an alternative or a supplement to silicon, the displaceable mass and the frame may also be made of another substrate material, such as a metal and/or a semiconductor material. For example, MEMS processing may be used to manufacture the micromechanical component.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one advantageous specific embodiment, at least one through contact is formed, which is continuous through the frame and contacts at least one contact surface of the at least one contact terminal. Such a through contact does not impair the displaceability of the displaceable mass. In addition, the through contact ensures a reliable electrical contact between the at least one contact surface and the second side of the frame, facing away from the electrodes. The frame may thus be installed in a simple manner on the second side on a circuit board or a CMOS chip.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, at least one second trench may be produced to form the at least one through contact, the at least one second trench being etched in the first direction in such a way that the at least one contact surface is exposed and/or at least one boundary surface, which encloses the at least one contact surface, of the at least one second trench is formed. This is executable easily and cost-effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The at least one first trench and the at least one second trench may be formed in a joint etching step. Etching of the at least one first trench and the at least one second trench in a joint etching step is to be understood to mean, for example, that a mask is structured, whose through openings correspond to the positions and the widths of the at least one first trench and the at least one second trench. This simplifies the manufacture of the micromechanical component and reduces the manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The at least one contact surface may be exposed using the at least one second trench. Subsequently, insulating side walls and a conductive core may be formed in the at least one second trench. The manufacture of the at least one through contact is thus easily executable.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a supplement or an alternative thereto, at least one etching opening may be formed in the at least one stator plate electrode. The at least one etching opening makes it easier to remove at least the partial mass of the second insulating layer. The at least one etching opening may have a diameter between 0.05 &#x3bc;m and 5 &#x3bc;m. An etching opening configured in this way is suitable in particular for a glob top and gelling to seal the micromechanical component against penetration of foreign materials.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above-described manufacturing method is also usable for manufacturing a sensor device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The advantages which are described in the preceding paragraphs are also ensured in the case of a corresponding micromechanical component. In the micromechanical component, the at least one spring component may also be used as the line between the assigned actuator plate electrode and the assigned contact terminal. The micromechanical component described here is additionally reducible in its size and its manufacture is simplified due to this multifunctionality of the spring component.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The exemplary embodiments and/or exemplary methods of the present invention allows for a micromechanical component having a mass displaceable in up to three spatial directions. The displaceability of the displaceable mass in three spatial directions may be used, for example, to implement a sensor device having three sensitive directions. For example, a cost-effective acceleration sensor may be configured in this way, using which an acceleration is detectable in all three spatial directions using a single displaceable mass. Due to the comparatively required small installation space and the minor mass of the acceleration sensor, which is configured having only one displaceable mass, it is suitable for a large number of various possible uses.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As described in greater detail hereafter, the micromechanical component may be protected via a glob top and/or with the aid of gelling against penetration of particles and/or a liquid. It is thus not necessary to protect the micromechanical component using a cap, for example, using a silicon cap. In addition to saving material costs, the necessity of a bonding frame is thus also dispensed with. This allows an additional reduction in the required installation space and/or a mass reduction of the micromechanical component.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A sensor device having a micromechanical component including the displaceable mass as the sensitive element of the sensor device, as described above, may be manufactured cost-effectively, requires comparatively little installation space, and has a relatively small mass. The sensor device is therefore suitable for many applications. In particular, the analysis unit of the sensor device may be configured in such a way that an acceleration may be established as information with the aid of the analysis unit taking into account the sensor variable. However, it is to be noted that the use of the sensor device is not restricted to an acceleration sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further features and advantages of the exemplary embodiments and/or exemplary methods of the present invention are explained hereafter on the basis of the figures.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a flow chart to illustrate a specific embodiment of the manufacturing method.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a method step S<b>1</b>, a first side of a substrate is at least partially covered using an insulating layer. The substrate, which is at least partially covered on the first side, includes a metal and/or a semiconductor material. The substrate may be a silicon substrate, for example. However, the method described here is not restricted to the use of a substrate made of silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first insulating layer may be an oxide layer, such as silicon oxide. Thermal oxidation of the first side of the substrate may be performed in method step S<b>1</b>. The first insulating layer also functions as the first sacrificial layer. The ability to execute the method described here is simplified by this multifunctionality of the first insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A through opening may be formed in the first insulating layer. For example, at least one through opening is etched in the first insulating layer after the thermal oxidation. Parts of the micromechanical component which are formed later may easily be placed directly on the first side of the substrate by forming the at least one through opening in the first insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a further method step S<b>2</b>, at least one first conductive material is applied to the first insulating layer. At least one actuator plate electrode, at least one actuator contact terminal, and at least one spring component are formed from at least the first conductive material. At least one of the actuator plate electrodes is connected via the particular spring component to the assigned actuator contact terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The at least one spring component may be structured/formed in such a way that the actuator plate electrode connected thereto is displaceable using a comparatively small force with respect to the assigned actuator contact terminal. For example, a doped semiconductor layer and/or a metal may be deposited and structured as the first conductive material. Suitable semiconductor materials are germanium and/or silicon. A doped polysilicon layer may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In particular, the at least one through opening in the first insulating layer may be at least partially filled with at least the first conductive material in method step S<b>2</b>. The at least one actuator contact terminal may thus be placed directly on the first side of the substrate in a simple way. The advantage of such a configuration of the at least one actuator contact terminal will become apparent hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a subsequent method step S<b>3</b>, at least the at least one actuator plate electrode, the at least one actuator contact terminal, and the at least one spring component are covered using a second insulating layer. The second insulating layer may also include an oxide, such as silicon oxide. However, the method described here is not restricted to the exclusive use of silicon oxide as the material for the first insulating layer and/or the second insulating layer. The second insulating layer also has the additional functionality of a second sacrificial layer, which simplifies the ability to execute the manufacturing method.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an optional method step S<b>4</b>, the first insulating layer and/or the second insulating layer may be structured in such a way that at least one through opening is formed, which advantageously exposes a partial surface of the first side of the substrate. In a subsequent method step, at least one component may be formed/placed directly on the first side of the substrate on the at least one exposed partial surface.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As an alternative or a supplement to forming at least one through opening in the first insulating layer and/or the second insulating layer, at least one depression may also be formed in the second insulating layer in method step S<b>4</b>. Method step S<b>4</b> may include two etching steps, for example. As explained in greater detail hereafter, the at least one depression in the second insulating layer may be used as a negative/form specification for forming at least one stop on a stator plate electrode formed hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Subsequently, at least one second conductive material is applied to the second insulating layer in a method step S<b>5</b>. The second conductive material may be a metal and/or a semiconductor material, such as germanium and/or silicon. A second doped polysilicon layer may be deposited as the second conductive material. At least one stator plate electrode is formed from at least the second conductive material. In addition, at least one stator contact terminal may also be structured from at least the second conductive material, each stator contact terminal being formed in one piece with the assigned stator plate electrode. The at least one stator contact terminal may be placed directly on the first side of the substrate in at least one of the through openings in the first insulating layer and/or the second insulating layer. This makes the formation of a through contact on the at least one stator contact terminal in a subsequent method step easier.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">During the structuring of the at least one second conductive material to form the at least one stator plate electrode, etching accesses may also be applied for later sacrificial layer etching. In particular, at least one etching opening may be formed in the at least one stator plate electrode. The at least one etching opening may have a diameter in a range between 0.05 &#x3bc;m and 5 &#x3bc;m. The at least one stator plate electrode is advantageously formed having a maximum thickness, facing perpendicularly to the first side, which is less than 8 &#x3bc;m, advantageously less than 5 &#x3bc;m, in particular less than 2 &#x3bc;m. This is easily executable in that the material/materials which is/are applied in method step S<b>5</b> to the second insulating layer is/are deposited having a total thickness less than 8 &#x3bc;m, advantageously less than 5 &#x3bc;m, in particular less than 2 &#x3bc;m. The advantages of a diameter of the at least one etching opening of the at least one stator plate electrode in this range and the comparatively low maximum thickness are discussed in greater detail hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an advantageous specific embodiment, in addition to the second conductive material, a nonconductive material is also applied to the second insulating layer in method step S<b>5</b>. The nonconductive material may be a (moderately pressure-tensioned) silicon-rich nitride layer, for example. The second conductive material, such as, for example, a second doped polysilicon layer, may be structured/deposited in this case in such a way that the second conductive material is only used for forming electron surfaces of the at least one stator plate electrode, a contact surface of the at least one stator contact terminal on the first side, and/or at least one conductive layer which connects a contact surface to an assigned electron surface. In particular, the at least one depression in the second insulating layer may be filled with the nonconductive material. At least one stop made of the nonconductive material may thus be formed in a simple way on the at least one stator plate electrode. Such stops may prevent sticking between the at least one actuator plate electrode and the at least one stator plate electrode during later operation of the micromechanical component. In particular, a current flow between the electrodes is prevented due to the insulating properties of the stops. The stops thus also contribute to preventing welding of the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an optional method step S<b>6</b>, an external contact may be formed on a second side of the substrate, which is diametrically opposite to the first side. For this purpose, a material suitable for electrical contact, for example, a metal and/or a doped semiconductor material, may be deposited and structured on the second side. Method step S<b>6</b> may also be executed before or between method steps S<b>1</b> through S<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a method step S<b>7</b>, at least one first trench is formed in the substrate. Using the at least one first trench, a displaceable mass (inertial mass) and a frame, which at least partially encloses the displaceable mass, of a mounting of the micromechanical component formed thereafter are structured out of the substrate. The displaceable mass is/remains connected via the at least one spring component to the mounting in such a way that the displaceable mass is displaceable in relation to the mounting. Etching is performed in a first direction from the second side to the first side for suitable structuring of the displaceable mass and the mounting. This may also be referred to as rear side etching. A suitable etching process is, for example, deep reactive ion etching (DRIE).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At least one second trench may be also formed in a method step S<b>8</b>, which is etched continuously through the substrate in the first direction from the second side to the first side. The etching of the at least one second trench is performed to form at least one through contact, via which a stator contact terminal or an actuator contact terminal on the first side may be contacted. The formation of the at least one first trench and the at least one second trench may be executed in a (joint) etching step, for example, in a DRIE etching step, using only one mask. The structuring of the mask may correspond to the positions and widths of the at least one first trench and the at least one second trench. Method steps S<b>8</b> and S<b>9</b> may thus be executed simultaneously. Such a manufacturing method is executable comparatively simply and cost-effectively. As an alternative thereto, the formation of the at least one second trench may be performed in a further etching step before or after the at least one first trench has been formed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Procedures for forming two different structures of through contacts are described hereafter:</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the first procedure, the at least one second trench is etched through the substrate in such a way that at least one contact surface, which contacts the first side of the substrate, of the at least one actuator contact terminal and/or stator contact terminal is framed by at least one floor/one boundary surface of the at least one second trench. In this case, the areas made of the substrate material, which are enclosed by the at least one second trench, may be used as the through contacts themselves. In order to ensure a good conductivity through the through contacts, which are adequately electrically insulated from the surrounding frame via the at least one second trench, doping of the areas made of the substrate material may be executed before or after method step S<b>7</b>. The at least one second trench may also be filled using an insulating material, in order to improve the electrical insulation. The formation of the at least one through contact may also be restricted to the etching of the at least one second trench, which is described in this paragraph.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the second procedure, the at least one second trench is formed in such a way that the at least one later contact surface is exposed. In this case, to form the at least one conductive contact, at least the side walls of the at least one second trench are covered using an insulating material in a further method step S<b>9</b>. Subsequently, in a method step S<b>10</b>, the at least one second trench may be filled using a third conductive material, such as, for example, a metal and/or a doped semiconductor material, after the covering of at least the side walls using the insulating material. Method steps S<b>9</b> and S<b>10</b> offer easily executable possibilities for forming a conductive contact having a conductive core and insulating side walls.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Before, during, or after method steps S<b>7</b> through S<b>10</b>, in a method step S<b>11</b>, at least one partial mass of the second insulating layer, which lies between the at least one actuator plate electrode and the at least one stator plate electrode, is removed. Etching is performed in a second direction from the first side to the second side of the substrate. Further areas of the first insulating layer and/or the second insulating layer may also be removed via the sacrificial layer etching in method step S<b>11</b>. If at least one of the two insulating layers includes an oxide, such as, for example, silicon oxide, method step S<b>11</b> may include HF gas-phase etching. Method step S<b>11</b> is thus easily executable, without the electrodes and the parts connected thereto being damaged. In particular, the at least one etching opening, which is placed in the at least one stator plate electrode, may make it easier to execute the etching. At a maximum thickness of the at least one stator plate electrode of less than 8 &#x3bc;m, advantageously less than 5 &#x3bc;m, in particular less than 2 &#x3bc;m, a diameter of the at least one etching opening in the range between 0.05 &#x3bc;m and 5 &#x3bc;m is already sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A cavern is formed in method steps S<b>7</b> and S<b>11</b>, in which the displaceable mass, which is structured out of the substrate, is deflectably placed. In the case of a suitable implementation of the at least one spring component, in particular a displaceability of the displaceable mass in all three spatial directions is ensured. The advantages of a micromechanical component having such a freely displaceable mass will be described on the basis of the further figures.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a further optional method step S<b>12</b>, the micromechanical component which is manufactured using method steps S<b>1</b> through S<b>11</b> may be placed on a contact plate. The contact plate may be a circuit board or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS chip), on which the micromechanical component is directly installed. Spacers, in particular conductive spacers (bump technology), may be used for mechanical and/or electrical contacting of the micromechanical component placed on the contact plate. The contact plate may additionally have at least one wire connection.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Optionally, in a method step S<b>13</b>, at least one etching access for executing the sacrificial layer etching of method step S<b>11</b>, such as, for example, the at least one etching opening, may also be sealed airtight using a sealing layer. For example, a PECVD nitride (plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition) may be deposited as the sealing layer. Penetration of foreign particles during later operation of the micromechanical component may be prevented using the sealing layer. In particular small etching accesses having diameters in the range between 0.05 &#x3bc;m and 5 &#x3bc;m have advantageous effects, since penetration of material of the sealing layer is prevented due to the small diameter of the etching accesses. The sealing layer may have a layer thickness in a range between 1 &#x3bc;m and 5 &#x3bc;m, for example. As an alternative thereto, the micromechanical component may be extrusion coated using a glob top and/or using a gel. Such capping reliably protects the micromechanical component against penetration of foreign particles. In addition, such capping ensures a better hold of the micromechanical component on the contact plate. Small etching accesses having diameters in the range between 0.05 &#x3bc;m and 5 &#x3bc;m also prevent the penetration of material in the case of capping.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a refinement of the manufacturing method described in the preceding paragraphs, still further layers may be deposited for wafer bow minimization. In addition to the above-mentioned materials, for example, a structured, highly tensioned nitride may be formed between the substrate and the first insulating layer. A tension of the first insulating layer may be compensated for in this way. A pressure-tensioned oxide may also be applied to the second side of the substrate as an alternative or supplement to the highly tensioned nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As an alternative or supplement, the semiconductor areas of the electrodes may be doped like diodes in the refinement. For example, the at least one actuator plate electrode is doped using ions of a first conduction type and the at least one stator plate electrode is doped using ions of a second charge type, which differs from the first conduction type. The diode-like doping of the electrodes additionally contributes to preventing a current flow between the electrodes, and thus welding of the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> show a cross section and a top view of a first specific embodiment of the micromechanical component.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The micromechanical component which is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> includes a displaceable mass (inertial mass) <b>10</b>, which is displaceable in relation to a mounting of the micromechanical component. Displaceable mass <b>10</b> is made of a substrate material, such as silicon, for example. At least one actuator plate electrode <b>12</b> is placed on a first side <b>11</b> of displaceable mass <b>10</b>. At least partial areas of a first insulating layer <b>14</b> are between the at least one actuator plate electrode <b>12</b> and displaceable mass <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At least one stator plate electrode <b>16</b> is fixedly connected to the mounting of the micromechanical component adjacent to the at least one actuator plate electrode <b>12</b>. Four stator plate electrodes <b>16</b> may be placed spaced apart from the at least one actuator plate electrode <b>12</b> or four actuator plate electrodes <b>12</b> are placed spaced apart from the at least one stator plate electrode <b>16</b>. In this case, a movement of displaceable mass <b>10</b> in all three spatial directions is detectable via an analysis of the voltages applied between electrodes <b>12</b> and <b>16</b>, or the capacitances of the capacitors which are formed by electrodes <b>12</b> and <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an advantageous specific embodiment of the micromechanical component, the at least one stator plate electrode <b>16</b> may have at least one etching opening <b>18</b>. Introducing at least one etching opening <b>18</b> into the at least one stator plate electrode <b>16</b> makes the manufacture of the micromechanical component which is described here easier. The at least one etching opening <b>18</b> may have a diameter in a range between 0.05 &#x3bc;m and 5 &#x3bc;m. Implementing the at least one etching opening <b>18</b> in this way prevents penetration of a sealing material.</p>

Further parts of the at least one stator plate electrode <b>16</b>, in particular an external frame <b>24</b>, may be made of an insulating material. This makes it easier to manufacture the at least one stator plate electrode <b>16</b> having a comparatively small maximum width perpendicular to first side <b>11</b> of less than 8 &#x3bc;m, advantageously less than 5 &#x3bc;m, in particular less than 3 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At least one stop <b>26</b> may be placed on a side of the at least one stator plate electrode <b>16</b> facing toward the at least one actuator plate electrode <b>12</b>. Sticking of electrodes <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> may be prevented with the aid of such stops <b>26</b>. In particular, stops <b>26</b> may be made of the insulating material of external frame <b>24</b>. A current flow between electrodes <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> is prevented in this way, even upon striking of electrodes <b>12</b> and <b>16</b>. Welding of electrodes <b>12</b> and <b>16</b>, which contact one another, is thus prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The at least one stator plate electrode <b>16</b> is connected at least via conductive layer <b>22</b> to an assigned stator contact terminal <b>28</b>.

The at least one actuator plate electrode <b>12</b> is also connected via at least one spring component <b>32</b> to at least one assigned actuator contact terminal <b>34</b>, which may be fastened directly on the frame. The at least one stator contact terminal <b>28</b> and the at least one actuator contact terminal <b>34</b> may be covered by the insulating material of external frame <b>24</b>. This improves the multifunctionality of external frame <b>24</b>. In order to additionally prevent a current flow between electrodes <b>12</b> and <b>16</b>, partial areas of actuator contact terminal <b>34</b> and/or actuator plate electrode <b>12</b> may also be enclosed by a second insulating layer <b>36</b>, whose mean layer thickness defines a mean distance of the electrode surfaces of electrodes <b>12</b> and <b>16</b>.</p>

Frame <b>30</b> is separated from displaceable mass <b>10</b> using at least one first trench <b>38</b>. Displaceable mass <b>10</b> may thus be placed in a particular position inside frame <b>30</b> via structuring out of the substrate material during manufacture of the micromechanical component. Complex alignment/fastening of displaceable mass <b>10</b> in the micromechanical component is dispensed with.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the specific embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the micromechanical component has a through contact <b>40</b> for each contact terminal <b>28</b> and <b>34</b>, which contacts a contact surface <b>42</b> of assigned contact terminal <b>28</b> and <b>34</b> continuously through frame <b>30</b> from second side <b>39</b>. A contact surface is to be understood as a surface of particular contact terminal <b>28</b> or <b>34</b> which contacts first side <b>11</b> of frame <b>30</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The schematically shown sensor device includes the above-described micromechanical components having parts <b>10</b> through <b>48</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the illustrated specific embodiment, contact plate <b>60</b> is connected via a wire connection <b>62</b> to an analysis unit.
