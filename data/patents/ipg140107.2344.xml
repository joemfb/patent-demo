<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of producing a carbon nanotube film structure having a substrate and a carbon nanotube layer, comprises a placing step of placing a carbon nanotube film comprising a plurality of carbon nanotubes aligned in one direction within a film plane on the substrate; and a densifying step of applying a densifying treatment to the carbon nanotube film thereby forming the carbon nanotube layer having the weight density of the carbon nanotube to 0.1 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or more. Thus, a problem of island-like shrinkage caused while a highly densified CNT layer is being manufactured is solved, and a high-quality CNT film structure wherein the aligned CNT layer having a high density and uniform thickness is deposited on the substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a carbon nanotube film structure, and a production process thereof. More specifically the invention also relates to a carbon nanotube film structure in which a carbon nanotube layer formed by aligning a plurality of carbon nanotubes continuously in one direction within a film plane is deposited on a substrate, and a production process thereof. Further, the invention also relates to a carbon nanotube thin film in which a plurality of carbon nanotubes are aligned in one direction within a film plane, and a production process thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A momentum has been increased for applying carbon nanotube (hereinafter also referred to as CNT) as a constituent material for Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices or electronic devices in the field of nanotechnology. For obtaining such devices, it has been demanded for a CNT film structure in which a CNT layer including a film-like CNT aggregate comprising a plurality of CNTs (hereinafter also referred to as a CNT film) is deposited on the surface of a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the present specification, &#x201c;carbon nanotube (CNT) film structure&#x201d; means a structure in which a CNT layer is disposed on a substrate and denotes a structure used as a wafer, for example, of electronic devices or MEMS devices, and it includes not only a substrate having planar surface but also a substrate having an uneven surface and a substrate of a three-dimensional structure in which the surface of a substrate having a protruded structural portion is covered with a CNT film. Further, &#x201c;CNT aggregate&#x201d; in the present specification means a structure in which a plurality of CNTs (for example, at a number density of 5&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>CNTs/cm<sup>2 </sup>or more) are aggregated in a layered or a bundled state. Further, &#x201c;CNT film&#x201d; referred to in the present specification means a plurality of CNTs aggregated in a thin film or thin-plate shape and includes those of sheet, foil, ribbon shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As techniques for producing such a CNT film structure, there have been known a technique of forming a step difference at the surface of a substrate and growing CNTs from the side wall of the step difference in parallel with the surface of the substrate, that is, a technique of producing a film structure having a CNT layer aligned in parallel with the surface of the substrate by using a chemical vapor deposition method (hereinafter also referred to as a CVD method) (refer to JP-A No. 2003-081622), and a technique of coating a liquid suspension of CNTs on a substrate by a spin coating method thereby depositing a non-woven fabric comprising CNT to the surface of the substrate, that is, a technique of producing a film structure with planar surface having a CNT layer (refer to JP-T No. 2005-524000).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the CNT film structure described in JP-A No. 2003-081622, since a stepped substrate is used, it is substantially impossible to planarize the surface of the CNT layer. In addition, the step difference is intended for forming the CNT layer and this is not necessary as a CNT film structure. Since such a step difference rather hinders the laying of wirings, it involves a problem of making the production of an electronic device extremely difficult. Further, since it is necessary that a substrate used in the process for forming the CNT layer (substrate for synthesizing CNT) is identical with a substrate as a film structure (wafer substrate), it is difficult to form the CNT layer at an optional position of an optional substrate and, in addition, only the substrate which withstands a heat treatment during CNT synthesis can be used for the CNT film structure. Further, the CNT layer formed as described above generally has low density (0.03 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less) and is in a fluffy state. Then, since a liquid agent such as a resist impregnates into a gap between CNTs in a state as formed, shaping processing by well-known patterning technique or etching technique is extremely difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, in the CNT film structure described in JP-T No. 2005-524000, a liquid suspension of CNTs has to be coated over and over for obtaining a CNT layer of a desired thickness and this tends to complicate the production steps. Further, while a CNT layer in which a plurality of CNTs are aligned in one identical direction can be provided with a property which is different between the alignment direction of CNTs and a direction perpendicular thereto, that is, anisotropy with regard to electric property (for example, conductivity), optical property (for example, transmittance), or mechanical characteristics (for example, bending property), it is difficult in the CNT film structure described in JP-T No. 2005-524000 to align a plurality of CNTs in one identical direction (providing anisotropy) in view of the production process thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">JP-A No. 2006-228818 proposes a technique of synthesizing a plurality of vertically aligned CNTs on a substrate and then turning down them thereby aligning the CNTs in parallel with the substrate. However, as it is apparent that JP-A No. 2006-228818 intends to prevent bundling of CNTs (column 0048), no technical idea of using a plurality of CNTs as an aggregate is not recognized therein. Further also in this case, shaping processing by well-known pattering technique and etching technique is substantially impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">JP-A No. 2007-182352 proposes a technique of increasing the density of a CNT aggregate aligned in a predetermined direction thereby enhancing the rigidity thereof. This can solve the problem of the existent CNT aggregate that the density is low and the strength is poor. However, this JP-A No. 2007-182352 does not suggest formation of a CNT layer in which a plurality of CNTs are aligned continuously along a film plane.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">JP-A No. 2007-182352 also considers a method of exposing a CNT aggregate to a liquid and then applying a pressure in a direction oblique to the alignment direction by way of a planar plate or the like, thereby turning down the CNTs. However, in this case, since the CNT aggregate is adhered to the plate or the CNT aggregate, undergoes damage or causes warp not being durable to the pressure, it is difficult to obtain a CNT film structure having a CNT layer of high density and uniform thickness. Further, since the thickness of the film is limited to 3 &#x3bc;m to 20 &#x3bc;m and, in addition, since CNTs are turned down, it is difficult to obtain a thin film by using CNTs of large size in the height. With the reasons described above, the structure described in JP-A No. 2007-182352 is not suitable to MEMS application use that requires a highly integrated arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, referring to the alignment, the CNT film structure described in JP-A No. 2007-182352 is formed by obliquely turning down, under pressure, the CNT aggregate aligned vertically from the substrate and the direction of the CNTs on the substrate is forcedly changed by an external force before and after the pressure-turn down treatment. That is, in the technique described in JP-A No. 2007-182352, the way of applying the pressure gives a significant effect on the alignment and it is difficult to obtain a CNT film structure in which a plurality of CNTs are aligned at a high level.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Even when the CNT aggregate vertically aligned above the substrate (state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>)) is exposed to a liquid, it forms an island shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), <b>1</b>(<i>c</i>), <b>1</b>(<i>d</i>) (refer to Nirupama Chakrapani, et al., Capillarity-driven assembly of two dimensional cellular carbon nanotube foams.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As can be seen in each of the patent documents described above, no technique for obtaining a CNT film structure in which high density aligned CNT layers are deposited above a substrate has been found at all. In the first place, since CNT is synthesized under a high temperature atmosphere, substrates that can be used are restricted and no technical ideas, for example, of intending to synthesize CNT on a substrate provided with a three dimensional structure (unevenness or like other structure) have been not present. That is, in the prior art, it was extremely difficult to dispose a CNT layer of optional shape to an optional position of an optional substrate and production of high density aligned CNT film structure was substantially impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, since a CNT film formed by a CVD method or the like generally had a low weight density in a state as formed, it was impossible to apply a well-known integrated circuit production process that requires coating of a resist or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, for a CNT aggregate in which the alignment degree of CNTs is low or CNTs are not aligned at all, a gap between individual CNTs in the assembly is inevitably increased and the filling density is not increased sufficiently even when they are compressed, for example, by applying an external pressure (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>)) and integrity and solidness capable of satisfying desired mechanical property cannot be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The problems described above result significant impediments in using a CNT film structure to an application use, for example, of MEMS that requires mechanical operation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention has been accomplished in view of the situations in the prior art and it mainly intends to provide a CNT film structure of high quality in which a CNT layer having a plurality of CNTs aligned continuously in one identical direction along a film plane and having high density and uniform thickness is deposited above a substrate, that is, a CNT film structure having a CNT film of an optional shape having excellent physical property and a substrate of an optional shape and material.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, the invention also intends to provide a CNT film structure having a CNT layer with anisotropy constituted with a CNT aggregate comprising a plurality of CNTs on the surface of a stepless planar substrate, or a three dimensionally shaped CNT film structure in which the surface of a substrate having a protruded structural portion or unevenness is covered with a CNT layer having anisotropy.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, the invention also intends to provide a CNT thin film in which a plurality of CNTs aligned in one direction within a film plane are filled at a high density.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In order to solve the problems described above, the present invention provides the following CNT film structure and the production process thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">[1] A method of producing a CNT film structure having a substrate and a CNT layer, in which a step of forming the CNT layer includes a placing step of placing a CNT film comprising a plurality of CNTs aligned in one direction in a film plane on the substrate, and a densifying step of applying a densifying treatment to the CNT film thereby increasing the weight density of the CNT to 0.1 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or more. According to the method, the CNT films shrink in the direction perpendicular to the alignment direction of CNTs by the presence of the substrate to which the film is placed. Accordingly, densification proceeds uniformly and a CNT film structure with a CNT layer having anisotropy, with no step difference and of planar surface can be produced easily. In addition, when the alignment property of CNT is high, since a distance between individual CNTs to each other is naturally narrowed (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>)) and the bonding force (Van der Waals' force) between each of CNTs that constitute the CNT layer is further increased, integrity and the solidness as the CNT film structure are improved to obtain a desired mechanical strength. Further, by increasing the density of the CNT layer to such a high level, since coating of a resist is possible, the CNT layer can be fabricated by applying a well-known patterning technique or etching techniques. The alignment property of CNT required for the CNT film of the invention is not necessarily complete so long as the densifying step can be practiced, and the integrity, the shape retainability, and the shape processability of the CNT layer are within an allowable level for putting the MEMS device to practical use.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the invention adopting the technical means or method described above, it is possible to easily provide a CNT film structure having a film-like CNT layer in which a plurality of CNTs aligned continuously in one direction along the film plane are filled at a high density and having a uniform thickness, and a remarkable effect can be provided for solving the problems described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the highly aligned CNT film constituting the CNT film structure, CNTs are intensely bonded to each other to such an extent that an integrity as a film can be maintained even when the film is detached from a synthesis substrate. That is, the invention can provide a technique which gives a remarkable turning point compared with the prior art in that the CNT film can be detached from the synthesis substrate and placed on other optional substrate. This is to be described below</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is considered that the phenomenon in which densification proceeds when a CNT aggregate deposited with a liquid is dried is caused by adhesion of each of CNTs adjacent with each other due to the surface tension upon evaporation of the liquid deposited to individual CNTs. That is, when the CNT aggregate is formed into a film shape and a densifying treatment is applied with the alignment direction thereof being in parallel with the surface of the wafer substrate, not only the movement of individual CNTs along the surface of the wafer substrate is restricted by adhesion between the CNT film and the wafer substrate but also the direction of shrinkage of the CNT film is defined in one dimensional manner in the direction perpendicular to the wafer substrate also due to the generation of the surface tension exclusively in the direction of height by the evaporation of the liquid from the side of the CNT film. Since the density of the CNT film is uniformly increased only in the direction of the thickness by the situations described above, the problem of shrinkage in the island shape in a case applying the densifying treatment to the bulky CNT aggregate grown vertically from the synthesis substrate does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">That is, according to the invention of placing the CNT film on the wafer substrate different from the synthesis substrate and applying the densifying treatment thereto, since the densification proceeds only in the direction of the thickness and a CNT film having a sufficiently high weight density and aligned highly along the film plane can be obtained, a CNT film structure provided with a high density CNT layer at an optional position of an optional substrate can be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the CNT film structure, since CNTs constituting the CNT layer are closely gathered (filled), the integrity as an individual body can be maintained and since the resist can be coated (confirmed in the CNT layer at a weight density of 0.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), a well-known integrated circuit production process technique is applicable. As a result, while the processing step was performed to CNTs depending on the place where the CNTs are present, since the device can be prepared while previously setting an optional place, design is facilitated and further integration can be expected. Further, since a substrate free of thermal hysteresis can be used, application to various application fields can be intended as a wafer for forming electronic devices, MEMS devices, or electronic circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, according to the invention, an optional three-dimensional film structure having the same CNT layer as described above on a substrate having unevenness or a substrate provided with a protruded structure can be provided easily. Since the well-known patterning technique and etching technique are applicable to the film structure as described above, a hollow structure or a three dimensional structure which is essential in the application use of MEMS can be produced by using a well-known integrated circuit production process. Particularly, since the physical properties of the MEMS device of a three dimensional structure depend on the shape thereof, capability of forming a desired three dimensional shape means that an MEMS device having a desired physical property can be formed. That is, the invention can provide a wafer that can be used suitably to the manufacture of the electronic devices, MEMS devices, or electronic circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, according to the invention, a high density CNT thin film in which a plurality of CNTs are aligned in one direction within a film plane can be provided easily. Since the CNT thin film has the same physical property as described above and the well-known pattering technique and etching technique are applicable thereto, compatibility with the integrated circuit production process is enhanced and the thin film can be used suitably to the manufacture of wafers for forming electronic devices, MEMS devices or electronic circuits.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Hereinafter, the modes for carrying out the invention will be described in detail with reference to the appended drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">&#x3c;CNT Film Structure&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A basic structure of a CNT film structure according to an embodiment of the invention is shown by a schematic cross sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A CNT film structure <b>1</b> of this embodiment has a CNT layer <b>3</b> formed by increasing the density of a plurality of CNT aggregates aligned in one direction in parallel with the surface of a wafer substrate <b>2</b> deposited on the wafer substrate <b>2</b> different from a synthesis substrate used for the synthesis of CNT by a CVD method in principle. Depending on the case, the synthesis substrate may be used as it is as the wafer substrate <b>2</b>. Further, the CNT layer <b>3</b> can be formed by using a single or plurality of CNT films.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the plurality of CNTs constituting the CNT layer <b>3</b>, CNTs adjacent with each other are strongly bonded by Van der Waals' force and the weight density of CNT in the CNT layer <b>3</b> is generally from 0.1 to 1.5 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and, preferably, from 0.2 to 1.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. In a case where the weight density of CNTs in the CNT layer <b>3</b> is at or more than the lower limit described above, CNTs are filled uniformly with no gaps, the CNT layer <b>3</b> exhibits a rigid state as a solid to obtain a required mechanical strength (rigidity, bending property, etc.). On the contrary, in a case where the weight density of CNTs is less than the value described above, a distinct gap is formed between each of CNTs that constitute the CNT layer <b>3</b>. Accordingly, the CNT layer <b>3</b> is no more rigid solid and not only the required mechanical strength cannot be obtained but also a liquid agent, for example, a resist penetrates into the gap between each of the CNTs when it is intended to be coated, application of a well-known patterning technique or etching technique becomes difficult. Generally, while higher weight density of CNTs in the CNT layer <b>3</b> is more preferred, the upper limit value thereof is about 1.5 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>with a view point of restriction in the production.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, in the invention, it is preferred that the CNT layer <b>3</b> has a Herman's Orientation Factor of 0.6 or more, preferably, 0.7 or more with a view point of densification.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The thickness of the CNT layer <b>3</b> can be optionally set to a desired value depending on the application use of the CNT film structure <b>1</b>. In a case where the thickness is 10 nm or more, integrity as a film can be maintained, and this can provide a conductivity required for giving a function as an article used for electronic devices or MEMS devices. There is no particular restriction for the upper limit value of the thickness, a range of about 100 nm to 50 &#x3bc;m is preferred in a case where the structure is utilized for the electronic devices or MEMS devices.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In a case where the CNT layer <b>3</b> has the density and the thickness as described above, a circuit or a device of an optional shape can be easily formed, for example, by coating a resist on the CNT layer <b>3</b>, drawing an optional pattern using a resist by lithography, and etching an unnecessary portion of the CNT layer <b>3</b> using the resist as a mask. That is, this enables to apply a well-known patterning technique or etching technique to enhance the compatibility with an integrated circuit production process.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">CNTs forming the CNT layer <b>3</b> may be either a single walled layer or a multi-walled layer. The type of the CNT to be used can be determined depending on the application use, etc. of the CNT film structure <b>1</b>. For example, in a case where high conductivity or flexibility is required, a single-walled CNT can be used and, in a case where importance is attached to rigidity or metallic property, a multi-walled CNT can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Further, since the CNT layer <b>3</b> of the CNT film structure <b>1</b> of the invention includes a CNT film comprising a plurality of CNTs aligned in one direction in parallel with the surface of the wafer substrate <b>2</b>, anisotropy can be provided for the electric property, optical property, or mechanical property between the alignment direction and the direction perpendicular thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The CNT film structure <b>1</b> of the invention may be produced by synthesizing a CNT film to a desired thickness in a chemical vapor deposition step (to be described later specifically) and increasing the density thereof to form the CNT layer <b>3</b> of a desired thickness, or synthesizing a plurality of CNT films in the chemical vapor depositions step, and increasing the density while laminating the films to form the CNT layer <b>3</b> of a desired thickness. The former method has an advantage capable of obtaining the CNT layer <b>3</b> with an aimed density by a single sheet of CNT film. The later method has an advantage capable of laminating a plurality of CNT films each in an identical alignment direction, or laminating them in different alignment directions thereby obtaining the CNT layer <b>3</b> laminated in various ways.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of a CNT film applied to the CNT film structure <b>1</b> of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) is an optical microscope photographic image and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) is a transmission electron microscope (TEM) photographic image. It can be observed from the drawing that the CNT film has an excellent alignment property.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an example of a lamination method of CNT films. In a case of laminating a plurality of CNT films while making their alignment directions identical, this provides a merit capable of easily controlling the thickness of the CNT layer <b>3</b> by the setting of the number of films to be laminated. Further in a case of laminating a plurality of CNT films while making their alignment directions different from each other, it is possible, in addition to easy control of the thickness, to provide a plurality of anisotropic properties with the directionality being different from each other or optionally control such anisotropy.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the CNT film structure <b>1</b> of the invention, the region of the CNT layer <b>3</b> may be formed by the number of one, or may be formed in plurality on the wafer substrate <b>2</b>. Further, the regions may be formed being spaced from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Further, according to the invention, the CNT thin film can be prepared by peeling the CNT layer <b>3</b> from the wafer substrate <b>2</b> for the CNT film structure <b>1</b>. As the method of peeling the CNT layer <b>3</b>, a method of immersing the CNT film structure <b>1</b> in an appropriate solution and peeling the layer by an appropriate tool such as tweezers.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">When a plurality of CNT films are placed and densified, since not only they shrink in the normal direction to the substrate due to the surface tension of a liquid on the surface of the substrate but also a portion of the CNT film may sometimes warp and be densified at the surface of the substrate, the followings are to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">(A1) In a case of laminating a plurality of CNT films, it should be adapted such that the micro structure provided with the first sheet of CNT film should not be swept upon placing the second sheet of CNT film.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">(A2) In a case of using a film, for example, of 8 &#x3bc;m thickness as a CNT film at or after the second sheet, since the CNT film at or after the second sheet may sometimes warp depending on the liquid used for densification, such a state should be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The point A1 described above can be coped with by reducing the thickness of the CNT film as thin as 20 &#x3bc;m and counting the number of lamination of the CNT films under a stereomicroscope.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">For the point A2 described above, the problem can be overcome by changing the illumination intensity of the stereomicroscope used for observation from the maximum to the minimum just before drying to solidness. This is estimated that the drying state of the CNT film is controlled and the warp can be suppressed by adjusting the lightness of the stereomicroscope</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Further, it is preferred that a CNT film gripped by tweezers is transferred to the needle tip of a manipulator having a needle, and arranged while controlling the manipulator at a desired position and in a desired alignment together with a manipulator also having a needle, and retained by the manipulators, and then a solution used for the densification is dropped and solidified. In this case, for effectively preventing the warp, it is particularly preferred to use methanol as a solution for the densification. With such a procedure, even in a case where a CNT micro structure is already present in the underlayer, CNT at and after the second layer can be placed easily without sweeping the CNT film of the CNT micro structure. The manipulator may be detached after drying. Such a method is effective in a case of handling a CNT film with a thickness of 4 &#x3bc;m or less.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the present specification, the alignment state of CNTs means a state where Herman's Orientation Factor is 0.6 or more and, preferably, 0.7 or more. The CNT film structure to which it is placed may have a Herman's Orientation Factor of 0.6 or more, preferably, 0.7 or more irrespective of the densifying treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The state where the position of the CNT film structure is controlled means a state where the CNT film structure is placed in a desired region on a substrate requiring the CNT film structure. Further, the state where the alignment of the CNT film structure is controlled means a state where the CNT film structure is directed to a necessary alignment direction within an allowable range. The state with no warp to the CNT film structure means a state where the CNT film structure is placed in a desired region on the substrate requiring the CNT film structure.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The CNT constituting the CNT layer <b>24</b> may be a single-walled CNT or multi-walled CNT. The type of the CNT to be used can be determined depending on the application use of the CNT film structure <b>21</b>, etc. For example, a single-walled CNT can be used in a case where high conductivity or flexibility is required and a multi-walled CNT can be used in a case where importance is attached to rigidity or metallic property.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, since the CNT layer <b>24</b> of the CNT film structure <b>21</b> of the present embodiment includes a CNT film comprising a plurality of CNTs aligned in one direction and densified within the film plane, anisotropy can be provided for the electric property, optical property, or mechanical property between the alignment direction and the direction perpendicular thereto. Further, when the CNT layer <b>24</b> of the CNT film structure <b>21</b> in this embodiment is formed by laminating a plurality of CNT films different from each other with regard to the alignment direction, a plurality of anisotropic properties can be provided or the anisotropy can be controlled optionally.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Then, the CNT micro structure will be described. &#x201c;CNT micro structure&#x201d; means a patterned and processed CNT film structure.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Referring to the method of preparing the CNT micro structure, a resist film <b>12</b> is at first coated to a CNT film structure <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25(</figref><i>a</i>). As the resist film <b>11</b>, any optional resist that constructs a shape such as an electron beam resist, photoresist, etc. can be used. Further, even when an etching selectivity to CNT is low, it may suffice that a resist of a sufficiently large thickness by more than the selectivity is formed to the CNT film structure <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Then, drawing conforming to the property of the resist film <b>12</b> (for example, electron beam drawing or photolithography) is applied to the resist film <b>12</b> coated on the CNT film structure <b>11</b> to draw a resist film <b>12</b>A in a desired shape intended to be constructed as a CNT micro structure <b>11</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25(</figref><i>b</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Then, the drawn resist is developed to form a resist mask <b>13</b> on the CNT film structure <b>11</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25(</figref><i>c</i>)). Then, the CNT film structure <b>11</b> is etched to process the CNT film structure <b>11</b> into a desired shape by using the resist mask <b>13</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25(</figref><i>d</i>)). After the CNT film structure <b>11</b> is processed the resist mask <b>13</b> is removed to obtain a CNT micro structure of a desired shape (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25(</figref><i>e</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">When the CNT film is patterned in the invention, the followings should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">(B1) Even for a densified CNT film, a silica type resist HSQ (hydrogen silsequioxane) (FOX16: manufactured by ZEON Corp.) capable of obtaining a etching selectivity or the like cannot sometimes be coated uniformly. Further, it is sometimes difficult to obtain reproducibility of the HSQ resist.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">(B2) It is desired that micro structures of CNT films of different alignment can be constructed on one substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As a result of study made by the present inventors, et al., inflow of the HSQ below the CNT film can be prevented by coating and solidifying a diluted polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or resist (ZEP520A/ZEON Corp.) to form a film on the CNT film before coating the HSQ and then coating the HSQ thereover.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Also it is preferred to coat the HSQ twice or three times, penetrating the same sufficiently in the inside and below the CNT film and the HSQ sufficiently to form the mask above the placed CNT film is supplied to form a mask. Further, it is also advantageous to handle the HSQ in a globe box containing an inert gas atmosphere and is used being exposed in air by a necessary amount only upon coating of the resist. Further, it is preferred to conduct placing and densifying steps (transfer) to be described later.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">&#x3c;Three-dimensional CNT Micro Structure&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Then, a three-dimensional CNT micro structure according to another embodiment of the invention will be described. The CNT micro structure is formed by using a wafer substrate having a convex shape structure, etc. The procedure for the production of the wafer substrate is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The CNT film structure <b>21</b> of this embodiment is formed by depositing a CNT layer <b>24</b> in which a plurality of CNTs are aligned in one direction within a film plane and increased in the density is deposited to a wafer substrate <b>22</b> in which a plurality of pillars <b>23</b> are formed as a convex shape structure on the surface thereof and the CNT layer <b>24</b> forms two planes placed on planes different from each other (general surface of the wafer substrate and the top face of pillar).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In a case of manufacturing the structure, the followings should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">(C1) When a CNT film is densified and placed over the unevenness, the CNT film placed so as to extend over the unevenness may sometimes be broken depending on the shape of the unevenness (specifically, depending on the height and the distance of pillars as the protrusions).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">(C2) When an HSQ liquid utilized as a resist mask is coated to the densified CNT film placed on the unevenness, particularly, the CNT film extended between the pillars, the HSQ liquid flows not uniformly to the lower side of the CNT film extended above the protrusions making it sometimes difficult to conduct the mask forming step by an electron beam.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">(C3) In the densified CNT film placed on the unevenness, the resist cannot be coated sufficiently, particularly, in a portion of covering the step, making it sometimes difficult to form the mask.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">(C4) In the final processing stage, when the processing of the solution is completed and it is dried, the constructed structure may be destroyed depending on the drying method. That is, it may sometimes occur that the three-dimensional structure is collapsed or the position of the CNT structure designed and arranged on the substrate may be displaced.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">For C1 described above, CNT breakage can be overcome by controlling the height of pillars as the protrusion, the area in contact with the CNT film on the pillar, and the distance.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Further, for C2 described above, inflow of the CNT film to the lower side of the CNT film can be prevented by coating and solidifying a diluted PMMA before coating of the HSQ to form a film on the CNT film and coating the HSQ thereover. Also, it is preferred to form a mask by coating the HSQ twice or three times, penetrating the same sufficiently to the inside and below the CNT film and supplying the HSQ sufficiently to form a mask to the upper side of the placed CNT film.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">For C3 described above, problems can be solved by controlling the height of the pillar as the protrusion, the area in contact with the CNTs on the pillar and the distance, and use of the two types of the resist coating methods together.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">For C4 described above, the problem can be solved, for example, by using IPA for densification and adopting spontaneous drying of IPA. When drying from an aqueous solution, particularly, water is adopted, it may sometimes destruct the three-dimensional structure (adhering of a hollow portion to the substrate), displace the CNT film from the substrate, or cause an error for the designed structure arrangement by the surface tension of water when it is evaporated. Further, also in a case of using acetone, a specimen is cooled by the heat of evaporation thereof, which causes condensation to provide the condition identical with that in the case of drying by using water. Accordingly, use of IPA or methanol is preferred. In addition to the drying method described above, it is also effective to use IPA or use a supercritical drying method with CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">&#x3c;Bridged CNT Micro Structure&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Then, a bridged CNT micro structure according to another embodiment of the invention will be described. The bridged CNT micro structure is obtained by forming a CNT film of a three-dimensional CNT film structure into a predetermined pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">A method of producing a bridged CNT micro structure of this embodiment is to be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(</figref><i>a</i>), a substrate <b>26</b> is patterned by a customary method and a mask <b>27</b> having a resistivity to etching conditions for the substrate <b>26</b> is provided. Then, the substrate <b>31</b> is etched under predetermined etching conditions to form a desired uneven shape. Alternatively, a substrate having a shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(</figref><i>b</i>) not by way of the process described above may also be used. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(</figref><i>c</i>), a CNT layer <b>28</b> is formed on the substrate <b>26</b> having the uneven shape to produce a CNT film structure.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(</figref><i>d</i>) a resist is coated on the CNT layer formed above the uneven shape and a resist mask <b>29</b> is constructed above the CNT film structure at a position and in a shape bridging the convex shape of the substrate <b>26</b>. Then, the CNT layer <b>28</b> is etched and the CNT film structure is processed so as to construct a bridged CNT micro structure at a desired position and in a desired shape by the resist mask <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(</figref><i>e</i>)). Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(</figref><i>f</i>), a resist mask <b>34</b> is removed to obtain a bridged CNT micro structure at a desired position and in a desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the bridged CNT micro structure of the invention, when the CNT layer is patterned, the followings should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">(D1) When the CNT film is densified and placed above the unevenness, since the CNT film structure placed so as to extend over the unevenness may sometimes be broken or distorted depending on the shape of the unevenness (specifically, depending on the height and the distance of the pillars as the protrusion), this should be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">(D2) When an HSQ liquid utilized as a resist mask is coated to the densified CNT film placed on the unevenness, particularly, the CNT film extended between the pillars, the HSQ liquid flows not uniformly to the lower side of the CNT film extended above the protrusions making it sometimes difficult to conduct the mask forming step by an electron beam.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">(D3) For the densified CNT film placed above the unevenness, particularly, the CNT film in the portion covering the step, it may sometimes occur that the resist cannot be coated sufficiently making it difficult to form a mask.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">(D4) In the final process stage, when treatment for the solution is completed and it is dried, there may result a problem that the constructed structure may be collapsed or peeled depending on the drying method. That is, the bridged structure may be collapsed, or the position of the bridged CNT micro structure designed and arranged above the protrusions may sometimes be displaced.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">For D1 described above, the problem of CNT breakage and distortion can be overcome by controlling the height of the pillars as the protrusions and the area in contact with the CNT film above the pillars, and the distance.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">For D2 described above, inflow of the HSQ to the lower side of the CNT film can be prevented by coating and solidifying a diluted PMMA before coating of the HSQ to form a film on the CNT film and coating the HSQ thereover. Also, it is preferred to form a mask by coating the HSQ twice or three times, penetrating the same sufficiently to the inside and below the CNT film and supplying the HSQ sufficiently to form a mask to the upper side of the placed CNT film.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">For the D3 described above, problems can be solved by controlling the height of the pillar as the protrusion, the area in contact with the CNTs on the pillar and the distance, and use of the two types of the resist coating methods together.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">For the D4 described above, the problem can be solved, for example, by using IPA for densification and adopting spontaneous drying of IPA. When drying from an aqueous solution, particularly, water is adopted, it may sometimes destruct the three-dimensional structure (adhering of a hollow portion to the substrate), displace the CNT film from the substrate, or cause an error for the designed structure arrangement by the surface tension of water when it is evaporated. Further, also in a case of using acetone, a specimen is cooled by the heat of evaporation thereof, which causes condensation to provide the condition identical with that in the case of drying by using water. Accordingly, use of IPA or methanol is preferred. In addition to the drying method described above, it is also effective to use IPA or use a supercritical drying method with CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Since the CNT layer of the CNT film structure of the present embodiment includes densified, anisotropy comprising a plurality of CNTs aligned in one direction within the film plane, and densified, anisotropy can be provided for the electric property, optical property, or mechanical property between the alignment direction and the direction perpendicular thereto. Further, when the CNT layer of the CNT film structure in this embodiment is formed by laminating a plurality of CNT films different from each other with regard to the alignment direction, a plurality of anisotropic properties can be provided or the anisotropy can be controlled optionally.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Then, referring to the etching of the CNT film, when the CNT film is processed, for example, by reactive ion etching (RIE) with O<sub>2</sub>, fluffed residues not burnt out completely may sometimes remain (they are estimated as passive state of C and some or other elements to O<sub>2 </sub>plasmas). For this problem, it is effective to conduct fabrication by way of RIE using O<sub>2 </sub>and Ar, RIE using O<sub>2 </sub>and CHF<sub>3</sub>, or by combination of three RIE conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Then, a CVD apparatus used in the invention is to be described.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">At first, an example of a CVD apparatus used in the production of CNT in the invention will be described more specifically. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a CVD apparatus <b>31</b> includes a tubular reaction chamber <b>32</b> formed of a quartz glass (tubular furnace:Model:KTF030 (30 mm diameter, 36 cm heating length), produced by Koyo Lindberg Co.) for accommodating a synthesis substrate <b>11</b> that supports a metal catalyst, a heating coil <b>33</b> disposed so as to externally surround the reaction chamber <b>32</b>, two gas supply pipes <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> (SUS304: 4.35 mm diameter) connected to one end of the reaction chamber <b>32</b> for supplying respective gases in a starting material gas reservoir <b>34</b>, a catalyst activating substance reservoir <b>35</b>, an atmospheric gas reservoir <b>36</b>, and a reducing gas reservoir <b>38</b> to the reaction chamber <b>32</b>, and a gas discharge pipe <b>40</b> (SUS304: 4.35 mm diameter) connected to the other end of the reaction chamber <b>32</b>. Further, for supplying a trace amount of the catalyst activating substance under control at high accuracy, a purifying device for removing an oxidative material (not illustrated) is disposed additionally to a pipeline near the starting material gas reservoir <b>34</b> and the atmospheric gas reservoir <b>36</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0176" num="0175">While the properties of the CNT film as an alignment assembly of single-walled CNTs and the aligned CNT film aggregate produced in this example to be described later depend on details of production conditions, and typical values of production conditions of the example described above include density: 0.03 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. BET-specific surface area: 1200 m<sup>2</sup>/g, average outer diameter 2.5 nm, half-value width: 2 nm, carbon purity: 99.9%, and Herman's Orientation Factor: 0.6. Further, the CNT film can maintain the integrity thereof even after peeling from the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Then, the synthesis substrate <b>11</b> with the CNT film was set so as to be entered in the view field of a stereomicroscope and the CNT film <b>12</b> was detached directly by tweezers from the synthesis substrate <b>11</b> under observation by the stereomicroscope.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Then, a wafer substrate, for example, made of silicon different from the synthesis substrate <b>11</b> was prepared, isopropanol (hereinafter simply referred to as IPA) was dropped onto the wafer substrate <b>2</b> by using a commercial Pasteur pipette to prepare a liquid reservoir which was placed under the view field of the stereomicroscope (synthesis substrate <b>11</b> and wafer substrate <b>2</b> may be set simultaneously to the stereomicroscope used in the film detaching step).

<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The detaching operation of the CNT film <b>12</b> from the synthesis substrate <b>11</b> could be conducted in the same manner by detaching the film directly with tweezers or tweezers attached with PTFE paper filter and there was no difference for the obtained products.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Then, the CNT film structure of the invention will be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The CNT film structure means a carbon nanotube aggregate formed by depositing, on a substrate, a CNT layer comprising a plurality of CNTs aligned continuously in one identical direction along the plane of a CNT film and having a high density and a uniform thickness, and the weight density is 0.1 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or more and 1.5 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less. In a case where the weight density is less than the range described above, a resist for pattering passes through the CNT aggregate. Preferred are those applied with treatments for suppressing creasings that cause partial raise of the film structure from the substrate, bursting and breakage, densification of the carbon nanotube film in the direction other than the direction of the radial line to the substrate, and warp that causes warp of the CNT film structure upon coating of the resist to the CNT film structure.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">&#x201c;The aligned state of CNTs in a densified state&#x201d; means a state where the Herman's Orientation Factor (Herman's Orientation Factor) is 0.6 or more and, preferably, 0.7 or more. For the CNT film structure for placement, the Herman's Orientation Factor may be 0.6 or more and, preferably, 0.7 or more irrespective of the densifying treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">&#x201c;The state where the position of the CNT film structure is controlled&#x201d; means a state where the CNT film is placed in a desired region on the substrate required for the CNT film structure. Further, &#x201c;the state where the alignment of the CNT film structure is controlled&#x201d; means a state where the CNT film structure is directed to an alignment direction required for the CNT film structure within an allowable range. Further, &#x201c;the state with no warp in the CNT film structure&#x201d; means a state where each of CNTs of the CNT film is present within an allowable range for vertical direction in a desired region on the substrate required for the CNT film structure.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">A process for producing the CNT film structure according to the invention is to be described specifically with reference to a block diagram (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) showing the production steps thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">At first, a CNT film is prepared in a chemical vapor deposition step (step S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In this embodiment, a CNT film was prepared by applying a method of growing a great amount of vertically aligned CNTs while incorporating a water content, etc. as a catalyst activating substance in a reaction atmosphere (refer to Kenji Hara, et al. , Water-Assisted Highly Efficient Synthesis of Impurity-Free Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube, SCIENCE, 2004. 11. 19., vol. 306, p. 1362 to 1364).</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The metal catalyst for growing the CNTs in the CVD method can be formed by using appropriate metals having a result used so far in the production of CNTs and using a well-known deposition technique. Typically, they can include a metal thin film deposited by a sputtering vapor deposition method using a mask, for example, thin iron film, thin iron chloride film, thin iron-molybdenum film, thin alumina-iron film, thin alumina-cobalt film, thin alumina-iron-molybdenum film, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">As the synthesis substrate supporting the metal catalyst, various materials well-known so far can be used, and flat surface sheet materials or plate materials comprising metals such as iron, nickel and chromium, and metal oxides, non-metals such as silicon, quartz and glass, or ceramics can be used typically.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The shape of the metal catalyst pattern may be a continuous linear pattern or a broken line pattern having a plurality of lines arranged along one direction. Further, the thickness of the metal catalyst may be determined to an optimal value depending on the metal used as the catalyst. It is preferably 0.1 nm or more and 100 nm or less in a case of using, for example, an iron metal. Then, the width may be determined in accordance with a required thickness of the CNT layer <b>3</b> finally deposited to the substrate <b>2</b> and it may be determined to a value about 5 to 20 times the thickness of the CNT layer <b>3</b> after densification.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">When the catalyst is patterned, the growth of CNTs is worsened. In a case where the catalyst pattern shape is a linear pattern, there were such problems that the growth was worsened (height is not obtainable), height unevenness increases, the growth occurs only at the central portion not at the periphery, etc. as the line is thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In order to solve the problems, the iron catalyst is laminated to a thickness somewhat thicker than usual (about 1.2 to 2 nm). In ethylene tuning (ethylene was decreased. 10 sccm). The growth was conducted while decreasing to 10 sccm from 20 sccm at the initial state and, correspondingly, X was tuned severely.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The thickness of the CNT film decided by the width of the metal catalyst pattern is important in for controlling not only the thickness of the CNT layer after the densification but also the weight density of the CNT layer after the densification. By controlling the CNT thickness (original thickness) before densification (just after synthesis), the weight density of the CNTs can be controlled from 0.11 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 0.54 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>(the relation between the original thickness and the thickness after the densification, and the density will be described later).</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">For the carbon compound as the starting carbon source in the CVD method, hydrocarbons, among all, lower hydrocarbons, for example, methane, ethane, propane, ethylene, propylene, and acetylene can be used preferably in the same manner as in usual.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">The reaction atmospheric gas may be any gas which is not reactive with CNT and inert at the growth temperature and may include, for example, helium, argon, hydrogen, nitrogen, neon, krypton, carbon dioxide, and chlorine, as well as a mixture of such gases.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The catalyst activating substance to be in contact, together with the starting material gas, with a metal catalyst film on the synthesis substrate may be any substance having a function of removing carbonaceous impurities that deposit to fine catalyst particles to deactivate the catalyst during synthesis of CNTs thereby cleaning the texture of the catalyst and generally may be any material containing oxygen and not damaging the CNTs at the growth temperature. Use of water vapor, as well as oxygen-containing compounds having less number of carbon atoms, for example, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, ketones such as acetone, aldehydros, acids, esters, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide is possible depending on the reaction conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Prior to the supply of the starting material gas, it is preferred to mix a reduction gas with the atmospheric gas and contact them to the metal catalyst film for a predetermined time. Thus, a metal catalyst present in the metal catalyst film is finely particulated and the metal catalyst is conditioned to a state suitable to the growth, for example, of single-walled CNTs. By appropriately selecting the thickness of the metal catalyst film and the reduction reaction conditions, fine catalyst particles of several nanometer diameter can be adjusted to a density of 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>to 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>(CNTs/cm<sup>2</sup>). The density is suitable to the growing of a plurality of CNTs aligned in a direction perpendicular to the catalyst film forming surface of the substrate. The reduction gas may be any gas that can act on the metal catalyst and promote fine particulation in a state suitable to the growing of the CNTs and, for example, a hydrogen gas, ammonium, or a gas mixture thereof can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The atmospheric pressure for the reaction is applicable so long as it is within a pressure range where CNTs have been produced so far and can be determined to an appropriate value within a range, for example, from 10<sup>2 </sup>Pa to 10<sup>7 </sup>Pa.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The temperature upon the growth reaction in the CVD method is determined properly while taking the reaction pressure, the metal catalyst, and the starting carbon source, etc. into consideration and CNTs can be grown preferably within a range usually from 400 to 1200&#xb0; C. and, more preferably, from 600 to 1000&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The state of the CNT film synthesized on the substrate as described above is shown by scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographic image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The CNTs constituting the CNT film had a purity of 98 mass % or higher, a weight density of about 0.029 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, a specific surface area of from 600 to 1300 m<sup>2</sup>/g (not opened)/1600 to 2500 m<sup>2</sup>/g (opened).</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In the invention, other production processes other than the production process described in the documents described above can be utilized. As the technique for obtaining a vertically oriented CNT assembly, there has been known, for example, &#x201c;Growth of vertically aligned single-walled carbon nanotube films on quartz substrates and their optical anisotropy&#x201d; (Y. Murakami, et al., Chemical Physics Letters, 385 (2004) 298-303), or (Ultra-high-yield growth of vertical single-walled carbon nanotubes: Hidden roles of hydrogen and oxygen&#x201d; (Guangyu Zhang, et al., PNAS Nov. 8, 2005, vol. 102, No. 45, 16141-16145).</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Then, in the subsequent CNT film detaching step (step S<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), a CNT film <b>12</b> formed on a synthesis substrate <b>11</b> is detached from the synthesis substrate <b>11</b> and the step can be attained properly by an operator while selecting from a method of gripping the CNT film <b>12</b> formed on the synthesis substrate <b>11</b> by tweezers and detaching the same directly or a method of bonding a membrane made of a synthetic resin to the top end of tweezers and detaching the CNT film <b>12</b> while adhering the same to the membrane depending on the situation. When the method of using the membrane is adopted, since the area of contact with the CNT film <b>12</b> is increased, the CNT film <b>12</b> can be gripped easily and this can decrease the effect of trembling of the operator's hands on the operation during delicate operation. In this case, while a PTFE paper filter can be used suitably as the membrane, those other than the PTFE paper filter can also be used so long as they have the advantage described above.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In the detachment step, it may be sometimes difficult to take out the CNTs from the densely gathered CNT film group. Further, it may be sometimes difficult to separate the taken out CNT films one by one.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The problem can be solved by using a stereomicroscope and a membrane filter, attaching the CNT film to the membrane filter and taking out the CNTs from the CNT film group while observing under the stereomicroscope. Further, while CNTs taken out by the membrane filter may comprise one or plurality sheets depending on the case, the CNTs can be taken out sheet by sheet by the membrane filter according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Further, with the stereomicroscope and the tweezers and with the thickness of the CNT film to be synthesized of 2 &#x3bc;m or more, a single sheet of the CNT film can be taken out by the tweezers.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">In the next placing step (step S<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the CNF film <b>12</b> detached in the detaching step is placed on the wafer substrate <b>2</b>, and the CNT film <b>12</b> is exposed to a liquid. Also for the step, there are several methods that can be selected optionally by an operator depending on the case.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In the first method, the CNT film <b>12</b> detached in the detaching step is transferred to a wafer substrate <b>2</b> to which a liquid is previously dropped and then detached from the tweezers. Subsequently, the CNT film <b>12</b> is aligned to an optional position in the liquid by tweezers attached with a membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">In the second method, after transferring the CNT film <b>12</b> onto the wafer substrate <b>2</b> and detaching the film from the tweezers <b>13</b>, a liquid is dropped so as to dip the CNT film <b>12</b> on the wafer substrate <b>2</b> and the CNT film <b>12</b> in the liquid is positioned by the tweezers with the membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">While an example of placing a single CNT film <b>12</b> on the wafer substrate <b>2</b> is shown, a plurality of CNT films <b>12</b> may be placed in stack as described above. Further, the CNT film <b>12</b> may be exposed to the liquid at a place other than the wafer substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">As the liquid for exposing the CNT film <b>12</b>, those having affinity with the CNTs and not containing ingredients which may remain after evaporation are used preferably. For example, water, alcohols (isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, methanol), acetones (acetone), hexane, toluene, cyclohexane, DMF (dimethylformamide), etc. can be used as such liquid. The liquid exposing time may be a time sufficient to wet the entire CNT film uniformly without leaving bubbles in the inside of the CNT film.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Then, in the densification step (step S<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the density of the CNT film <b>12</b> in a state exposed to the liquid and placed on the surface of the wafer substrate <b>2</b> is increased to form a CNT layer <b>3</b> deposited to the surface of the wafer substrate <b>2</b>. The step is conducted typically by drying the CNT film <b>12</b> deposited with the liquid. For example, spontaneous drying in a nitrogen atmosphere at a room temperature, vacuum drying, heating under the presence of an inert gas such as argons, etc. can be used as the method of drying the CNT film <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In the densification step, when bubbles are formed to the carbon nanotube film immersed in the solution or tweezers handling the carbon nanotube, or membrane handling the carbon nanotube film upon densification, creasings may sometimes be caused upon densification. Further, it may be sometimes difficult to align the CNT film to a desired direction upon densification. Further, upon drying for densification, the solvent may sometimes remain in the densified CNT film. The problem can be overcome by reducing the thickness of the CNT film to 20 &#x3bc;m or less and counting the number of lamination under a stereomicroscope. Further, in a case where warp occurs even in an CNT film with a thickness of 20 &#x3bc;m or less, the problem can be overcome by changing the intensity of illumination in a stereomicroscope used for observation from the maximum to the minimum just before drying. This is estimated that the drying state of the CNT film is controlled thereby capable of suppressing the warp. Further, bubbling can be prevented by immersing the CNT film or the tweezers for handling the CNT film or the membrane for handing the CNT film sufficiently in the solution placed on the substrate used for densification, and observing the state by a stereomicroscope. Further, the CNT film can be arranged at a desired position and in a desired alignment by gripping the membrane filter at the top end of the tweezers, immersing them into the solution on the substrate in the same manner as for the CNT film, and moving the CNT film in the solution by manipulating the tweezers, that is, the membrane filter while observing the alignment direction of the CNT film by the microscope. Further, densification can be conducted by transferring the CNT film gripped by the tweezers to a manipulator having a top end capable of positional control, controlling and arranging the CNT film to a desired position and in a desired alignment by the manipulator, retaining the same on the substrate by the manipulator and then dripping the liquid used for the densification. The top end capable of controlling the position may be a needle-like or bar-like top end having a high degree such as tungsten or may be a top end having flexibility like a resin. Further, a jig capable of gripping such as tweezers may also be utilized as the top end. Further, as a solution used for densification capable of effectively preventing warp, while methanol is used preferably, this is judged depending on the case.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Upon drying, alignment of CNTs can be adjusted to a desired one direction by drying while changing the illumination intensity of the stereomicroscope from the maximum to the minimum just before drying. Further, according to the method, even in a case where a micro structure is already present as an underlying layer, the CNT films at or after the second layer can be placed without sweeping the CNT film of the micro structure. The manipulator may be detached after drying. Further, a method of keeping it in vacuum at 180&#xb0; C. for 10 min before used in the subsequent process is also preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">When the CNT film <b>12</b> is immersed in the liquid, the entire volume shrinks somewhat by close adhesion of CNTs to each other, the adhesion degree is further enhanced upon evaporation of the liquid, so that the volume is considerably reduced and, as a result, highly densified CNT layer <b>3</b> is formed. In this case, it scarcely causes a real shrinkage at the surface in parallel with the wafer substrate <b>2</b> due to the contact resistance with the wafer substrate <b>2</b> and shrinkage occur exclusively in the direction of the thickness of the CNT layer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">By way of each of the steps described above, a CNT film structure <b>1</b> deposited with a high density CNT layer <b>3</b> aligned in one direction parallel to the surface of the wafer substrate <b>2</b> is completed. An example of the CNT film structure <b>1</b> produced as described above is shown by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographic image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.

Accordingly, the densification step may adopt any method of causing surface tension between CNTs to each other and, for example, a method of using high temperature steams can also be applied.</p>

<heading id="h-0019" level="1">DEMONSTRATION EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">Result of demonstrating the controllability for the film thickness and the weight density before and after the densifying treatment in the densifying step of the invention is shown below. As the experimental conditions for this purpose, for obtaining a desired number of CNT films of a desired thickness, the width of the metal catalyst film served for the chemical vapor deposition step (thickness of the CNT film before densification) was defined as 1 &#x3bc;M for 2 sets, 2 &#x3bc;m for 1 set, 4 &#x3bc;m for 2 sets, and 7.5 &#x3bc;m for 4 sets.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">The result is to be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(</figref><i>a</i>), while the CNT film having a thickness before densification (original thickness) of 7.5 &#x3bc;m shrank to about 0.5 &#x3bc;m in average after densification, CNT films having original thickness of 1, 2, 4 &#x3bc;m, shrank to 0.2 &#x3bc;m to 0.3 &#x3bc;m respectively after densification. This suggests that the density is different after densification depending on the original thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">On the other hand, since the weight of the CNT film before densification is extremely small, it is difficult to measure the weight density thereof. Then, the weight density of the CNT film before densification was estimated as the density of a bulky CNT aggregate which was grown from a substrate where the metal catalyst film was formed for the entire surface without linear patterning.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">While the density of the bulky CNT aggregate is calculated based on weight/volume, it is known that the density of the bulky CNT aggregate is constant under various conditions (refer to Don N. Futabe, et al., 84% Catalyst Activity of Water Assisted Growth of Single Walled Carbon Nanotube Forest Characterization by a Statistical and Macroscopic Approach. Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2006, vol. 110, p. 8035 to 8038). The reference document reports that the weight density of the bulky CNT aggregate takes a constant value (0.029 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) in a range of the height of the aggregate from 200 &#x3bc;m to 1 mm. That is, it can be estimated that the density of a CNT film grown by using the growing conditions and the catalyst substantially equal with those in the growth of the bulky CNT aggregate is not greatly different from the density of the bulky CNT aggregate.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">When defining the compression ratio of the CNT film (compression ratio=original thickness&#xf7;thickness after densification) in the densifying step, the weight density of the CNT film after densification is (CNT density=compression ratio&#xd7;0.029 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). When the weight density of the CNT films of each thickness is derived based on the definition, a relation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(</figref><i>b</i>) is obtained. In this demonstration example, the weight density could be controlled from 0.11 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 0.54 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>by controlling the original thickness of the CNT film.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">Also in the CNT film at the weight density of 0.11/cm<sup>3 </sup>obtained as described above, adhesion with the substrate was kept sufficient and identical patterning with that in each of the examples described above was possible. On the contrary, in a case of a CNT film before densification (weight density 0.029 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), application of known etching and lithographic techniques was substantially impossible due to insufficient adhesion with the substrate, erosion of the resist, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">The upper limit for the controllable weight density of the CNT film in the invention is not limited to 0.54 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>used in this demonstration example. Although not positively described in the present specification, the weight density can be attained, in principle in a wider range by controlling the diameter of CNT. Assuming that all CNTs have an identical diameter and all CNTs are close packed by the densifying step, it can be easily calculated that the CNT density after densification increases as the diametrical size of the CNT is smaller (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). While the average diameter of CNTs in the CNT film used in each of the examples described above is about 2.8 nm, the weight density when the CNTs are close packed in this case is about 0.78 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. In this regard, it has been already found that the diameter of the CNT can be made smaller (about 1.0 nm) by using the technique reported in the non-patent document (Ya-Qiong Xu, et al., Vertical Array Growth of Small Diameter Single-Walled Carbon Nanobutes, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 128 (20), 6560 to 6561, 2006).

<p id="p-0323" num="0322">The degree of anisotropy, that is, the degree of alignment property can be recognized by measuring the resistivity of a CNT thin film by a 4 terminal method. The 4-terminal method is carried out, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, by placing a CNT thin film <b>5</b> on a measuring site in which four Au electrodes <b>7</b><i>a </i>to <b>7</b><i>d </i>each of 2 &#x3bc;m width are arranged each at 2 &#x3bc;m distance.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">The resistivity was measured by the 4-terminal method in this demonstration example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, by providing a measuring substrate equipped with 6-sets of the measuring sites shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, and providing CNT thin films each having a thickness of 306 nm, a weight density of 0.28 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and an average diameter of 2.8 nm, and CNT thin films each having a thickness of 835 nm, a weight density of 0.19 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and an average diameter of 2.8 nm patterned with measuring portions of the lateral size (1, 2, 5, 10 &#x3bc;m for parallel direction, 2.5 &#x3bc;m for perpendicular direction) different from each other for the direction parallel with and the direction perpendicular to the alignment direction of CNTs (shown by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>), and placing the measuring portion formed in each of the CNT thin films on each of the electrodes of the measuring substrate so as to correspond to the electrode for each of the measuring sites.</p>

Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the resistivity of a CNT thin film of 306 nm thickness (&#x25aa;, &#x25cf;) was 0.009 &#x3a9;cm for the direction in parallel with the alignment direction and 0.27 &#x3a9;cm for the direction perpendicular to the alignment direction, and the resistivity of a CNT thin film of 835 nm thickness (&#x25a1;, &#x25ef;) was 0.007 &#x3a9;cm for the direction in parallel with the alignment direction and 0.13 &#x3a9;cm for the direction perpendicular to the alignment direction and, accordingly, anisotropy was confirmed.

According to this demonstration example, since the alignment property is evaluated by using a Fast Fourier Transformation from a plane image by an atomic force microscope (AFM), the alignment property can be evaluated easily also for a thin film of extremely small thickness.</p>
