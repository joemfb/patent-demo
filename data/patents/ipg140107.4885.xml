<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A lens barrel that is capable of decreasing a barrel length under a retracted condition by simplifying a configuration. The lens barrel changes a focal length by moving first and second lens groups in an optical axis direction. A light-amount adjusting member is located between the first and second lens groups. First, second, third holding frames hold the first lens group, the second lens group, and the light-amount adjusting member, respectively. A cam mechanism moves the first, second, and third holding frames in the optical axis direction so that a part of the second lens group is inserted into the aperture of the light-amount adjusting member and concave and convex surfaces of the first and second lens groups are overlapped in the optical axis direction under a retracted condition. The aperture diameter of the light-amount adjusting member is enlarged when shifting to the retracted condition from a shooting condition.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a lens barrel that changes a focal length, increases a barrel length under a shooting condition, and decreases the barrel length under a retracted condition, and to an image pickup apparatus equipped with the lens barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, various techniques to shorten the barrel length under the retracted condition have been suggested with respect to a zoom lens barrel that increases the barrel length under the shooting condition and decreases the barrel length under the retracted condition to retract the lens barrel into a camera body (a retractable lens).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2004-347615 (JP2004-347615A) discloses a lens barrel that can further decrease a length in an optical axis direction (the barrel length) as compared with an ordinary retractable lens barrel that can extend and can be retracted into a camera body, and a camera equipped with such a lens barrel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a sectional view showing a configuration of the conventional lens barrel described in the above-mentioned publication. This lens barrel <b>800</b> is capable of varying its barrel length between a retracted condition with a short barrel length and a shooting condition with a long barrel length. The lens barrel <b>800</b> reduces a length in an optical axis direction by opening an aperture of a lens shutter <b>900</b> and inserting a lens group <b>852</b> into the aperture under the retracted condition.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. H10-111444 (JP H10-111444A) discloses a zoom lens barrel with a shutter that is able to shorten a length in an optical axis direction under the retracted condition.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the above-mentioned conventional lens barrel has a problem that the barrel length under the retracted condition cannot be shortened enough.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, the lens barrel in the Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2004-347615 (JP 2004-347615A) has a configuration where a light-amount control member such as a lens shutter is opened compulsorily more greatly than the maximum aperture at the time of shooting by a rodlike member, when the lens barrel shifts to the retracted condition from the shooting condition. Accordingly, unnecessary power is applied to the light-amount control member, which may break the light-amount control member.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a lens barrel and an image pickup apparatus with the lens barrel that are capable of decreasing a barrel length under the retracted condition by simplifying a configuration. Moreover, the present invention provides a lens barrel and an image pickup apparatus that are capable of preventing a breakage of the light-amount adjusting member.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides a lens barrel that changes a focal length by moving at least one of a first lens group and a second lens group in an optical axis direction, and that increases a barrel length under a shooting condition and decreases the barrel length under a retracted condition, comprising a first holding frame adapted to hold the first lens group, a second holding frame adapted to hold the second lens group, a light-amount adjusting member adapted to adjust an amount of light that transmits an optical system by changing a diameter of an aperture, the light-amount adjusting member being located between the first lens group and the second lens group, a third holding frame adapted to hold the light-amount adjusting member, and a cam mechanism adapted to move the first, second, and third holding frames in the optical axis direction so that a part of the second lens group is inserted into the aperture of the light-amount adjusting member and concave and convex surfaces, which are faced to each other, of the first and second lens groups are overlapped in the optical axis direction under the retracted condition, wherein the diameter of the aperture of the light-amount adjusting member is enlarged and the first, second, and third holding frames are moved in the optical axis direction, when shifting to the retracted condition from the shooting condition.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, a second aspect of the present invention provides an image pickup apparatus comprising, a lens barrel adapted to change a focal length by moving at least one of a first lens group and a second lens group in an optical axis direction, to increase a barrel length under a shooting condition, and to decrease the barrel length under a retracted condition, comprising a first holding frame adapted to hold the first lens group, a second holding frame adapted to hold the second lens group, a light-amount adjusting member adapted to adjust an amount of light that transmits an optical system by changing a diameter of an aperture, the light-amount adjusting member being located between the first lens group and the second lens group, a third holding frame adapted to hold the light-amount adjusting member, and a cam mechanism adapted to move the first, second, and third holding frames in the optical axis direction so that a part of the second lens group is inserted into the aperture of the light-amount adjusting member and concave and convex surfaces, which are faced to each other, of the first and second lens groups are overlapped in the optical axis direction under the retracted condition, a control unit adapted to control the light-amount adjusting member so as to enlarge the diameter of the aperture and to control the cam mechanism so as to move the first, second, and third holding frames in the optical axis direction, when shifting to the retracted condition from the shooting condition.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the present invention, when shifting to the retracted condition from the shooting condition, the part of the second lens group is inserted into the aperture of the light-amount adjusting member and the concave and convex surfaces, which are faced to each other, of the first and second lens groups are overlapped in the optical axis direction. Accordingly, the configuration is simplified and the barrel length under the retracted condition is shortened.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereafter, embodiments according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A lens barrel of this embodiment is mounted on a digital camera as an image pickup apparatus. This lens barrel has a retractable zoom mechanism (a collapsible-mount-type zoom mechanism) with a variable focal length, increases a barrel length under a shooting condition, and decreases the barrel length under a retracted condition to retract the lens barrel into a camera body.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing an external appearance of the digital camera <b>12</b> that is provided with the lens barrel <b>71</b> according to the embodiment. A finder <b>17</b> for determining composition of a subject, an auxiliary light source <b>16</b> for assisting photometric measurement and distance measurement, an electric flash <b>18</b>, and the lens barrel <b>71</b> are mounted on a front side of the digital camera <b>12</b>. It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the condition where the main power of the digital camera <b>12</b> is OFF and the lens barrel (an image pickup lens barrel) <b>71</b> is under the retracted condition.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A release button <b>13</b>, a power supply change button <b>15</b>, and a zoom switch <b>14</b> are arranged on an upper surface of the digital camera <b>12</b>. A tripod fitting part (not shown) and a card battery cover (not shown) are arranged on a bottom surface of the digital camera <b>12</b>. A memory card drive <b>42</b> and a battery insert portion (not shown) that will be described later are arranged inside the card battery cover.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Operation buttons <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>26</b> that are used to switch various functions; a display <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that consists of LCD; and a finder eyepiece (not shown) are arranged on a back surface of the digital camera <b>12</b>. An operation mode of the digital camera <b>12</b> is selected by depressing the manual operation buttons <b>21</b> through <b>26</b> from among a shooting mode, a reproduction mode, a moving image shooting mode, or the like. The display <b>20</b> displays image data stored in a memory <b>40</b> or image data read from a memory card. When the reproduction mode is selected, the display <b>20</b> displays a plurality of shooting data with a reduced size.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram schematically showing configurations of a control unit and peripheral circuits of the digital camera <b>12</b>. A control unit <b>50</b> mainly consists of a CPU <b>46</b>, a ROM <b>45</b>, and a RAM <b>47</b>. The control unit <b>50</b> and various components such as the release button <b>13</b>, the operation buttons <b>21</b> through <b>26</b>, the display <b>20</b>, the memory <b>40</b>, and the memory card drive <b>42</b> are connected via a bus <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A zooming motor driving unit <b>29</b>, a focusing motor driving unit <b>31</b>, a shutter driving unit <b>32</b>, a diaphragm driving unit <b>35</b>, an image pickup device <b>105</b> such as a CCD and a CMOS, and the electric flash <b>18</b> are connected to a driving circuit <b>43</b> that is connected with the control unit <b>50</b> via the bus <b>44</b>. The zoom motor driving unit <b>29</b> drives a lens-barrel driving motor <b>29</b><i>a</i>. The focusing motor driving unit <b>31</b> drives a focusing motor <b>31</b><i>a</i>. These units are controlled by signals from the control unit <b>50</b>. Control programs to control the above-mentioned various constitution elements are stored in the ROM <b>45</b>. Data required for the respective control programs is stored in the RAM <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the digital camera <b>12</b> having the above-mentioned configuration, when a user presses the power supply change button <b>15</b> to turn the power ON from OFF, the CPU <b>46</b> reads a necessary control program from the ROM <b>45</b>, and starts an initial operation. That is, the control unit <b>50</b> shifts the lens barrel <b>71</b> to a predetermined shooting condition, and starts a shooting function so that the camera is made into a shooting standby state.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the user presses the release button <b>13</b> to take a picture, the control unit <b>50</b> detects brightness (a photometry value) of a subject by the image pickup device <b>105</b>, sets an aperture value and a shutter speed based on the photometry value, and determines whether the electric flash <b>18</b> will be emitted or not. By operating the operation button <b>21</b> beforehand, the user can also select a flash mode from among a forced-emission mode to force the electric flash <b>18</b> to emit and a no-emission mode to prohibit an emission.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, the control unit <b>50</b> measures a distance to the subject, and controls the focusing motor driving unit <b>31</b> so as to move a focusing lens member <b>30</b> to a predetermined in-focus position. Accordingly, an image pickup lens focuses on the subject. It should be noted that a third lens group <b>104</b> mentioned later is used for the focusing lens member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The control unit <b>50</b> controls the shutter driving unit <b>32</b> so as to open and close a shutter (the shutter unit) <b>201</b>, and makes the image pickup device <b>105</b> capture a desired image. Electrical charge corresponding to a light amount that enters based on an exposure value is accumulated by the image pickup device <b>105</b>. The electrical charge is converted into an image signal, which is outputted to an analog signal processing unit <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The analog signal processing unit <b>36</b> applies an analog signal process to the captured image signal, and outputs to an A/D conversion unit <b>38</b>. The A/D conversion unit <b>38</b> converts the received analog data into digital data. The digital data is outputted to a digital signal processing unit <b>39</b>, and the digital data is processed here. Finally, the digital data is stored into the memory <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A compression-extension unit <b>41</b> applies a compression process or the like such as JPEG and TIFF to the digital data stored in the memory <b>40</b> in response to an operation of the operation button <b>22</b>. Then, the processed data is outputted to the memory card drive <b>42</b>, and is stored into the memory card. It should be noted that the digital data processed by the digital signal processing unit <b>39</b> is outputted to the compression-extension unit <b>41</b> and is stored into the memory card by the memory card drive <b>42</b>, when the digital camera <b>12</b> does not have a memory <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The control unit <b>50</b> controls the compression-extension unit <b>41</b> to apply an expansion process to the image data stored in the memory <b>40</b> or the image data stored in the memory card by the memory card drive <b>42</b>, and displays the processed image data on the display <b>20</b> via the bus <b>44</b>. When the user who looks at the data indicated on the display <b>20</b> determines that the image is unnecessary, the user can delete data by operating the operation button <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the user operates the zoom switch <b>14</b> arranged on the upper surface of the digital camera <b>12</b>, the zoom motor driving unit <b>29</b> is controlled by the control unit <b>50</b> through the driving circuit <b>43</b> so that the lens barrel <b>71</b> extends/contracts in an optical axis direction of an optical system (the direction of an optical axis passing through centers of lenses). The user can perform what is called digital zoom that enlarges or reduces a stored image displayed on the display <b>20</b> by operating the zoom switch <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, a configuration of the lens barrel <b>71</b> of the digital camera <b>12</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view showing the configuration of the lens barrel <b>71</b> under the retracted condition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view showing the configuration of the lens barrel <b>71</b> under the shooting condition.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An optical system arranged in the lens barrel <b>71</b> is constituted by arranging a first lens group <b>102</b>, a diaphragm unit <b>301</b>, a second lens group <b>209</b>, the shutter <b>201</b>, the third lens group <b>104</b>, a filter <b>106</b>, and the image pickup device <b>105</b> along the optical axis <b>101</b> in this order from a subject side that is a left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It should be noted that although each of the lens groups is shown as a single-piece lens in the figures, it is constituted as a combination of a plurality of lenses in fact.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The lens barrel <b>71</b> is provided with a fixing barrel <b>400</b> that surrounds the outermost position, a rotating barrel <b>402</b> that is driven by the zoom motor <b>29</b><i>a </i>to be rotated inside the fixing barrel <b>400</b>, a cylinder <b>150</b> that is inserted inside the rotating barrel <b>402</b> from the subject side, and a straight moving barrel <b>401</b> that is inserted inside the rotating barrel <b>402</b> from the side of the image pickup device <b>105</b>. The rotating barrel <b>402</b> moves in the optical axis direction by rotating. Although the straight moving barrel <b>401</b> moves in the optical axis direction with the rotating barrel <b>402</b>, it goes straight on without rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second lens group <b>209</b> is fixed to a shutter base <b>202</b> (a second holding frame). The shutter <b>201</b> is mounted on the shutter base <b>202</b>. Three advance guide parts <b>206</b> are formed on the shutter base <b>202</b> radially at nearly regular intervals, and cam pins <b>207</b> are attached to tip ends thereof. The cam pins <b>207</b> are engaged with cam grooves <b>403</b> formed inside the rotating barrel <b>402</b>. When the rotating barrel <b>402</b> rotates, the shutter base <b>202</b> moves in the optical axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The diaphragm unit <b>301</b> is located between the first and second lens groups <b>102</b> and <b>209</b> as a light-amount adjusting member that adjusts an amount of light that transmits the optical system by changing an aperture diameter, and is mounted on a diaphragm base <b>305</b> (a third holding frame). Three advance guide parts <b>314</b> are formed on the diaphragm base <b>305</b> radially at nearly regular intervals, and cam pins <b>315</b> are attached to tip ends thereof. The cam pins <b>315</b> are engaged with cam grooves <b>404</b> formed inside the rotating barrel <b>402</b>. When the rotating barrel <b>402</b> rotates, the diaphragm base <b>305</b> moves in the optical axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first lens group <b>102</b> is held by the cylinder <b>150</b> (a first holding frame) that is movable in the optical axis direction with respect to the rotating barrel <b>402</b>. The cylinder <b>150</b> has follower parts that follow cam grooves (not shown) formed on the rotating barrel <b>402</b>, and moves in the optical axis direction according to a rotation of the rotating barrel <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The third lens group <b>104</b> is held by a lens frame <b>108</b>. The lens frame <b>108</b> equips a screw guide <b>108</b><i>a </i>at one edge thereof. The screw guide <b>108</b><i>a </i>is meshed with a worm gear <b>31</b><i>b </i>fixed to a rotating shaft of the focusing motor <b>31</b><i>a</i>. When rotating the focusing motor <b>31</b><i>a</i>, the third lens group <b>104</b> moves in the optical axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, a configuration of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> will be shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an exploded perspective view showing the configuration of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are views showing the configuration of the diaphraym unit <b>301</b> viewed in the optical axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The diaphragm unit <b>301</b> comprises the diaphragm base <b>305</b>, a diaphragm cover <b>306</b>, a diaphragm ring <b>307</b>, diaphragm blades <b>308</b>, a diaphragm actuator <b>309</b>, a gear <b>310</b>, and a sensor <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A plurality of holes <b>313</b> into which rotating shafts <b>312</b> of the diaphragm blades <b>308</b> are inserted are formed on the diaphraym base <b>305</b> at nearly regular intervals in the circumferential direction around the optical axis <b>101</b>. The gear <b>310</b> is attached to the driving shaft of the diaphragm actuator <b>309</b>. The diaphragm actuator <b>309</b> is fixed to the diaphragm base <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A plurality of cam grooves <b>316</b> with which bosses <b>317</b> of the diaphragm blade <b>308</b> are engaged are formed on the diaphraym ring <b>307</b> at nearly regular intervals in the circumferential direction around the optical axis <b>101</b>. A gear part <b>318</b> that meshes with the gear <b>310</b> and a detected part <b>322</b> that is detected by the sensor <b>311</b> are formed on the diaphragm ring <b>37</b>. It should be noted that the combination of the sensor <b>311</b> and the detected part <b>322</b> is an example of a position detecting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The rotating shaft <b>312</b> and the boss <b>317</b> are formed on the diaphraym blade <b>308</b>. The rotating shaft <b>312</b> is inserted into the hole <b>313</b> formed on the diaphragm base <b>305</b>. The boss <b>317</b> is inserted into the cam groove <b>316</b> formed on the diaphragm ring <b>307</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The plurality of diaphraym blades <b>308</b> are arranged at the nearly regular intervals around the optical axis <b>101</b>. The plurality of diaphragm blades <b>308</b> form an aperture <b>319</b> of which a size is variable in response to an overlapping condition of the diaphragm blades <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the diaphragm ring <b>307</b> is driven by the power of the diaphragm actuator <b>309</b>, each of the diaphragm blades <b>308</b> moves so as to rotate along the cam groove <b>316</b> of the diaphragm ring <b>307</b> around the rotating shaft <b>312</b>, and the aperture <b>319</b> of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> will be set at a desired size.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Under the shooting condition, the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> of this embodiment adjusts the light amount by changing the size of the aperture <b>319</b> formed of diaphragm blade <b>308</b>. On the other hand, under the retracted condition, the plurality of diaphragm blades <b>308</b> are stored in positions outer than the maximum aperture d and inner than the outer diameter of the diaphragm base <b>305</b> in order to prevent interference with the second lens group <b>209</b>. That is, the plurality of diaphragm blades <b>308</b> shift to a super-full aperture condition where the aperture is opened still larger than the maximum aperture under the shooting condition. Here, the inner side of the maximum aperture d under the super-full aperture condition is defined as a super-full aperture <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The sensor <b>311</b> is fixed to the diaphragm base <b>305</b>. The condition of the diaphragm blades <b>308</b> is grasped by detecting the position of the detected part <b>322</b> formed on the diaphragm ring <b>307</b>. In this embodiment, the sensor <b>311</b> is arranged so as to detect the detected part <b>322</b> when the diaphragm blades <b>308</b> are stored in the diaphragm base <b>305</b> and shift to the super-full aperture condition where the aperture is opened still larger than the maximum aperture under the shooting condition.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a view showing configurations of the straight moving barrel <b>401</b>, the rotating barrel <b>402</b>, the diaphragm unit <b>301</b>, and the shutter unit <b>201</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a development view showing the cam grooves <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> formed on the rotating barrel <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Slits <b>405</b> are formed on the straight moving barrel <b>401</b> so that the advance guide parts <b>206</b> provided on the shutter unit <b>201</b> (a light-amount varying member) and the advance guide parts <b>314</b> provided on the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> are engaged. It should be noted that a rotation of the straight moving barrel <b>401</b> is prohibited by a straight movement control member (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The rotating barrel <b>402</b> is rotatable and movable in the optical axis direction with respect to the straight moving barrel <b>401</b>. As mentioned above, the cam grooves <b>403</b> with which the cam pins <b>207</b> provided at the tip end of the advance guide parts <b>206</b> are engaged, and the cam grooves <b>404</b> with which the cam pins <b>315</b> provided at the tip ends of the advance guide parts <b>314</b> are engaged are formed on the inner surface of the rotating barrel <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The advance guide parts <b>314</b> and <b>206</b> are inserted into the slits <b>405</b> of the straight moving barrel <b>401</b>, and the cam pins <b>207</b> and <b>315</b> provided at the respective tip ends are located in the cam grooves <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> formed on the rotating barrel <b>402</b>. Accordingly, the straight moving barrel <b>401</b> and the rotating barrel <b>402</b> hold the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> and the shutter unit <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Here, when rotating the rotating barrel <b>402</b> relatively to the straight moving barrel <b>401</b>, the shutter unit <b>201</b> and the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> move in the direction of the optical axis <b>101</b>. A distance between the shutter unit <b>201</b> and the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> is maintained at a fixed interval <b>406</b> under the shooting condition by means of the cam grooves <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> formed on the rotating barrel <b>402</b>. However, since the interval between the cam groove <b>403</b> and the cam groove <b>404</b> decreases to an interval <b>407</b> when shifting to the retracted condition from the shooting condition, the shutter unit <b>201</b> and the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> become close to each other. Accordingly, the barrel length under the retracted condition can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be noted that although the shutter unit <b>201</b> and the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> are moved while keeping the distance therebetween under the shooting condition in this embodiment, they can be moved while changing the distance, which increases a degree of freedom of the optical system. Since the shutter unit <b>201</b> and the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> are held and driven by the straight moving barrel <b>401</b> and the rotating barrel <b>402</b>, the structure of the lens barrel is simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> and the shutter unit <b>201</b> under the shooting condition and the retracted condition will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a view showing external appearances of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> and the shutter unit <b>201</b> under the shooting condition viewed in the optical axis direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a sectional view showing structures of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> and the shutter unit <b>201</b> viewed in a direction of an arrow A-A line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The shutter unit <b>201</b> comprises a part of the shutter base <b>202</b>, a shutter blade <b>203</b>, a shutter cover <b>204</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), and a shutter actuator (not shown). The shutter blade <b>203</b> consists of one or plural blades dependent on its space. The shutter blade <b>203</b> can be opened and closed using a power of the shutter actuator, and is held under a fully-opened condition or a totally closed condition in a no-electricity status.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a flowchart showing operation procedures to shift the lens barrel <b>71</b> to the retracted condition from the shooting condition when turning OFF the main power. This processing program is stored in the ROM <b>45</b> in the control unit <b>50</b>, and is executed by the CPU <b>46</b> when the main power is turned OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the lens barrel <b>71</b> shifts to the retracted condition from the shooting condition, first, the control unit <b>50</b> determines whether the sensor <b>311</b> detects the position of the detected part <b>322</b> mounted on the diaphraym ring <b>307</b> (step S<b>1</b>). When the position of the detected part <b>322</b> is not detected, the control unit <b>50</b> checks the condition of the aperture <b>319</b> of the diaphragm blades <b>308</b>, and drives the diaphragm actuator <b>309</b> according to the condition (step S<b>2</b>). And the control unit <b>50</b> returns the process to the step S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">On the other hand, when the control unit <b>50</b> confirms that the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> is under the super-full aperture condition based on a signal from the sensor <b>311</b>, the control unit <b>50</b> shifts the lens barrel <b>71</b> to the retracted condition from the shooting condition (step S<b>3</b>), and finishes this process.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">At this time, the diaphragm blades <b>308</b> are stored in positions outer than the super-full aperture <b>320</b> of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b>, and shift to the super-full aperture condition where the aperture opens still larger than the maximum aperture under the shooting condition, and are held in order to prevent interference with the second lens group <b>209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">At least a part of the second lens group <b>209</b> enters into the super-full aperture <b>320</b> of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b>, and at least a part of the second lens group <b>209</b> overlaps with at least a part of the first lens group <b>102</b> in the optical axis direction. That is, a convex surface <b>321</b> of the second lens group <b>209</b> enters into a recess portion of a concave surface <b>107</b> of the first lens group <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the total length of the lens barrel can be reduced (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a flowchart showing operation procedures to shift the lens barrel <b>71</b> to the retracted condition from the shooting condition when an error occurs under the shooting condition. This processing program is stored in the ROM <b>45</b> in the control unit <b>50</b>, and is executed by the CPU <b>46</b> in a predetermined cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The control unit <b>50</b> determines whether an error such as an abnormality of the digital camera <b>12</b> and a malfunction of the lens barrel <b>71</b> is occurred under the shooting condition (step S<b>11</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When an abnormality occurs in the digital camera <b>12</b> or when the lens barrel <b>71</b> causes a malfunction under the shooting condition, the control unit <b>50</b> checks the condition of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> based on a signal from the sensor <b>311</b> (step S<b>12</b>). That is, the control unit <b>50</b> determines whether the sensor <b>311</b> detects the position of the detected part <b>322</b> mounted on the diaphragm ring <b>307</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the control unit <b>50</b> determines that the diaphragm blades <b>308</b> are not under the super-full aperture condition as a result of checking the aperture <b>319</b> of the diaphragm blades <b>308</b>, the control unit <b>50</b> drives the diaphragm actuator <b>309</b> (step S<b>13</b>). And the control unit <b>50</b> returns the process to the step S<b>1</b>. On the other hand, when the control unit <b>50</b> confirms that the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> is under the desired super-full aperture condition based on the signal from the sensor <b>311</b>, the control unit <b>50</b> shifts the lens barrel <b>71</b> to the retracted condition from the shooting condition (step S<b>14</b>), and finishes this process.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thus, the control unit <b>50</b> shifts the diaphragm blade <b>308</b> to the super-full aperture condition by checking the condition of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> based on the signal from the sensor <b>311</b>. Accordingly, a damage of the lens barrel <b>71</b> due to interference between the diaphragm blades <b>308</b> and the second lens group <b>209</b>, which occurs when the lens barrel <b>71</b> is retracted while keeping the diaphragm blades <b>308</b> under the shooting condition, is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Here, even when the lens barrel <b>71</b> is under the retracted condition, the shutter blade <b>203</b> can open and close regardless of the condition. Therefore, performance degradation of the image pickup device <b>105</b> and the filter <b>106</b> attached to the image pickup device <b>105</b> can be prevented by closing the shutter blade <b>203</b> under the retracted condition.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In this embodiment, the lens surface <b>107</b> of the first lens group <b>102</b> nearest to the second lens group <b>209</b> has a concave form, and the lens surface <b>321</b> of the second lens group <b>209</b> nearest to the first lens group <b>102</b> has a convex form. Under the retracted condition, these lens surfaces are overlapped in the direction of the optical axis <b>101</b>. Accordingly, the barrel length under the retracted condition can be reduced. It should be noted that the combination of the surface forms is arbitrary and is not limited in particular.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Since the distance between the shutter unit <b>201</b> and the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> is not reduced when shifting to the retracted condition from the shooting condition or when receiving an external force such as a shock under the shooting condition, damage to the shutter unit <b>201</b> and the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the lens barrel of this embodiment, when shifting to the retracted condition from the shooting condition, the second lens group <b>209</b> enters into the super-full aperture <b>320</b> of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b>, and the second lens group <b>209</b> and the first lens group <b>102</b> are held so that they are overlapped in the optical axis direction. Accordingly, the configuration is simplified and the barrel length under the retracted condition can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Under the super-full aperture condition, since the second lens group <b>209</b> is held while being entered into the super-full aperture <b>320</b> of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b>, damage to the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Since the lens barrel shifts to the retracted condition after checking that the diaphragm blades <b>308</b> are in the super-full aperture condition, contact between the lens and the blades can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Since the shutter unit <b>201</b> is totally closed under the retracted condition, degradation of the image pickup device <b>105</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Since the shutter unit <b>201</b> does not approach the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> when receiving an external force such as a shock under the shooting condition, damage to the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> due to contact between the lens and the blades can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Since the shutter unit <b>201</b> is arranged at the opposite side of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> across the second lens group <b>209</b>, the shutter unit <b>201</b> can be arranged near the image pickup device <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It should be noted that the present invention is applicable to not only the configuration of the above-mentioned embodiment, but also any configurations as long as the functions shown in the claims or the functions of the configuration of the embodiment can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Although the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> becomes the super-full aperture condition and the shutter unit <b>201</b> becomes the totally closed condition in this embodiment, such conditions are not limited in particular. For example, a configuration where the shutter unit <b>201</b> fully opens as the light-amount adjusting member and the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> totally closes as the light-amount varying member, and a configuration where the light-amount adjusting member such as an ND filter is used instead of the diaphragm unit <b>301</b> may be adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The configurations or allocations of the guide part, the pressurization part, etc. are not limited to those of the above-mentioned embodiment, and can be changed suitably.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Although the lens barrel of this embodiment is constituted as a single-piece design with the image pickup apparatus, it may be exchangeably equipped with the image pickup apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the above-mentioned embodiment, although the digital camera has been described as an example of the image pickup apparatus, the present invention is also applicable to a digital video camera etc.</p>
