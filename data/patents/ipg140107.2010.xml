<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed are embodiments of an electroplating system and an associated electroplating method that allow for depositing of metal alloys with a uniform plate thickness and with the means to alter dynamically the alloy composition. Specifically, by using multiple anodes, each with different types of soluble metals, the system and method avoid the need for periodic plating bath replacement and also allow the ratio of metals within the deposited alloy to be selectively varied by applying different voltages to the different metals. The system and method further avoids the uneven current density and potential distribution and, thus, the non-uniform plating thicknesses exhibited by prior art methods by selectively varying the shape and placement of the anodes within the plating bath. Additionally, the system and method allows for fine tuning of the plating thickness by using electrically insulating selectively placed prescribed baffles.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, electrodeposition is a process in which a workpiece to be plated is placed in a plating container with a plating solution (i.e., plating bath). An electrical circuit is created when a negative terminal of a power supply is connected to the workpiece so as to form a cathode and a positive terminal of the power supply is connected to another metal in container so as to form an anode. The plating material is typically a stabilized metal specie (e.g., a metal ion) in the solution. During the plating process this metal specie is replenished with a soluble metal that forms the anode and/or can be added directly to the solution (e.g., as a metal salt). When an electrical current is passed through the circuit, metal ions in the solution take up electrons at the workpiece and a layer of metal is formed on the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Several methods have been developed for depositing an alloy of two or more different metals (e.g., nickel and cobalt) on a workpiece, based on the above-described electrodeposition process. In one method, a single anode is used that comprises one of the plating metals and any additional plating metals are contained in the plating bath. However, to control the composition and residual stress of the deposited alloy, the plating bath requires frequent chemical additions and eventual dumping. That is, the level of the metal salts in the plating bath buildup over time and in order to keep the metal salt concentrations within normal plating levels, the plating bath must be periodically removed and replaced. If this is not done, the residual stress of the deposit will increase. In another method, an anode that comprises an alloy with the predetermined metal ratio is used. The use of the alloy anode, resolves the need for chemical additions and periodic dumping of the plating bath. However, it is basically impossible to modify the alloy metal ratio once the electrodeposition process has started because the ratio of the deposited alloy is for the most part determined by the ratio of the metals in the anode. In yet another method, multiple rectangular-shaped anodes are placed against one side of the container and spaced apart, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. These rectangular-shaped anodes comprise different type metals and are connected to separate voltage sources. This method allows the ratio of metals in the alloy plate to be selectively controlled by applying different current values to anodes with different type metals. However, varying currents in this manner produces a non-uniform voltage profile in the plating bath that typically results in both a non-uniform alloy composition and a non-uniform thickness as compared to the above-described methods. Therefore, there is a need in the art for an electroplating system and an associated electroplating method for depositing metal alloys that does not require periodic plating bath removal or an alloy anode and that does allow for both deposition thickness control and dynamic metal ratio control.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing, disclosed herein are embodiments of an electroplating system and an associated electroplating method that allow for depositing of metal alloys with a uniform plate thickness and with the means to dynamically alter the alloy composition (i.e., the ratio of two or more metals within the alloy). Specifically, by using multiple anodes, each with different types of soluble metals, the system and method avoid the need for periodic plating bath replacement and also allow the ratio of metals within the deposited alloy to be selectively varied by applying different voltages to the different metals. The system and method further avoids the uneven current density and potential distribution and, thus, the non-uniform plating thickness of prior art methods by selectively varying the shape and placement of the anodes within the plating bath. Additionally, the system and method allows for fine tuning of the plating thickness by using electrically insulating baffles.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">More particularly, each of the embodiments of the alloy plating system comprises a plating container that is adapted to contain a plating solution as well as to hold the workpiece that is to be plated immersed within the solution. The system further comprises a plurality of anode layers on a wall of the container opposite a first side of the workpiece. Theses anode layers provide the metal for uniform plating of the workpiece. The anode layers in each embodiment comprise at least two different types of metal anodes (e.g., first anode(s) comprising a first soluble metal, second anode(s) comprising a second soluble metal, third anode(s) comprising a third soluble metal, etc.). The different types of anodes are each connected to different power sources in order to vary the alloy composition. Furthermore, the anodes can comprise solid metal anodes and/or non-metal or non-soluble metal containers that have a plurality of openings (e.g., baskets) and that are filled with multiple pieces of the selected soluble metal. However, the plating system of the present invention and, particularly, the anodes of the plating system of the present invention differ from the prior art systems because the size, shape, numbers, placement of the anodes within the plating bath, etc. are selectively varied. By selectively varying these features a user can achieve the desired alloy composition and can simultaneously ensure an approximately uniform current density and potential distribution within the solution in the area adjacent the workpiece in order to obtain a uniform plating thickness. The different embodiments vary based on the position and configuration of the anodes within a plurality of anode layers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment of the system, anodes in the same layer comprise the same soluble metal, but the metal may vary from layer to layer. For example, a first anode layer with at least one first anode comprising a first soluble metal can be positioned adjacent to a wall in the plating bath, a second anode layer with at least one second anode comprising a second soluble metal can be positioned adjacent to the first anode layer, etc. The anodes in adjacent anode layers overlap. Furthermore, based on the desired alloy composition and on the space available in the container, various anode features are predetermined. These features include, but are not limited to, the relative surface areas of the different metals, the three dimensional shape of the anodes (e.g., trapezoidal, triangular, rectangular and/or cylindrical three-dimensional shapes), the size of the anodes, the total number of anodes, the number of anode layers, the number of anodes in each layer, etc. These features are specifically predetermined so that, when different voltages are applied to the different metals during the plating process, the desired alloy composition is achieved and the current density and potential distribution remain approximately uniform within the solution in an area adjacent to the first side of the workpiece to ensure a uniform plating thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment of the system, each of the anode layers can comprise multiple anodes and, specifically, anodes comprising different soluble metals can be dispersed throughout the anode layers. For example, one anode layer can have a first anode(s) comprising a first soluble metal and second anode(s) comprising a second soluble metal that is different from the first soluble metal. Another layer can comprise first anode(s) and third anode(s) comprising a third soluble metal that is different from the first and/or second soluble metals. In yet another layer, all of the anodes can comprise the same soluble metal (e.g., can comprise first anodes). As with the previously described system embodiment, the anodes in adjacent anode layers overlap. Furthermore, again based on the desired alloy composition and on the space available in the container, various anode features are predetermined. These features include, but are not limited to, the relative surface areas of the different metals, the three dimensional shape of the anodes, the size of the anodes, the total number of anodes, the number of anode layers, the number of anodes of each metal type in each layer, etc. These features are specifically predetermined so that when different voltages are applied to the different metals during the plating process, the desired alloy composition is achieved and the current density and potential distribution remain approximately uniform within the solution in an area adjacent to the first side of said workpiece to ensure a uniform plating thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another embodiment of the system, each of the anode layers can comprise a plurality of multi-anode structures, where each anode in the multi-anode structure comprises a different soluble metal. For example, a multi-anode structure can comprise a first anode that comprises a first soluble metal and that is surrounded by a second anode that comprises a second soluble metal that is different from the first soluble metal. The first and second anodes can each comprise either a non-metal or a non-soluble metal basket (i.e., a container with holes). The basket of the first anode can be filled with pieces of the first metal and can be nested within the basket of the second anode which can further be filled with the second metal. The multi-anode structures in adjacent anode layers overlap. Furthermore, as with the previously described embodiments, based on the desired alloy composition and on the space available in the container, various anode features are predetermined. These features include, but are not limited to, the relative surface areas of the different metals, the three dimensional shape of the multi-anode structures and, specifically, the shapes of the first and second anodes that make up the multi-anode structures, the relative sizes of the first and second anodes, the total number of multi-anode structures, the number of anode layers, the number of multi-anode structures in each layer, etc. These features are specifically predetermined so that when different voltages are applied to the different anodes during the plating process, the desired alloy composition is achieved and the current density and potential distribution remain approximately uniform within the solution in an area adjacent to the first side of the workpiece to ensure a uniform plating thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Each of the above-described embodiments can further comprise at least one baffle in the plating bath adjacent to the workpiece. The baffle(s) can comprise a dielectric material and can be configured so that their dimensions and positions within the container relative to the workpiece will enable current flux control. Adjusting the baffle position allows for fine tuning of the uniform current density and potential distribution in the solution in the area adjacent to the workpiece so as to selectively vary the overall plating thickness distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also disclosed are embodiments of associated methods for uniform plating of a workpiece with an alloy of two or more metals. The embodiments comprise providing a plating container (i.e., a plating tank) that is adapted to contain a plating solution as well as to hold the workpiece that is to be plated within the solution.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Then, the space available in the tank and the desired alloy composition are determined. Based on the desired alloy composition, the required relative surface areas of the alloy metals are determined.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Then, based on the space available in the tank, the desired alloy composition and on the required relative surface areas, several other predeterminations are made regarding features of the anodes. These predeterminations include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the three dimensional shape of the anodes (e.g., trapezoidal, triangular, rectangular and/or cylindrical three-dimensional shapes, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>); (2) the relative number of anodes with different types of metals (e.g., the number of first anodes comprising a first soluble metal, second anodes comprising a second soluble metal, etc.); (3) the configurations of the anodes (e.g., single anode structures (e.g., as illustrated in embodiments <b>300</b> and <b>700</b>, described above) or multi-anode structures (e.g., as illustrated in embodiment <b>800</b>, described above); (4) the sizes of the anodes; (6) the number of anode layers; the numbers of different types of anodes in each layer; (7) the positions of the different types of anodes within each of the layers; (8) the size and location of baffles; etc. These predeterminations are made specifically so that when different voltages are subsequently applied to the different anodes during the plating process, the desired alloy composition is achieved and current density and potential distribution remain approximately uniform in the solution in an area adjacent to the first side of the workpiece to ensure a uniform plating thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Then, based on these predeterminations, multiple anodes are formed in overlapping layers in the container adjacent to one or more of the container walls. Different type metal anodes are connected to different voltage sources and the plating process is performed. During this plating process, the voltages applied to the different type metal anodes can be selectively varied so as to selectively vary the ratio the different metals in the alloy being deposited on the workpiece. Additionally, the current density and potential distribution in the solution can be fined tuned in the area adjacent to the workpiece using selectively placed prescribed baffles. This fine tuning can be done to control the overall thickness of the uniformly deposited plating.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The embodiments of the invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments of the invention. Also, it should be understood that all voltage references, in volt %, are used herein to represent the percent of the voltage differential between the working voltage of one of the anodes and the cathode. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments of the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">There is a need in the art for an alloy electroplating system and an associated alloy electroplating method. Specifically, an alloy electroplating system is needed that does not require periodic plating bath removal or an alloy anode. An alloy electroplating system that allows for both deposition thickness control and metal ratio control is also needed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As mentioned above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, one method of electrodeposition of an alloy that does not require an alloy anode or periodic plating bath removal involves the use of multiple rectangular-shaped anodes <b>101</b>-<b>102</b>, <b>103</b>-<b>104</b> comprising different soluble metals (e.g., anodes <b>101</b> and <b>103</b> comprise a first metal, such as nickel, and anodes <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> comprise a second metal, such as cobalt). These anodes <b>101</b>-<b>104</b> are placed on one or more sides <b>181</b>-<b>182</b> of a plating container <b>180</b> opposite the side(s) of the workpiece <b>120</b> that are to be plated, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. If the anodes <b>101</b>-<b>104</b> are all connected to the same voltage source such that the same voltage (e.g., 100 volt %) is applied to each of them, then even though they are spaced apart a uniform current density and potential distribution will be exhibited within the plating bath in an area <b>140</b> adjacent to the workpiece <b>120</b>, as evidenced by the uniform contours of relative differential voltage <b>110</b> within this area <b>140</b>. For example, a current variability of only &#x2dc;1.5% may be exhibited within the center region <b>140</b> of the bath <b>180</b> adjacent to the workpiece <b>120</b>. This uniform current density and potential distribution results in a workpiece <b>120</b> with a uniform plated thickness. One advantage of this method is that the ratio of metals in the alloy plate can be selectively controlled by applying different voltages to anodes with different metal types. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, applying one voltage (e.g., 100 volt %) to the first metal anodes <b>101</b> and <b>103</b> and another separate and different voltage (e.g., 56 volt %) to the second metal anodes <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> typically causes an uneven current density and potential distribution within the plating bath <b>180</b> in the area <b>140</b> adjacent to the workpiece <b>120</b>, as evidenced by the uneven contours of relative differential voltage <b>111</b> in this area <b>140</b>. For example, a current variability of &#x2dc;29% may be exhibited in the center region <b>140</b> of the plating bath <b>180</b> adjacent to the workpiece <b>120</b>. This uneven current density and potential distribution results in both a greater overall alloy thickness and a non-uniform thickness as compared to the other alloy deposition methods. Consequently, if current density and potential distribution within the plating bath can be controlled, so can plating thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Therefore, disclosed herein are embodiments <b>300</b>, <b>700</b>, <b>800</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, respectively) of an electroplating system and an associated electroplating method (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) that allow for depositing of metal alloys with a uniform plate thickness and with the means to alter dynamically the alloy composition (i.e., the ratio of two or more metals within the alloy). Specifically, by using multiple anodes, each with different types of soluble metals, the system and method avoid the need for periodic plating bath replacement and also allow the ratio of metals within the deposited alloy to be selectively and dynamically varied by applying different voltages to the different metals. The system and method further avoids the uneven current density and potential distribution and, thus, the non-uniform plating thicknesses exhibited by prior art methods by selectively varying the shape and placement of the anodes within the plating bath. Additionally, the system and method allow for fine tuning of the plating thickness by using electrically insulating selectively placed prescribed baffles.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">More particularly, referring to the embodiments <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> and <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> in combination, each of the embodiments <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> and <b>800</b> comprises a plating container <b>80</b> (i.e., an otherwise conventional plating tank) that is adapted to contain a plating solution (i.e., an otherwise conventional plating bath). The plating container <b>80</b> is further adapted to hold the workpiece <b>20</b> that is to be plated such that it is immersed within the plating solution <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The system further comprises a plurality of anode layers <b>50</b> adjacent to a wall (e.g., a first wall <b>81</b>) in the plating container <b>80</b> opposite the side of the workpiece <b>20</b> that is to be plated (e.g., first side <b>21</b>). These anode layers <b>50</b> provide the metal that forms the alloy plate on the side <b>21</b> of the workpiece <b>20</b>. The system can further optionally comprise a plurality of additional anode layers <b>60</b> that are identical to the anode layers <b>50</b>. The additional anode layers <b>60</b> are positioned on another wall (e.g., a second wall <b>82</b>) in the container <b>80</b> that is opposite another side of the workpiece <b>20</b> (e.g., side <b>22</b>) that is to be simultaneously plated. These additional anode layers <b>60</b> can similarly provide the metal that forms the alloy plate on the side <b>22</b> of the workpiece <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The anode layers <b>50</b> in each embodiment <b>300</b>, <b>700</b>, and <b>800</b> comprise at least two different types of metal anodes (e.g., first anode(s) <b>51</b> comprising a first soluble metal (e.g., nickel), second anode(s) <b>52</b> comprising a second soluble metal <b>52</b> (e.g., cobalt), sometimes third anode(s) <b>53</b> comprising a third soluble metal, etc.). Each of the different types of anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, etc. are connected to different power sources in order to vary the alloy composition (i.e., the ratio of metals in the alloy plating). For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, first anode(s) <b>51</b> can be electrically connected to a first power source <b>61</b> so that they may receive a first voltage (e.g., 100 volt %), second anode(s) <b>52</b> can be electrically connected to a second power source <b>62</b> so that they may receive a second voltage (e.g., 56 volt %) that is different from the first voltage, etc. Furthermore, these anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> can comprise solid metal anodes and/or non-metal or non-soluble metal (e.g., titanium) baskets or similar containers that have a plurality of openings (e.g., mesh-type openings). An anode container can be filled with multiple pieces (e.g., spheres) of the selected soluble metal, for example, as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,190,530 of Brodsky et al. issued on Feb. 20, 2001 and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, the embodiments <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> and <b>800</b> differ from the prior art alloy plating methods and systems because the size, shape (i.e., the use of non-standard anode geometries), numbers, placement of the anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> within the plating bath <b>90</b>, etc. are selectively varied. By selectively varying these features, a user can achieve the desired alloy composition and can simultaneously ensure an approximately uniform current density and potential distribution within the solution the area adjacent the workpiece in order to obtain a uniform plating thickness. The different embodiments <b>300</b>, <b>700</b>, and <b>800</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, respectively, vary based on the position and configuration of the anodes <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> within the anode layers <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>represents a top view of one embodiment <b>300</b> of an alloy plating system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>represents a cross-section view of the embodiment <b>300</b>. In this embodiment, anodes in the same layer comprise the same soluble metal, but the metal type may vary from layer to layer. For example, the anode layers <b>50</b> can comprise a first anode layer <b>301</b> with at least one first anode <b>51</b> comprising a first soluble metal (e.g., nickel) and a second anode layer <b>302</b> with at least one second anode <b>52</b> comprising a second soluble metal (e.g., cobalt), a third anode layer comprising at least one third anode comprising a third soluble metal, etc. The first anode layer <b>301</b> can be positioned adjacent to a first wall <b>81</b> of the container <b>80</b> and the second anode layer <b>302</b> can be positioned adjacent to the first anode layer <b>301</b> opposite the first wall <b>21</b> of the workpiece <b>20</b>. Anodes in adjacent anode layers <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> can overlap. For example, the anodes in each layer can be spaced apart at predetermined distance that is less than the width of an individual anode and the positions of the anodes in the second layer <b>302</b> can be offset from the positions of the anodes in the first layer <b>301</b> such that at least one side edge of each anode in the second layer overlaps a side edge of an anode in the first layer. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>is a selectively placed prescribed baffle <b>30</b> (see detailed discussion below regarding size and placement of baffles <b>30</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, as mentioned above, the shapes, sizes, numbers, etc. of the anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> may vary based on the desired alloy composition (i.e., the desired ratio of metals in the alloy) and on the space available in the container <b>80</b>. That is, based on various factors (including, for example, the desired alloy composition and the space available in the plating container <b>80</b>), various anode features must be predetermined. These features include, for example, the relative surface areas of the different metals, the three dimensional shape of the anodes, the size of the anodes, the total number of anodes, the number of anode layers <b>50</b>, the number of anodes in each layer <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, etc. The size, shape and location of baffles <b>30</b> relative to the workpiece <b>20</b> can also be predetermined.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Specifically, the above-listed features are predetermined so that, when different voltages are applied during the plating process to the different anodes having different metals, the desired alloy composition is achieved and the current density and potential distribution remain approximately uniform within the solution. That is, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, when a first voltage of 100 volt % is applied from the first current source <b>61</b> to the first anodes <b>51</b> with the first metal and a second different voltage is simultaneously applied to the second anodes <b>52</b> with the second metal from the second voltage source <b>62</b>, the current density and potential distribution within the solution <b>90</b> in an area <b>40</b> adjacent to the first side <b>21</b> of the workpiece <b>20</b> will remain approximately uniform. This is evidenced by the uniform contours of relative differential voltage <b>10</b> in the area <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). This uniform current density and potential distribution ensures that a uniform plating thickness is achieved (i.e., that variability of the plating thickness across the surface of the first side <b>21</b> of the workpiece is minimal). These predeterminations can, for example, be made using any commercially available Laplace equation solver to model the voltage and current distribution in the plating bath for a given set of baffles, anodes, and cathodes.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should be noted that to match the experimental plated thickness data and to plate Ni&#x2014;Co alloys, the model uses the electrolyte potential near the electrodes as boundary condition instead of using the electrode potential provided by the power source. This potential value is determined by measuring the potential with the use of a standard reference electrode such as Ag/AgCl or saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a potentiostat or a very sensitive high impedance voltmeter at both the anode and cathode. Since the potential is related to current density, the potential must be determined for the range of current densities. This range can be easily measured by using standard electrochemical techniques. Thus, the surface area of the anode is a key factor in the modeling. This means that this technique if applicable to both solid soluble metal anodes and soluble pellet anodes in a basket. However, since the surface area will be different, this information will need to be known at the start of the design. This procedure is expected to work well with other plated alloys too where the current density is dependent of plating fluid geometry inside the plating tank.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>illustrate exemplary trapezoidal, triangular, rectangular and/or cylindrical three-dimensional anode shapes and configurations that may alternatively be incorporated into the above-described embodiment <b>300</b> of the alloy plating system as well as into any of the other embodiments <b>700</b> and <b>800</b>. These shapes are only exemplary and not intended to be limiting. Thus, those skilled in the art will recognize that other suitable three-dimensional shapes and configurations may be incorporated into the embodiments <b>300</b>, <b>700</b>, and <b>800</b> of the alloy plating system. Additionally, those skilled in the art will recognize that the above-described embodiment <b>300</b> may alternatively incorporate more than two anode layers <b>50</b> and may also incorporate more than two metal types. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the embodiment <b>300</b> may further comprise a third anode layer <b>303</b> between the second anode layer <b>302</b> and the workpiece <b>20</b>. This third anode layer <b>303</b> can comprise at least one third anode <b>53</b> that comprises a third soluble metal. This third soluble metal can be the same or different from the first metal and/or the second metal of the first and second anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> represents another embodiment <b>700</b> of an alloy plating system. In this embodiment <b>700</b> each of the anode layers <b>50</b> can comprise multiple anodes and, specifically, can comprise multiple anodes with different types of soluble metals (i.e., first anodes <b>51</b> comprising a first soluble metal, second anodes <b>52</b> comprising a second soluble metal, third anodes <b>53</b> comprising a third soluble metal, etc.) dispersed throughout the anode layers <b>50</b>. For example, one anode layer <b>701</b> can comprise first anode(s) <b>51</b> and second anode(s) <b>52</b>. Another layer <b>702</b> can comprise first anode(s) <b>51</b> and third anode(s) <b>53</b>. In yet another layer <b>703</b>, all of the anodes can comprise the same soluble metal (e.g., can comprise first anodes <b>51</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As with the previously described system embodiment, the anodes in adjacent anode layers <b>50</b> overlap. That is, the anodes in each layer <b>701</b>-<b>703</b> can be spaced apart a predetermined distance that is less than the width of an individual anode and the positions of the anodes in the second layer <b>702</b> can be offset from the positions of the anodes in the first layer <b>701</b>, the positions of the anodes in the third layer <b>703</b> can be offset from the positions of the anodes in the second layer <b>702</b>, etc. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the shapes, sizes, numbers, etc. of the anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> may vary based on the desired alloy composition and on the space available in the container <b>80</b>. That is, based on the desired alloy composition and on the space available in the container <b>80</b>, various predeterminations are made. These predeterminations can include, but are not limited to, the relative surface areas of the different metals (i.e., of the first metal and the second metal), the three dimensional shape of the anodes (e.g., trapezoidal, triangular, rectangular and/or cylindrical three-dimensional shapes, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>), the size of the anodes, the total number of anodes, the number of anode layers <b>50</b>, the number of anodes of each metal type in each layer, etc. The size, shape and position of baffles <b>30</b> relative to the workpiece <b>20</b> are also determined. These predeterminations are made so that when different voltages are applied to the different anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, etc. during the plating process, the desired alloy composition is achieved and the current density and potential distribution remain approximately uniform within the solution in an area adjacent to the first side of the workpiece to ensure a uniform plating thickness. Again, these predeterminations can be made using any commercially available Laplace equation solver to model the voltage and current distribution in the plating bath for a given set of baffles, anodes, and cathodes.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>represents another embodiment <b>800</b> of an alloy plating system. In this embodiment <b>800</b> each of the anode layers <b>50</b> can comprise a plurality of multi-anode structures <b>855</b>. Each multi-anode structure can comprise at least two different anodes comprising different types of soluble metals. Specifically, each multi-anode structure <b>855</b> can comprise a first anode <b>51</b> that comprises a first soluble metal (e.g., nickel) and that is surrounded by a second anode <b>52</b> that comprises a second soluble metal (e.g., cobalt) that is different from the first soluble metal (e.g., see shapes of exemplary multi-anode structures depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>). In this embodiment the first and second anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> can each comprise either non-metal or non-soluble metal (e.g., titanium) baskets or similar type containers with a plurality of openings (e.g., mesh-type openings). The basket of the first anode <b>51</b> is filled with pieces (e.g., spheres) of the first soluble metal and is nested within the basket of the second anode <b>52</b> which is further filled with pieces (e.g., spheres) of the second soluble metal. The multi-anode structure <b>855</b> adjacent anode layers <b>50</b> overlap. That is, the multi-anode structures <b>855</b> in each layer can be spaced apart a predetermined distance that is less than the width of the individual multi-anode structures and the positions of the structures in the adjacent layers can be offset. Furthermore, as with the previously described embodiments, based on the desired alloy composition and on the space available in the container, various anode features are predetermined. These features include, but are not limited to, the relative surface areas of the different metals, the three dimensional shape of the multi-anode structures <b>855</b> (e.g., trapezoidal, triangular, rectangular and/or cylindrical three-dimensional shapes, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>) and, specifically, the shapes of the first and second anodes within the structures, the relative sizes of the first and second anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, the total number of multi-anode structures <b>855</b>, the number of anode layers <b>50</b>, the number of multi-anode structures <b>855</b> in each layer, etc. The size, shape and position of baffles <b>30</b> relative to the workpiece <b>20</b> are also determined. These predeterminations are specifically made so that, when different voltages are applied to the different anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, during the plating process, the desired alloy composition is achieved and the current density and potential distribution remain approximately uniform within the solution in an area adjacent to the first side of the workpiece to ensure a uniform plating thickness. Again, these predeterminations can be made using any commercially available Laplace equation solver to model the voltage and current distribution in the plating bath for a given set of baffles, anodes, and cathodes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As mentioned above, each of the above-described embodiments <b>300</b>, <b>700</b>, <b>800</b> can comprise at least one baffle <b>30</b> in the plating container <b>80</b> adjacent to the workpiece <b>20</b>. The baffle(s) <b>30</b> can comprise a dielectric material and can be configured so that their size, shape and position within the container <b>80</b> relative to the workpiece <b>20</b> is selected to enable current flux control (i.e., to maximize current density control) over the workpiece <b>20</b> surface. Once the size, shape and location of the prescribed baffles are determined, they can be placed permanently in the plating bath tank. Alternatively, they can be mounted on the structure that supports the workpiece <b>20</b> when placed inside the plating tank. Optimizing the sizes, shapes and positions of the baffles, allows for fine tuning of the uniform current density and potential distribution in the solution in the area adjacent to the workpiece so as to selectively vary the overall plating thickness distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, also disclosed are embodiments of associated methods for uniform plating of a workpiece with an alloy of two or more metals. The embodiments comprise providing a plating container (i.e., an otherwise conventional plating tank) that is adapted to contain a plating solution (i.e., an otherwise conventional plating bath) as well as to hold the workpiece that is to be plated within the solution (<b>902</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Then, a determination is made regarding the space available in the tank for the anodes, based on both the size of the tank and the sizes of the workpiece (<b>904</b>). A determination is also made regarding the desired alloy composition (i.e., the desired ratio of metals (e.g., nickel and cobalt) in the alloy plate (<b>906</b>). Then, based on the desired alloy composition, a determination is made regarding the relative surface areas required in the anodes for the different metals of the alloys (<b>980</b>). Next, based on the space available in the tank, on the desired alloy composition and on the required relative surface areas, predeterminations are made regarding various features of the anodes that are to be placed in the tank (<b>910</b>). These predeterminations can include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: (1) the three dimensional shape of the anodes (e.g., trapezoidal, triangular, rectangular and/or cylindrical three-dimensional shapes, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>); (2) the relative number of anodes with different types of metals (e.g., the number of first anodes comprising a first soluble metal, second anodes comprising a second soluble metal, etc.); (3) the configurations of the anodes (e.g., single anode structures (e.g., as illustrated in embodiments <b>300</b> and <b>700</b>, described above) or multi-anode structures (e.g., as illustrated in embodiment <b>800</b>, described above); (4) the sizes of the anodes; (6) the number of anode layers; the numbers of different types of anodes in each layer; (7) the positions of the different types of anodes within each of the layers, etc. The need to use baffles around the cathode to improve the current density distribution over the cathode surface must also be determined in this stage of the process. That is, the size, shape and location of the baffles relative to the workpiece can also be predetermined.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The above-mentioned features are specifically predetermined so that during a subsequent plating process (see process <b>914</b> below) when different voltages are applied to the different types of anodes (e.g., when a first voltage is applied to the first anode(s) that comprise a first soluble metal and a second voltage is applied to the second anode(s) that comprise a second soluble metal, etc.), the desired alloy composition is achieved and current density and potential distribution remain approximately uniform in the solution in an area adjacent to the first side of the workpiece to ensure a uniform plating thickness. These predeterminations can, for example, be accomplished using a standard Laplace equation solver with modified boundary conditions, as described above, to model the voltage and current distribution in the plating bath for a given set of baffles, anodes, and cathodes.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Then, based on these predeterminations, baffles, multiple anodes (e.g., first anodes comprising the first soluble metal (e.g., nickel) and second anodes comprising the second soluble metal (e.g., cobalt) are formed in overlapping layers in the container adjacent to a one or more of the container walls (<b>912</b>). For example, depending upon the space available in the take, the desired alloy composition and on the required relative surface areas, all anodes in the same layer can comprise the same soluble metal with the metal type varying from layer to layer (e.g., as illustrated in embodiment <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, described above) or anodes comprising different soluble metals can be dispersed throughout the anode layers (e.g., as illustrated in embodiment <b>700</b>, described above). Alternatively, each layer can comprise a plurality of multi-anode structures, where each multi-anode structure comprises at least two different soluble metals (e.g., as illustrated in embodiment <b>800</b>, described above).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Once the anodes are formed in the plating tank at process <b>912</b>, the plating process can be performed (<b>914</b>). Specifically, each of the anodes with different types of metals can be electrically connected to the positive terminal of separate/different voltage sources (<b>916</b>). For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, first anodes <b>51</b> that comprise a first metal can be connected to a first voltage source <b>61</b>, second anodes <b>52</b> that comprise a second metal can be connected to a second voltage source <b>62</b>, etc. The workpiece <b>20</b> (i.e., the cathode) can be electrically connected to the positive terminals of these voltage sources <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> (<b>918</b>). Thus, a circuit is created. Then, voltages can be simultaneously applied from the voltage sources to the anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> causing an electrical current to pass through the solution <b>90</b> and, thereby, causing metal ions from the different metal type anodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> to take up excess electrons at the workpiece <b>20</b> such that an alloy layer of the metals is formed on the workpiece <b>20</b>. The embodiments of the method can further comprise selectively and, optionally, dynamically varying the different voltages applied to the different anodes so as to selectively vary the ratio of the first metal to the second metal in the alloy being deposited on the workpiece (<b>920</b>). Additionally, the embodiments of the method can further comprise fine tuning the current density and potential distribution in the solution in the area adjacent to the workpiece using selectively placed prescribed baffles (<b>922</b>). This fine tuning can be done to control the overall thickness of the uniformly deposited plating.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be understood, by those skilled in the art, that some of the modifications to the plating bath geometry described herein would also apply to pulse plating, reverse pulse plating and reverse plating processes, also known as electro-etch. It should further be understood, by those skilled in the art, that the operation of the power supplies in voltage control mode, current control mode or dual control mode apply.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Therefore, disclosed above are embodiments of an electroplating system and an associated electroplating method that allow for depositing of metal alloys with a uniform plate thickness and with the means to alter the alloy composition. Specifically, by using multiple anodes, each with different types of soluble metals, the system and method avoid the need for periodic plating bath replacement and also allow the ratio of metals within the deposited alloy to be selectively varied dynamically by applying different voltages to the different metals. The system and method further avoid the uneven current density and potential distribution and, thus, the non-uniform plating thicknesses exhibited by prior art methods by selectively varying the shape and placement of the anodes within the plating bath. Additionally, the system and method allow for fine tuning of the plating thickness by using electrically insulating selectively placed prescribed baffles.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The alloy electroplating system and method disclosed above provides several other advantages. Specifically, it enables a path to selectively define the anode shape for any typical product surface shape and to accommodate prescribed non-constant compositions and/or thicknesses as well as specialized plated alloy finishes. It can be used in packaging and silicon chip processing and further that it is applicable to other products and/or transient processes. It reduces the costs associated with alloy plating by reducing the required rate at which the plating bath must be disposed of and replaced. Finally, it improves the quality of the alloy plating with time by reducing the use of organics, such as stress reducers, as the metals level increase in the plating bath prior to dumping. These organics eventually build up in the bath and effect the surface topography which can impact product performance. Furthermore, it should be noted that other current density control methods applicable to this disclosure and using the described novel anode arrangement include synchronous and asynchronous pulsing current profiles, direct and reverse potential biasing, surface area ratio of anodes to reduce voltage differential, electroetching of metals, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments. It is to be understood that the phraseology or terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation. Therefore, those skilled in the art will recognize that these embodiments can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
