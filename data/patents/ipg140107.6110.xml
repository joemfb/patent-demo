<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to computer software, and deals more particularly with enabling users to focus on a selectable subset of elements represented by a rendered topology view.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The term &#x201c;topology&#x201d; is commonly used to refer to an arrangement of nodes in a computing system, as well as relationships among those nodes. A &#x201c;topology view&#x201d; is used to view this arrangement of nodes and to display their interrelationships. Users typically have the ability to interact with this view to select nodes and/or links representing the interrelationships, and to query information on a selected element (i.e., node or link). Since a topology view offers a &#x201c;top-down&#x201d; view of a system, users also typically have the capability to &#x201c;drill down&#x201d; from one level to another (e.g., to obtain more detailed information).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention addresses limitations of existing topology views.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides techniques for enabling users to select a subset of elements represented by a rendered topology view, and in response, a new view comprising the selected elements is automatically created. Preferred embodiments render this subset view, referred to herein as a &#x201c;tear-away view&#x201d;, alongside the topology view from which the elements were selected, thereby enabling the user to focus on the selected elements in context of the bigger picture. An active correlation is preferably maintained between the views, such that various updates to one view are also reflected in the other view. Preferred embodiments automatically create a new data model underlying the tear-away view, and in one aspect, this data model and/or tear-away view may be persisted.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention provides techniques that enable users to build what are referred to herein as &#x201c;tear-away&#x201d; topology views and to interact with those views. A tear-away topology view comprises a subset of elements from a main topology view. Preferred embodiments enable each individual user (such as a systems administrator) to select which elements from the main topology view should be included in that user's tear-away view or views. Preferably, these tear-away views are interactive views where actions performed on a tear-away view can be correlated to the main topology view; various actions performed on the main topology view may also be reflected on corresponding elements of the tear-away topology view. In one aspect, the tear-away topologies may be persisted or exported.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Drawbacks of prior art topology views will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a sample topology view <b>100</b> of the prior art. As can be seen by inspection, this view <b>100</b> represents a large number of nodes and relationships. In the figures herein, nodes are depicted as square icons and relationships are shown as lines or links between those icons (although this is by way of illustration and not of limitation).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the number of nodes and links displayed within a topology view exceeds a relatively small number, a user's ability to discern useful information from the view is reduced. In fact, the number of nodes and links in a topology view may become overwhelming. This is illustrated by the sample view <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where nodes and links for two networks <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> are depicted; in actual practice, a topology view of this type might contain even more nodes and links.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a sample &#x201c;zoomed-in&#x201d; or &#x201c;zoomed&#x201d; view <b>200</b> of a topology according to the prior art. (The view <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be referred to as a &#x201c;zoomed-out&#x201d; view, by contrast.) A topology view may allow the user to zoom in to better focus his or her attention on a subset of the overall topology. In this representative zoomed-in view <b>200</b>, the nodes are no longer shown as square icons. Instead, this sample zoomed-in view <b>200</b> provides computer-styled icons to represent nodes. Reference number <b>210</b> generally indicates sample network addresses which are rendered for several of the nodes. In actual practice, network addresses (or other node-specific characteristics) are often depicted alongside every one of the nodes in a zoomed-in view of this type. However, for ease of illustration, network addresses have been omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for the remaining nodes in the sample view <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As illustrated by the sample view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the sample zoomed view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (and in particular, the portion thereof where sample network addresses have been provided), the user's ability to view a distinct set of nodes or to work with a distinct set of nodes (e.g., by clicking on the node's icon or its links, thereby requesting more information) may become futile as the system grows beyond a relatively small size. To deal with this situation using prior art techniques, the user may be forced to hide a series of nodes within a view&#x2014;for example, by individually identifying nodes to be suppressed from the view or by use of a software filter that omits node representations based on characteristics specified for the filter. Or, the user may try to isolate the nodes of interest by zooming in to a sufficiently-small section of the view, and then trying to ignore all other extraneous data. These approaches have a number of drawbacks, including an inability to maintain an overall &#x201c;big picture&#x201d; perspective, decreased user productivity, user confusion, and resulting error-prone operation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">No techniques are known to the present inventor that enable &#x201c;breaking down&#x201d; a topology view into smaller views (referred to equivalently herein as tear-away views or &#x201c;sub-topology views&#x201d;), where those smaller views present a user-selectable subset of the overall topology view&#x2014;while, at the same time, allowing that user to continue viewing the entire &#x201c;big picture&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, although prior art topology views support navigation among levels (as in the drill-down approach mentioned earlier), no techniques are known to the present inventor to build or tear away a subset of the topology view that displays data of interest to this user, as determined by this user.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferred embodiments address these and other limitations of prior art topology views through user-selectable tear-away topology views. Using a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a user can select one or more elements rendered in a main topology view and then drag and drop the selected elements outside the main topology view, resulting in creation of a separate tear-away topology view. Individual users can therefore select elements within a topology view that are specific to their needs and view that selected subset, while at the same time viewing the overall topology of the entire system. Preferred embodiments also maintain active correlations, or communications, between nodes and links of the tear-away views and their counterparts in the main topology view (as discussed in more detail below). In addition, in an optional aspect, embodiments of the present invention enable users to export tear-away views and persist those as separate topology views, effectively allowing them to create their own user-specific, reusable sub-topology views of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, an example is provided of a sample tear-away topology view that might be created by a user of an embodiment of the present invention. One manner in which a user may create this tear-away topology view will now be described. A boundary <b>330</b> is visually depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> as a dashed rectangle (by way of example only) that surrounds a topology view <b>340</b> (comprising, in this example, a view of a first network <b>320</b> and a second network <b>321</b>). From this rendered topology view, a user selects one or more nodes and/or links&#x2014;for example, by positioning a pointing cursor over the rendering thereof and then depressing a selection mechanism such as the left mouse button. Then, the user continues to depress the selection mechanism while dragging the pointing cursor (or similar indicator) to a point outside the boundary area of the main topology view. The user then releases the pointing cursor, and in response, a new tear-away view (see reference number <b>310</b>) is created, containing the selected nodes and/or links. Preferably, this tear-away view is rendered within the same view or window as the main topology view, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> by reference numbers <b>310</b>, <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one approach, an implementation of the present invention allows the user to select nodes and links separately. In an alternative approach, selection of nodes may be used as a signal to automatically select links that reach those nodes. In yet another alternative approach, selection of nodes may signal that links should be automatically selected only if they connect selected nodes. An implementation of the present invention may support one or more of these approaches (and optionally, users may be allowed to selectively choose among the approaches when more than one is available, for example by setting a configuration option or by activating a dynamic selection means on a graphical display).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the tear-away topology view <b>310</b> shows that the user has selected a relatively small subset of the nodes/links from main topology view <b>340</b>. In practice, the interests of the particular user will determine how many nodes/links, and which ones, are selected. As one example, the user might select nodes surrounding a node or link that has been visually distinguished in the main topology view as experiencing performance problems. Note that the sample tear-away topology view <b>310</b> includes two &#x201c;caution&#x201d; or &#x201c;warning&#x201d; symbols <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>. While it is difficult to view warning symbols or other problem indicators in the crowded topology view <b>340</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> provides an &#x201c;exploded&#x201d; view <b>360</b> of a portion of detail from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, where that portion has been surrounded by a rectangle <b>350</b>. As can be seen in exploded view <b>360</b>, two warning indicators are present in this portion of the main topology view. The user has therefore selected a subset of the surrounding elements for rendering in tear-away topology view <b>310</b>, allowing the user to focus on those selected elements.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> also illustrate an optional enhancement, whereby the rendering within main topology view <b>340</b> of the nodes that have been selected and used for creating the tear-away topology view <b>310</b> is visually distinct from the non-selected nodes. This can best be seen in the exploded portion <b>360</b>, where the 6 selected nodes are depicted as hollow icons instead of the solid icons used for the remainder of the nodes. (See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where these same 6 nodes have not yet been selected in the main topology view <b>100</b> and have therefore not been visually distinguished.)</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferred embodiments maintain active correlations between the tear-away topology view and the main topology view, as noted earlier. For example, selecting an element in a tear-away view preferably causes a corresponding selection of that item within the main topology view (thereby allowing the user to see how the views are related). Similarly, various actions performed against an element in one of the topology views may be reflected in the rendering of the corresponding element in the other topology view. For example, if the user selects a link in the tear-away view and requests that the link be disabled, or selects a particular device and then requests stopping or starting that device, the rendering of that link or device may change in the tear-away topology view. Thus, the main topology view is preferably revised, as necessary, such that it remains aligned with that element's rendering in the tear-away view. As another example, if the user rearranges nodes in the tear-away topology view, the corresponding depictions in the main topology view are preferably rearranged in an analogous manner. As yet another example, communication between the views may be triggered responsive to events that impact a view. Suppose a node in a network fails, thereby causing its visual representation in the main topology view to be changed to a red icon. If the failing node is also present in a tear-away topology view, this node-failure information may be communicated to the tear-away topology view, causing the node to also be visually flagged in that view.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The correlation between views may be disabled, at least for some actions, thereby enabling various actions that are performed against a view to be applied independently to one view or the other (and the disabling may optionally be user-selectable). As an example, the user may select to filter the tear-away view to show only nodes with a particular status, such as having an icon color of yellow (which may indicate a warning or caution status), without affecting the main topology view. In this manner, the user can view a subset of the data according to specific criteria while, at the same time, actively monitoring the larger main topology view. As another example, the user might select to temporarily disable the correlation to manipulate selected ones of the nodes in the tear-away topology view, and then restore the correlation to allow the result to be reflected in the main topology view. Provision may be made for disabling the correlation as to all elements of the tear-away topology view, or alternatively, for selected ones of those elements.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another aspect, creating a tear-away topology preferably automatically generates a corresponding data model that contains the selected nodes/links. This data model remembers which elements are to be included, along with the interrelationships. The model also preferably remembers the visual alignment of those elements, such that the same alignment will be used when the tear-away topology is reused (e.g., if the user requests to re-display a previously-defined tear-away topology view). The model preferably associates a user-selected name or identifier with the particular tear-away topology view. (This data model is also preferably used when correlating actions between the tear-away topology view and the main topology view.)</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an optional aspect, the data model can be leveraged to enable users to export or persist the tear-away topology view(s) they have created. Users may build one or more tear-away topology views, based on their business needs or other criteria, in order to establish views for specific functions. An example is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, where the user has selected a subset of the elements from main topology view <b>420</b> for rendering in tear-away topology view <b>410</b>. In this example, the user has further zoomed in on the tear-away topology view, enabling certain details of each node to be rendered. Note that in this example, the zooming action on view <b>410</b> is not correlated to view <b>420</b>, and view <b>420</b> therefore remains in its original non-zoomed state. Suppose the elements in this sample tear-away topology view <b>410</b> are nodes that are used when performing a nightly build operation. The systems administrator may therefore wish to view operations of those nodes each night. By persisting the tear-away topology view <b>410</b>, the administrator can quickly and efficiently request the detailed and focused view of the nodes of interest, without having to search for and select those nodes from the main topology view each night.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the prior art, creation of a new topology view typically involves accessing a database (or a plurality of databases) to obtain information to be used in the rendering. Execution of complex algorithms may also be required to build the topology view. By contrast, embodiments of the present invention provide for rapid development of new views, as has been demonstrated with reference to the sample tear-away topology views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, embodiments of the present invention may optionally allow a user to reuse persisted tear-away topology views as a basis for defining new tear-away topology views. For example, suppose the user has persisted the tear-away topology view shown at <b>410</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and now wishes to view and interact with some subset of those elements. The view <b>410</b> may be rendered, and the user may then remove selected ones of the elements from that view, creating a new data model (preferably with a new identifier).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the prior art, it is common for access permissions to be set on a per-resource basis. For example, access to information about individual nodes or links may be restricted to designated users or user groups. When a user wishes to interact with resources from a topology view of the type depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this type of one-at-a-time access control can be problematic. Embodiments of the present invention may be used to provide more efficient, easier-to-use access controls. Upon defining the collection of resources for a particular tear-away topology view, access control information may be established in terms of that view (and the data model associated with the tear-away topology view may be augmented with access-control information), thereby enabling a user to access the entire collection of resources with one access verification.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a flowchart is depicted which illustrates logic that may be used when implementing preferred embodiments of the present invention, as will now be described. Beginning at Block <b>500</b>, a main topology view is rendered, preferably using prior art techniques. (As an example, a prior art product known as &#x201c;ILOG&#xae; Jviews&#x201d; provides a graphics toolkit having components with which various types of graphs and charts, including topology charts, can be created. &#x201c;ILOG&#x201d; is a registered trademark of ILOG Corporation France in the United States, other countries, or both, and information about Jviews may be found on the corporate Web site.)</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">From this rendered topology view, the user selects one or more elements (Block <b>510</b>). Preferably, prior art selection techniques are leveraged, including the ability to select multiple elements (e.g., by depressing the &#x201c;Control&#x201d; or &#x201c;Shift&#x201d; key on a keyboard and then depressing the left mouse button over icons associated with each element of interest). Once the elements of interest have been selected, the user drags those elements across a boundary (Block <b>520</b>). A visual boundary is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>4</b>, as a dashed rectangle. Other approaches to defining a boundary may be used without deviating from the scope of the present invention. As one example, an invisible boundary may be used, and audio means may be activated to signal the user that the boundary has been crossed. As another example, the boundary may be defined as the outermost perimeter of elements in the rendered topology view, such that dragging elements beyond this perimeter indicates that the boundary has been crossed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the user drops the selected elements outside the boundary (Block <b>530</b>), preferred embodiments interpret this as an indication that a tear-away topology view is to be created using those elements. Block <b>540</b> therefore accesses the topology model of the main topology view, and this topology model is searched (Block <b>550</b>) for each of the selected elements. Upon locating the model information for each element, a new model is created (Block <b>560</b>) and populated (Block <b>570</b>) using that information. As indicated in Block <b>580</b>, this new model is then used for the tear-away view.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be noted that techniques other than drag-and-drop may be used for positioning the selected elements outside the main topology view, thereby indicating that a tear-away topology is to be created, without deviating from the scope of the present invention. As one example, the user may touch a light pen to a rendering to indicate a group of elements, and may then activate a graphical user interface control, such as a graphical button, which is operably associated with a &#x201c;create new tear-away topology&#x201d; function.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A user may optionally create more than one tear-away view from a particular main topology view. Embodiments of the present invention may choose to render these multiple tear-away views separately (using, for example, views as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4</figref> to render two different tear-away topology views). Or, alternatively, multiple tear-away topology views may be rendered within a single overall view, using (for example) a tiled or cascaded approach.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferred embodiments have been illustrated herein with reference to topology views depicting components of a computing network. This is by way of illustration and not of limitation. Embodiments of the present invention may be used advantageously in other scenarios, including (but not limited to) a topology view of internal components of a device or elements comprising other complex systems.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As has been demonstrated, the present invention provides advantageous techniques that address a number of drawbacks of the prior art. Benefits include (but are not limited to) users' ability to focus on specific elements or areas within a topology view; users' ability to create sub-topology views while, at the same time, maintaining a big-picture view of the overall topology; intuitive techniques such as drag-and-drop for creating tear-away views; and an ability to correlate actions between views.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, embodiments of the present invention may be provided as methods, systems, or computer program products comprising computer-readable program code. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment, or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects. The computer program products maybe embodied on one or more computer-usable storage media (including, but not limited to, disk storage, CD-ROM, optical storage, and so forth) having computer-readable program code embodied therein.</p>

<claim-text>detecting a selection of a plurality of the rendered elements;</claim-text>
<claim-text>detecting a dragging of the selected elements across a defined tear-away topology boundary, the tear-away topology boundary defined to signal that elements dragged across the boundary are to be used, when dropped, for creating a second topology view in association with the first topology view;</claim-text>
<claim-text>creating, responsive to detecting a drop of the dragged elements after detecting the signal that the elements were dragged across the defined tear-away topology boundary, the second topology view in association with the first topology view, wherein:
<claim-text>the second topology view comprises a copy of the selected elements;</claim-text>
<claim-text>the copy maintains spatial positioning of, and relationships among, the selected elements as rendered in the first topology view; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>providing a correlation between the selected elements in the first topology view and the copy of the selected elements in the second topology view, such that when the correlation is active, an update to the copy of the selected elements in the second topology view automatically causes a corresponding update to the selected elements in the first topology view and an update to the selected elements in the first topology view automatically causes a corresponding update to the copy of the selected elements in the second topology view;</claim-text>
</claim-text>
<claim-text>rendering the second topology view; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>using the correlation to manage updating in the second topology view, comprising:
<claim-text>disabling the correlation for the copy of a particular one of the elements, prior to initiating an update affecting the particular element using the second rendered topology view;</claim-text>
<claim-text>restoring the correlation following the update; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>automatically revising a visual representation of the particular element in the first rendered topology view, responsive to the restoring, such that the first rendered topology view also reflects the update. </claim-text>
