<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to waveguides and in particular waveguides that reduce radiation losses due to optical scattering.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently a limitation of the performance of optical microcavities and waveguides is posed by lithographically formed roughness generated through the etch process which defines the sidewalls of waveguides and microcavities, including both microring and photonic crystal cavities. This lithographically formed roughness tends to scatter the light out of the guided optical modes generating optical losses that may be detrimental to the performance of the optical waveguides and cavities. While lithographic roughness can be improved somewhat by using highly controlled lithographic processes there is often no practical way to achieve the low loss level that is desirable for certain highly desirable applications in the context of integrated photonics.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is embodied in a waveguide system including a first waveguide having surface roughness along at least one surface and a second waveguide substantially identical to the first waveguide and having substantially identical surface roughness along a corresponding surface. The first and second waveguides are separated from each other by a predetermined distance and are configured to receive respective first and second light signals having antisymmetric modes. The predetermined distance between the first and second waveguide tends to cause cancellation of at least far-field polarization radiation emanating from the first and second waveguides and resulting from the surface roughness.</p>

Barwicz et al. entitled &#x201c;Three Dimensional Analysis of Scattering Losses Due to Sidewall Roughness and Microphotonic Waveguides,&#x201d; IEEE J. of Lightwave Tech. vol. 23. no. 9, pp 2719-2732 (2005). The drawing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> exhibits roughness as illustrated by the vertical ridges <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> along the sides of the waveguide. This roughness is typically caused by unevenness in the mask that is used to form the waveguide. The ridges shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are exaggerated to aid in the description of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the above-referenced article by Barwicz et al., the waveguide <b>100</b> is decomposed into a smooth waveguide <b>202</b> and the ridges <b>204</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The smooth waveguide does not contribute to the scattering loss radiation and so is ignored in the analysis. Barwicz et al. modeled each of the ridges as a dipole antenna <b>206</b> which, combined with the roughness function F<sub>rough </sub><b>208</b>, models the radiation field exhibited by the edges <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross section of the waveguide <b>100</b> along the line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The waveguide includes the central portion <b>202</b> and two ridges <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>. As described in the Barwicz article, each ridge <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> acts a dipole antenna generating a polarization current at the boundary. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross sectional diagram illustrating the polarization radiation pattern <b>402</b>.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The embodiments of the invention described below cancel this radiation by forming each waveguide as a system of two or more parallel waveguides in which light propagates through the multiple waveguides in an anti-symmetric super mode. In the examples described below, each waveguide includes at least a lower waveguide and an upper waveguide separated by a cladding material. Light is coupled into the waveguide system such that it propagates through the waveguide in an anti-symmetric mode. In one example embodiment, light propagating through the lower waveguide is primarily in the transverse magnetic (TM) mode while light propagating through the upper waveguide is primarily in the transverse electric (TE) mode. As described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the effect of this construction is essentially to cancel the radiation fields generated by the polarization currents of the two waveguides, greatly reducing polarization radiation emitted by the waveguides, at least in the far field.</p>

In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, layers of material having respective high and low indices of refraction are formed on top of a substrate. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, <b>602</b> is a silicon substrate and layers <b>604</b>, <b>608</b> and <b>612</b> are formed of silicon dioxide SiO<sub>2</sub>. The substrate <b>602</b> and the intervening layers <b>606</b> and <b>610</b> are formed of silicon. In this example embodiment, silicon layers <b>610</b> and <b>606</b> are waveguides covered on top and bottom by cladding layers <b>604</b>, <b>608</b> and <b>612</b>. These layers have a lower index of refraction than the waveguide layers <b>606</b> and <b>610</b>. The device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> except that the device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> includes two additional high-index layers, <b>616</b> and <b>620</b> and two additional low-index layers <b>618</b> and <b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The described materials are exemplary. The waveguide system may be formed from other materials commonly used to form semiconductor waveguides, for example, alternating layers of indium phosphide (InP) and Indium Gallium Arsenide phosphide (InGaAsP). Alternatively, multiple layers of deposited amorphous materials such Silicon Nitride, or Bismuth Oxide may be used to form the waveguide system. In addition, dual or multiple layers of crystalline silicon can be used as the core material with a silica cladding formed through use of double or multiple layer silicon on insulator materials (SOI).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The item <b>614</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> is a photo resist mask pattern that is used to form the waveguide in the compound structure. In a typical fabrication process, an etchent may be applied to the semiconductor wafer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to selectively remove portions of the semiconductor wafer that are not covered by the mask <b>614</b>. This removal operation may be down to stop etch layer (not shown) formed between the layers <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. During the etching process, unevenness along the edges of the mask may cause vertical ridges, such as the ridges <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, on the side surfaces of the waveguide. Alternatively, the pattern may be transferred to a third material, such as nickel which acts as a robust hard-mask during the lithography process. An example process for forming waveguide systems using such a third material is described in an article by T.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> show the devices after the etching operation and after the photo resist <b>614</b> has been removed. The example devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> each includes layers <b>604</b>&#x2032;, <b>608</b>&#x2032; and <b>612</b>&#x2032; having a relatively low index of refraction and layers <b>606</b>&#x2032; and <b>610</b>&#x2032; having a relatively high index of refraction. The device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> includes the additional high-index layers <b>616</b>&#x2032; and <b>620</b>&#x2032; as well as the additional low-index layers <b>618</b>&#x2032; and <b>620</b>&#x2032;. The sides of the waveguide layers are subject to the ambient atmosphere which also has a lower index of refraction than the silicon layers <b>606</b>&#x2032; and <b>610</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The difference between the index of refraction of the layers <b>606</b>&#x2032; and <b>610</b>&#x2032; on the one hand and the index of refraction of the layers <b>604</b>&#x2032;, <b>608</b>&#x2032; and <b>612</b>&#x2032; and the surrounding atmosphere on the other hand, causes light to propagate through layers <b>606</b>&#x2032; and <b>610</b>&#x2032; in a mode that depends on the spacing between layers <b>606</b>&#x2032; and <b>610</b>&#x2032; (i.e., the thickness of layer <b>608</b>&#x2032;). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, light may propagate through the two waveguides <b>606</b>&#x2032; and <b>610</b>&#x2032; in a symmetric mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) or in an anti-symmetric mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Because the roughness on both waveguides <b>606</b>&#x2032; and <b>610</b>&#x2032; is substantially identical, as it results from the etch process that defines both waveguides, the roughness produced dipole moments may be identical and perfectly in phase in the case of symmetric mode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or identical and 180&#xb0; out phase in the case of the anti-symmetric mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. This feature of the waveguide system may be used to effectively cancel the scattering induced radiation emanating from the waveguide, at least in the far field.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows two waveguides <b>1002</b> and <b>1006</b> separated by an intervening cladding layer <b>1004</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> each of the waveguides <b>1002</b> and <b>1006</b> has a depth d and width w. The two waveguides <b>1002</b> and <b>1006</b> are separated by the cladding layer having a depth g and a width w. The plus sign on the waveguide <b>1002</b> and the minus sign on the waveguide <b>1006</b> indicate that the compound waveguide is operating in the anti-symmetric mode. In this mode the dipoles <b>1010</b> on the waveguide <b>1002</b> and the dipoles <b>1012</b> on the waveguide <b>1006</b> exhibit radiation patterns that are 180&#xb0; out of phase and tend to cancel each other. The inventors have determined that with proper spacing of the waveguides <b>1002</b> and <b>1006</b> and proper sizing of each of the waveguides <b>1002</b> and <b>1006</b> at least the far field polarization radiation exhibited by the waveguide and caused by the roughness of the sides of the waveguide may be essentially cancelled.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The separation of the waveguides <b>1002</b> and <b>1006</b> depends on the wavelength of the light being transmitted through the waveguides. Coherent interference between the radiation patterns of the waveguides <b>1002</b> and <b>1006</b> have some impact on the radiation losses regardless of the separation. However, the largest effect is anticipated where the dipole moment of the scattering system (consisting of the roughness from multiple waveguides) cancels, or is near cancellation. When the dipole moment cancels, or nearly cancels, only the quadripole and higher order multipole moments remain. These moments tend to have much poorer radiation efficiency, and therefore yield lower propagation losses. Broadband cancellation of the of the dipole moment most often occurs when the waveguide separation is smaller than an optical wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, however, the structure of the two waveguides in the anti-symmetric mode may not be identical to that of a single waveguide or to the structure waveguides operating in the symmetric mode. This is because the waveguides operating in the anti-symmetric mode may have a lower effective index of refraction and, thus, less confinement of the optical beam than either a single waveguide or a waveguide system operating in the symmetric mode. For a linear waveguide, this effect may be compensated by forming thicker waveguides. Adaptations for specific embodiments on the invention are described below with references to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a graph of effective refractive index versus waveguide separation which shows that the compound waveguide mode (or super mode) produced by the dual waveguide structure result in a splitting of the effective refractive index of the waveguide system. Each waveguide has a different level of confinement within the high index region of the waveguide system. The symmetric mode has a large field energy between the waveguides while the anti-symmetric mode has a field null yielding weaker modal confinement. As described above, in order to cancel the roughness induced scattering it is desirable to use the anti-symmetric mode. It is noted that the use of the anti-symmetric mode is one example of such a system employing a super mode. Alternatively any multilayer structure such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, having alternating different propagation modes defining more than two waveguide layers can also yield canceling anti-phase radiation in the far field.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An example embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>. As shown in these Figs., an input waveguide <b>1202</b> couples light into a mode converter <b>1204</b> which produces light having an anti-symmetric propagation mode in parallel waveguides <b>1206</b> and <b>1208</b>. In the example, this light is evanescently coupled to a microring resonator optical filter formed by microring resonators <b>1210</b> and <b>1212</b>. Light at the resonant frequency of the microring resonators <b>1210</b> and <b>1212</b> is then coupled, also by evanescent coupling, into output waveguides <b>1214</b> and <b>1216</b>. As described above, the operation of the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> may be significantly improved over that of a single layer device, because the roughness induced polarization radiation in the paired waveguides <b>1206</b>, <b>1208</b>; <b>1210</b>, <b>1212</b>; and <b>1214</b>, <b>1216</b> is essentially cancelled due to the anti-symmetric super mode propagation of light through the waveguides.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, input waveguide <b>1302</b> provides light to parallel ring resonators <b>1304</b> and <b>1306</b>. By properly spacing the waveguides <b>1304</b> and <b>1306</b> relative to the waveguide <b>1302</b> light propagating in the waveguide <b>1306</b> may be in different, antisymmetric modes. Light from the two rings <b>1306</b> and <b>1304</b> may, in turn, be coupled into the linear waveguides <b>1310</b> and <b>1308</b> respectively via evanescent coupling. The waveguides <b>1308</b> and <b>1310</b> form the output of the mode converter <b>1300</b>. In order to perform as a mode converter, the converter is designed to have a particular spacing between the two ring resonators <b>1304</b> and <b>1306</b> and a particular vertical position of the input waveguide <b>1302</b> relative to the ring resonators <b>1304</b> and <b>1306</b>.

Apertures are omitted from a portion of the matrix <b>1502</b> to create a cavity, and from a portion <b>1506</b> to create a waveguide. These omitted apertures give the device its characteristic as a drop filter. As described above, roughness along the edges of the apertures <b>1504</b> may result in unwanted polarization radiation which tends to reduce the efficiency of the device by reducing the optical power of the signals that may be transmitted through the device. A photonic crystal cavity device according to the an embodiment of the subject invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. As shown, parallel photonic crystal devices are separated by a distance suitable to produce a canceling effect for any radiation dipoles caused by roughness in the apertures <b>1604</b>.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The essential optical characteristics that change in going from the single layer device to a multilayer device are the vertical mode confinement and vertical mode profile. The vertical mode profile impacts the propagation constant and the lateral mode confinement. Thus, in order to recover identical external coupling to the microcavity while reducing the roughness induce scattering losses, the layer thickness hole radius and hole spacing may need to change. In particular it may be desirable to increase the layer thickness to achieve the same modal confinement in order to achieve strong Bragg reflection within the photonic lattice. Furthermore because vertical mode confinement is closely linked to the effective index of refraction and the lateral confinement, it may be desirable to make a small adjustment of the design of the device to ensure proper coupling between photonic crystal cavity and photonic crystal waveguide. For a particular device, such an adjustment may be achieved in a straight forward manner using finite time domain and finite element modeling techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a microring resonator device that may be used an add or drop filter as is well known. In a single layer device, light propagating through an input waveguide <b>1702</b> resonates in a microring resonator <b>1704</b> and is provided to in an output waveguide <b>1706</b>. This structure may be used to remove (i.e., drop) a wavelength band from the input waveguide <b>1702</b> or to add the wavelength band to the output waveguide <b>1706</b>. As described above, one or more additional microring resonators may be included in the device.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a similar device implemented in the two layer structure as described above. In this device optical energy propagates through input waveguides <b>1802</b> and <b>1804</b> in an anti-symmetric super mode and is coupled to parallel microring resonators <b>1806</b> and <b>1808</b> also in the super mode. Finally the optical energy from the resonators <b>1806</b> and <b>1808</b> is coupled to the output waveguides <b>1810</b> and <b>1812</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To adapt the microring design from a single layer to a dual layer system employing the anti-symmetric super mode, it may be desirable to increase the layer thickness to achieve the same modal confinement that is desirable to implement tight bends within the microring. In addition because the vertical mode confinement is closely linked to the effective index of refraction and the lateral confinement, it may be desirable to implement a small correction in the ring bus coupling gap and the waveguide width. For a particular device, this modification can be achieved in a straightforward manner using finite time domain and finite element modeling techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">While two embodiments of the invention, a microring resonator device and a photonic crystal cavity device have been described, the subject invention has much broader application and may be used in any optical device having waveguides that are subject to unwanted polarization radiation due to roughness along the waveguide surfaces. To reduce this radiation, the device may be formed as two substantially identical vertically parallel devices having substantially identical waveguides separated by a small distance. Input light to the device is desirably mode-converted to propagate through the vertically parallel devices in an antisymmetric super mode. It may also be desirable to mode convert the light at the output of the device to provide an output signal having, for example, both TE and TM modes.</p>
