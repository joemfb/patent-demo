<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/472,397, filed Apr. 6, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates generally to the field of roof structures and related methods. More specifically, the invention relates to the field of insulating metal roofing structures.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Roof insulation has been used in metal building arrangements. A typical roof insulation configuration uses blanket insulation. The thermal resistance offered by the insulation is compromised when it is compressed or packed down. In conventional metal roof insulation systems, when the roof structure is applied to the tops of the roof purlins, the thick layer of blanket insulation is compressed, thus reducing the thermal resistance of the roof insulation system. In some areas of the conventional roof system, the compression of the insulation is so severe that a thermal short is created, thus substantially degrading the insulation properties of the roof insulation system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, the present disclosure provides a thermal block for a metal roof, the thermal block comprising a first end, a second end, and a first leg between the first and second ends. The first end includes slots for receiving clip legs of a first roof clip. The second end includes an abutment surface and a landing surface for receiving a next thermal block in a series of thermal blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect, the present disclosure provides a system comprising a blanket of insulation laid over at least one purlin. A series of thermal blocks are fastened above the purlin over the blanket of insulation. Each thermal block in the series of thermal blocks has legs that pin the blanket of insulation to a top of each purlin. Gaps are defined between the legs, the gaps enabling regions between the legs wherein the blanket of insulation is only partially compressed between the purlin and an underside of each thermal block.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of providing insulation in a metal roof, the method comprising: laying a blanket of insulation over at least one purlin; fastening a series of thermal blocks above the purlin over the blanket of insulation, each thermal block in the series of thermal blocks having legs that pin the blanket of insulation to a top of each purlin; and forming gaps between the legs, the gaps enabling regions between the legs such that the blanket of insulation is only partially compressed between the purlin and an underside of each thermal block.</p>

Although only three Z-purlins are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be understood that many more of these purlins in parallel relation would be included on various roof structures on a building.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In cross-section, the Z-Purlins typically have a vertical web portion <b>300</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and horizontal top flange <b>302</b> and bottom flange <b>306</b> portions. The horizontal top flange <b>302</b> has a downwardly sloped front lip <b>304</b>. The bottom flange portion <b>306</b> of purlin <b>104</b> has an upwardly angled lip <b>308</b>, and the bottom <b>306</b> extends in an opposite direction than does the top flange portion <b>302</b>. Although the system can be used with different kinds of purlins (e.g., C-shaped and other varieties), the purlins <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref> are Z-shaped, and are, therefore, referred to as Z-purlins. The roof frame also includes a plurality of angle-metal cross members <b>110</b> which are installed in an offset staggered fashion through alternating opposed sets of apertures <b>111</b> in the webs <b>300</b> of the purlins <b>104</b> in a known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Initially, two opposing strips of batt insulation <b>108</b><i>a </i>and <b>108</b><i>b</i>, each having laterally extending flaps <b>107</b><i>a </i>and <b>107</b><i>b </i>on each side, are unrolled over and rest on top of the cross members <b>110</b> in the space existing between the opposing purlins. Then, extended portions <b>107</b><i>a </i>and <b>107</b><i>b </i>are draped over each on top of the upper flange <b>302</b> of the purlin as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The opposing batts of insulation <b>108</b><i>a </i>and <b>108</b><i>b </i>each run between and in the direction of the purlins <b>104</b> as shown in the figures. Insulation <b>108</b>, in embodiments, is a fiberglass insulation (often marketed in rolls) which is commonly used to insulate floors, walls and ceilings. This insulation typically comes with a vapor barrier sheet already installed on the underside of the roll. The laterally extending flaps are a deviation from the norm, but are a feature easily included by the manufacturer. Although most commonly made of fiberglass, insulation <b>108</b> could also be constructed of other insulating materials.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When these strips of insulation <b>108</b> are unrolled in place between the purlins, the insulation is not compacted in any way, allowing it to maintain full thermodynamic properties. And this freedom from encumbrance will be maintained in the final product.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Once the insulation strips <b>108</b> have been unrolled in the space between the purlins, and the flaps <b>107</b><i>a </i>and <b>107</b><i>b </i>have been draped over the purlin upper flange, a blanket of insulation <b>112</b> is laid into place over the purlins (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). This insulation, in embodiments, is constructed of fiberglass, but could be made from any number of materials depending on the application. This blanket <b>112</b> is held down by the bridging blocks <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Each series of bridging blocks <b>114</b> is installed such that it runs longitudinally along the upper portions <b>302</b> of each Z-purlin <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The bridging blocks have a number of features, the details of which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-E</figref> in which a single block is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, each bridging block <b>114</b> includes an intermediate leg <b>116</b> and a joint supporting leg <b>118</b>. A first end <b>200</b> of each block includes two clip-leg-receiving notched out vertical slots <b>208</b>. These slots <b>208</b> can be seen most clearly in the end view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>) of the first end <b>200</b>, and in the Section <b>2</b>E-<b>2</b>E shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>. These slots <b>208</b> are designed to receive legs <b>314</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) at each of the joints <b>130</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to avoid clip/block interference.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A second end <b>202</b> of each bridging block (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C) includes a landing surface <b>204</b> as well as an abutment surface <b>206</b> for receiving the corresponding first end <b>200</b> of the next block in the series. But before the first end <b>200</b> for the next block in the series is received, an L-bracket <b>122</b> is installed. A short portion <b>212</b> of the L-bracket <b>122</b> is sized to fit the abutment surface <b>206</b>, and the longer portion <b>210</b> of the L-bracket <b>122</b> is sized to match the landing surface <b>204</b>. These end configurations, along with the clips <b>120</b> and L-brackets <b>122</b> enable the installation of a series of continuous blocks in series one after the other, and each block <b>114</b>, in the disclosed embodiment, is identical. Alternatively, these blocks could have different configurations for different embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first series <b>126</b> of blocks <b>114</b> have already been installed, whereas a second series <b>128</b> of bridging blocks <b>114</b> are in the process of being installed. The blocks <b>114</b> in series <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> come together at joints <b>130</b>. The joints <b>130</b> are formed by the meeting of the second end <b>202</b> of an already installed block, e.g. block <b>132</b>, and the first end <b>202</b> of the next block, e.g., block <b>134</b>, in the series to be installed. Block <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) has already been fastened to the purlin <b>104</b>, and block <b>134</b> is shown about to be fastened at its end <b>202</b> using L-bracket <b>122</b> and clip <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The L-bracket <b>122</b>, when installed, will clamp down on the landing surface <b>204</b> at end <b>202</b> when the particular clip <b>120</b> at that joint <b>130</b> is screwed down using two fasteners <b>316</b>. One of these fasteners <b>316</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Although only one fastener of the pair <b>316</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it should be understood that two exist and that the second is simply hidden behind the first. These fasteners could be a bolt <b>315</b>/nut <b>317</b> combination as shown, or alternatively can be screws. Although a bolt arrangement is shown, screws are preferred. Prefabricated, e.g., punched or drilled, holes (not shown) can exist in the bottom of the clip <b>120</b> in one embodiment. The fasteners <b>316</b> are installed through these holes, then through predrilled or prepunched holes (not shown) made through the landing portion <b>210</b> of the L-bracket <b>122</b>, then through predrilled or prepunched holes (not shown) made through the joint support leg <b>118</b> of the block <b>114</b>, through the insulation blanket <b>112</b> and the flaps <b>107</b><i>a </i>and <b>107</b><i>b</i>, and then through predrilled or prepunched holes made into the purlin head <b>302</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In any instance, predrilling will not be required through the <b>107</b><i>a </i>and <b>107</b><i>b </i>or the blanket of insulation <b>112</b>, because both are easily pierced by the fastener <b>316</b>. Where screws are used, the predrilled or prepunched holes are optional. Additionally, where predrilled holes or prepunched are used in the purlin head <b>302</b>, they will be sized to be slightly smaller than the diameter of the screws to encourage engagement into the head <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Regardless of the fastening device used (bolt or screw), the fastening causes the L-bracket <b>122</b> to clamp down on the landing area <b>204</b> of block <b>134</b>, and not only is second end <b>202</b> of block <b>134</b> held down, but the first end of that same block <b>134</b> is thus caused to rest into its joint with the already installed block <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Now that the second end <b>202</b> of block <b>134</b> has been secured by the clip and L-bracket installed there, the clip legs <b>208</b> and seam flanges <b>310</b> will stick up and are exposed. Then, in order to install the next block <b>136</b>, the slots <b>208</b> of its first end <b>200</b> are matched up with and consume the clip legs <b>314</b> of the clip already installed on the last block <b>134</b>. Then, when the clip <b>120</b> and L-bracket <b>122</b> are screwed down onto the landing area <b>204</b> of block <b>136</b>, the joint between blocks <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> is complete. It will be understood that block after block can be installed in series this way until the entire length of a purlin <b>104</b> is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the blocks in each series are secured, the flaps <b>107</b><i>a </i>and <b>107</b><i>b </i>and a small swatch of the insulation blanket <b>112</b> are pinched between the underside of each block <b>114</b> and the purlin head <b>302</b>. More specifically, the bottom surfaces <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> of each of the legs <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> on each block, respectively, directly clamp down on the blanket <b>112</b> and flaps <b>107</b><i>a </i>and <b>107</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Gaps <b>150</b> (see series <b>126</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) formed by underside surfaces <b>216</b> between the legs <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> on each bridging block, however, allow for some expansion of the insulation in that area. Thus, although somewhat restricted in volume, the insulation blanket between the block legs still has some depth, and is not completely compacted. This provides heat transfer resistance advantages. Laterally relative to each row of blocks <b>114</b>, the blanket expands upward back to its normal density and fills the area above the upper surfaces <b>350</b> of the lower insulation strips <b>108</b> to be at the same levels as the upper surfaces of the installed blocks <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, the metal roof panels <b>102</b> are installed over and transversely to the blocks. More specifically, the flanges <b>310</b> on top of the clips <b>120</b> are seamed into edges <b>124</b> and <b>125</b> of the roof panels <b>102</b> in a known manner. Although only a single roof panel is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, those skilled in the art will be aware that a plurality of roof panels will be installed such that the entire roof is covered.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Another embodiment is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref> uses the same bridging block configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-E</figref>, so detailed description of this element of the disclosed roof system has not been repeated. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a broken out portion of a roof incorporating this second embodiment is illustrated. Again, the system <b>400</b> is provided to support and insulate roof panels <b>403</b> which will be installed on top of the assembly. Again, the system rests on top of the plurality of Z-purlins <b>500</b>. Although only three Z-purlins <b>500</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it should be understood that many more of these purlins <b>500</b> in parallel relation would be included on the entire roof structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the system <b>400</b> of the second embodiment in cross-section. The Z-Purlin <b>500</b> has a vertical web portion <b>501</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and horizontal top portion <b>502</b> and a bottom portion <b>506</b>. The horizontal top portion <b>502</b> has a downwardly sloped front lip <b>504</b>. The bottom portion <b>506</b> of purlin <b>500</b> has a lip <b>508</b>, and the bottom <b>506</b> extends in an opposite direction from the direction of the top portion <b>502</b>. Although the second embodiment <b>400</b> of the system can be used with different kinds of purlins (e.g., C-shaped and other varieties), the purlin cross sections shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> are Z-shaped. As with the last embodiment, the roof frame will also include a plurality of angle-metal cross members <b>110</b> which are installed through apertures in the webs <b>501</b> in the purlins <b>500</b> in a known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Initially, a blanket of insulation <b>558</b> is laid out over the purlins <b>500</b> such that it sags down to rest atop the cross members <b>110</b>. This is different than with the first embodiment which had thin batts <b>108</b> which were unrolled and extended longitudinally between the opposing purlins <b>104</b>. Here instead, the blanket is draped over all. Insulation blanket <b>558</b>, in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, is a fiberglass insulation (often marketed in rolls) which includes a vapor barrier sheet <b>556</b> on its bottom side. Although most commonly made of fiberglass, blanket <b>558</b> could be constructed of other materials. Further, vapor-barrier sheet <b>556</b> and blanket <b>558</b> could be separate components, the blanket laid on top of the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Once blanket <b>558</b> has been laid into place over the purlins <b>500</b>, the bridging blocks <b>414</b> are installed directly on top of the upper portion <b>302</b> of each Z-purlin <b>500</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a first series <b>426</b> of blocks <b>414</b> have already been installed, whereas a second series <b>528</b> of bridging blocks <b>414</b> are in the process of being installed. The blocks <b>414</b> in series <b>426</b> and <b>528</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> come together at joints <b>430</b>. The joints <b>430</b> are formed by the meeting of the second end <b>402</b> of an already installed block, e.g. block <b>432</b>, and the first end <b>401</b> of the next block, e.g., block <b>434</b>, in the series to be installed. Block <b>432</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) has already been fastened to the purlin <b>500</b>, and block <b>434</b> is shown about to be fastened at its end <b>402</b> using L-bracket <b>422</b> and clip <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Here however, since the blanket <b>558</b> of insulation is already draped across the purlin heads, the L-brackets <b>422</b>, when installed, will clamp the leg bottoms of the bridging blocks <b>414</b> down on top of a small patch of insulation on the purlin heads.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Prefabricated/drilled holes (not shown) exist in the bottom of the clip <b>420</b> in the preferred second embodiment. A bolt <b>515</b> nut <b>517</b> combination (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), or a screw could be used to fasten. The fasteners <b>516</b> are installed through these holes, then through the larger portion of the L-bracket <b>422</b> (see, e.g., portion <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), then through the joint support leg <b>518</b> of the block <b>414</b>, and then into the purlin <b>500</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Two holes (not shown) can be predrilled or prepunched down through the landing portion (see e.g. <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the L-bracket <b>422</b>, predrilled or prepunched bores made through the leg <b>518</b> of the bridging block <b>414</b>, then through the thin layer of blanket insulation which has been compressed below the leg <b>518</b>, and then down to predrilled or prepunched holes on the purlin head <b>502</b>. With the bolt version the bolts have lengths which cause the bolt tips to drop through the leg <b>518</b>, through the insulation, and then drop underneath the purlin head <b>502</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) where the nut <b>517</b> can be screwed on. Where the fastening mechanisms <b>516</b> are self-drilling screws they will be passed down and then secured through the holes in the upper surface <b>502</b> of the Z-purlin <b>500</b> below which when screws are used, will have diameters slightly smaller than the screws selected so that they can bite. This causes the L-bracket <b>422</b> to clamp down on the landing area (e.g., see area <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) of block <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Now that the second end <b>402</b> of block <b>434</b> has been secured by the clip <b>420</b> and L-bracket <b>422</b> installed there, the clip legs <b>511</b> and seam flanges <b>510</b> will stick up and are exposed. Then, in order to install the next block <b>436</b>, the slots <b>508</b> of its first end <b>401</b> are matched up with and consume the clip legs <b>511</b> of the clip already installed on the last block <b>434</b>. Then, when the clip <b>402</b> and L-bracket <b>422</b> are screwed down onto the landing area of block <b>436</b>, the joint between blocks <b>434</b> and <b>436</b> is complete. It will be understood that block after block can be installed in series this way until the entire length of a purlin <b>500</b> is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As the blocks in each series are secured, the lower batt insulation sheet <b>558</b> and vapor barrier <b>556</b> are pinched between the underside of each block <b>414</b> and the purlin upper flange <b>502</b>. More specifically, the bottom surfaces (e.g., bottom surfaces <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of each of the legs <b>514</b> and <b>518</b> on each block, respectively, directly pinch the insulation blanket <b>558</b> to the upper surface of each purlin head <b>502</b>. In gaps <b>450</b> (see series <b>426</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) formed between the legs <b>514</b> and <b>518</b> on each block, however, the insulation, although somewhat restricted in volume, is partially puffed out. This provides heat transfer resistance advantages. The upper surface of the insulation <b>550</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), other than where it is pinched underneath the legs <b>514</b> and <b>518</b>, is substantially maintained at a level equal to the surfaces underneath the blocks <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once all of the blocks <b>414</b> have been secured, a relatively thin strip of batt insulation <b>412</b> is unrolled into the rectangular cavities formed between the opposing series of blocks, e.g., between series <b>426</b> and <b>528</b> where the insulation extends longitudinally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Board insulation could be used instead of batt insulation in embodiments. The upper insulation layer <b>412</b>, if made from board insulation, will be precut to fit the cavities. Where rolls of batt insulation are used, they are normally sized in width to fit between standard purlin spacing. There, the upper insulation layer <b>412</b> sits on top of the upper surface <b>550</b> of the lower blanket and fills the open area between the rows of blocks above the lower blanket <b>558</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Once the relatively thin strips of batt insulation <b>412</b> are laid in place, the metal roof panels <b>403</b> are installed over and transversely to the blocks <b>414</b>. More specifically, the flanges <b>510</b> on top of the clips <b>420</b> are seamed into edges <b>424</b> and <b>425</b> of the roof panels <b>403</b> in a known manner. Although only a single roof panel is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, those skilled in the art will be aware that a plurality of roof panels will be installed such that the entire roof is covered.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Many different arrangements of the various components depicted, as well as components not shown, are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Embodiments of the present invention have been described with the intent to be illustrative rather than restrictive.
