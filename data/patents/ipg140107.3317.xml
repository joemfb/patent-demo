<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A semiconductor device is improved in reliability. A switching power MOSFET and a sense MOSFET for sensing a current flowing in the power MOSFET, which is smaller in area than the power MOSFET, are formed in one semiconductor chip. The semiconductor chip is mounted over a chip mounting portion via a conductive bonding material, and sealed in a resin. Over the main surface of the semiconductor chip, a metal plate is bonded to a source pad electrode of the power MOSFET. In the plan view, the metal plate does not overlap a sense MOSFET region where the sense MOSFET is formed. The metal plate is bonded to the source pad electrode so as to surround three of the sides of the sense MOSFET region.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a result of conducting study, the present inventors have made the following findings.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A power MOSFET capable of handling high power has been used as a switch element. By packaging a semiconductor chip formed with the power MOSFET, a switch semiconductor package can be obtained. For example, by coupling the power MOSFET as the switch element between a power source and a load and performing ON/OFF switching of the power MOSFET, it is possible to switch between a state in which an output (voltage) from the power source is supplied to the load and a state in which the output from the power source is not supplied to the load.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present inventors have studied a semiconductor device manufactured by forming, in a semiconductor chip formed with the power MOSFET as the switch element, a sense MOSFET for sensing a current flowing in the power MOSFET which is smaller in area than the power MOSFET, mounting the semiconductor chip over a chip mounting portion via a conductive bonding material, and sealing them. The semiconductor device senses the current flowing in the power MOSFET by means of the sense MOSFET, and controls the power MOSFET in accordance with a current flowing in the sense MOSFET. For example, when it is determined that an excessive current is flowing in the power MOSFET based on the current flowing in the sense MOSFET, the power MOSFET is forcibly turned. OFF to protect the semiconductor device and an electronic device using the semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, when a thermal stress (such as, e.g., a thermal load during the use of the semiconductor device or a temperature cycle test) is applied to the semiconductor device, a crack or peel-off may occur in the conductive bonding material interposed between the semiconductor chip and the chip mounting portion. In the region of the conductive bonding material where a crack or peel-off has occurred, a current is unlikely to flow so that the region can hardly function as a current path. Between the current flowing in the power MOSFET and the current flowing in the sense MOSFET, a predetermined ratio exists. However, if a crack or peel-off occurs in the conductive bonding material interposed between the semiconductor chip and the chip mounting portion, the ratio varies to possibly degrade accuracy in sensing the current flowing in the power MOSFET by means of the sense MOSFET. This degrades the reliability of the semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An object of the present invention is to provide a technology which can improve the reliability of a semiconductor device.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In each of the following embodiments, if necessary for the sake of convenience, the embodiment will be described by being divided into a plurality of sections or embodiments. However, they are by no means irrelevant to each other unless particularly explicitly described otherwise, and one of the sections or embodiments is modifications, details, supplementary explanation, and so forth of part or the whole of the others. When the number and the like (including the number, numerical value, amount, range, and the like thereof) of elements are referred to in the following embodiments, they are not limited to specific numbers unless particularly explicitly described otherwise or unless they are obviously limited to specific numbers in principle. The number and the like of the elements may be not less than or not more than specific numbers. It will be appreciated that, in the following embodiments, the components thereof (including also elements, steps, and the like) are not necessarily indispensable unless particularly explicitly described otherwise or unless the components are considered to be obviously indispensable in principle. Likewise, if the shapes, positional relationships, and the like of the components and the like are referred to in the following embodiments, the shapes and the like are assumed to include those substantially proximate or similar thereto and the like unless particularly explicitly described otherwise or unless it can be considered that they obviously do not in principle. The same shall apply in regard to the foregoing numerical value and range.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Hereinbelow, the embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. Note that, throughout all the drawings for illustrating the embodiments, members having the same functions are designated by the same reference numerals, and a repeated description thereof is omitted. In the following embodiments, a description of the same or like parts will not be repeated in principle unless particularly necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the drawings used in the embodiments, hatching may be omitted even in a cross section for improved clarity of illustration, while even a plan view may be hatched for improved clarity of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the present invention, a field effect transistor is referred to as MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) or simply as MOS, but it is not intended to exclude a non-oxide film from examples of a gate insulating film. The MOSFET described above is not limited to a case where the gate insulating film is formed of an oxide film, but is assumed to include a MISFET (Metal Insulator Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) in which the gate insulating film is formed of an insulating film taken in a broad category. That is, in the present specification, the term &#x201c;MOSFET&#x201d; is used for the sake of convenience, but the MOSFET is used also as a term intended to include even a MISFET. Therefore, in the following description, a MOSFET can also be replaced with a MISFET.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A semiconductor device of an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">&#x3c;About Structure of Semiconductor Device (Semiconductor Package)&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a top view (plan view) of a semiconductor device PKG as the embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a bottom view (plan view) of the semiconductor device PKG. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref> are cross-sectional views of the semiconductor device PKG. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref> are perspective plan views (top views) of the semiconductor device PKG.

A cross section of the semiconductor device PKG at a position along the line A<b>3</b>-A<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> substantially corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A cross section of the semiconductor device PKG at a position along the line A<b>4</b>-A<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> substantially corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a perspective plan view of the top side of the semiconductor device PKG when the semiconductor device PKG is viewed through a sealing portion MR. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective plan view (top view) of the semiconductor device PKG when the semiconductor device PKG is viewed without a metal plate MPL and bonding wires BW (which are omitted) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective plan view (top view) of the semiconductor device PKG when the semiconductor device PKG is viewed without semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b> (which are omitted) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Note that, since <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref> are cross sections each passing through a sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> described later, the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> in the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the semiconductor device PKG of the present embodiment, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> formed with a power MOSFET (corresponding to a power MOSFET QH described later) as a switch field effect transistor, and the control semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> are integrated in one semiconductor package (packaged) to provide the one semiconductor device (semiconductor package) PKG.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The semiconductor device PKG of the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref> has the semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b>, die pads (chip mounting portions or tabs) DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> for mounting the respective semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b>, a plurality of leads LD each formed of a conductor, and the sealing portion MR sealing therein the foregoing members.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The sealing portion (sealing resin portion) MR is comprised of a resin material such as, e.g., a thermosetting resin material, and can also contain a filler or the like. For example, the sealing portion MR can be formed using an epoxy resin containing a filler or the like. Besides the epoxy resin, for the purpose of reducing a stress or the like, it may also be possible to use, e.g., a phenol curing agent, a biphenyl thermosetting resin to which silicone rubber, filler, or the like is added as the material of the sealing portion MR.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The sealing portion MR has an upper surface (top surface) MRa as one main surface, a lower surface (back surface or bottom surface) MRb as a main surface opposite to the upper surface MRa, and side surfaces MRc<b>1</b>, MRc<b>2</b>, MRc<b>3</b>, and MRc<b>4</b> each intersecting the upper surface MRa and the lower surface MRb. That is, the outer appearance of the sealing portion MR is in the form of a thin plate defined by the upper surface MRa, the lower surface MRb, and the side surfaces MRc<b>1</b>, MRc<b>2</b>, MRc<b>3</b>, and MRc<b>4</b>. Each of the upper surface MRa and the lower surface MRb of the sealing portion MR is formed to have, e.g., a rectangular two-dimensional shape. It is also possible to round the corners of the rectangular shape (two-dimensional rectangular shape). When the upper surface MRa and the lower surface MRb of the sealing portion MR are designed to have rectangular two-dimensional shapes, the two-dimensional shape (outer shape) of the sealing portion MR which intersects the thickness thereof is a rectangle (quadrilateral). Of the side surfaces MRc<b>1</b>, MRc<b>2</b>, MRc<b>3</b>, and MRc<b>4</b>, the side surfaces MRc<b>1</b> and MRc<b>3</b> oppose each other and the side surfaces MRc<b>2</b> and MRc<b>4</b> oppose each other, while the side surface MRc<b>1</b> and the side surfaces Mrc<b>2</b> and MRc<b>4</b> intersect each other, and the side surface MRc<b>3</b> and the side surfaces Mrc<b>2</b> and MRc<b>4</b> intersect each other.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The plurality of leads (lead portions) LD are each formed of a conductor, and preferably comprised of a metal material such as copper (Cu) or a copper alloy. Each of the plurality of leads. LD has a part thereof sealed in the sealing portion MR, and another part thereof protruding from the side surface of the sealing portion MR to the outside of the sealing portion MR. Hereinafter, the part of the lead LD located in the sealing portion MR will be referred to as an inner lead portion, and the part of the lead LD located outside the sealing portion MR will be referred to as an outer lead portion.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Note that the semiconductor device PKG of the present embodiment is a structure in which the part (outer lead portion) of each of the leads LD protrudes from the side surface of the sealing portion MR. Hereinbelow, a description will be given based on the structure, but the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, it is also possible to adopt a configuration (QFN-type configuration) in which each of the leads LD barely protrudes from the side surface of the sealing portion MR, and a part of each of the leads LD is exposed at the lower surface MRb of the sealing portion MR or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The plurality of leads LD include a plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> and a plurality of leads LD<b>2</b>. The plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> included in the plurality of leads LD are disposed on the side surface MRc<b>1</b> side of the sealing portion MR. The respective outer lead portions of the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> protrude from the side surface MRc<b>1</b> of the sealing portion MR to the outside of the sealing portion MR. On the other hand, the plurality of leads LD<b>2</b> included in the plurality of leads LD are disposed on the side surface MRc<b>3</b> side of the sealing portion MR. The respective outer lead portions of the plurality of leads LD<b>2</b> protrude from the side surface MRc<b>3</b> of the sealing portion MR to the outside of the sealing portion MR. The outer lead portion of each of the leads LD (LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b>) is bent such that the lower surface of the outer lead portion located in the vicinity of the end portion thereof is located in substantially the same plane as the lower surface MRb of the sealing portion MR. The outer lead portion of the lead LD (LD<b>1</b> or LD<b>2</b>) functions as the external coupling terminal portion (external terminal) of the semiconductor device PKG. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref>, the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> (inner lead portions thereof) disposed on the side surface MRc<b>1</b> side of the sealing portion MR are coupled to each other to be integrated in the sealing portion MR.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As can be also seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>7</b> to <b>9</b>, the die pad DP<b>1</b> and the die pad DP<b>2</b> are disposed adjacent to each other in a separated state with a predetermined interval kept therebetween such that one of the sides of the die pad DP<b>1</b> extends along one of the sides of the die pad DP<b>2</b>. The die pad DP<b>1</b> is disposed closer to the side surface MRc<b>1</b> of the sealing portion MR, while the die pad DP<b>2</b> is disposed closer to the side surface MRc<b>3</b> of the sealing portion MR. The die pad DP<b>1</b> is a chip mounting portion for mounting the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, while the die pad DP<b>2</b> is a chip mounting portion for mounting the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>. Of the semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b>, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is the larger one (having a larger two-dimensional size (area)). Accordingly, of the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b>, the die pad DP<b>1</b> for mounting the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is the larger one (having a larger two-dimensional size (area)).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The space between the die pad DP<b>1</b> and the die pad DP<b>2</b> is filled with a resin material forming the sealing portion MR. The die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> are electrically insulated from each other. Between the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b>, no lead LD is disposed. Along the side of the die pad DP<b>1</b> (side opposite to the side thereof opposing the die pad DP<b>2</b>) closer to the side surface MRc<b>1</b> of the sealing portion MR, the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> are disposed (arranged). Along the side of the die pad DP<b>2</b> (side opposite to the side thereof opposing the die pad DP<b>1</b>) closer to the side surface MRc<b>3</b> of the sealing portion MR, the plurality of leads LD<b>2</b> are disposed (arranged). That is, between the die pad DP<b>1</b> and the side surface MRc<b>1</b> of the sealing portion MR and along the side surface MRc<b>1</b> of the sealing portion MR, the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> are disposed (arranged) while, between the die pad DP<b>2</b> and the side surface MRc<b>3</b> of the sealing portion MR and along the side surface MRc<b>3</b> of the sealing portion MR, the plurality of leads LD<b>2</b> are disposed (arranged).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">At the lower surface MRb of the sealing portion MR, the respective lower surfaces (back surfaces) of the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> are exposed. On the other hand, at the upper surface MRa of the sealing portion MR, the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> are not exposed. Because the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> were coupled to a lead frame (frame body thereof) or the like when the semiconductor device PKG was manufactured, parts of the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> are exposed at the side surfaces MRc<b>2</b> and MRc<b>4</b> of the sealing portion MR.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> are each formed of a conductor, and are preferably comprised of a metal material such as copper (Cu) or a copper alloy. More preferably, the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> and the plurality of leads LD each forming the semiconductor device PKG are formed of the same material (the same metal material). This allows easy production of the lead frame to which the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> and the plurality of leads LD are coupled, and allows easy manufacturing of the semiconductor device PKG using the lead frame.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Over the upper surface (main surface) of the die pad DP<b>1</b>, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is mounted with the top surface (main surface or upper surface) thereof facing upward and with the back surface (lower surface) thereof facing the die pad DP<b>1</b>. Over the upper surface (main surface) of the die pad DP<b>2</b>, the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> is mounted with the top surface (main surface or upper surface) thereof facing upward and with the back surface (lower surface) thereof facing the die pad DP<b>2</b>. The semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> (back surface thereof) is adhesively bonded and fixed to the die pad DP<b>1</b> (upper surface thereof) via an adhesive layer (bonding material) BD<b>1</b>. The semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> (back surface thereof) is adhesively bonded and fixed to the die pad DP<b>2</b> (upper surface thereof) via an adhesive layer (bonding material) BD<b>2</b>. The semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b> are sealed in the sealing portion MR, and are not exposed from the sealing portion MR.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> has a back-side electrode BE formed over the back surface (main surface to be adhesively bonded to the die pad DP<b>1</b>) thereof. Accordingly, the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> for adhesively bonding the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> has electrical conductivity and, via the conductive adhesive layer BD<b>1</b>, the back-side electrode BE of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is bonded and fixed to the die pad DP<b>1</b>, and is also electrically coupled thereto. The back-side electrode BE of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is electrically coupled to the drain of the power MOSFET (corresponding to the power MOSFET QH described later) formed in the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>. The adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> is comprised of a conductive paste-type adhesive such as, e.g., a silver (Ag) paste, a solder, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">On the other hand, the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> does not have a back-side electrode formed over the back surface thereof. Accordingly, the adhesive layer BD<b>2</b> for adhesively bonding the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> may be either electrically conductive or insulating. If the adhesive layer BD<b>2</b> is formed of the same material as that of the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b>, the steps of assembling the semiconductor device PKG can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b> are manufactured by forming various semiconductor elements or semiconductor integrated circuits in a main surface of a semiconductor substrate (semiconductor wafer) comprised of, e.g., single-crystal silicon or the like, and then dividing the semiconductor substrate into individual semiconductor chips by dicing or the like. Each of the semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b> has a rectangular (quadrilateral) two-dimensional shape intersecting the thickness thereof. The semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> has a two-dimensional area larger than that of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>, and the following is a reason for the different two-dimensional areas. That is, the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> is formed with a control circuit for controlling the gate of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> and the like. In consideration of the size of the entire semiconductor device PKG, the outer size of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> is desired to be minimized. On the other hand, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is formed with the power MOSFET (corresponding to the power MOSFET QH described later). In the power MOSFET, an ON resistance produced in the transistor is desired to be minimized. A reduced ON resistance can be achieved by increasing a channel width per unit transistor cell area. For this reason, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is formed to have an outer size larger than that of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Over the top surface (main surface or upper surface) of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, a plurality of pad electrodes (pads, bonding pads, or terminals) PD are formed.

As for the types of the pad electrodes PD of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, they will be described later. Over the top surface (main surface or upper surface) of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>, a plurality of pad electrodes (pads, bonding pads, or terminals) PD<b>2</b> are formed.

Of the two long sides of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>, one long side opposes the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, and the other long side opposes the plurality of leads LD<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The plurality of pad electrodes PD of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> include a pad electrode (bonding pad) PDS<b>1</b> having a large area.

The side SD<b>3</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> (here, the side SD<b>3</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> opposes the foregoing side SD<b>1</b>) opposes the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b>. Note that, of the top surfaces of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, the sides SD<b>1</b> and SD<b>3</b> oppose each other, the sides SD<b>2</b> and SD<b>4</b> oppose each other, the sides SD<b>1</b> and SD<b>3</b> are parallel with each other, the sides SD<b>2</b> and SD<b>4</b> are parallel with each other, the side SD<b>1</b> is orthogonal to the sides SD<b>2</b> and SD<b>4</b>, and the side SD<b>3</b> is orthogonal to the sides SD<b>2</b> and SD<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The plurality of pads PD of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> other than the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> are electrically coupled to the plurality of pads PD<b>2</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> via the plurality of bonding wires BW each as a conductive coupling member. The plurality of leads LD<b>2</b> (inner lead portions thereof) are electrically coupled to the plurality of pad electrodes PD<b>2</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> via the plurality of bonding wires BW each as the conductive coupling member. The bonding wires BW are the conductive coupling members, and are more specifically conductive wires. Preferably, the bonding wires BW are comprised of metal thin wires such as gold (Au) wires, copper (Cu) wires, or aluminum (Al) wires. The bonding wires BW are sealed in the sealing portion MR, and are not exposed from the sealing portion MR.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A more specific description will be given below. Of the plurality of pad electrodes PD<b>2</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>, those disposed over the top surface of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> and along a side SD<b>5</b> thereof opposing the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> are electrically coupled to those of the plurality of pad electrodes PD of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> other than the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> via the bonding wires BW. Of the plurality of pad electrodes PD<b>2</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>, those disposed over the top surface of the semiconductor chip CP and along a side SD<b>6</b> thereof opposing the plurality of leads LD<b>2</b> are electrically coupled to the plurality of leads LD<b>2</b> (inner lead portions thereof) via the bonding wires BW. That is, of the both ends of each of the bonding wires BW, one end portion is coupled to the pad electrode PD<b>2</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>, and the other end portion is coupled to the pad electrode PD of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> or the inner lead portion of the lead LD<b>2</b>. Note that the spaces between the inner lead portions of the adjacent leads LD<b>2</b> and between the inner lead portions of the leads LD<b>2</b> and the die pad DP<b>2</b> are filled with the material forming the sealing portion MR.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is electrically coupled to the leads LD<b>1</b> via the metal plate MPL. That is, of the pad electrodes PD and PD<b>2</b> of the semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b>, the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> is not coupled to the bonding wire BW, but is coupled to the metal plate MPL, and the pad electrodes PD and PD<b>2</b> other than the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> are coupled to the bonding wires BW. The metal plate MPL is sealed in the sealing portion MR, and is not exposed from the sealing portion MR.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A more specific description will be given below. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref>, one end portion of the metal plate MPL is bonded to the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> via the conductive adhesive layer (bonding material) BD<b>3</b> to be electrically coupled thereto, while the other end portion of the metal plate MPL is bonded to the leads LD<b>1</b> (inner lead portions thereof) via the conductive adhesive layer (bonding material) BD<b>4</b> to be electrically coupled thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The adhesive layers (bonding materials) BD<b>3</b> and BD<b>4</b> used to bond the metal plate MPL are each required to have electrical conductivity, and a conductive paste-type adhesive material such as, e.g., a silver paste, a solder, or the like can be used. If the adhesive layers (bonding materials) BD<b>3</b> and BD<b>4</b> are each formed of the same material, the steps of assembling the semiconductor device PKG can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The metal plate MPL is formed of a metal (metal material) having a high electrical conductivity and a high thermal conductivity such as, e.g., copper (Cu), a copper (Cu) alloy, aluminum (Al), or an aluminum (Al) alloy. Preferably, the metal plate MPL is formed of copper (Cu) or a copper (Cu) alloy in terms of its excellent workability, high thermal conductivity, and relatively low price. The width of the metal plate MPL is larger (wider) than the width (diameter) of each of the bonding wires BW. Since the source pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is electrically coupled to the lead LD<b>1</b> through the metal plate MPL, compared to the case where the source pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is coupled to the lead LD<b>1</b> with a wire, the ON resistance of a power MOSFET (corresponding to the power MOSFET QH described later) formed in the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> can be reduced. This allows a reduction in package resistance and a reduction in conduction loss. Moreover, by using the metal plate MPL formed of a metal material less costly than gold instead of a wire formed of gold (Au), the cost of the semiconductor device PKG can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is also possible to provide openings OP in each metal plate MPL. The openings OP are provided to allow the state and amount of the adhesive layer BD<b>3</b> bonding the metal plate MPL to the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> to be observed through the openings OP or reduce a stress produced in each of the metal plates MPL during manufacturing steps (assembling steps) of the semiconductor device PKG.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Over the side surface MRc<b>1</b> of the sealing portion MR, the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> are disposed. The inner lead portions of the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> are integrally coupled to each other in the sealing portion MR, and the metal plate MPL is coupled (bonded) thereto via the foregoing adhesive layer BD<b>4</b>. In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref>, the five leads LD<b>1</b> are disposed over the side surface MRc<b>1</b> of the sealing portion MR. The inner lead portions of the five leads LD<b>1</b> are integrally coupled to each other in the sealing portion MR, and the metal plate MPL is coupled (bonded) thereto via the foregoing adhesive layer BD<b>4</b>. The inner lead portions of the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> are coupled to each other because each of the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> is used as a terminal electrically coupled to the source pad PDS<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, i.e., as a terminal electrically coupled to the source of the power MOSFET QH formed in the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, which will be described later. By coupling the inner lead portions of the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> to each other, the volume can be increased to be larger than in the case where the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> are separately provided. This allows a reduction in package resistance and a reduction in conduction loss. Note that the spaces between the inner lead portions of the leads LD<b>1</b> and the die pad DP<b>1</b> are filled with the material forming the sealing portion MR so that they are electrically insulated from each other. In another form, the inner lead portions of the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> can also be separately provided instead of being coupled to each other. In this case, the metal plate MPL may be coupled (bonded) appropriately to the plurality of inner lead portions (inner lead portions of the leads LD<b>1</b>) separately provided.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The respective lower surfaces (back surfaces) of the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> are exposed from the lower surface MRb of the sealing portion MR. The heat generated during the operation of the semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b> is radiated mainly from the back surfaces of the semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b> through the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> to the outside. Therefore, the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> are formed to have respective areas larger than those of the semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b> mounted thereover. This allows an improvement in heat radiation property. Of the semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b>, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> generates a larger amount of heat. Accordingly, by designing the die pad DP<b>1</b> for mounting the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> such that the two-dimensional area thereof is larger than the two-dimensional area of the die pad DP<b>2</b> for mounting the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>, it is possible to efficiently release heat generated from the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> to allow a further improvement in heat radiation property.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The following is the difference between the semiconductor device PKG of the modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and the semiconductor device PKG of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref> described above. In the semiconductor device PKG of the modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b>, the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> (inner lead portions thereof), and the plurality of leads LD<b>2</b> (inner lead portions thereof) are formed with respective openings OP<b>1</b>. Each of the openings OP<b>1</b> is filled with the material forming the sealing portion MR. By providing the openings OP<b>1</b>, the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> and the leads LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> can be made less likely to come off the sealing portion MR. When the semiconductor device PKG is manufactured, a lead frame to which the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> and the plurality of leads LD are coupled can be used and, in this case, to stably couple the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> to the frame body of the lead frame, a suspension lead TL can also be added. Of the suspension lead TL, the portions protruding from the sealing portion MR after the formation of the sealing portion MR are cut away and removed, while the suspension lead TL in the sealing portion MR remains therein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the suspension lead TL remaining in the sealing portion MR.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the upper surface of a mounting substrate (wiring substrate) PWB for mounting the semiconductor device PKG, a plurality of terminals TML are formed. To mount the semiconductor device PKG over the mounting substrate PWB, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the outer lead portions of the respective leads LD of the semiconductor device PKG are bonded to the individual terminals TML in the upper surface of the mounting substrate PWB via a conductive bonding material such as a solder SL to be electrically coupled thereto. At this time, the respective lower surfaces of the die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> exposed at the lower surface MRb of the sealing portion MR of the semiconductor device PKG are also bonded to the terminals TML in the upper surface of the mounting substrate PWB via a conductive bonding material such as the solder SL to be electrically coupled thereto. The lower surface of the die pad DP<b>2</b> having the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> mounted thereover need not be coupled to the terminal TML of the mounting substrate PWB but, in the case where the lower surface of the die pad DP<b>2</b> is coupled to the terminal TML of the mounting substrate PWB, heat generated from the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> can be released to the mounting substrate PWB via the die pad DP<b>2</b>. On the other hand, since the back-side electrode BE of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is electrically coupled to the die pad DP<b>1</b> via the foregoing conductive adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> as described above, terminals TML<b>1</b> to be coupled to the back-side electrode BE of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, which are among the plurality of terminals TML of the mounting substrate PWB, are coupled to the die pad DP<b>1</b> (lower surface thereof) exposed at the lower surface MRb of the sealing portion MR via a conductive bonding material such as the solder SL. This allows the plurality of terminals TML<b>1</b> of the mounting substrate PWB to be electrically coupled to the back-side electrode BE of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> through the die pad DP<b>1</b>. This also allows heat generated from the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> to be released to the mounting substrate PWB through the die pad DP<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Thus, in the semiconductor device PKG, the outer lead portions of the individual leads LD (LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b>) and the die pad DP<b>1</b> exposed at the lower surface MRb of the sealing portion MR are allowed to function as the external coupling terminal portions (external terminals) of the semiconductor device PKG.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">To manufacture the semiconductor device PKG of the present embodiment, it is possible to use, e.g., a method shown below.

Then, coupling is provided between the source pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> and the foregoing leads LD<b>1</b> via the foregoing metal plate MPL. Subsequently, a mold step is performed to form the foregoing sealing portion MR. Then, by cutting (disconnecting) the foregoing die pads DP<b>1</b> and DP<b>2</b> and the leads LD from the lead frame and bending the outer lead portions of the leads LD, the semiconductor device PKG can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">&#x3c;About Circuit Configuration of Semiconductor Device&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Next, a circuit configuration of the semiconductor device PKG will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a circuit diagram (circuit block diagram) of the semiconductor device PKG. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the portion enclosed by the dotted line is formed of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, the portion enclosed by the dot-dash line is formed of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>, and the portion enclosed by the two-dot dash line is formed of the semiconductor device PKG.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the semiconductor device PKG has one switch power MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) QH, a sense MOSFET QS for sensing a current flowing in the power MOSFET QH, and a control circuit CLC. The control circuit CLC is formed in the foregoing semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>. The power MOSFET QH and the sense MOSFET QS are formed in the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The control circuit CLC has a driver circuit (drive circuit) DR as a drive circuit. The driver circuit DR controls a potential at the gate terminal of the power MOSFET QH in response to a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal supplied from (a control circuit) outside the semiconductor device PKG or the like to control the operation of the power MOSFET QH. In another form, a circuit for generating the pulse width modulation (PWM) signal can also be provided in the control circuit CLC.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The output of the driver circuit DR is electrically coupled to the gate terminal of the power MOSFET QH. The driver circuit DR can be regarded as the driver circuit (drive circuit) of the power MOSFET QH.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The gate of the power MOSFET QH is coupled to the driver circuit DR. By supplying an ON signal (gate voltage for bringing the power MOSFET QH into an ON state) from the driver circuit DR to the gate of the power MOSFET QH, the power MOSFET QH can be brought into the ON state.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">When the power MOSFET QH is brought into the ON state by supplying the ON signal from the driver circuit DR to the gate of the power MOSFET QH, the voltage of a power source BT is outputted from the power MOSFET QH to a load LA. When the power MOSFET QH is brought into an OFF state by supplying an OFF signal from the driver circuit DR to the gate of the power MOSFET QH (or stopping the supply of the ON signal), the supply of the voltage from the power source BT to the load LA is stopped. Such ON/OFF control of the power MOSFET QH of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is performed by the control, circuit CLC (driver circuit DR) of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Thus, the semiconductor device PKG can function as a switch semiconductor device which performs ON/OFF switching of the application of the voltage from the power source BT to the load LA. Also, the power MOSFET QH of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> can function as a switch element (switching element). Since the output of the power MOSFET QH is supplied to the load LA, the power MOSFET QH can also be regarded as an output circuit. As the load LA, any electronic device (or electronic component) desired to be coupled to the power source BT via the switch semiconductor device PKG can be used appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> of the semiconductor device PKG, the sense MOSFET QS for current sensing is provided. The current flowing in the power MOSFET QH is sensed by the sense MOSFET QS and, in accordance with a current flowing in the sense MOSFET QS, the power MOSFET QH is controlled. For example, when it is determined (sensed) that an excessive current is flowing (a current of a value not less than a prescribed value is flowing) in the power MOSFET QH based on the current flowing in the sense MOSFET, the gate voltage of the power MOSFET QH is controlled to limit the current of the power MOSFET QH to a value of not more than the prescribed value or the power MOSFET QH is forcibly turned OFF to allow the semiconductor device PKG and an electronic device using the semiconductor device PKG to be protected.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The sense MOSFET QS has a drain and a gate which are common to those of the power MOSFET QH. That is, the drain of the power MOSFET QH and the drain of the sense MOSFET QS are electrically coupled to the foregoing back-side electrode BE of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, and therefore electrically coupled to each other. Accordingly, the foregoing back-side electrode BE of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is the drain back-side electrode of each of the power MOSFET QH and the sense MOSFET QS. The drain (common drain) of the power MOSFET QH and the sense MOSFET QS is coupled to the terminal TE<b>1</b> (the foregoing die pad DP<b>1</b> corresponds to the terminal TE<b>1</b>) such that the same potential is supplied to the drain of the sense MOSFET QS and to the drain of the power MOSFET QH. The terminal TE<b>1</b> is coupled to the power source (battery) BT disposed outside the semiconductor device PKG.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Also, the gate of the sense MOSFET QS and the gate of the power MOSFET QH are electrically coupled to each other to provide a common gate. The common gate is coupled to the driver circuit DR such that the same gate signal (gate voltage) is inputted from the driver circuit DR to the gate of the sense MOSFET QS and to the gate of the power MOSFET QH.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">On the other hand, the source of the sense MOSFET QS is not common to the source of the power MOSFET QH, and there is no short circuit between the source of the power MOSFET QH and the source of the sense MOSFET QS.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The source of the power MOSFET QH is coupled to a terminal TE<b>2</b> (the foregoing lead LD<b>1</b> corresponds to the terminal TE<b>2</b>). To the terminal TE<b>2</b>, the load LA disposed outside the semiconductor device PKG is coupled. That is, the source of the power MOSFET QH is coupled to the load LA. On the other hand, the source of the sense MOSFET QS is coupled to the control circuit CLC. Specifically, the source of the sense MOSFET QS is coupled to the source of a transistor (p-channel MOSFET) TR formed in the control circuit CLC, and the drain of the transistor TR is coupled to a comparator circuit CMP and a resistor (reference resistor) RST. Note that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the mark D<b>1</b> denotes the drain of the power MOSFET QH, the mark S<b>1</b> denotes the source of the power MOSFET QH, the mark D<b>2</b> denotes the drain of the sense MOSFET QS, and the mark S<b>2</b> denotes the source of the sense MOSFET QS.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The sense MOSFET QS is formed together with the power MOSFET QH in the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>. The sense MOSFET QS is formed so as to configure, in conjunction with the power MOSFET QH, a current mirror circuit in the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>. For example, the sense MOSFET QS has a size corresponding to 1/20000 of the size of the power MOSFET QH. The size ratio therebetween can be changed as necessary, but, here, a description will be given below on the assumption that the size ratio is 1/20000.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The control circuit DLC has an amplifier circuit AMP and the transistor TR. To the two input nodes of the amplifier circuit AMP, the source of the power MOSFET QH and the source of the sense MOSFET QS are coupled. By the output node of the amplifier circuit AMP, the gate of the transistor TR is driven. The sense MOSFET QS is an element for detecting a current Idh flowing in the power MOSFET QH. In the sense MOSFET QS, a current corresponding to a predetermined proportion (which is 1/20000 here) of the current Idh flows due to the current mirror configuration described above when the source voltage of the sense MOSFET QS is equal to that of the power MOSFET QH. That is, the size ratio between the power MOSFET QH and the sense MOSFET QS is set such that, when the current Idh flows in the power MOSFET QH, a current Ise flowing in the sense MOSFET QS corresponds to 1/20000 of the current Idh (i.e., Ise=Idh/20000 is satisfied). To equalize the source voltages of the sense MOSFET QS and the power MOSFET QH and detect the current Idh in the power MOSFET QH with high accuracy, the amplifier circuit AMP and the transistor TR are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The drain of the transistor TR is coupled to the resistor RST. The resistor RST is a resistive element for current-voltage conversion. Specifically, one end of the resistor RST is coupled the drain of the transistor TR, while the other end of the resistor RST is coupled to a ground potential (0 V). By coupling the source of the sense MOSFET QS to the source of the transistor TR and coupling the resistor RST to the drain of the transistor TR, the value of the current flowing in the sense MOSFET QS can be converted to the value of a voltage at a terminal TE<b>3</b> (as the current Ise flowing in the sense MOSFET QS increases, the voltage value at the terminal TE<b>3</b> increases and, specifically, the voltage value at the terminal TE<b>3</b> is substantially proportional to the current Ise flowing in the sense MOSFET QS). Here, the terminal TE<b>3</b> is located between the drain of the transistor TR and the resistor RST. The drain of the transistor TR is coupled to the terminal TE<b>3</b>, and the terminal TE<b>3</b> is coupled to one end of the resistor RST (the other end of the resistor RST is coupled to the ground potential). The resistor RST can be formed in the control circuit CLC (i.e., in the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>). However, in another form, it is also possible to provide the resistor RST outside the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b> (i.e., outside the semiconductor device PKG) (i.e., to provide the resistor RST as an external resistor).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The voltage at the terminal TE<b>3</b> is compared to a predetermined comparison voltage V<sub>1 </sub>by the comparator circuit CMP in the control circuit CLC. When it is detected by the comparator circuit CMP that the voltage value at the terminal TE<b>3</b> is larger than the comparison voltage V<sub>1</sub>, an overcurrent protection circuit OCP in the control circuit CLC operates to control the driver circuit DR and bring the power MOSFET QH into the OFF state (i.e., turn OFF the gate signal inputted to the gate of the power MOSFET QH). Alternatively, the current in the power MOSFET QH is reduced to be not more than a predetermined value (i.e., the gate voltage inputted to the gate of the power MOSFET QH is reduced).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">That is, the current Idh flowing in the power MOSFET QH is sensed (as the current Ise flowing in the sense MOSFET QS) by means of the sense MOSFET QS. When it is determined (detected) that the voltage value at the terminal TE<b>3</b> is larger than the comparison voltage V<sub>1 </sub>(i.e., when it is determined (detected) that the current Ise flowing in the sense MOSFET QS is excessively large), the control circuit CLC turns OFF (OFF state or non-conductive state) the power MOSFET QH or reduces the current in the power MOSFET QH. In this manner, when an excessive current flows in the power MOSFET QH, it is possible to forcibly turn OFF the power MOSFET QH or reduce the current in the power MOSFET QH.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Specifically, the resistance value of the resistor RST is set such that, when a current corresponding to 1/20000 of an allowable upper-limit value Ilm of the current Idh in the power MOSFET QH flows in the sense MOSFET QS (i.e., when Ise=Ilm/20000 is satisfied), the voltage at the terminal TE<b>3</b> becomes the foregoing comparison voltage V<sub>1</sub>. As a result, when a current of not less than the allowable upper-limit value Ilm flows in the power MOSFET QH, a current of not less than Ilm/20000 flows in the sense MOSFET QS and the voltage at the terminal TE<b>3</b> becomes not less than the foregoing comparison voltage so that the control circuit CLC forcibly turns OFF the power MOSFET QH or reduces the current in the power MOSFET QH. This can prevent a current of not less than the allowable upper-limit value Ilm from flowing in the power MOSFET QH and improve the reliability of the semiconductor device PKG and the electronic device using the semiconductor device PKG.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The foregoing power MOSFET QH is formed in the main surface of a semiconductor substrate (hereinafter simply referred to as a substrate) <b>1</b> forming the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>.

In other words, the area of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> is smaller than that of the main MOSFET region RG<b>1</b>. Accordingly, the number of the coupled unit transistor cells in the power MOSFET QH is different from the number of the coupled unit transistor cells in the sense MOSFET QS. The number of the unit transistor cells forming the sense MOSFET QS and coupled in parallel to each other is smaller than the number of the unit transistor cells forming the power MOSFET QH and coupled in parallel to each other. As a result, as long as the source potential in the sense MOSFET QS is the same as the source potential in the power MOSFET QH, in the sense MOSFET QS, a current smaller than the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH flows. Each of the unit transistor cells in the main MOSFET region RG<b>1</b> and the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> is formed of, e.g., an n-channel MOSFET having a trench gate structure.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">When the crack <b>113</b> occurs in the solder <b>111</b> and a current flows so as to avoid the crack <b>113</b>, since the area of the main MOSFET region RG<b>101</b> is larger than that of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>102</b> and accounts for a considerable proportion of the area of the semiconductor chip CP<b>101</b>, the resistance of a path in which the current flows from the die pad DP<b>1</b> into the main MOSFET region RG<b>101</b> (into the transistors thereof) through the solder <b>111</b> is not greatly affected by the presence or absence of the crack <b>113</b>. However, the area of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>102</b> is considerably smaller than that of the main MOSFET region RG<b>101</b> and, if the crack <b>113</b> extends under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a path in which the current flows from the die pad DP<b>1</b> into the sense MOSFET region RG<b>102</b> (into the transistors thereof) through the solder <b>111</b> becomes accordingly circuitous due to the current flowing while bypassing the crack <b>113</b>. Consequently, the resistance of the path increases to have a rather large value.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">When the crack <b>113</b> is not formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the current flowing in the sense MOSFET QS is 1/20000 of the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH. However, when the crack <b>113</b> extends under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the current ratio changes and, consequently, the current flowing in the sense MOSFET QS undesirably becomes smaller than 1/20000 of the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Accordingly, even when the semiconductor chip CPH<b>101</b> is designed such that the current flowing in the sense MOSFET QS is originally 1/20000 of the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH, if the crack <b>113</b> that has occurred in the solder <b>111</b> extends to a position under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the current flowing in the sense MOSFET QS becomes far smaller than 1/20000 of the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH. As a result, even if the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH is to be sensed by means of the sense MOSFET QS, the accuracy thereof is degraded, and the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH is sensed as a current lower than the actually flowing current.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Therefore, when whether or not the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH has exceeded a given limit value is to be sensed by means of the sense MOSFET QS, if the crack <b>113</b> has not occurred, accurate sensing can be performed by means of the sense MOSFET QS. However, if the crack <b>113</b> has occurred so as to extend to a position under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>, sensing cannot be performed properly by means of the sense MOSFET QS, and a moment at which the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH has exceeded the given limit value may be missed. For example, in the case where the current flowing in the sense MOSFET QS, which is 1/20000 of the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH in the absence of the crack <b>113</b>, becomes 1/22000 of the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH due to the occurrence of the crack <b>113</b>, when the current in the power MOSFET QH no longer has the limit value and exceeds 1.1 times the limit value, the sense MOSFET QS senses the value exceeding the limit value.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">A phenomenon in which the accuracy of sensing the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH by means of the sense MOSFET QH is thus degraded by the crack <b>113</b> is accelerated by the occurrence of the crack <b>113</b> under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>. To prevent this, in the present embodiment, the positional relationship between the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> and the metal plate MPL and the like are adjusted so as not to cause the crack <b>113</b> under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>, as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Note that the problem resulting from the crack <b>113</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> occurs particularly remarkably when a bonding material (die bonding material) for die-bonding the semiconductor chip CP<b>101</b> to the die pad DP<b>1</b> is a solder, but may also occur when a conductive bonding material (die bonding material) other than a solder is used. Accordingly, the present embodiment is particularly effective when the bonding material (i.e., the foregoing adhesive layer BD<b>1</b>) for die-bonding the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> to the die pad DP<b>1</b> is a solder, but is also effective when a conductive bonding material other than a solder, e.g., a paste-type conductive bonding material such as a silver paste is used.</p>

<p id="p-0173" num="0172">To obtain such a positional relationship, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> and the metal plate MPL are specifically designed as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">First, for the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, a side SD<b>7</b> (more specifically, in the vicinity of substantially the middle of the side SD<b>7</b>) of the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> opposing the side SD<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is provided with a retracted portion (pad retracted portion, recessed portion, or two-dimensional recessed portion) <b>21</b> which is a region where the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> is locally (partially) retracted (retracted in the plan view) in a direction away from the side SD<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>.

Then, the metal plate MPL is bonded to the source pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> such that the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> is located (disposed) in the retracted portion <b>22</b>. This can provide a state in which the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> are surrounded by the metal plate MPL, by the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b>, and by the bonded portion between the metal plate MPL and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> (in other words, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> oppose the metal plate MPL, the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b>, and the bonded portion between the metal plate MPL and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b>).

<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The purpose for providing such a state is to minimize, even when a crack corresponding to the foregoing crack <b>113</b> is formed in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> bonding the die pad DP<b>1</b> to the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, the possibility of extension of the crack to a position under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b>, which will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the semiconductor device PKG. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> schematically shows a state in which the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is mounted over (bonded to the upper surface of) the die pad DP<b>1</b> via the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b>, and the metal plate MPL is bonded to the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> (to the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> thereof) with the adhesive layer BD<b>3</b>, but illustration of the sealing portion MR is omitted therein. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a cross-sectional view, but hatching is omitted therein for improved clarity of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the region where the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is vertically interposed between the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b> (i.e., region where the metal plate MPL is present over the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>) is denoted by the mark RG<b>11</b>, and the region where the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is not vertically interposed between the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b> (i.e., region where the metal plate MPL is not present over the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>) is denoted by the mark RG<b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is vertically interposed between the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b>. In the plan view, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is included in the upper surface of the die pad DP<b>1</b> so that the die pad DP<b>1</b> is present under the entire semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>. However, the top surface of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> has the region (portion) overlapping the metal plate MPL and the region (portion) not overlapping the metal plate MPL in the plan view. Accordingly, the top surface of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> has the region where the metal plate MPL is present thereover (i.e., region to which the metal plate MPL is bonded) and the region where the metal plate MPL is not present thereover (i.e., region to which the metal plate MPL is not bonded). Therefore, a two-dimensional region corresponding to the entire semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> in the plan view is a combination of the region RG<b>11</b> where the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is vertically interposed between the metal MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b> and the region RG<b>12</b> where the &#xb0; semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is not vertically interposed between the metal MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">When a thermal stress (such as, e.g., a thermal load during the use of the semiconductor device PKG or a temperature cycle test) is applied to the semiconductor device PKG, a crack (crack corresponding to the foregoing crack <b>113</b>) may occur in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> bonding the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> to the die pad DP<b>1</b>. One of major causes of the occurrence of the crack in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> is the difference between the amount of thermal expansion (thermal expansion length) of the die pad DP<b>1</b> and the amount of thermal expansion (thermal expansion length) of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, which is produced due to the difference between the thermal expansion coefficient (coefficient of thermal expansion) of the die pad DP<b>1</b> and the thermal expansion coefficient (coefficient of thermal expansion) of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> when a thermal stress is applied. This causes a stress in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> interposed between the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> and the die pad DP<b>1</b> and a crack in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b>. Specifically, the thermal expansion coefficient of the die pad DP<b>1</b> comprised of a metal is larger than the thermal expansion coefficient of the semiconductor chip (mainly comprised of Si) so that, when a thermal stress is applied, the amount of thermal expansion of the die pad DP<b>1</b> is large and, compared thereto, the amount of thermal expansion of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is small. This causes a large stress in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> interposed between the die pad DP<b>1</b> having the relatively large amount of thermal expansion and the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> having the relatively small amount of thermal expansion, resulting in the occurrence of the crack.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">However, the experiment conducted by the present inventors has confirmed that the crack in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> is less likely to be formed in the region RG<b>11</b> where the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is vertically interposed between the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b> (i.e., region where the metal plate MPL is present thereover) than in the region RG<b>12</b> where the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is not vertically interposed between the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b> (i.e., region where the metal plate MPL is not present thereover). The following is a conceivable reason for this.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">That is, in the region RG<b>11</b> where the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is vertically interposed between the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b>, when a thermal stress is applied, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is not only pulled in the direction of thermal expansion by the die pad DP<b>1</b> located thereunder, but also pulled in the direction of thermal expansion by the metal plate MPL located thereover. Accordingly, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is more likely to undergo thermal expansion in the region RG<b>11</b> than in the region RG<b>12</b> (i.e., the amount of thermal expansion increases therein). As a result, the difference between the amount of thermal expansion of the die pad DP<b>1</b> and that of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is smaller in the region RG<b>11</b> than in the region RG<b>12</b>. That is, the difference between the amount of thermal expansion of the die pad DP<b>1</b> and that of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is smaller in the region RG<b>11</b> than in the region RG<b>12</b>, and therefore the stress produced in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> is smaller in the region RG<b>11</b> than in the region RG<b>12</b>. In other words, because the thermal expansion coefficients of the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b> are larger than that of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, when a thermal stress is applied, in the region RG<b>11</b>, both the metal plate MPL over the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> and the die pad DP<b>1</b> under the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> operate to pull the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> in the direction of thermal expansion. As a result, the difference between the amount of thermal expansion of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> and that of the die pad DP<b>1</b> is smaller in the region RG<b>11</b> than in the region RG<b>12</b>, and the stress produced in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> is also smaller in the region RG<b>11</b>. Since the crack in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> is more likely to occur in a place where the stress produced in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> is large, and is less likely to occur in a place where the stress is small, the crack in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> is less likely to occur in the region RG<b>11</b> than in the region RG<b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In view of this, in the present embodiment, the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> is disposed in a place corresponding to the region RG<b>11</b> where the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is vertically interposed between the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b> (i.e., region where the metal plate MPL is present over the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>) to thereby inhibit a crack from occurring in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> immediately under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>. In other words, the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> is disposed at a position in the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> which allows a reduction in the difference between the amount of thermal expansion of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> and that of the die pad DP<b>1</b> to thereby inhibit a crack from occurring in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> immediately under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">That is, as described above, when attention is focused on the two-dimensional positional relationship between the metal plate MPL and the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>, the three sides (<b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b</i>, and <b>23</b><i>c</i>) of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> are surrounded by the metal plate MPL (in other words, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> oppose the metal plate MPL). When attention is also focused on the two-dimensional positional relationship between the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> and the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>, in the plan view, the three sides (<b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b</i>, and <b>23</b><i>c</i>) of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> are surrounded by the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> (in other words, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> oppose the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b>). Briefly, in the plan view, the bonded portion (MPLa) between the metal plate MPL and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> surrounds the three sides (<b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b</i>, and <b>23</b><i>c</i>) of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> (in other words, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> oppose the bonded portion between the metal plate MPL and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">When viewed from another perspective, in the plan view, the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b>, the metal plate MPL, and the bonded portion MPLa between the metal plate MPL and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> exist in a direction (direction parallel with the side SD<b>1</b>) of approach from the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> to the side SD<b>2</b>, in a direction (direction perpendicular to the side SD<b>1</b>) of approach from the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> to the side SD<b>3</b>, and in a direction (direction parallel with the side SD<b>1</b>) of approach from the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> to the side SD<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In addition, over the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>, not the source wire <b>10</b>S<b>1</b> (source wire <b>10</b>S<b>1</b> for the power MOSFET QH), but the source wire <b>10</b>S<b>2</b> (source wire <b>10</b>S<b>2</b> for the sense MOSFET QS) needs to be disposed. Therefore, it is difficult to extend the source pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> of the power MOSFET QH to a region immediately over the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>. As a result, the source pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> of the power MOSFETA QH does not overlap the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> in the plan view. Consequently, the bonded portion MPLa between the metal plate MPL and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> does not overlap the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> in the plan view, and the metal plate MPL also does not overlap the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> in the plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Such a position at which the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> is disposed is a place corresponding to the region RG<b>11</b> described above where the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is vertically interposed between the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b> and, in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> located thereunder, a crack is less likely to occur. Therefore, by disposing the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> at such a position, it is possible to inhibit or prevent a crack from occurring in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> immediately under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> (i.e., it is possible to inhibit or prevent a crack corresponding to the foregoing crack <b>113</b> from being formed at a position under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b>). As a result, it becomes possible to inhibit or prevent the accuracy of sensing a current flowing in the power MOSFET QH by means of the sense MOSFET QS from being degraded by the foregoing crack <b>113</b>. This allows an improvement in the accuracy of sensing the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH by means of the sense MOSFET QS.

<p id="p-0187" num="0186">If the source pad electrode PDS<b>4</b> of the sense MOSFET QS is disposed at a position close to the outer peripheral portion (side SD<b>1</b>) rather than at an inner position over the main surface of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, it is easier to couple a conductive member such as the bonding wire BW thereto. Therefore, in the present embodiment, over the main surface (top surface) of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> and the source pad electrode PDS<b>4</b> of the sense MOSFET QS are not disposed at the same two-dimensional positions (vertically overlapping positions), but the source pad electrode PDS<b>4</b> of the sense MOSFET QS is disposed outside the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> (closer to the side SD<b>1</b>). In other words, over the main surface of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> and the pad electrode PDS<b>4</b> are disposed such that the pad electrode PDS<b>4</b> is closer to the outer peripheral portion (side SD<b>1</b>) of the main surface of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> than the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>. Briefly, over the main surface of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, a distance (interval) L<b>2</b> from the outer periphery (side SD<b>1</b>) of the main surface of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> to the pad electrode PDS<b>4</b> is adjusted to be smaller (shorter) than a distance (interval) L<b>1</b> from the outer periphery (side SD<b>1</b>) of the main surface of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> to the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> (i.e., L<b>1</b>&#x3e;L<b>2</b> is satisfied.

Additionally, by disposing the pad electrode PDS<b>4</b> outside the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> (i.e., disposing the pad electrode PDS<b>4</b> closer to the side SD<b>1</b> than the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>), it is possible to easily couple a conductive member such as the bonding wire BW to the source pad electrode PDS<b>4</b> of the sense MOSFET QS.

This allows the source wire <b>1052</b> to extend in the direction of approach from the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> to the side SD<b>1</b> over the main surface of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>, unlike in the present embodiment, a distance L<b>101</b> between the sense MOSFET region RG<b>102</b> and a side (chip side) SD<b>101</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>101</b> is smaller (shorter) than a distance L<b>103</b> between a front end side SD<b>108</b> of the metal plate MPL<b>101</b> and the side (chip side) SD<b>101</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>101</b> (i.e., L<b>101</b>&#x3c;L<b>103</b> is satisfied). Here, the side SD<b>101</b> corresponds to the foregoing side SD<b>1</b>, and the front end side SD<b>108</b> corresponds to the foregoing front end side SD<b>8</b>.</p>

Accordingly, a crack is more likely to occur in the foregoing solder <b>111</b> located thereunder than in the region RG<b>11</b>.

<p id="p-0195" num="0194">By contrast, in the present embodiment, in the plan view, the distance L<b>3</b> between the front end side SD<b>8</b> of the metal plate MPL and the side (chip side) SD<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is not more than the distance L<b>1</b> between the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> and the side (chip side) SD<b>1</b> (i.e., L<b>3</b>&#x3e;L<b>1</b> is satisfied). That is, in the present embodiment over the main surface (top surface) of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> is disposed at a position inward of the front end side SD<b>8</b> of the metal plate MPL. This allows a reduction in the difference between the amount of thermal expansion of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> and that of the die pad DP<b>1</b> at the position at which the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> is formed. Accordingly, it is possible to more reliably inhibit or prevent a crack from occurring in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> immediately under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>. Therefore, it is possible to more reliably improve the accuracy of sensing a current flowing in the power MOSFET QH by means of the sense MOSFET QS, and more reliably improve the reliability of the semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In the present embodiment, it is preferable that the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b> between which the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is interposed are formed of the same material. This is because, if the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b> are formed of the same material, the thermal expansion coefficient (coefficient of thermal expansion) of the metal plate MPL and the thermal expansion coefficient (coefficient of thermal expansion) of the die pad DP<b>1</b> are the same so that, when a thermal stress is applied, the metal plate MPL located over the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> and the die pad DP<b>1</b> located thereunder operate to pull the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> to the same degree in the direction of thermal expansion. As a result, it is possible to more reliably obtain the effect of inhibiting or preventing a crack from occurring in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> immediately under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Therefore, when the metal plate MPL is formed of aluminum (Al) or an aluminum (Al) alloy, the die pad DP<b>1</b> is also preferably formed of aluminum (Al) or an aluminum (Al) alloy, which is the same material as that of the metal plate MPL. When the metal plate MPL is formed of copper (Cu) or a copper (Cu) alloy, the die pad DP<b>1</b> is also preferably formed of copper (Cu) or a copper (Cu) alloy, which is the same material as that of the metal plate MPL. In terms of its excellent workability, high thermal conductivity, and relatively low price, copper (Cu) or a copper (Cu) alloy is particularly preferred as the materials of the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b>. If each of the die pad DP<b>2</b> and the leads LD is also formed of the same material as those of the die pad DP<b>1</b> and the metal plate MPL, the die pad DP<b>1</b>, the die pad DP<b>2</b>, and the leads LD can be formed using a lead frame, which more desirably facilitates the manufacturing of the semiconductor device PKG.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">More preferably, not only the metal plate MPL and the die pad DP<b>1</b>, but also the adhesive layer BD<b>3</b> bonding the metal plate MPL to the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is formed of the same material as that of the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> bonding the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> to the die pad DP<b>1</b>. That is, in the case of using a solder for the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> bonding the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> to the die pad DP<b>1</b>, it is preferable to use a solder also for the adhesive layer BD<b>3</b> bonding the metal plate MPL to the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>. This allows, when a thermal stress is applied, the operation of pulling the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> in the direction of thermal expansion by the metal plate MPL located thereover and the operation of pulling the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> in the direction of thermal expansion by the die pad DP<b>1</b> located thereunder to be more equalized. Therefore, it is possible to more reliably obtain the effect of inhibiting or preventing a crack from occurring in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> immediately under the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>a</i>, not only the foregoing power MOSFET QH (main MOSFET region RG<b>1</b>) and the sense MOSFET QS (sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>), but also a temperature sensing diode (diode element) is formed, and the region where the diode is formed is the diode region RG<b>3</b>. Thus, as can be also seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>a </i>has the main MOSFET region RG<b>1</b> where the foregoing power MOSFET QH is formed, the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> where the foregoing sense MOSFET QS is formed, and the diode region RG<b>3</b> where the temperature sensing diode (diode element) is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The diode formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> is a diode (circuit) for sensing the temperature of the power MOSFET QH. The diode can also be regarded as a diode (circuit) for sensing heat generated from the power MOSFET QH, and is disposed in the vicinity of the power MOSFET QH in the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>a </i>to allow the temperature of the power MOSFET QH (heat generated therefrom) to be sensed. The diode formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> can also be regarded as a temperature sensing circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The anode of the diode formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> is electrically coupled to an anode pad electrode PDA via the anode wire <b>10</b>A, while the cathode of the diode formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> is electrically coupled to a cathode pad electrode PDC via the cathode wire <b>10</b>C. The anode wire <b>10</b>A and the cathode wire <b>10</b>C are each formed of the foregoing patterned conductor film <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the anode wire <b>10</b>A and the cathode wire <b>10</b>C are wires in the same layer as the foregoing source wires and the foregoing gate wire <b>10</b>G. The semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>a </i>has, as pad electrodes, the anode pad electrode PDA for the diode formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> and the cathode pad electrode PDC for the diode formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> in addition to the source pad electrodes PDS<b>1</b>, PDS<b>2</b>, PDS<b>3</b>, and PDS<b>4</b> and the gate pad electrode PDG. To the anode pad electrode PDA and the cathode pad electrode PDC, the foregoing bonding wires BW are coupled and, via the foregoing bonding wires BW (each having one end thereof coupled to the pad electrode PDA or the pad electrode PDC and the other end thereof coupled to the pad electrode PD<b>2</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>), the anode pad electrode PDA and the cathode pad electrode PDC are electrically coupled to the control circuit CLC formed in the foregoing semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Since the diode has a voltage-current characteristic which changes in accordance with the temperature, by sensing (monitoring) the voltage-current characteristic of the diode formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b>, it is possible to sense the temperature of the diode in the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, by disposing the diode region RG<b>3</b> (diode) in the vicinity of the power MOSFET QH in the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>a</i>, it is possible to sense the temperature of the power MOSFET QH (heat generated therefrom) by means of the diode.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">For example, it is possible to sense (monitor) the voltage of the diode (voltage between the anode and cathode thereof) formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> in a state in which a constant current is allowed to flow in the diode, and obtain the temperature of the diode from the resulting voltage value. That is, the voltage when the constant current is allowed to flow in the diode is lower as the temperature is higher, and therefore it is possible to sense the temperature of the diode using the voltage. The supply of the constant current to the diode formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> and the sensing of the voltage of the diode (voltage between the anode and cathode thereof) can be performed using the control circuit CLC of the foregoing semiconductor chip CP<b>2</b>. It is also possible to sense (monitor) the current in the diode (current between the anode and cathode thereof) formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> in a state in which the constant voltage is applied to the diode, and obtain the temperature of the diode from the resulting current value.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">Therefore, when the power MOFSET QH generates excessive heat to increase the temperature of the diode formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> to a temperature higher than a predetermined upper-limit temperature, the foregoing driver circuit DR of the foregoing control circuit CLC supplies the OFF signal to the gate of the power MOSFET QH (or stops the supply of the ON signal) to thereby switch the power MOSFET QH into the OFF state. In this manner, when the power MOSFET QH generates excessive heat, it is possible to sense the generation of the excessive heat by means of the diode in the diode region RG<b>3</b>, and swiftly switch the power MOSFET QH into the OFF state.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">For example, if the foregoing load LA is short-circuited in a state in which the power MOSFET QH has been turned ON and a voltage is applied from the foregoing power source BT to the foregoing load LA, a large current (current larger than during normal operation) undesirably flows in the power MOSFET QH so that the power MOSFET QH generates excessive heat. By sensing a temperature rise due to the generation of the excessive heat from the power MOSFET QH by means of the diode formed in the diode formation region RG<b>3</b>, when the foregoing load LA is short-circuited, the power MOSFET QH can be swiftly switched into the OFF state.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Thus, the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> has the diode region RG<b>3</b> where the temperature sensing diode (diode element) is formed. The diode (diode formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b>) can be formed of a diode DD<b>1</b> using a PN junction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, in the diode region RG<b>3</b>, a polysilicon film <b>31</b> for forming the diode is formed over the field insulating film (isolation region) <b>2</b>. The polysilicon film <b>31</b> has an n-type silicon portion (n-type silicon region) <b>31</b><i>a </i>into which an n-type impurity (e.g., phosphorus) has been introduced, and a p-type silicon portion (p-type silicon region) <b>31</b><i>b </i>into which a p-type impurity (e.g., boron) has been introduced. The n-type silicon portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the p-type silicon portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>are adjacent to each other, and a PN junction is formed at the interface between the p-type silicon portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>and the n-type silicon portion <b>31</b><i>a</i>. The polysilicon film <b>31</b> can also be formed of the conductive film in the same layer as the gate electrodes and the wiring portions <b>7</b><i>a </i>for gate extraction, but the polysilicon film <b>31</b> and the gate electrodes <b>7</b> (and the wiring portions <b>7</b><i>a </i>for gate extraction) are isolated from each other and are not electrically coupled to each other. By the formation of the PN junction (at the interface) between the p-type silicon portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>and the n-type silicon portion <b>31</b><i>a</i>, the diode DD<b>1</b> is formed. That is, the p-type silicon portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the polysilicon film <b>31</b> formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> serves as the anode of the diode DD<b>1</b>, and the n-type silicon portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the polysilicon film <b>31</b> formed in the diode region RG<b>3</b> serves as the cathode of the diode DD<b>1</b>. The anode wire <b>10</b>A is electrically coupled to the p-type silicon portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the polysilicon film <b>31</b> through a contact hole (opening or through hole) <b>9</b><i>c </i>formed in the insulating film <b>8</b>, while the cathode wire <b>10</b>C is electrically coupled to the n-type silicon portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the polysilicon film <b>31</b> through a contact hole (opening or through hole) <b>9</b><i>d </i>formed in the insulating film <b>8</b>.

The anode wire <b>10</b>A exposed from the opening <b>13</b> in the protective film <b>12</b> forms the anode pad electrode PDA of the foregoing diode DD<b>1</b>, while the cathode wire <b>10</b>C exposed from the opening <b>13</b> of the protective film <b>12</b> forms the cathode pad electrode PDC of the foregoing diode DD<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">In the foregoing semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> is disposed in the retracted portion <b>21</b> in which the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b> is locally (partially) retracted in the direction away from the side SD<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Consequently, in the case of using the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>a </i>instead of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b>, when attention is focused on the two-dimensional positional relationship among the metal plate MPL, the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b>, and the diode region RG<b>3</b>, in the plan view, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> and the three sides of the diode region RG<b>3</b> are surrounded by the metal plate MPL (in other words, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b> and the three sides of the diode region RG<b>3</b> oppose the metal plate MPL).

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, illustration of the foregoing pad electrodes PDS<b>2</b> and PDS<b>3</b> is omitted, but the foregoing pad electrodes PDS<b>2</b> and PDS<b>3</b> are also formed in the first MOSFET region RG<b>21</b> and the second MOSFET region RG<b>22</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 to 40</figref>, one of the leads LD<b>1</b> is electrically coupled to the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>a </i>of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>b </i>via the metal plate MPL<b>1</b>, while another of the leads LD<b>1</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>b </i>is electrically coupled to the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>b </i>via the metal plate MPL<b>2</b>. In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 to 41</figref>, the five leads LD<b>1</b> are disposed over the side surface MRc<b>1</b> of the sealing portion MR. Of the five leads LD<b>1</b>, two have the inner lead portions thereof that are integrally coupled to each other in the sealing portion MR such that the metal plate MPL<b>1</b> is coupled thereto via the foregoing adhesive layer BD<b>4</b>, and other two have the inner lead portions thereof that are integrally coupled to each other in the sealing portion MR such that the metal plate MPL<b>2</b> is coupled thereto via the foregoing adhesive layer BD<b>4</b>. However, the leads LD<b>1</b> to which the metal plate MPL<b>1</b> is coupled (i.e., the leads LD<b>1</b> electrically coupled to the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>a </i>of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> through the metal plate MPL<b>1</b>) and the leads LD<b>1</b> to which the metal plate MPL<b>2</b> is coupled (i.e., the leads LD<b>1</b> electrically coupled to the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>b </i>of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> through the metal plate MPL<b>2</b>) are not coupled, but are isolated by a resin material forming the sealing portion MR to be electrically insulated from each other. Also, over the side surface MRc<b>1</b> of the sealing portion MR, the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> are disposed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the plurality of leads LD<b>1</b> may also include a dummy lead LD<b>1</b>D which is not electrically coupled to any of the pad electrodes of the semiconductor chips CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">As can be seen from the comparison between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44 and 16</figref> the comparison between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 23</figref>, the two-dimensional positional relationship between the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a </i>of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>b </i>and the source pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>a </i>thereof, the two-dimensional positional relationship between the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a </i>and the metal plate MPL<b>1</b>, and the two-dimensional positional relationship between the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a </i>and the bonded portion between the metal plate MPL<b>1</b> and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>a </i>are the same as in the case of the foregoing semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 23</figref>). Also, the two-dimensional positional relationship between the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a </i>and the source pad electrode PDS<b>4</b><i>a </i>is the same as in the case of the foregoing semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref> and <b>23</b>). Also, the two-dimensional positional relationship between the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b </i>of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>b </i>and the source pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>b </i>thereof, the two-dimensional positional relationship between the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b </i>and the metal plate MPL<b>2</b>, and the two-dimensional positional relationship between the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b </i>and the bonded portion between the metal plate MPL<b>2</b> and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>b </i>are the same as in the case of the foregoing semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 23</figref>). Also, the two-dimensional positional relationship between the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b </i>and the source pad electrode PDS<b>4</b><i>b </i>is the same as in the case of the foregoing semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 23</figref>). The following is a brief description of a part thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">That is, when attention is focused on the two-dimensional positional relationship between the metal plate MPL<b>1</b> and the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a</i>, in the plan view, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a </i>are surrounded by the metal plate MPL<b>1</b> (in other words, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a </i>oppose the metal plate MPL<b>1</b>). When attention is also focused on the two-dimensional positional relationship between the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>a </i>and the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a</i>, in the plan view, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a </i>are surrounded by the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>a </i>(in other words, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a </i>oppose the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>a</i>). Briefly, in the plan view, the bonded portion between the metal plate MPL<b>1</b> and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>a </i>surrounds the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a </i>(in other words, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>a </i>oppose the bonded portion between the metal plate MPL<b>1</b> and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">The same holds true for the second MOSFET region RG<b>22</b>. When attention is focused on the two-dimensional positional relationship between the metal plate MPL<b>2</b> and the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b</i>, in the plan view, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b </i>are surrounded by the metal plate MPL<b>2</b> (in other words, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b </i>oppose the metal plate MPL<b>2</b>). When attention is also focused on the two-dimensional positional relationship between the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>b </i>and the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b</i>, in the plan view, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b </i>are surrounded by the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>b </i>(in other words, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b </i>oppose the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>b</i>). Briefly, in the plan view, the bonded portion between the metal plate MPL<b>2</b> and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>b </i>surrounds the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b </i>(in other words, the three sides of the sense MOSFET region RG<b>2</b><i>b </i>oppose the bonded portion between the metal plate MPL<b>2</b> and the pad electrode PDS<b>1</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">With the arrangement, even when the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>b </i>is used, in the same manner as when the foregoing semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b> is used, it is possible to inhibit or prevent a crack from occurring in the adhesive layer BD<b>1</b> immediately under each of the sense MOSFET regions RG<b>2</b><i>a </i>and RG<b>2</b><i>b</i>. As a result, it is possible to inhibit or prevent the accuracy of sensing the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH<b>1</b> by means of the sense MOSFET QS<b>1</b> and the accuracy of sensing the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH<b>2</b> by means of the sense MOSFET QS<b>2</b> from being degraded by the foregoing crack <b>113</b>. This allows an improvement in the accuracy of sensing the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH<b>1</b> by means of the sense MOSFET QS<b>1</b> as well as an improvement in the accuracy of sensing the current flowing in the power MOSFET QH<b>2</b> by means of the sense MOSFET QS<b>2</b>. Therefore, the reliability of the semiconductor device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Also, in the same manner as in the foregoing semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>a</i>, in the first MOSFET region RG<b>21</b> and the second MOSFET region RG<b>22</b> of the semiconductor chip CP<b>1</b><i>b</i>, it is possible to provide the diode region RG<b>3</b>, the anode pad electrode PDA, and the cathode pad electrode PDC.</p>
