<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to storage media, and more specifically to physical features in bit-patterned magnetic storage media.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, hard-disk drives have rotating high precision disks that are coated on both sides with a special thin film media designed to store information in the form of magnetic patterns. In bit-patterned, hard-disk drives, the special thin film media has been patterned to form a large number of individual storage elements that can retain a magnetic orientation and thereby store data. Electromagnetic read/write heads &#x201c;flying&#x201d; on a cushion of air only fractions of micro-inches above the disk are used to record information onto the thin film media or read information from the media. Read/write heads may write information to the disk by creating an electromagnetic field to orient magnetic grains of a storage element in one direction or the other. Each grain acts as a magnetic dipole pointing in a certain direction and creating a magnetic field around the grain. All of the grains in a storage element will typically point in the same direction so that the storage element as a whole has an associated magnetic field. Read/write heads may read information from the disk by sensing the direction of a magnetic field associated with the storage elements.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Because read/write heads are used to sense and orient the magnetic fields of a storage element, proximity of the read/write heads can be quite important. For example, when the read/write heads are located closer to a storage element, it may be possible to more accurately and efficiently write to or read from the storage element, which can lead to better hard-disk drive performance in the form of speed and efficiency. Further, increased proximity between read/write heads and storage elements can even lead to better data retention and a reduced likelihood of data corruption because the magnitude of the static magnetic fields necessary for reading and the magnitude of the induced magnetic fields for writing may be reduced. The reduced magnitudes may lead to less detrimental interaction between a storage element and a magnetic field induced by the read/write head and/or nearby storage elements.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While it may be desirable to have the read/write head as close to the storage elements as possible, it may also be undesirable that the read/write head contact the thin film medium. For example, contact between the read/write head and the thin film medium can damage the storage elements and cause the contacted portion to become inoperable. Thus, it is important to balance proximity of the read/write head with the risk of the read/write head contacting the thin film medium.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Two major aspects of the design of thin film media can lead to increased proximity between a read/write head and the storage elements. A first aspect is the thickness of the intervening layers between a surface of the thin film medium and the magnetic region of a magnetic storage element. Reduced overall thickness of these intervening layers can allow a read/write head to be closer to the magnetic region. A second aspect is the planarity of the surface of the thin film medium. Generally, the more planar or smooth the thin film medium is, the closer the read/write head can be to the storage elements because the lower the risk of the head contacting the surface of the medium. Because the patterning of a thin film can, in some embodiments, lead to bumps or other surface features on the thin film, this can be an important consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, manufacturing of patterned features on the thin film can be quite complicated and involve multiple steps which may include forming multiple layers, etching one or more layers, planarizing, or other steps. Each step adds to the complexity which increases cost, risk of failure, and/or other problems. Thus, reducing the number of layers or fabrication steps may reduce the cost of fabricating a storage medium. This reduction of layers and manufacturing complexity must be balanced with the desired quality and density of magnetic storage.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The subject matter of the present application has been developed in response to the present state of the art, and in particular, in response to the problems and needs in the art that have not yet been fully solved by currently available patterned magnetic storage media and/or methods of forming patterned magnetic storage media.</p>

Appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;in an embodiment,&#x201d; and similar language throughout this specification may, but do not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment. Similarly, the use of the term &#x201c;implementation&#x201d; means an implementation having a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, however, absent an express correlation to indicate otherwise, an implementation may be associated with one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating one embodiment of a magnetic disk drive system <b>100</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the magnetic disk drive system <b>100</b> includes a magnetic storage disk or disks <b>102</b>, a spindle <b>104</b>, a read/write head <b>106</b>, a suspension arm <b>108</b>, an arm actuator <b>110</b>, and a controller module <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The disk <b>102</b> can be defined as a magnetic storage medium that includes magnetic material for magnetically storing information. The spindle <b>104</b> allows the disk <b>102</b> to rotate about an axis defined by the spindle <b>104</b>. The read/write head <b>106</b> is mounted on the suspension arm <b>108</b>, which is connected to the arm actuator <b>110</b>. The arm actuator <b>110</b> actuates the position of the suspension arm <b>108</b> and, in conjunction with the rotation of the disk <b>102</b> about the spindle <b>104</b>, physically actuates the location of the read/write head <b>106</b> in relation to the surface of the disk <b>102</b>. In a write mode, the read/write head <b>106</b> induces a magnetic field that changes the magnetic orientation of a portion of the disk <b>102</b>. In a read mode, the read/write head <b>106</b> reads information from the disk <b>102</b> by measuring or sensing an orientation of the magnetic fields of different portions of the storage media. The controller module <b>112</b> controls the arm actuator <b>110</b>, the read/write head <b>106</b>, and the rotational speed and position of the disk <b>102</b> to perform reading, writing, and other operations.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the disk <b>102</b> includes a rigid substrate and storage elements for magnetically recording and/or storing data. The storage elements may be near a surface of the disk <b>102</b> such that the information stored by the elements can be read or information can be written to the elements by the read/write head <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, the storage elements include a plurality of magnetic regions <b>116</b> defined between one or more non-magnetic regions <b>114</b>. The magnetic regions <b>116</b> may also be referred to herein as lands or islands. The disk <b>102</b> with a pattern of magnetic and non-magnetic regions <b>116</b>, <b>114</b> may be referred to as a bit-patterned medium.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the depicted embodiment, the magnetic regions <b>116</b> are formed so that they are laterally separated by non-magnetic regions <b>114</b>. In one embodiment, laterally separated is given to mean that the regions <b>116</b>, <b>114</b> are separated in a direction substantially parallel to a surface of a surface of the disk <b>102</b>. Each magnetic region <b>116</b> may be defined by the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> which may form a boundary. The non-magnetic region <b>114</b> may separate nearby magnetic regions <b>116</b> into independent magnetic areas, each capable of storing a single bit of data storage. For example, if the material (e.g., grains) of region <b>116</b> is magnetically oriented in a first general direction, the magnetic disk drive system <b>100</b> may read that bit as a zero &#x2018;0&#x2019;. In contrast, if the material of the region <b>116</b> is magnetically oriented in a second general direction generally opposite the first general direction, the magnetic disk drive system <b>100</b> may read the bit as &#x2018;1&#x2019;. In another embodiment, a magnetic field that switches between magnetic regions <b>116</b> may be read as a &#x2018;1&#x2019; while a magnetic field that remains the same between magnetic regions may be read as a &#x2018;0&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the magnetic grains of each of the magnetic regions <b>116</b> are oriented in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the disk <b>102</b>. In another embodiment, the magnetic grains of each of the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may be oriented parallel to the surface of the disk. In varying embodiments, the magnetic grains of each of the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may be magnetically oriented in a direction perpendicular or parallel to a surface of the disk <b>102</b>. The non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> may be non-magnetic or substantially non-magnetic such that little or no magnetization may be written in the non-magnetic region, or little or no magnetic field may be read from the non-magnetic region <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a magnetic disk drive system <b>100</b>, it is important to note that the present disclosure may be applicable to any type of magnetic storage media. For example, the teaching disclosed herein may be applicable to magnetic tape drives or any other magnetic storage system. Additionally, the principles here also apply to semiconductor logic and non-magnetic storage media, in some embodiments. For example, features in semiconductor logic and/or non-magnetic storage media may be formed using one of the stop layers and/or fill layers within a groove or other feature between one or more magnetic regions <b>114</b> (lands or islands), as disclosed herein. Although focus in the present disclosure is on magnetic disk drive systems, this is by way of illustration and not limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a cross-sectional structure of one embodiment of a magnetic storage medium <b>200</b>. The magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> includes an etched magnetic layer <b>202</b> that includes a plurality of magnetic regions <b>116</b> and non-magnetic regions <b>114</b>. The magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> also includes a stop layer <b>204</b>, a lubrication layer <b>206</b> and a substrate <b>208</b>. The illustrated structures are exemplary only and may not all be included in all embodiments and/or may vary between embodiments. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram and may not represent the actual physical structure and/or shape or physical structure of the components. One of skill in the art will recognize that the actual structure may vary depending on fabrication methods, imperfections, types of materials, design variations, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the depicted embodiment, the magnetic regions <b>116</b> are laterally adjacent the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b>. As used herein the terms &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; or &#x201c;laterally&#x201d; are given to indicate a direction substantially parallel to a planar surface of the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b>. In one embodiment, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> at least partially separate adjacent magnetic regions <b>116</b>. As discussed above, each of the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may be used to store data by maintaining its magnetic materials (e.g., grains) in a certain magnetic orientation that can later be read or altered by a read/write head <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, the magnetic region <b>116</b> may include a hard magnetic material particularly conducive to maintaining its magnetic orientation such that it creates a static magnetic field that may be read. The magnetic region <b>116</b> may be highly magnetic and have a high magnetic moment density such that the magnetic orientation of the magnetic region may be more easily read.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The magnetic regions <b>116</b> may be formed of any magnetic material known in the art. Exemplary magnetic materials may include materials containing elements selected from cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), and platinum (Pt). In one embodiment, the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may include a single layer of material. In one embodiment, multiple layers of different materials having different chemical compositions may be used. In one embodiment, the composition of the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may vary in a vertical dimension. For example, the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may include a bi-layer of two different magnetic compositions. In another embodiment, the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may be built up from a multi-layer stack consisting of layers such as cobalt and palladium or cobalt and platinum. Other embodiments may include magnetic regions formed from iron (Fe) and platinum (Pt). One of skill in the art will recognize significant variation in the possible chemical compositions and structures of the magnetic regions <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> are formed within grooves <b>404</b> of the etched magnetic layer <b>202</b>. The non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> may laterally separate the magnetic regions <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> are formed of a fill layer that has been deposited within grooves <b>404</b> separating the magnetic regions <b>116</b>. The non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> may be substantially non-magnetic such that they interact only very weakly with magnetic fields or not at all. In one embodiment, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> may separate each magnetic region <b>116</b> from other magnetic regions <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> may make it easier to read an orientation of a magnetic region <b>116</b>. For example, if a non-magnetic region <b>114</b> is substantially non-magnetic, there may be a reduced amount of noise detected by a read/write head <b>106</b> when the head is over the non-magnetic region <b>114</b>. This may make it easier for a controller module <b>112</b> to identify the magnetic regions <b>116</b> and/or their orientation when passed over by a read/write head <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> may be formed of any material that does not interact or only weakly interacts with magnetic fields. In one embodiment, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> are made from alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). In other embodiments, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> may be made from another material, such as, for example, a material that includes aluminum and oxygen. For example, the non-magnetic regions may be made from a material that has the composition AlO<sub>x</sub>, where x is in the range of 1 to 2. In another embodiment, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> may be made from a material that includes titanium and nitrogen, tantalum and nitrogen, or tantalum and titanium and nitrogen, or the like. For example, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> may be made from titanium nitride (TiN), tantalum nitride (TaN), TiTaN, a combination thereof, or the like. In one embodiment, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> (fill layer) are made from a material having a composition TiNx, where x is in the range of 0.5 and 1.5. In one embodiment, the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> (fill layer) are made from a material having a composition TaNx, where x is in the range of 0.5 and 1.5. In one embodiment the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> (fill layer) are made from a material having a composition (TiTay)Nx, where x is in the range of 0.5 and 1.5 and y is in the range of 0 and 1.0.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> is at least partially located between the magnetic regions <b>116</b> and the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b>. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> lines the sidewall surfaces and base surfaces of the grooves <b>404</b> of the magnetic layer <b>202</b>. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> substantially separates the fill layer of the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> from the magnetic regions <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> completely separates the magnetic regions <b>116</b> from the non-magnetic regions <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> extends over the magnetic regions <b>116</b> and forms a boundary between underlying layers and overlying layers. Underlying layers may be any layers deposited underneath or prior to the stop layer while overlying layers may be any layers deposited on top of or after the stop layer. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> is a substantially uniform (e.g., homogenous) layer. For example, the stop layer <b>204</b> can be formed within a single deposition step to form a single layer. In other words, in some implementations, the stop layer <b>204</b> does not include multiple layers formed by separate or intervening deposition and/or etching steps. Further, the thickness of the stop layer <b>204</b> can be substantially the same across the medium. In another embodiment, the stop layer thickness can be thicker near the outer diameter (OD) and thinner in the middle or inner regions of the disk. In yet another embodiment, the stop layer thickness can be thicker near the inner diameter (ID) and thinner in the middle and outer regions of the disk.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> is formed of a physically hard material to facilitate planarization during fabrication. For example, the stop layer <b>204</b> may be formed to stop or slow etching of the surface of the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> during a chemical mechanical planarization. This may allow a surface of the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> to be smoother and more planar. The stop layer <b>204</b> may also help seal the material of the medium below the stop layer <b>204</b> from outside materials. For example, the stop layer <b>204</b> may seal out moisture or other contaminants. Additionally, the stop layer may reduce or prevent chemicals in the planarizing slurry from reaching to the magnetic layer during the CMP planarization processing. Additionally, the stop layer <b>204</b> may act as a protective layer for lower layers or material within the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b>. For example, according to one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> protects the underlying magnetic regions <b>116</b> from damage due to impact with a read/write head <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> facilitates bonding between adjacent layers. For example, the stop layer <b>204</b> may bond well with the magnetic regions <b>116</b>, substrate <b>208</b>, non-magnetic regions <b>114</b>, and/or lubrication layer <b>206</b>. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> may bond better to one or more of the contacted layers and thus facilitated bonding and longevity for the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b>. For example, in one embodiment a particular lubrication material used in the lubrication layer <b>206</b> may bond or stick better to the stop layer <b>204</b> than to the magnetic region <b>116</b> or non-magnetic region <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A variety of materials may be used for the stop layer <b>204</b>. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> is made from carbon or a carbon compound. For example, the stop layer <b>204</b> can be made from a hardened carbon material. The composition of the stop layer may vary thru the thickness of the stop layer. In one specific implementation, the top of the stop layer <b>204</b> is made from a nitrogenated carbon for facilitating bonding with the lubrication layer <b>206</b>. The stop layer may also be formed of other materials such as silicon nitride (SiN), silicon carbide (SiC), boron nitride (BN), boron carbide (BC), or other hard materials. In one embodiment, the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may serve as a stop layer. For example, by using a magnetic material that is not corroded during an etching process and/or placing the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> in a corrosion-free environment within a disk drive (such as a helium filled disk drive) the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may serve as a stop layer <b>204</b>. In one embodiment, this may allow a lubrication layer <b>206</b> to be placed directly on top of the magnetic regions <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, a top of the fill layer is no more than 2 nm above a top of the stop layer and no more than 6 nm below the top of the stop layer. In a further embodiment, a top of the fill layer is no more than 1 nm above a top of the stop layer and no more than 4 nm below the top of the stop layer.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The lubrication layer <b>206</b> may be a low friction layer to facilitate improving triobology such as protecting the disk surface from when portions of the read/write head <b>106</b> come in contact with the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b>. For example, the slider may hit the magnetic storage medium during drive operation when the write head is pushed closer to the disk to calibrate the spacing between the read/write head <b>106</b> and the disk for minimizing and controlling magnetic spacing. Other examples include shock events such as when a disk drive is accelerated to the point that the read/write head <b>106</b> can be forced to the disk surface. The lubrication layer <b>206</b> may help minimize damage to the disk during these events. For example, during an event in which the read/write head <b>106</b> comes in contact with or hits the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> the lubrication layer <b>206</b> may allow the read/write head <b>106</b> to slide on the surface of the lubrication layer <b>206</b> rather than penetrating into the surface of the storage medium <b>200</b> and damaging underlying layers. Exemplary materials used for lubrication may include fluorocarbon-based Z-dol, ZTMD, Z-Tetraol, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> is configured such that there is a minimal distance between the magnetic regions <b>116</b> and a flying read/write head <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, one aspect of minimizing this distance includes minimizing the distance between the lubrication layer <b>206</b> and the magnetic regions <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> is formed having a minimal thickness. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> has a thickness of about 3 nanometers (nm) or less. According to one particular implementation, the stop layer <b>204</b> has a thickness of about 2.5 nanometers (nm) or less. In yet another embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> has a thickness of about 2 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The substrate <b>208</b> may be a non-magnetic material that supports the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b>. The substrate may be made from any of various materials, such as, for example aluminum, aluminum alloys, polymers, Mylar, paper, glass, glass composites, magnesium alloys, ceramics, silicon, silicon wafers coated with one or more material layers, or other materials commonly used in the art. In certain implementations, the substrate <b>208</b> is a flexible tape substrate. In other implementations, the substrate <b>208</b> is a hard disk substrate. The substrate may be made from glass or aluminum and be formed in the shape of a disk with the diameter of the disk larger than the thickness of the disk and with a hole missing from the center of the disk. In the case of a substrate used for a semiconductor device or memory the substrate may start out as a disk shaped wafer and then eventually be diced into a rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows magnetic regions <b>116</b> directly on the substrate <b>208</b>, in some embodiments, the medium may include one or more underlayers disposed on the substrate <b>208</b> between the magnetic regions <b>116</b> and the substrate <b>210</b>. In one embodiment, for example, the recording medium <b>200</b> may include a soft underlayer between the substrate and magnetic regions <b>116</b>. The soft underlayer may be made from a material that is magnetically softer (lower coercivity) than a magnetic region <b>202</b>. In one embodiment, the soft underlayer may be made from Co, NiFe or any other suitable alloys such as CoPtCr, or the like, which are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the soft under layer increases the available write flux and field gradients for the write process. That is, a soft underlayer may increase the possible field strength and field gradient of a write field that may be used in a write process. Higher field strengths and higher field gradients enable writing sharper magnetic transitions and may be needed or desired for magnetically reversing smaller sized magnetic bits (such as magnetic regions <b>116</b> in bit-patterned media) that are thermally stable. A soft underlayer may also be useful to help reduce the affects of adjacent track interference (ATI) during a read and/or write process.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The dimensions and structure of the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> is for illustrative purposes only. Variations in the thicknesses of layers, shapes of layers, or other aspects may vary between embodiments. The thin film layers may not be atomically smooth, but rather can have a roughness associated with the variation in height of the top surface. This could be the case for the magnetic, stop and/or fill layers. In one embodiment, the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may have a thickness in the range of about 4 nm to about 20 nm. In another embodiment, the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may have a thickness in the range of about 5 nm to 8 nm. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> is made as thin as possible to limit the distance between a top of the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> and the magnetic regions <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> may have a thickness of about 30 angstroms or less. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> may have a thickness of about 25 angstroms or less. In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> may have a thickness in the range of about 5 angstroms to about 30 angstroms. According to one embodiment, one or more additional layers may be included. For example, the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> may include an overcoat layer, one or more underlayers, or any other layers.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, the structure and dimensions of the various layers and materials of the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> may be configured to minimize a distance between a surface of the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> and a the magnetic regions <b>116</b>. Minimizing the distance between a surface of the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> and the magnetic regions <b>116</b> may allow for better read and write performance because it may allow a read/write head <b>106</b> to be positioned closer to the magnetic regions <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, for example, a distance <b>210</b> between the magnetic regions <b>116</b> and the lubrication layer <b>206</b> may be minimized. In one embodiment, the distance <b>210</b> between the magnetic regions <b>116</b> and the lubrication layer <b>206</b> may be about 3 nanometers (nm) or less. In another embodiment, the distance <b>210</b> may be about 2 nm or less. In another embodiment, the distance <b>210</b> may be about 1 nm or less. In yet another embodiment, the distance <b>210</b> may be about 0 nm. For example, a lubrication layer <b>206</b> may be deposited substantially directly on the magnetic layer <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, the combination of materials used may also vary. In one embodiment, for example, the stop layer <b>204</b> is made from carbon, such as a diamond-like carbon that is hydrogenated, and the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> are made from alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). In one embodiment, the stop layer <b>204</b> is made from carbon and the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> are made from titanium nitride (TiN) or tantalum nitride (TaN). The stop layer <b>204</b> in the above embodiments may be formed of another material such as silicon carbide (SiC), silicon nitride (SiN), boron nitride (BN), boron carbide (BC), or other hard and dense materials.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic flow chart diagram illustrating one embodiment of a method <b>300</b> for fabricating a magnetic storage medium <b>200</b>. The method <b>300</b> may be used, for example, to form the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The steps <b>302</b>-<b>316</b> of the method are exemplary only and may not be included in all embodiments. Any combination of the steps <b>302</b>-<b>316</b> may be included in various embodiments. In one embodiment, for example, only steps <b>306</b>-<b>310</b> may be included. Exemplary operation of the method <b>300</b> will be illustrated in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4I</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the illustrated embodiment, the method <b>300</b> includes depositing <b>302</b> a magnetic layer <b>202</b>. The magnetic layer may be deposited <b>302</b> on top of a substrate <b>208</b> or an underlayer. In one embodiment, the underlayer may be a magnetically soft underlayer, a magnetically hard underlayer, or any other type of underlayer. The magnetic layer may be deposited using any various deposition techniques known in the art. For example, the magnetic layer may be deposited using chemical vapor deposition, sputter deposition, or any other thin film fabrication methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a substrate <b>208</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates the substrate <b>208</b> with a magnetic layer <b>402</b> deposited <b>302</b> thereon. The substrate <b>208</b> depicted is exemplary only and does not necessarily reflect an actual substrate thickness in relation to the magnetic layer <b>402</b>.

In another embodiment, planarizing the fill layer comprises removing substantially all the fill layer <b>406</b> that lies 1 nm or more above the top of the stop layer <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Planarizing <b>310</b> to the stop layer <b>204</b> may be done using any material removal or etching techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, the planarizing <b>310</b> to the stop layer <b>204</b> includes performing a chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). In one embodiment, CMP includes the use of chemical etching combined with abrasion to remove and smooth a surface. In one embodiment, a chemical slurry may be selected for selective etching of material. For example, a chemical slurry for removing the fill layer <b>204</b> but not the stop layer <b>204</b> may be used in some embodiments. This may help to ensure that during CMP the stop layer <b>204</b> is not removed. This may allow for the creation of an extremely flat and smooth surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref> illustrates the surface of the stop layer <b>204</b> and non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> after the fill layer <b>406</b> has been planarized <b>310</b> down to the stop layer <b>204</b>. In one embodiment, planarizing <b>310</b> to the stop layer <b>204</b> may result in a portion of the filler material within the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> being removed. This may result in dips being formed along the surface of the stop layer <b>204</b> and non-magnetic regions <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The method <b>300</b> may also include planarizing <b>312</b> to the magnetic regions <b>116</b>.

In one embodiment, planarizing includes a CMP step using a slurry that selects for the stop layer and not the non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> or the magnetic regions <b>116</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref> illustrates the exposed magnetic regions <b>116</b> after the stop layer <b>204</b> has been removed. In one embodiment, the slurry used to CMP the stop layer is different than the slurry used to CMP the fill layer. In some embodiments, the step of planarizing <b>312</b> a portion of the stop layer <b>204</b> may not be included. For example, the stop layer <b>204</b> may remain substantially in tact following one or more planarization steps. For example, a finished structure for a magnetic recording medium <b>200</b> may include a substantially uniform and intact stop layer <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The method <b>300</b> may include depositing <b>314</b> a lubrication layer <b>206</b>. The lubrication layer <b>206</b> may be deposited <b>314</b> using any available deposition techniques known in the art.

In other words, the stop layer <b>204</b> still extends over the magnetic regions <b>116</b> and has not been removed. For example, the lubrication layer <b>206</b> has been deposited substantially directly on the stop layer <b>204</b> and non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4I</figref> illustrates a magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> where a lubrication layer <b>206</b> has been deposited <b>314</b> after planarizing <b>312</b> to the magnetic regions <b>116</b>. In other words, the stop layer <b>204</b> no longer extends over the magnetic regions <b>116</b> and has been removed. For example, the lubrication layer <b>206</b> has been deposited <b>314</b> substantially directly on the stop layer <b>204</b>, magnetic regions <b>116</b>, and non-magnetic regions <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The method <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one exemplary method for forming a magnetic storage layer <b>200</b>. It is important to note that one or more steps may be omitted or added, in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment, the etching process or steps performed within the method <b>300</b> may be ion-based etch process.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The method <b>300</b> may allow for a reduced number of steps or processing procedures to fabricate or manufacture a magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> while maintaining high quality. For example, the deposition of a stop layer <b>204</b> that is not completely removed may allow for the stop layer to not only facilitate planarization but also to perform a protective layer such that deposition of protective overcoat may be omitted. Additionally, the stop layer <b>204</b> may allow for better adherence to a lubrication layer <b>206</b> while maintaining a small distance between a magnetic region <b>116</b> and the lubrication layer <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">According to one embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>G, and <b>4</b>I all illustrate exemplary embodiments of a magnetic storage medium <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate further embodiments of magnetic storage media <b>200</b> with exemplary variations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a cross-sectional structure of one embodiment of a magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> having an overcoat layer <b>502</b>. In one embodiment, the overcoat layer <b>502</b> is formed of a physically hard material and forms a protective layer over the underlying magnetic regions <b>116</b> and other layers.

According to one embodiment, the dips <b>602</b> may be formed as a result of using method <b>302</b> in forming a magnetic storage medium <b>200</b>. For example, the a planarization of the fill layer <b>406</b> (depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>) may result in a removal of a portion of the fill layer <b>406</b> within the grooves <b>404</b>. Deposition of a lubrication layer <b>206</b> may then result in dips <b>602</b> remaining.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to one embodiment, the dips <b>602</b> may reduce the smoothness or planarity of the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> and may have a detrimental effect on read/write head <b>106</b> flying height. For example, the height at which the read/write head <b>106</b> is required to fly to reduce risk of contact with the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> due to the dips <b>602</b> may decrease the performance of a storage device in which the magnetic storage medium <b>200</b> is used. However, the size of the dips <b>602</b> may be significantly smaller than features found in other bit-patterned media. For example, the dips may have a width <b>604</b> of 10 nm or less. In some embodiments, the dips <b>602</b> may have a width <b>604</b> of 5 nm or less. In one embodiment, the dips <b>602</b> may have a depth <b>606</b> of 5 nm or less.
