<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is generally related to aerosol or liquid sprayers or spray cans such as air fresheners, deodorizers, etc., and more particular to an electrical valve control device for application to such an aerosol or liquid sprayer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The engagement of a conventional automatic sprayer e, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, mainly involves a motor's axle a, a first transmission gear b, a second transmission gear c, and a fan-shaped gear d having an extension d<b>1</b> at an end of its circumferential arc. The extension d<b>1</b> is positioned right above a nozzle e<b>1</b> of the sprayer e.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">After the motor is activated and through the first and second transmission gears b and c, the fan-shaped gear d swings downward and the extension d<b>1</b> pushes the nozzle e<b>1</b>. As such, the content inside the sprayer e is sprayed through the nozzle e<b>1</b>. After the motor stops, the nozzle e<b>1</b> restores itself and raises the fan-shaped gear d, so as to wait for its next engagement. Alternatively, the motor is reversed by a control circuit so that the fan-shaped gear d is restored to its original position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above design can indeed achieve the engagement of the sprayer. However, the design cannot control how much is sprayed from the sprayer. Usually this is achieved by a valve beneath the nozzle e<b>1</b> that will be closed when a certain amount of spray is reached. Then, even though the nozzle e<b>1</b> is still pressed, no more spray is delivered. The disadvantage is that the cost of the valve has to be bore by the sprayer manufacturer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, a major objective of the present invention is to provide a novel electrical valve control device for a sprayer that is easy to assembly, convenient to use, and inexpensive to manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the objective, the electrical valve control device contains a cover member and a base member that are matched and joined together. A motor is joined to the outer surface of the cover member. The motor's axle is configured with an axial gear and threads through the cover member. A transmission gear having a track around its axle engages the axial gear. A valve assembly has a nozzle and a plug tube pointing at opposite directions. The valve assembly further has a channel perpendicular to and connected to the plug tube at one end. The other end of the channel is an open end and is in the same space as the nozzle. A cover piece is positioned in front of the open end of the channel. The cover piece is joined to a first end of a shaft threading through a helical spring. A second end of the shaft is connected to a first end of a lever. A pin is extended from the second end of the lever and is embedded in the transmission gear's track. As such, the transmission gear drives the lever which in turn engages the shaft so that the cover piece is moved away from the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably, the track on the transmission gear is a spiral track.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, a ring is configured at the second end of the lever that surrounds the axle of the transmission gear.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, a fastening ring is plugged into the plug tube, and the plug tube and the fastening ring are altogether threaded into a joining tube.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, two positioning beams are extended from an outer surface of the cover member, each positioning beam has a hook at a top end, and the two positioning beams jointly fasten the motor to the outer surface of the cover member.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, a pin is configured on an inner surface of the cover member for the axially mounting of the transmission gear.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, two openings are configured on the cover and base members at corresponding locations, respectively, so as to allow the nozzle and the joining tube of the valve assembly to thread through.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, an L-shaped tube is configured on the nozzle so as to alter the direction of spray.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The advantages of the present invention over the prior art are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">First, the amount of spray is controlled by the duration of the cover piece's opening the channel, which is in turn controlled by the up and down movement of the lever's ring as the motor's axial gear drives the transmission gear as well as the spiral track.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Secondly, with an L-shaped tube mounted on the nozzle, the spray direction can be altered and adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The foregoing objectives and summary provide only a brief introduction to the present invention. To fully appreciate these and other objects of the present invention as well as the invention itself, all of which will become apparent to those skilled in the art, the following detailed description of the invention and the claims should be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Throughout the specification and drawings identical reference numerals refer to identical or similar parts.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Many other advantages and features of the present invention will become manifest to those versed in the art upon making reference to the detailed description and the accompanying sheets of drawings in which a preferred structural embodiment incorporating the principles of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The following descriptions are exemplary embodiments only, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the following description provides a convenient illustration for implementing exemplary embodiments of the invention. Various changes to the described embodiments may be made in the function and arrangement of the elements described without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an electrical valve control device <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention contains a cover member <b>12</b> and a base member <b>21</b> that are matched and joined together. Two positioning beams <b>13</b> are extended from an outer surface of the cover member <b>12</b>. Each positioning beam <b>13</b> has a hook at a top end and the two positioning beams <b>13</b> jointly fasten a motor <b>11</b> to the outer surface of the cover member <b>12</b>. The cover member has a through hole surrounded by the positioning beams <b>13</b> that allows the motor <b>11</b>'s axle which is configured with an axial gear <b>111</b> to thread through the cover member <b>12</b>. On an inner surface of the cover member <b>12</b>, a pin <b>14</b> is configured beside the through hole and a transmission gear <b>15</b> is mounted axially so that it engages the axial gear <b>111</b>. On an outer side of the transmission gear <b>15</b>, there is an axle <b>17</b> and a spiral track <b>16</b> around the axle <b>17</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a valve assembly <b>18</b> has a nozzle <b>186</b> and a plug tube <b>185</b> pointing at opposite directions. A fastening ring <b>187</b> is plugged into the plug tube <b>185</b>. The plug tube <b>185</b> and the fastening ring <b>187</b> are altogether fitted into a joining tube <b>20</b>. The valve assembly <b>18</b> further has a channel <b>184</b> perpendicular to and connected to the plug tube <b>185</b> at one end. The other end of the channel <b>184</b> is an open end and is in the same space as the nozzle <b>186</b>. A cover piece <b>183</b> is positioned in front of the open end of the channel <b>184</b>. The cover piece <b>183</b> is joined to an end of a shaft <b>181</b> extending through a helical spring <b>182</b>. The other end of the shaft <b>181</b> is connected to an end of a substantially L-shaped lever <b>19</b>. A ring <b>191</b> at the other end of the lever <b>19</b> surrounds the axle <b>17</b> of the transmission gear <b>15</b>. A pin <b>192</b> is extended from the rim of the ring <b>191</b> perpendicularly and is embedded in the spiral track <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref>, the electrical valve control device <b>1</b> is coupled to an aerosol sprayer <b>5</b> by having its joining tube <b>20</b> joined to a top end of the aerosol sprayer <b>5</b>. After such connection, the aerosol sprayer <b>5</b> is opened but the aerosol inside does not leak due to the confinement of the channel <b>184</b>, the fastening ring <b>187</b>, and the cover piece <b>183</b>. When the motor <b>11</b> is not activated, the lever <b>19</b> and the shaft <b>181</b> remain still, and the cover piece <b>183</b> seals the channel <b>184</b>. After the motor <b>11</b> is activated, the axial gear <b>111</b> spins and engages the transmission gear <b>15</b>. The lever <b>19</b>'s pin <b>192</b> is then driven along the spiral track <b>16</b>. As the ring <b>191</b> moves downward, the shaft <b>181</b> is pulled backward and as such the cover piece <b>183</b> is moved away from the channel <b>184</b>. Then, the plug tube <b>185</b>, the channel <b>184</b>, and the nozzle <b>186</b> jointly form a connected path, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The aerosol inside the aerosol sprayer <b>5</b> is as such released through the nozzle <b>186</b>. The amount of aerosol released is dependent on how long the cover piece <b>183</b> opens the channel <b>184</b>. As the lever <b>19</b>'s pin <b>192</b> continues to move along the spiral track <b>16</b>, the ring <b>191</b> moves upward and pushes the shaft <b>181</b> forward. The channel <b>184</b> is then closed again by the cover piece <b>183</b> and the aerosol in the aerosol sprayer <b>5</b> is not released. As the motor <b>11</b> continues to run, the cover piece <b>183</b> opens and closes the channel <b>184</b> periodically and the aerosol in the aerosol sprayer <b>5</b> is released by a fixed amount intermittently.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, the nozzle <b>186</b> can be plugged into an L-shaped tube <b>188</b> so as to alter the direction of the aerosol released.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While certain novel features of this invention have been shown and described and are pointed out in the annexed claim, it is not intended to be limited to the details above, since it will be understood that various omissions, modifications, substitutions and changes in the forms and details of the device illustrated and in its operation can be made by those skilled in the art without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
