<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A self-lock glazing mechanism of two aluminum extrusion profiles, a male profile and a female profile, to self-lock glass panels using beadings. The mechanism functions when a glass panel is positioned on setting blocks over the flat surface of the upper leg of the female profile&#x2014;with spacers between the vertical leg of the female profile and the glass panel and the male profile with the locking tip facing upward on its horizontal leg inserted into the gap between the upper leg and the lower leg of the female profile against the female locking tip above. The locking tips of both male and female profiles are then engaged by tilting the vertical leg of the male profile outward about its built-in fulcrum, and inserting wedges into the space created between the glass panel and the vertical leg of the male profile, for keeping the glass panel locked in position. The mechanism further tightens grip on the edges of the glass panel when the spacers and wedges are replaced by rubber beading of appropriate resilience for glazing to avoid touching metal and to allow expansion and to absorb impacts.</p>

<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The current invention relates to a unique and compact self-lock glazing system composed of two aluminum extrusion profiles&#x2014;a male profile and a female profile&#x2014;designed in such a way to self-lock glass panels using beadings. The mechanism functions when a glass panel is positioned on setting blocks over the flat surface of the upper leg of the said female profile&#x2014;with spacers between the vertical leg of the said female profile and the said glass panel (as illustrated in FIGS. <b>3</b>,<b>4</b>,<b>5</b>,<b>6</b>,<b>7</b>,<b>8</b>) and the said male profile with the locking tip facing upward on its horizontal leg inserted into the gap between the upper leg and the lower leg of the said female profile against the female locking tip above. The locking tips of both male and female profiles are then engaged by tilting the vertical leg of the said male profile outward about its built-in fulcrum, and inserting wedges into the space so created between the said glass panel and the vertical leg of the male profile, for keeping the said glass panel locked in position. The mechanism further tightens grip on the edges of the said glass panel when the said spacers and wedges are replaced by rubber beadings of appropriate resilience (which is mandatory for glazing to avoid touching metal, to allow expansion and to absorb impacts).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The introduction of the said rubber beadings lends a unique dynamism to the mechanism. The inherent resilience of rubber beadings causes a mating action in the locking chamber and the resulting equal and opposite reactions keeps the glass pane lin equilibrium between the vertical tips of both the said male and female profiles by means of the built-in fulcrum. This balancing act of forces remains in the locking system throughout the life of the beadings.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">2. General Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,007,221 entitled &#x201c;snap-in glazing pocket filler&#x201d; was disclosed a snap-in pocket filler for use with a structural frame member having an unused glazing pocket, or for use as gap filler on aluminum profiles to cover the unused area for aesthetic reason.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It was noticed that a proper glazing system was lacking in the market to meet the increasing demand for thicker glazing (e.g. shop fronts and partitions) and it has become a necessity for those skilled in the art to develop a system which must be simple, technically safe and aesthetically impressive.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Aluminum glazing profiles generally available in the market are intended for standard window glazing only. These profiles are used by many people for bigger partition walls with thicker glazing, compromising safety, quality and aesthetic appeal as no other options are available for glazing big partition walls with thicker glass panels than window pane glasses. For maximum visibility of the showrooms, designers insist on frameless glazing with thin frames around the glass panel. Technicians use U channels, in which glass panels are allowed to stand free but these tend to move horizontally due to loose fixing with silicone at the ends.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Some professional pioneers like Dorma (Germany) developed heavy profiles for thicker glass application which require fastening by screws that further should be covered for aesthetic reasons and consequently the work becomes complicated, laborious and eventually expensive. In view of the above factors and considering the demand for faster glazing, the current invention emphasizes the issue of safety while addressing the importance of aesthetic appeal, allowing enough clearance for glazing (so that one could decide the glass size before installing frames at site) and making site installation easy.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The self-lock glazing system consists of two extruded aluminum profiles, a male profile <b>11</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and a female profile <b>12</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> as described in the succeeding paragraphs, designed in such a way to create a secure space for keeping glass panels safely and tightly in position. The important aspect of the invention is that when a glass panel <b>99</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is placed on the upper leg <b>70</b> of the female profile <b>12</b> and the male profile <b>11</b> is inserted and rubber beadings <b>97</b>, <b>98</b> are forced in (by hand) between the said glass panel <b>99</b> and the profiles <b>12</b>, <b>11</b> respectively creates outward forces F, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> on the vertical tips of the said profiles (forcing them apart). The turning moment at the pivotal fulcrum <b>18</b> of the said male profile <b>11</b> forces the locking system together because of the complementary locking tips <b>73</b> and <b>71</b> provided on the profiles as a result, the system interlocks and thus arrest the profiles (<b>11</b> and <b>12</b>) in position; eventually the said glass panel <b>99</b> held in guard (under the pressure of the beadings <b>98</b> and <b>97</b>) of the said vertical tips (<b>32</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 67</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) remains locked.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The self-lock glazing system comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">(a) A female profile <b>12</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the female profile <b>12</b> is a right angled profile having a lower leg <b>69</b> as base, an upper leg <b>70</b> and an upward vertical leg <b>68</b>. The upper leg <b>70</b> is the horizontal cantilever extension from the lower half portion of the vertical leg <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The vertical leg <b>68</b> originates from the horizontal lower leg <b>69</b> at the base and has a vertical face <b>35</b> which ends at about three-fourth the height of the vertical leg <b>68</b> to join an inclined surface <b>34</b> which terminates at the horizontal tip <b>33</b> with adjoining vertical face <b>67</b>. The vertical face <b>67</b> acts as the link for transfer of forces between the glass panel <b>99</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the female profile <b>12</b> and also helps to retain the rubber beading. The vertical face <b>67</b> is followed by a horizontal face <b>66</b> below that ends to a sloping face <b>65</b> which leads to the inside wall <b>64</b> of the vertical leg <b>68</b> that extends down to form a groove <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The said groove <b>60</b> comprises an upper projection <b>63</b>, an upper recess <b>62</b>, followed by the vertical wall <b>61</b> which is parallel to the exterior wall <b>35</b>, a lower recess <b>59</b> and a bottom projection <b>58</b>. The bottom projection <b>58</b> is followed by another vertical face <b>57</b> that curves down to join the upper face <b>56</b> of the upper leg <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The upper leg <b>70</b> which is the horizontal cantilever extension from the lower half portion of the vertical leg <b>68</b>, has an upper flat surface formed by <b>56</b> and <b>54</b> and a groove <b>55</b> in between, and this leg <b>70</b> terminates approximately at two-thirds of the length of the lower leg <b>69</b> at tip <b>53</b> and its bottom has a downwardly sloping protrusion <b>52</b> with a female locking tip <b>71</b> with a mating face <b>51</b> followed by an upper horizontal surface <b>50</b> that curves down to the vertical wall <b>49</b> to form the locking chamber facing downward to the gap formed by the remaining portion of the inside wall <b>49</b> and the adjacent upper surface <b>48</b> up to 42 of the lower leg <b>69</b>; this gap provides access to the said locking chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The said vertical faces <b>67</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>57</b> and <b>49</b> are all in a same straight line and defines the inside wall of the said female profile <b>12</b>. The recess formed by the sloped face <b>65</b> is for accommodating the allowances provided in the grooved rubber beadings.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The top surface of the lower leg <b>69</b> is flat in general, and this top surface starts with a horizontal surface <b>48</b> adjacent to the inner vertical wall <b>49</b> and this horizontal surface <b>48</b> defines the general level of the top surface. On the other end of the leg there is another horizontal surface <b>42</b> which is of same level as <b>48</b>. The horizontal surface <b>42</b> at the other end plays a vital role in the system since it acts as the base for acting the built-in fulcrum <b>18</b> in the said male profile <b>11</b>. The upper surfaces <b>48</b> and <b>42</b> of the lower leg <b>69</b> have two lower horizontal faces <b>46</b> and <b>44</b> in between with a &#x2018;v&#x2019; shaped groove <b>45</b> at its centre. The recessed surface <b>46</b> is connected to the surface <b>48</b> with an inclined surface <b>47</b>. The horizontal recessed surface <b>44</b> is connected with the surface <b>42</b> by an inclined surface <b>43</b>. The &#x2018;v&#x2019;-shaped groove <b>45</b> at the centre acts as a guidance for drilling holes for countersunk screws for fastening the female profile <b>12</b> to the structure. There is another &#x2018;v&#x2019; shaped groove <b>55</b> on the flat surface on top of the upper leg <b>70</b> that facilitates ease of drilling a hole for access to the &#x2018;v&#x2019; shaped groove <b>45</b> vertically below. The &#x2018;v&#x2019;-shaped grooves <b>45</b> and <b>55</b> are required to ensure precision and accuracy of the installation of the glazing system and also to make drilling easier and to the point.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Adjacent to the horizontal surface <b>42</b>, a vertical face <b>41</b> goes down to the bottom surface of the horizontal leg <b>69</b> and this vertical surface <b>41</b> comes in the same line with the outer surface <b>15</b> of the said male profile <b>11</b> when the system is engaged. The bottom surface of the lower leg of the said female profile <b>12</b> has two symmetrical projections <b>36</b> and <b>40</b> at the ends with recess <b>38</b> at centre for proper seating. The recess <b>38</b> is connected to projection <b>36</b> and <b>40</b> with inclined surfaces <b>37</b> and <b>39</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">b) A male profile <b>11</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the said male profile <b>11</b> is an acute angled profile consisting of a horizontal leg <b>72</b> with a locking tip <b>73</b> at one end and vertical leg <b>74</b> at the other end. The horizontal leg <b>72</b> is the base with a lower surface <b>19</b> starting from the lower face <b>20</b> of the locking tip <b>73</b>, and ends with the built-in fulcrum <b>18</b> with an adjoining recess formed by vertical face <b>17</b> and a horizontal face <b>16</b>. The vertical leg <b>74</b> starts from the said recess with a surface <b>15</b> inclined forward and ends at another inclined face <b>14</b> which is further inclined inward to join the horizontal tip <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The locking tip <b>73</b> comprising an upward sloping surface <b>20</b> turns to form another upward sloping surface <b>21</b>, and an adjoining dropping down face <b>22</b> combines to form a unique shape to the locking tip <b>73</b>. The upper surface <b>23</b> of the horizontal leg <b>72</b> curves upward to join the inner vertical wall <b>24</b> which extends up to a groove <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The said groove comprising a lower projection <b>25</b>, an upper projection <b>29</b>, a lower recess <b>26</b>, an upper recess <b>28</b> with a vertical wall <b>27</b> that is parallel to the exterior wall <b>15</b>, a top projection <b>29</b>, joins the interior wall which slopes upward forming an inclined surface <b>30</b> which terminates at the horizontal surface <b>31</b>. The horizontal surface <b>31</b> ends to a vertical face <b>32</b> that joins the horizontal tip <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The horizontal tip <b>13</b> together with a vertical surface <b>32</b> and a bottom surface <b>31</b> helps to retain the rubber beadings.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The mechanism functions when a glass panel <b>99</b> is positioned on packing <b>96</b> over the upper leg <b>70</b> of the said female profile with spacers <b>94</b> between the vertical leg <b>68</b> of the said female profile <b>12</b> and the said glass panel <b>99</b>, and then inserting the horizontal leg <b>72</b> of the said male profile <b>11</b> with its locking tip <b>73</b> facing upward into the gap between the lower leg <b>69</b> and upper legs <b>70</b> of the said female profile, then engaging the locking tips of both male and female profiles by tilting the said male profile <b>11</b> on its built-in fulcrum <b>18</b> by pulling the vertical leg <b>74</b> outward and introducing the wedges <b>95</b> into the space so created between the said glass panel <b>99</b> and the said vertical tip <b>32</b> of the said male profile <b>11</b> to keep the locks engaged and thus the said glass panel <b>99</b> locked in the system; the mechanism further tightens its grip on the edges of the locked glass panel <b>99</b> when the spacers <b>94</b> and wedges <b>95</b> are replaced by rubber beadings <b>97</b> and <b>98</b> of appropriate resilience which enables the said glass panel <b>99</b> to remain in an equilibrium throughout the life of the beading. The vertical plane passing through the centre of the glass panel <b>99</b> will intersect both the male profile <b>11</b> and female profile <b>12</b>, and also intersect the gap of the female profile <b>12</b> and the leg <b>72</b> of the male profile <b>11</b>. Then the horizontal tip <b>33</b> of the vertical leg <b>68</b> of the said female profile <b>12</b> and the horizontal tip <b>13</b> of the vertical leg <b>74</b> of the said male profile <b>11</b> are located at the same height when the glass panel <b>99</b> is positioned and the lock is engaged by tilting the said male profile <b>11</b> on its built-in fulcrum <b>18</b> by pulling the vertical leg <b>74</b> outward and introducing the wedges <b>95</b> into the space so created between the said glass panel <b>99</b> and the said vertical tip <b>32</b> of the said male profile <b>11</b> to keep the locks engaged and thus the said glass panel <b>99</b> locked in the system.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">METHOD OF INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The scientific principles used are the Newton's Law of Motion, the property of elasticity of the rubber and the transmission of the rotational moments of the moving parts around the fulcrum.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The locking system functions due to the combination of a pair of hooking tips and the fulcrum built in the legs of the male and female profiles mating in the locking chamber while retaining the pivotal mating profile (male) firmly in position and the glass panel which is under the grip of the said vertical tips are eventually remain locked.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The pre-determined variables are the sizing of the glass panel and that of the rubber beading. In this arrangement any external forces applied due to conditions like wind or vibrations caused by physical movements&#x2014;whose action may act to dislodge the glass from its set position&#x2014;only acts to further tighten the fastening mechanism of the system to arrest the glass panel in position.</p>
