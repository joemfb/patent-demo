<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A foldable lock includes a first body, a second body, and a rod set including a plurality of pivotally connected locking rods. The first body and the second body are separately pin-connected to a locking rod. The first body, the second body, and the plurality of the locking rods can have rotational movement in two-dimensional space with the pin joint as a rotation axis, which affects relative position of the first body and the second body. The first body has a first mating face, and the second body has a second mating face. The mating faces can separate from or mate with each other. The bodies and the rod set constitutes a closed ring by means of matching of the mating faces; at this time, a locking operation will let the mating faces be unable to separate from each other, namely the bodies will not move relatively. At the same time, if the closed ring does not circle any object, the rod set can further be rotated to a stacking state for storage.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This non-provisional application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/357,313 filed on Jun. 22, 2010. The entire contents of the above application is hereby incorporated by reference into the present application.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to a lock apparatus. Particularly, the present invention relates to a foldable lock having a foldable rod set for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As diversity of lifestyle and improvements in technology increases, the function and form of lock apparatuses also varies to meet the different requirements. Besides, because of widespread use of vehicles and related movable devices, lock apparatuses for outdoor movable devices were developed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The way of securing bicycles, motorcycles, or other movable objects usually includes securing them to an immobile article, such as a pillar or other fixed facilities. Therefore, excluding the lock body, a lock apparatus for the purpose mentioned above usually has a cable for circling the fixed facilities and the object to be secured. For example, cable locks and chain locks were developed for this purpose. However, cable locks require rolling-up for storage while chain locks are not convenient for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, a foldable lock having a plurality of pin-connected locking rods for circling is provided. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, the locking rods <b>51</b> are usually flat-shaped. In addition to being able to expand to circle an object, the locking rods <b>51</b> can also be rotated to a stacking state and form a block having a regular shape for storage in a box or a bag. However, the connection of the rod set <b>5</b> with the body <b>1</b> is usually through means of aiming and positioning the locking rod <b>51</b>, which has a locking end <b>53</b>, at a trough <b>12</b> of a body <b>1</b> so that a locking bolt <b>13</b> can be therefore fastened by a locking hole <b>532</b> of the locking end <b>53</b> in order to accomplish a locking operation. However, a slit <b>533</b> in the locking end <b>53</b> for the locking bolt <b>13</b> to pass through and rest at the trough <b>12</b> is too small for operation, and therefore improvements are needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a foldable lock capable of forming a closed ring to secure an object to an immobile article.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another object of the present invention to provide a foldable lock capable of forming a closed ring by means of matching two complementary mating faces of two bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is another object of the present invention to provide a foldable lock capable of being unfolded and expanded when used, and to be folded to form a block having a regular volume when in storage.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The foldable lock of the present invention includes a first body, a second body, and a rod set. The first body has a first mating face, the second body has a second mating face, wherein the two bodies can be separated from each other or be conjugated by matching the mating faces. The rod set is composed of a plurality of pin-connected locking rods. In addition, the first body and the second body are respectively pin-connected to the locking rods at the ends of the rod set. Each locking rod can have rotational movement in two-dimensional space with the pin joint as the rotation axis. This rotational movement allows the first body and the second body to separate from or conjugate with each other. When the bodies are completely conjugated with each other, the bodies constitute a closed ring together with the rod set. If the closed ring does not encircle any object, the rod set can further be rotated to a stacking state and form a block configuration having a regular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first body has a protruding rotatable fastener and a guiding protrusion on the first mating face. The rotatable fastener is a part of a lock body and rotatably driven by the operation of the lock body. In comparison to the rotatable fastener and the guiding protrusion, a containing trough and a guiding groove are formed on the second mating face. The guiding groove of the second mating face and the guiding protrusion of the first mating face guide the rotatable fastener to enter the containing trough so that the rotatable fastener is rotatable in the containing trough in response to locking/unlocking operations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The dimensional size of the first body and the second body suitably fits in a user's palm while the guiding components of the bodies are easy to understand and operate. Therefore during operation, the left palm and the right palm may respectively hold the first and second bodies, moving them toward each other. The movement can be operated in coordination with the guide of the guiding components to achieve conjugation of the bodies, wherein the rotatable bodies further shorten the time which is needed to orient and conjugate the bodies.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention provides a foldable lock. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref> are perspective views of an embodiment of the present invention. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows, the foldable lock includes a first body <b>110</b>, a second body <b>120</b>, and a rod set <b>200</b> composed of a plurality of locking rods <b>210</b>, wherein the first body <b>110</b> has a first mating face <b>111</b> and may include therein or be itself a lock body. The second body <b>120</b> has a second mating face <b>121</b>, wherein the planes in which the mating faces rests are mutually overlapping or are parallel to each other. Moreover, the arrangement of the locking rods <b>210</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The plurality of locking rods <b>210</b> are pivotally connected in series and connected to the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> at two ends of the rod set <b>200</b>, wherein each locking rod <b>210</b> is rotatable in two-dimension space with a connection joint as a rotation axis. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the locking rod <b>210</b> is usually flat-shaped and at least one end of each locking rod <b>210</b> includes a first end <b>211</b> and a second end <b>212</b>, wherein every locking rod is connected to, especially pin-connected to the second end <b>212</b> or the first end <b>211</b> of the adjacent locking rod by the first end <b>211</b>, which constitutes a connection, especially a pin joint <b>220</b>. Each locking rod <b>210</b> with the pin joint <b>220</b> as the rotation axis can have rotational movement A. The rotational movement is in two-dimensional space. Namely, the planes on which the locking rods <b>210</b> are resting are parallel to each other. In addition, the locking rods further include a first locking rod <b>210</b><i>a </i>and a second locking rod <b>210</b><i>b </i>at the ends of the rod set <b>200</b>, and are respectively connected with the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> by the second end <b>212</b>. The rotation of the first locking rod <b>210</b><i>a </i>or the second locking rod <b>210</b><i>b </i>can therefore directly drive the movement of the first body <b>110</b> or the second body <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition to driving the movement of the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> through the first locking rod <b>210</b><i>a </i>and the second locking rod <b>210</b><i>b</i>, the rotation of at least one third locking rods <b>210</b><i>c </i>may also cause movement in the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> so that they change their relative positions. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows, through the rotating of the plurality of the locking rods <b>210</b> of the rod set <b>200</b>, the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> will be positioned in alignment along a line <b>500</b>. Meanwhile, the first mating face <b>111</b> and the second mating face <b>121</b> are opposite to and come in contact with each other. As a result, the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> conjugate with each other. The conjugated lock bodies and the rod set <b>200</b> form a closed ring <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the preferred embodiment of the present invention mentioned above, wherein the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> respectively has the first mating face <b>111</b> and the second mating face <b>121</b>. The first body <b>110</b> has the lock body disposed therein. In addition, the first mating face <b>111</b> further has a protrusion portion (described later), and the second mating face <b>121</b> has a cavern portion (described later). The outlines of the protrusion portion and the cavern portion are complementary to each other. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the rod set <b>200</b> includes eight locking rods <b>210</b>, wherein seven locking rods have the same length and the remaining rod has a length that is longer than the other seven rods. Each locking rod has the first end <b>211</b> and the second end <b>212</b>, whereon a round hole is formed for the connecting components, such as a rivet or screw, to connect to adjacent locking rods and other adjacent components. The third locking rod <b>210</b><i>c </i>is pin-connected by its first end <b>211</b> to the second end <b>212</b> or the first end <b>211</b> of the adjacent locking rod, and/or by its second end <b>212</b> to the first end <b>211</b> of the adjacent locking rod. The first locking rod <b>210</b><i>a </i>and the second locking rod <b>210</b><i>b </i>are respectively pin-connected to the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> by the second end <b>212</b>, wherein the pin joint of the first locking rod <b>210</b><i>a </i>and the first body <b>110</b> is located at a connection portion <b>112</b> disposed outside the first body <b>110</b>. The connection joint of the second locking rod <b>210</b><i>b </i>and the second body <b>120</b> is located inside the second body <b>120</b>, and therefore the second locking rod <b>210</b><i>b </i>is preferably longer. Each locking rod <b>210</b> and the body can have rotational movement A in two-dimensional space, with their pin joints as the rotation axes, and therefore drive the bodies to conjugate.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As mentioned above, the first mating face <b>111</b> has a protrusion portion <b>60</b>, wherein the preferred embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. As the figure shows, the first mating face <b>111</b> of the first body <b>110</b> has a protrusion portion <b>60</b>. The protrusion portion <b>60</b> includes a guiding protrusion <b>135</b> and a blocking portion <b>136</b> that is connected to the guiding protrusion <b>135</b>. A surface of the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> and a surface of the blocking portion <b>136</b> facing toward the second mating face <b>121</b> are on the same plane and connected with each other to form the first mating face <b>111</b><i>b</i>. In the embodiment of the present invention, the number of guiding protrusions <b>135</b> may be but not limited to two. As the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows, two congruent guiding protrusion <b>135</b> can be seen in a front side view of the first mating face <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, the first mating faces <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b </i>of the protrusion portion <b>60</b> (including the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> and the blocking portion <b>136</b>) are parallel to each other. The guiding protrusion <b>135</b> and the blocking portion <b>136</b> have a side surface <b>138</b> which is simultaneously perpendicular to both the first mating faces <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b</i>. The protrusion portion <b>60</b> of the first mating face <b>111</b> enables the first mating face <b>111</b> to complement and match the second mating face <b>121</b> (described later).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The function of the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> mentioned above, in conjunction with a guiding groove of the second mating face <b>121</b>, is to guide the mating of the two mating faces. The mating of the two mating faces <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> makes the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> enter a containing trough (described later). As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> show, the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> is exposed from the first mating surface <b>111</b> and is disposed between the guiding protrusions <b>135</b>. In this embodiment, the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> is a component belonging to or coupled with an end of the lock body thereon and protrudes out of a containing hole <b>130</b> where the lock body is disposed. The other end of the lock body has a key hole. As shown in the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4C</figref>, the key hole <b>132</b> is positioned at the rear side of the first body <b>110</b>, which is contrary to the first mating face <b>111</b>. When a key is inserted into the key hole <b>132</b>, it is able to rotate the key, if the lock body is a key lock, to drive the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> to rotate as well. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows, when the inserted key is rotating, the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> rotates in a counterclockwise direction B when viewed from the front side of the first mating face <b>111</b>, wherein the preferred greatest rotation angle is 90 degrees. In summary, after the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> and the guiding groove together guide the mating faces to match and to position the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> in the containing trough, a rotation of the inserted key will make the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> rotate in the containing trough (described later) and accomplish the locking operation, which allows the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> to conjugate. In other embodiments, the key lock can be replaced by a combination lock.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5B</figref> show, in comparison to the protrusion portion <b>60</b> of the first mating face <b>111</b> of the first body <b>110</b>, the second mating face <b>121</b> of the second body <b>120</b> has the complementary cavern portion <b>90</b> that includes a guiding groove <b>122</b> formed on a second mating face <b>121</b><i>a</i>, a containing trough <b>125</b>, and a second mating face <b>121</b><i>b</i>, wherein the guiding groove <b>122</b> corresponds to the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> and has a number of two. The guiding groove <b>122</b>, in conjunction with the guiding protrusion <b>135</b>, can guide the mating faces <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> to match and to position the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> within the containing trough <b>125</b>. The cavern portion <b>90</b> has an indentation having the second mating face <b>121</b><i>b </i>and a side surface. The side surface is perpendicular to both the second mating face <b>121</b><i>b </i>and <b>121</b><i>a</i>, and the second mating surface <b>121</b><i>b </i>together with the side surface is complementary to the blocking portion <b>136</b>. Furthermore, the design of the containing trough <b>125</b> is in concert with accommodation and rotation of the rotatable fastener <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As the mentioned above, the guiding groove <b>122</b> and the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> guide the mating faces <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> to match with each other by allowing the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> to enter the complementary guiding groove <b>122</b>, wherein the guiding groove <b>122</b> has an open end <b>123</b> and a closed end <b>124</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The open end <b>123</b> is positioned at the edge of the second mating face <b>121</b><i>a</i>, and the closed end is positioned within the second mating face <b>121</b><i>a</i>. The guiding protrusion <b>135</b> enters the guiding groove <b>122</b> through the open end <b>123</b> to a degree that the end of the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> entering the guiding groove <b>122</b> first reaches the closed end <b>124</b>. Furthermore, the design of the containing trough <b>125</b> is in concert with accommodation and rotation of the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> therein. As shown in the dotted-line circle figure of the enlarged containing trough <b>125</b>, a position b is at an opening <b>1250</b> of the containing trough <b>125</b>. The opening <b>1250</b> allows the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> to enter the containing trough <b>125</b> as the first mating surface <b>111</b> mates with the second mating surface <b>121</b>. A distance between positions a and b is equal to a distance between positions a&#x2032; and b&#x2032;, wherein a line connecting position a and position b is perpendicular to a line connecting position a&#x2032; and position b&#x2032;. A route from positions a to a&#x2032; is an arc portion in concert with rotation of the rotatable fastener <b>133</b>. By means of guiding the guiding components (<b>135</b> and <b>122</b>), the fastener rotatable <b>133</b> will enter the containing trough <b>125</b> from position b and occupy the space having a length equal to the distance between the positions a and b. When the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> rotates, the end of the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> that enters the containing trough first will move from position a to position a&#x2032; along the route of the arc portion while the other end moves from position b to position b&#x2032; along the route of the other arc portion. Therefore, after rotating <b>90</b> degrees, the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> will occupy the space having a length equal to the distance between positions a&#x2032; and b&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the first mating face <b>111</b> and the second mating face <b>121</b> match by means of guiding the guiding components, the first body and the second body also conjugates with each other at the same time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the closed ring <b>300</b> composed of the conjugated first body <b>110</b> and second body <b>120</b>, as well as the rod set <b>200</b>. In order to form the closed ring <b>300</b>, the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> has to move relatively to reach a position along a line, such as a line L, where the first mating face <b>111</b> and the second mating face <b>121</b> are complementary to and contact with each other, and a projection of the first mating face <b>111</b> is completely on the second mating face <b>121</b>; and vice versa. For achieving the position and overlapping of the mating faces, the relative movement of the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b>, in the embodiment of the present invention, is that the second body <b>120</b> relatively move from the left side of the first mating face <b>111</b> of the first body <b>110</b> to the line L; and vice versa. Therefore, the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> of the first mating face <b>111</b> can come closer to the open end <b>123</b> of the second mating face <b>121</b>. In other embodiments, the relative movement of bodies may be that the second body <b>120</b> relatively moves from the right side of the first mating face <b>111</b> of the first body <b>110</b> to the line L. When the bodies relatively moves to a degree that the partial first mating face <b>111</b> and the partial second mating face <b>121</b> start to contact each other, the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> will enter the guiding groove <b>122</b> through the open end <b>123</b> and therefore the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> will enter the containing trough <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the mating faces of the conjugated bodies, wherein the second mating face <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the second body <b>120</b> contacts with the first mating face <b>111</b><i>a </i>(not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). The matching of the first mating face <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the second mating face <b>121</b><i>a </i>starts when the first mating face <b>111</b><i>a </i>contacts with the second mating face <b>121</b><i>b</i>. A cross-sectional view of the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> and the blocking portion <b>136</b> are also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, wherein the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> is completely within the complementary guiding groove <b>122</b>. At this time, the top surface of the blocking portion <b>136</b> (belonging to the first mating face <b>111</b><i>b</i>) contacts with the second mating face <b>121</b><i>b</i>. In summary, the first mating face <b>111</b> and the second mating face <b>121</b> overlap. In addition, the conjugated bodies cannot move relatively at random. Only a movement C that the guiding protrusion <b>135</b> moves in a direction opposite to the direction in which the guiding portion <b>135</b> enter the guiding groove <b>122</b> is allowable.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In conclusion, after the bodies conjugate, the inserted key in the key hole will be able to rotate to drive the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> to rotate in the containing trough <b>125</b>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B-7C</figref> show, it can be seen that the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> rotates clockwise. Namely, the end of the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> entering the containing trough <b>125</b> first will move from positions a to a&#x2032; along a first arc portion <b>126</b> while the other end of the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> will move from the position b at the opening <b>1250</b> to the position b&#x2032; along a second arc portion <b>127</b>. In other words, the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> rotates 90 degrees. After the rotation, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> shows, the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> occupies the space having length equal to the distance between positions a&#x2032; and b&#x2032;. At least one stopping portion is further disposed in the containing trough <b>125</b> to limit rotation of the rotatable fastener <b>133</b>. Particularly, the rotatable fastener <b>133</b> interferes with at least a stopping portion (which is a first stopping portion <b>141</b> and a second stopping portion <b>142</b>), to stop rotating in an engaging state. Therefore the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> cannot have the movement C and thus the locking operation is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> show the perspective views of the conjugated bodies. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows, when the foldable lock is utilized to secure an object, such as vehicle, the first mating face <b>111</b> of the first body <b>110</b> mates with the second mating face <b>121</b> of the second body <b>120</b> and the first body <b>110</b> is engaged with the second body <b>120</b> due to the operations of the lock boy as well as the rotatable fastener, so that the conjugated and locked first body <b>110</b> and second body <b>120</b> will not move relatively, and together with the rod set <b>200</b> is in the expanded state forming a closed ring <b>300</b> with the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b> to secure the object. In addition, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows, when the foldable lock is not in use, the first locking rod <b>210</b><i>a </i>and the second locking rod <b>210</b><i>b </i>may be rotated to be parallel with each other to the stacking state, wherein the locking rods <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, <b>210</b><i>c </i>form a block configuration together with the first body <b>110</b> and the second body <b>120</b>. In the block configuration, the first locking rod <b>210</b><i>a </i>and the second locking rod <b>210</b><i>b </i>are apart from each other with the third locking rods <b>210</b><i>c </i>in between, wherein a perpendicular distance D exists between the first locking rod <b>210</b><i>a </i>and the second locking rod <b>210</b><i>b</i>. Since the locking rods are stacked on each other, the perpendicular distance D is only slightly greater than or substantially equal to a sum of the thickness of the six stacked third locking rods <b>210</b><i>c</i>. Therefore, the closed ring <b>300</b> can be adjusted to a stacking state, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows, for storage by rotating the locking rods <b>210</b>.</p>
