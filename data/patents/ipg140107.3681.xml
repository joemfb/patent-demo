<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method of use thereof for facilitating restaurant wait staff notification of a patron requiring service and of the type of service required. More particularly, this invention is directed to an apparatus and method for visually communicating the service needs of a patron in a restaurant, or similar establishment, by means of high visibility lit indicators.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The prior art is typified by signaling devices that comprise a radio frequency transmitting device placed at the restaurant patron's table with a receiving device located centrally or distributed to pagers to notify wait staff that service is required. Typically transmitting type devices have been preferred due to the wait staff's generally poor visibility of an alert indicator located at the table. Other types of signaling devices are table based visible semaphore or light emitting devices. Of these devices, the prior art table based signaling devices can generally be grouped as those that signal by means of a lit indicator and those that utilize a non-lit flagging element or marker. Non-lit devices are disadvantaged in restaurant environments where the tables are located in low lighting areas as wait staff may have difficulties identifying that a non-lit flagging or marker device has been activated. Depending upon the environment and construction an activated non-lit device does not draw attention as well as a lighted device. Lighted indicator signaling devices located at the table facilitate the wait staff to survey the tables from a distance to determine if service is required; however, the indicator must be clearly visible to the wait staff without having to visually search for the device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A disadvantage of using light emitting devices is the high level power required to activate the light indicator, particularly for battery power driven devices. Consequently, a short battery life is a limiting factor and disadvantage for such devices. In order to provide high visibility from many view angles, as required in a restaurant environment, the distribution of light must be broad thereby requiring yet more power as compared to a light source directed in a narrow field. Battery driven prior art devices that present an indicator light at the table for purposes of signaling for service typically lack sufficient light distribution to provide a distinctive indicator from most angles thus reducing visibility by the wait staff.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is important that an indicator be visible to staff by merely glancing toward a table without having to search for a device on the table. A portable device may be placed anywhere on the table and hence the staff does not have a known reference point to check when scanning tables to determine if service is required.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As illustrated, improved communications between the wait staff and the restaurant patron has many beneficiary effects including, but not limited to, an improved overall experience by the patron, increased patron count by decreasing the total meal time, and increased wait staff efficiency. What is needed is an improved battery power driven low cost wait staff signaling apparatus locatable at the patron's table capable of communicating patron requests to the wait staff and providing high visibility so as to noticeable to the wait staff by glancing at the table and without having to visually search for the device on the table.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to wait staff signaling devices and methods and, more specifically, to a low power portable wait staff signaling apparatus located at a patron's table utilizing color coded high visibility illuminated indicators controllable by a patron for purposes of signaling to wait staff and communicating the type of service required, thereby substantially obviating one or more of the problems due to the limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is a portable apparatus with a plurality of illuminating indicators controlled by the restaurant patron to indicate that service is required; the apparatus having large illuminated indicator surfaces capable of distributing light in a broad range of angles. The patron activates a self-powered illuminating indicator or indicators by means of activator switches which cause corresponding indicators to light. The need for service is signaled by activating the device and the type of service required is communicated by the color coding of the illuminated indicator and/or by the combinations of activated indicators. The apparatus is placed on the table by the wait staff and is activated by the patron. The illuminated indicator is typically deactivated after the service is provided or after attention of the wait staff is accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A secondary illuminating optic is provided, in each indicator, having substantially a rectangular shape with light collector wing element portions on two sides. The lens provides functionality to maximize the transmission of light from light emitting diodes (LEDs) having a standard T lens thereby increasing the power efficiency of the apparatus. The secondary illuminating optic also distributes the light from the light emitting diodes in a manner to maximize visibility and aesthetics in a table top restaurant application by providing an evenly distributed light glow over the upwardly facing surface of the lens while also providing a high intensity narrow beam from the front and rear exitant sides of the lens and at a low angle to the table top thereby directing a high visibility lighted indication to the wait staff.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the invention to provide an improved visual signal device with high visibility from many angles and a method to communicate service requests to wait staff at a distance without the necessity of wires, radio or other communications linking to a separate receiving system. The secondary illuminating optics are fashioned to provide appropriate light intensity at respective viewing angles.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another objective of the invention is to provide an illuminated indicator permits effective signaling in all light level restaurant environments wherein non-lit indicators are not usable due to darkness or lit indicators are not usable due washout in medium to high light levels. The low angle narrow beams generated by the secondary lens optic facilitate visibility in higher light level applications.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further objective is facilitate portable use by providing high visibility indicators being battery driven and having an acceptable operational life. The light concentrator appendages of the secondary optics lens minimizes optical coupling losses with the light emitting diodes of the indicators.</p>

Each illuminating indicator comprises a non-refractive optical lens cover portion at <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> molded into the top surface of the housing <b>20</b> which is optionally colored; and, a high efficiency transparent lens insert being a secondary illuminating optic secured in a recess, in the bottom of the non-refractive optical lens covers, sized to receive the lens insert disposed directly below each non-refractive optical lens cover.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each indicators is optionally labeled with text or a symbol representing the type of service requested with the indicator is activated. Example symbols are shown in the top plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> wherein lens <b>22</b> has a waiter, being a symbol for general service, lens <b>24</b> has a coffee cup, being a symbol for beverage refill, and lens <b>26</b> has a dollar sign for requesting the check.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the apparatus being battery operated has a power switch <b>30</b> located in a recess <b>32</b> in the bottom housing plate <b>28</b> which is removable by releasing securing fastener <b>34</b> so as to gain access to a battery compartment for replacement purposes. The power switch <b>30</b> is provided to deactivate the device thereby eliminating any power drain of the internal batteries when not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, being a front elevation view of the apparatus, the generally rectangular shape of the housing <b>20</b> is visible. The housing has a top portion <b>36</b> and a bottom portion <b>38</b> wherein the bottom portion has expanded dimensions and has an inner recess sized to fit over the outside of the top portion <b>36</b> of the housing <b>20</b> such that the devices may be stacked upon each other for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The right side elevation view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, further illustrates the rectangular shape of the housing <b>20</b> with the lower portion <b>38</b> sized to fit over the top portion <b>36</b> of another identical device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Details of the spatial arrangement of the elements of the device are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> where the first, second and third high efficiency secondary illuminating optic lens inserts <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are positioned below and in contact with the corresponding colored white, blue and green translucent lens covers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. The integral control module <b>46</b> is positioned below the lens inserts and provides the electrical control for the apparatus. The control module <b>46</b> is in electrical connectivity with a battery power supply, illustrated, in part, at <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>. The control module <b>46</b> comprises a printed circuit board having capacitive touch pad traces etched in positions directly adjacent and below the lens inserts <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>44</b>. The control module <b>46</b> further has electronic circuitry for detecting the presence of a user in proximity of the touch pad by means of capacitive touch detection circuitry. A microprocessor, also incorporated in the control module, is programmed to activate or deactivate light emitting diode (LED) lamps responsive to a touch being detected. The microprocessor is further programmed to provide power management so as to maximize battery life wherein the device enters a low power mode when no touch activity is detected. Further the microprocessor may flash the lamps to indicate a low battery condition, provide a variable flash rate dependent upon the time the lamps have been active, or shut the lamps off after a period of time to save power. Still further, the microprocessor is programmed to allow only one indicator to be illuminated at any given time.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Again in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the control module <b>46</b> further comprises a power switch <b>30</b> protruding downwardly through inner housing <b>50</b>. The inner housing <b>50</b> also forms a battery holder with electrical battery contacts <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> providing electrical communication to the integral control module. The power switch <b>30</b> is accessible through power switch recess opening <b>32</b> to allow a user to disable the device when not in use. Note that the inner housing <b>50</b> is secured to housing <b>20</b> by means of inner housing fastener <b>48</b> thereby allowing a user to remove the bottom plate <b>28</b> by removing bottom fastener <b>34</b> to gain access to the batteries without gaining access to the integral control module <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, being a cross section view taken on Line <b>7</b>-<b>7</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the top of the first, second, and third lens inserts <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>44</b> are shown separated by light baffles <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and <b>66</b> thereby preventing light from leaking over from one illuminator assembly to the next. The lens inserts are secondary illuminating optics designed to maximize the light capture from two LEDs each at <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>, and <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> respectively. The secondary illuminating optic is designed to capture and redirect the light from the LEDs across the top surface of the lens insert upwardly and out opposing vertical exitant side surfaces so as to direct light out the front and back sides of the apparatus. The projection of light out the side provides a narrow rectangular distribution of light at a low angle relative to a table top surface and having a higher intensity than out the top surface. This low angle higher intensity beam is designed to provide further distance for visibility to wait staff, that typically would be viewing at a lower angle as they are distant from a table, while providing a lower intensity upward illumination towards guests seated at the table.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the recessed fit of the lens insert <b>40</b> within the non-refractive lens cover <b>22</b>. Note that the outwardly faces side edges of the lens insert <b>40</b> are also flush with and behind the cover <b>22</b> so as to provide an exit path for the exitant light beam out the side of the apparatus. Note also the spacing between the inner housing <b>50</b> and the integral control module <b>46</b>, therein provided to distance the batteries <b>52</b> and <b>82</b> from the integral control module as a closer proximity of the batteries to the integral control module is disruptive to the capacitive touch detection mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the bosses <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, and <b>92</b> are representative of bosses, extending from the bottom of the housing bottom plate <b>28</b>, positioned periodically around the exterior of the recess of the bottom portion <b>38</b> of the housing <b>20</b> so as to provide a snug fit over the top portion <b>36</b> of the housing <b>20</b> of another device. The stacking facility is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> wherein the top of the housing of another device <b>84</b> is positioned within the recess of the bottom plate and cradled by bosses <b>90</b> and <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also note in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> that the user's figure, when touching or in close proximity to the lens cover <b>26</b> provides an increase in electrical capacitance which is detected by the integrated control panel which in turn directs the LED lamps associated with the lens cover to be activated or deactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Of particular importance in this embodiment of the present invention is the secondary illuminating optic lens insert. The design is critical to operation of the apparatus. An embodiment of the lens is shown at <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. An LED lamp with a T type design generally emits light in a conical projection from the top of the LED at typically 20 to 30 degrees. In order to provide high efficiency, a secondary illuminating optic lens is provided to maximize the capture of the emitted light and redirect the light for useful purposes. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 100</figref>, the secondary illuminating optic lens comprises a flat rectangular optic having a top surface and bottom surface, a front <b>118</b> and rear <b>120</b> vertical exitant surface, a first and second wing shaped portions <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, each comprising an incident refractive surface <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> and an optically active reflective surface <b>112</b> and <b>110</b>, forming the sides of the lens. The lens thickness is the same or greater than the width of the LED T lens utilized and may be constructed of any suitable optical material. The incident refractive surfaces <b>116</b> and <b>114</b> are designed in an arch shaped curvature to match the cross sectional profile of the LED for providing efficient light and optical coupling between the LED and the lens. The second optically active surface being a reflective surface, within the wing portion, is shown at <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, along the outer surface of the wing portion, wherein the surface is contoured outwardly relative to the top of the lens so as to reflect light inwardly and downwardly into the interior of the lens. Further, these surfaces are contoured to distribute and direct light across the interior of the lens so as to provide even illumination of the bottom surface of the lens and positioned to allow even distribution of light out the vertical exitant side surfaces <b>118</b> and <b>120</b>. Two wings are provided, positioned on opposite sides and opposing, such that each wing illuminates the respective half of the lens towards which the LED is directed. Light is directly channeled to the vertical exitant side surface in the direction of the illuminating LED. The bottom of the lens <b>100</b> further comprises a grating <b>122</b> designed to reflect and diffuse light from the wing portions <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> upwardly and uniformly to the top surface of the lens thereby providing even upward illumination across the entire top surface of illuminating optic lens.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Example light ray pathways are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, at top plan view of the secondary illuminating lens <b>100</b>. Light emitted by LED <b>104</b> is captured by the incident surface <b>116</b> of the first wing portion and reflected by the reflective surface <b>110</b> into the interior and bottom of the lens at <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> while the opposing vertical exitant surface is directly illuminated, without reflection, from the LED at <b>134</b>. Similarly, light emitted by LED <b>102</b>, facing the opposing direction, is captured by the incident surface <b>114</b> of the second wing portion and reflected by reflective surface <b>112</b> into the interior and bottom of the lens at <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> while the opposing vertical exitant side surface is directly illuminated, without reflection, at <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Note that the reflective surfaces of the wing portions may also be contoured to illuminate the same interior and bottom portions of the lens as the exitant side surface.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring lastly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the optical effect of the grated surface <b>122</b> of the lens <b>100</b> is illustrated wherein the example ray pathways <b>142</b>, initially reflected by wing surface <b>110</b>, is reflected to and out the top surface <b>140</b> of the lens by the grating <b>122</b>. Many pathways are available and, like pathway <b>146</b>, light may be reflected to the top surface directly. The net resulting illumination is even and uniform across the top surface thereby providing a uniform glow appearance to the entire lens cover when the LEDs are activated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The apparatus is powered on by pressing the power switch. After placement on a table, a user brings one's finger within close proximity of the lens cover illustrating the type of service required. The integral control module detects the increased capacitance induced by the user's finger near the lens cover and, performing as a proximity switch, activates the LED lamps within the associated indicator assembly. The secondary illuminating optic lens of the assembly directs the LED light and provides a uniform upwardly directed light through the lens cover. A high intensity narrow beam of light is also projected from the front and rear of the device to provide high visibility to wait staff at a distance and a low viewing angle to the table top. The indicator is deactivated by means of placing one's finger in close proximity to the indicator a second time.</p>
