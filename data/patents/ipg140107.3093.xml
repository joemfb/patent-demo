<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The described subject matter relates generally to laser drilling, and more particularly to providing shallow-angled holes in coated components.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Combustors of gas turbine engines are subjected to high temperatures and effusion holes can be used to direct air to cool combustor components such as combustor liner, dome and heat shield. Effusion holes extend through the component at a shallow angle with respect to the surface of the component, for efficiently cooling without risking a reduction in combustion temperature. Laser beam drilling of effusion holes in combustor components has confronted challenges. A combustor component is coated with a thermal barrier coating (TBC). Although a TBC layer is about 30% or less of, for example a heat shield thickness, it consumes more than 60% of the laser drilling energy, due to TBC properties such as heat resistance and poor thermal conductivity. Laser pulse energy is utilized to enable drilling through the TBC layer, but that laser pulse energy is too high for drilling through the base metal under the TBC, which causes excessive recast layer. The shallow angle of the effusion holes increases the distance which the laser beam has to drill through and increases the laser strike area on the component surface. This causes the intensity of the laser pulse to dissipate. Furthermore, shallow holes with an angle to the surface equal to or less than 20 degrees, may cause relatively long cracks at the interface between the TBC and the base metal. Crack length and the area subject to cracks increase as hole angle to surface decreases. Coating cracks are the main contributor to TBC spallation and chipping which risk part scrap or reduced part life in gas turbine engines.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, there is a need to provide improvements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It will be noted that throughout the appended drawings, like features are identified by like reference numerals.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a gas turbine engine as an example of the application of the described subject matter, which includes a housing or nacelle <b>10</b>, a core casing <b>13</b>, a low pressure spool assembly seen generally at <b>12</b> which includes a fan assembly <b>14</b>, a low pressure compressor assembly <b>16</b> and a low pressure turbine assembly <b>18</b> and a high pressure spool assembly seen generally at <b>20</b> which includes a high pressure compressor assembly <b>22</b> and a high pressure turbine assembly <b>24</b>. The core casing <b>13</b> surrounds the low and high pressure spool assemblies <b>12</b> an <b>20</b> in order to define a main fluid path (not numbered) therethrough including a combustor <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The combustor <b>26</b> includes various combustor components such as liners, heat shields, etc. One combustor component <b>28</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which includes a base metal <b>30</b>, as a substrate, coated with a thermal barrier coating (TBC) <b>34</b> attached thereto. The thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the base metal <b>30</b> are secured together, for example by a layer of bond coat (BC) <b>32</b> disposed therebetween. Effusion holes are distributed over an area of the combustor component <b>28</b>. An example of one effusion hole <b>36</b> shown in the combustor component <b>28</b> is cylindrical and extends through the combustor component <b>28</b> including the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>, bond coat <b>32</b> and the base metal <b>30</b>. The effusion hole <b>36</b> has a central axis <b>38</b> disposed at a non-zero shallow-angle of, for example 20 degrees or less with respect to a top surface <b>40</b> formed by the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The effusion hole <b>36</b> may be formed by applying a pulse laser beam energy to the combustor component <b>28</b>. As previously discussed, due to the shallow angle of the effusion holes <b>36</b> relative to the to the top surface <b>40</b> and due to the different material properties of the respective thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>, bond coat <b>32</b> and the base metal <b>30</b>, cracks (not numbered) may occur at the interface between the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the bond coat <b>32</b> or at the interface between the bond coat <b>32</b> and the base metal <b>30</b> during a pulse laser beam drilling procedure, thereby causing TBC-BC spallation or BC-substrate spallation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. However, the potential risks of causing cracks at the layer's interface (not numbered) during hole drilling, is minimized or eliminated in drilling procedures according to various embodiments described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Similar components and features in various embodiments indicated by similar numeral references will not be redundantly described.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, an effusion hole <b>37</b> is being drilled in the combustor component <b>28</b>, extending through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the base metal <b>30</b> (the bond coat therebetween is very thin and not shown). The central axis <b>38</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b> is disposed at an angle of 20 degrees or less with respect to the top surface <b>40</b> and the hole <b>37</b> is in a truncated conical profile with a diameter diminishing as the hole <b>37</b> extends from the top surface <b>40</b> to an under surface <b>41</b> of the component <b>28</b>, formed by the base metal <b>30</b>. This truncated conical profiled hole <b>37</b> is provided as an example to illustrate various embodiment of laser hole drilling which are also applicable to cylindrical or other profiled holes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In accordance with one embodiment, the hole drilling procedure includes a first step of applying a pulse laser beam <b>42</b> to drill a section <b>46</b> of the hole <b>37</b> substantially through only the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>. The laser drilling of the section <b>46</b> is completed in a trepanning concept to interpolate the laser beam within a final perimeter <b>48</b> of the hole <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The effusion hole <b>37</b> may be in a truncated conical shape and therefore the final perimeter <b>48</b> in any cross-section thereof which is perpendicular to the central axis <b>38</b> of the hole <b>37</b>, is circular as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. However, a boundary <b>48</b><i>a </i>of the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b> on the top surface <b>40</b> of the combustor component <b>28</b> is elliptical, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. A central axis <b>44</b> of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> is disposed parallel to the central axis <b>38</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b>, that is, at the angle of the central axis <b>38</b> of the hole <b>37</b> with respect to the top surface <b>40</b>. A laser drilling step for completing the section <b>46</b> of the hole <b>37</b> within the thermal barrier layer <b>34</b> is conducted by moving the central axis <b>44</b> of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> in a circular motion <b>52</b> to confine the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> within the boundaries of the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b>, thereby interpolating a target spot <b>50</b> of the laser beam <b>42</b> along the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the hole <b>37</b> to complete the formation of the section <b>46</b> of the hole <b>37</b> through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>. Nevertheless, the circular motion <b>52</b> of the central axis <b>44</b> makes an elliptical track <b>52</b><i>a </i>on the top surface <b>40</b> of the combustor component <b>28</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, thereby interpolating an elliptical target spot <b>50</b><i>a </i>along the elliptical boundary <b>48</b><i>a </i>of the hole <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The laser beam target spot <b>50</b> at this step may be set with a spot diameter smaller than the diameter of the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b> at the cross-section of the hole <b>37</b>, for example, a minimum diameter of the hole <b>37</b>. When the target spot is relatively small as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the central axis <b>44</b> of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> must be moved within the boundary <b>48</b><i>a</i>, following various routes, for example as indicated by arrow <b>52</b><i>b</i>, in order to complete the formation of the section <b>46</b> of the hole <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After the drilling of the section <b>46</b> of the hole <b>37</b> within the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> is completed, the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> is further applied to drill through the base metal <b>30</b>, for example, by disposing the central axis <b>44</b> of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> at the required angle and applying shots of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> through the completed section <b>42</b> of the hole <b>37</b> to strike the base metal <b>30</b> until the hole <b>37</b> extends through the entire component <b>28</b>. The pulse laser beam <b>42</b> used in this embodiment may be set with a first pulse rate for drilling through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and then re-set with a second pulse rate for drilling through the base metal <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The first pulse rate may be higher than the second pulse rate. In this embodiment, the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> may also be set with a first pulse energy level for drilling through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and then re-set with a second pulse energy level for drilling through the base metal <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The first pulse energy level may be lower than the second pulse energy level.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The drilling steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> may be repeated at various locations over the top surface <b>40</b> of the combustor component <b>28</b> to complete the formation of other effusion holes in the combustor component <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The above-description does not mention a particular step of drilling through a very thin bond coat layer (not indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>) between the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the base metal <b>30</b>. In practice, the step of drilling through this thin bond coat may be included in formation of the section <b>46</b>. In such a case, the trepanning formation of the section <b>46</b> of the hole <b>37</b> extends through both the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and an underlying thin bond coat but not into the base metal <b>30</b>. Alternatively, drilling through the thin bond coat may be incorporated with the step of drilling through the base metal <b>30</b> after the section <b>46</b> of the hole <b>37</b> is formed within the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The trepanning concept used in the hole drilling according to the above embodiment may also be applicable to a hole having a non-circular cross-section. The pulse laser beam <b>42</b> may have a target spot <b>50</b> or <b>50</b><i>a </i>having a size smaller than a minimum cross-sectional dimension of the hole and is moved to allow the target spot <b>50</b> or <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the laser beam <b>42</b> to move within and along the boundaries of the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b>. In such a case, the hole will not be a circle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> but may have a non-circular shape. The boundary of the final perimeter of the hole on the top surface <b>40</b> of the component <b>28</b>, will not be elliptical as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, but in a closed loop in any shape. The central axis <b>44</b> of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> will be moved therefore in a closed loop (not shown) corresponding to and within the boundary (in any shape) of the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the hole <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a combustor component similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, in a hole drilling procedure according to another embodiment. Instead of drilling through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> in a trepanning concept as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the step of drilling through only the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> according to this embodiment is conducted by drilling in a perpendicular direction with respect to the top surface <b>40</b> of the combustor component <b>28</b> in order to remove material of the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> within the boundaries of the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b>. This drilling in the perpendicular direction may be conducted one or more times at different locations within a boundary of the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b> on the top surface <b>40</b> of the combustor component <b>28</b>, each perpendicular drilling is conducted to a depth not greater than a thickness of the thermal barrier coating or not greater than a sum of the thickness of the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and a bond coat (not indicated) attached to the under surface of the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>. It should be understood that the depth of each perpendicular drilling in the different locations may vary in order to prevent extending beyond the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The perpendicular drilling however, may not be enabled to remove all of the thermal barrier coating material within the boundaries of the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the hole and thus the perpendicular drilling procedure results in a partial formation of the section <b>46</b> extending through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>, or through both the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> the thin bond coat, leaving residual coating material within the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b>. The residual coating material within the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b> is removed in a further step by applying the pulse laser beam <b>32</b> at the angle of the hole, through the partially completed section <b>48</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b> to drill through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>, the thin bond coat and the base metal <b>30</b> in order to complete formation of the effusion hole <b>37</b> extending through the entire combustor component <b>28</b>. This step is similar to the step in the previous embodiment with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and will not be repeated in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be understood that perpendicular drilling through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> removes relatively more material of the thermal material coating <b>34</b> and leaves less residual material within the final perimeter <b>48</b> of the effusion hole <b>37</b> if the laser beam <b>42</b> is set with a target spot having a relatively smaller size and if the laser beam <b>42</b> is applied to relatively more drilling locations within the boundary of the final perimeter <b>48</b> on the top surface <b>40</b> of the combustor component <b>28</b>. Therefore, it may be desirable to use a pulse laser beam <b>42</b> with a target spot having a size smaller than, for example a diameter of the effusion hole <b>37</b> in any completely circular cross-section perpendicular to the central axis <b>38</b> of the hole, or smaller than a minimum cross-sectional dimension of the effusion hole <b>27</b> in the case that the cross-sectional shape of the effusion hole <b>37</b> is not circular.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Similar to the previous embodiment, the laser beam <b>42</b> used in this embodiment may also have different settings for drilling through the different layers of the combustor component <b>28</b>, which will not be repeated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, another embodiment of the hole drilling procedure is described. The steps of drilling through the respective thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and base metal <b>30</b> in this embodiment may not necessarily change drilling methods and therefore may be conducted in one method, for example by disposing the central axis <b>44</b> of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> at the shallow angle of the effusion hole <b>37</b> relative to the top surface <b>40</b> and applying shots of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> to strike the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and then the base metal <b>30</b> in order to complete formation of the hole extending through the combustor component <b>28</b>. Nevertheless, the settings of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> differ between drilling through the respective thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and drilling through the base metal <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The pulse laser beam <b>42</b> is set with a first pulse frequency rate and a first pulse energy level to drill a section of the effusion hole <b>37</b> through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> only. The pulse laser beam <b>42</b> is then re-set with a second pulse frequency rate and a second pulse energy level to drill through the base metal <b>30</b> in order to complete formation of the effusion hole <b>37</b> extending through the combustor component <b>28</b>. The first pulse frequency rate is higher than the second pulse frequency rate and the first pulse energy level is lower than the second pulse energy level.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Drilling through a thin bond coat (not indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) between the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the base material <b>30</b> may be conducted together with the step of drilling through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> or with the step of drilling through the base metal <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be understood that the principle of different laser settings suitable for different materials of the thermal barrier coating and base metal may be combined with different laser drilling methods for drilling through the respective thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and base metal <b>30</b>. Examples of such combinations are described above with reference to previously described embodiments. Such combinations will be applicable in further embodiments described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The pulses of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> which has the relatively high pulse frequency rate and low pulse energy level, is shown in solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and in comparison, the pulses of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> which has the relatively low pulse frequency rate and higher pulse energy level, is shown in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The relatively high pulse frequency rate as shown in the solid line, may be in a range between 50 Hz and 100 Hz.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the combustor component <b>28</b> is shown in a multiple hole drilling procedure according to a further embodiment. As previously described, a combustor component such as a liner, heat shield, etc. includes a plurality of effusion holes <b>37</b>, for example four effusion holes <b>37</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In the previously described embodiments, only one of the effusion holes in the combustor component <b>28</b> is shown. It should be understood that the procedures of the previously described embodiments are conducted by completing drilling of one effusion hole <b>37</b> before drilling of another effusion hole <b>37</b> is begun. Therefore, the formation of the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> in a single combustor component <b>28</b> is achieved one after another.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The multiple hole drilling procedure according to this embodiment is however conducted by applying a single shot of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> to strike the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> once a time at each location of the effusion holes <b>37</b> in a selected sequence, for example as shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, thereby removing a volume of the coating material at each location of the effusion holes <b>37</b> until a first round of single shots of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> to the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> over every location of the effusion holes <b>37</b> is completed. A second round of single shots of the laser beam <b>42</b> is then applied to each location of the effusion holes <b>37</b> in a sequence which may be the same or different from the sequence of the first round of the single shots of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b>, to strike the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> within the boundaries of the final perimeter <b>48</b> of each effusion hole <b>37</b> being drilled. After a number of rounds of single shots of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> to the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> in each location of the effusion holes <b>37</b>, a section <b>46</b> of each of the effusion holes <b>37</b> has been at least partially drilled through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> to expose the bond coat and/or base metal <b>30</b>. These steps are then repeated to drill deeper into the materials of the combustor component <b>28</b> including the base metal <b>30</b>, within the boundaries of the final perimeters <b>48</b> of the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> being drilled, until formation of all the effusion holes <b>37</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In contrast to the hole drilling procedures of previous embodiments in which the formation of a plurality of effusion holes <b>37</b> in the combustor component <b>28</b> is completed by completing the drilling of one hole before beginning the drilling of another hole, the completion of all of the effusion holes <b>37</b> in the combustor component <b>28</b> in this embodiment is completed when the final round of single shots of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> to every location of the effusion holes <b>37</b>, is completed. Therefore, the formation of all the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> in the combustor component <b>28</b> is completed at substantially the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to this embodiment, completion of each effusion hole <b>37</b> takes much longer time in contrast to the time for completion of each effusion hole <b>37</b> in the previous embodiments, and the laser beam <b>42</b> does not immediately follow a previous shot of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> applied to the same location of the effusion hole <b>37</b>. This allows cooling of the combustor component material in a local area around each effusion hole <b>37</b>, before the next laser shot (in the next round of laser beam shots) is applied to the same effusion hole <b>37</b>. It also improves the heat gradient across the combustor component which reduces the chances of coating cracks. This may improve the formation quality of the effusion holes being drilled and may allow use of a higher pulse energy level of the laser beam because of the increased cooling time between laser beam shots in the same hole and the improved heat gradient, resulting in a more efficient drilling process.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Optionally, this embodiment can be combined with the previous described embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> to set the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> with the relatively high pulse frequency rate and relatively low pulse energy level as shown by solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, to be used in a few initial rounds of the single shots of the pulse laser beam to drill through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and/or bond coat (not indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) in respective locations of the effusion holes <b>37</b>. The pulse laser beam can then be reset with the relatively low pulse frequency rate and relatively high pulse laser energy levels as shown by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, to be used in following rounds of the single shots of the pulse laser beams one shot a time to the base metal <b>30</b> of the effusion holes <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>, the formation of a plurality of shallow angled effusion holes <b>37</b> (only one shown) distributed over the top surface <b>40</b> of the combustor component <b>28</b> according to this embodiment, begins with providing the base metal <b>30</b> in an uncoated condition as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The pulse laser beam <b>42</b> is applied at the desired angle to individual locations of the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> in the base metal <b>30</b> in order to pre-drill a section of the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> through the uncoated base metal <b>30</b>. The next step is to attach the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> onto the top surface (not numbered) of the uncoated base metal <b>38</b> with the bond coat (not indicated) disposed therebetween in order to secure the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the base metal <b>30</b> together, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Therefore, the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> forms the top surface <b>40</b> of the combustor component <b>28</b>. The bond coat between the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the base metal <b>30</b> may or may not cover the pre-drilled section of the effusion holes <b>37</b> in the base metal <b>30</b>. The bond coat may be applied to the top surface of the base metal <b>30</b> or may be applied to an under face of the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>, after pre-drilling of the section of the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> through the base metal <b>30</b> is completed, but immediately before attachment of the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> to the base metal <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The last step of this embodiment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, is to apply the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> at the angle of the effusion holes <b>37</b> to various locations in the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> in order to drill through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the bond coat into the pre-drilled sections of the respective effusion holes <b>37</b>, thereby reopening the pre-drilled sections of the hole <b>37</b> and completing formation of the effusion holes <b>37</b> extending through the combustor component <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">This embodiment may be combined in various ways with the previously described embodiments. For example, different settings of the pulse frequency rate and pulse energy level may be used for the respective pre-drilling step of drilling through the uncoated base metal <b>30</b> and for the final drilling step of drilling through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>. Different drilling methods may also be applied to the respective pre-drilling step and the final drilling step, such as drilling in a trepanning concept, or applying a single shot of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> in each location of the effusion holes <b>37</b>, in repeated round of laser beam shots.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref> show an embodiment similar to the previously described embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>. The difference between the two embodiments lies in that the pre-drilling step begins with providing the base metal <b>30</b> with a surface coated with the bond coat <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, rather than the uncoated base metal <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Therefore, the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> in this embodiment is applied at the desired angle in various locations of the effusion holes <b>37</b> to the bond coat <b>32</b> covering a surface (not numbered) of the base metal <b>30</b>, to pre-drill the section (not numbered) of the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> extending through the bond coat <b>32</b> and the base metal <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> is then attached to the surface of the base metal <b>30</b> covered by the bond coat <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The final drilling step is to apply the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> at the angle of the effusion holes <b>37</b> to drill through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> at various locations in the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> into the pre-drilled sections of the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> in the bond coat <b>32</b> and base metal <b>30</b>, thereby re-opening the pre-drilled sections of the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> and completing formation of the effusion holes <b>37</b> extending through the combustor component <b>28</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It should be noted that the attachment of the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> to the uncoated base metal <b>30</b> or to the surface of the base metal <b>30</b> covered by the bond coat <b>32</b> in these two embodiments, should be conducted only after the pre-drilled sections of all the diffusion holes <b>37</b> through the uncoated base metal <b>30</b> or through the bond coat <b>32</b> and base metal <b>30</b> of the combustor component <b>28</b> are completed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Optionally, a cleaning step may be desirable before attachment of the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> to the uncoated base metal <b>30</b> or to the surface of the base metal <b>30</b> covered by the bond coat <b>32</b> in these two embodiments, in order to provide a clean surface of the uncoated base metal <b>30</b> or the coated base metal <b>30</b> after the pre-drilling procedure, in order to improve the quality of attachment of the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> to the uncoated base metal <b>30</b> or the coated base metal <b>30</b>. The cleaning step may be conducted for example, by using pressurized gas jets which may be available in a laser drilling procedure, as will be further described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It should be noted that after attachment of the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> to the uncoated or coated base metal <b>30</b>, the pre-drilled sections of the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> are not visible from the side of the combustor component <b>28</b> attached with the thermal barrier coating. Optionally, a step of probing and/or scanning the combustor component <b>28</b> which as the pre-drilled sections of the effusion holes <b>27</b> covered by the attached thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 14</figref>, may be conducted in order to accurately locate the positioned of the pre-drilled sections in the combustor component <b>28</b>, thereby ensuring alignment of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> with the pre-drilled section of the effusion holes <b>37</b> in the following re-opening drilling step.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the effusion holes <b>37</b> (only one shown) in the combustor component <b>28</b> are shown in a drilling procedure according to a further embodiment. The pulse laser beam <b>42</b> is set with a laser focal point <b>58</b> located at the top surface <b>40</b> of the combustor component <b>28</b> in order to apply a first shot of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> to strike the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> at a location of one of the effusion holes <b>37</b> in the combustor component <b>28</b>, thereby removing a volume of the thermal barrier coating material <b>34</b>. Further shots of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> are applied to the location of this one effusion hole <b>37</b> to strike the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and/or bond coat (not indicated) to further remove the thermal barrier material and/or bond coat material, with the laser focal point <b>58</b> being moved closer to the under surface <b>41</b> of the combustor component <b>28</b> with each consecutive shot, as indicated by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The process of drilling by applying shots of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> with the laser focal point <b>58</b> being moved deeper into the effusion hole <b>37</b> with each consecutive shot, may be conducted repeatedly to complete the formation of this effusion hole <b>37</b> extending through the combustor component <b>28</b>. The remaining effusion holes <b>37</b> in the combustor component <b>28</b> may be completed one after another in a similar procedure as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Alternatively, the drilling procedure of by applying shots of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b> with the laser focal point <b>58</b> being moved deeper within the effusion hole <b>37</b> with each consecutive shot, may continue until a section of the effusion hole <b>37</b> extends through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the bond coat. The further drilling through the base metal <b>30</b> may be conducted otherwise, for example by using the methods described in previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, an assist gas jet such as pressurized nitrogen gas may be used in a laser drilling procedure, thereby facilitating the laser drilling procedure. The assist gas jet, as indicated by arrows <b>60</b> is injected into the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> being drilled during the pulse laser beam drilling procedure, substantially in the direction of the central axis <b>44</b> of the pulse laser beam <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When a section of the effusion hole <b>37</b> is being drilled through the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and into the base metal <b>30</b>, the assist gas jet <b>60</b> under high pressure and at high velocity will create a bending moment on the thermal barrier coating, as indicated by arrow <b>59</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. This bending moment <b>59</b> may however cause substantial cracks in the interface between the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the base metal <b>30</b>, resulting in TBC-BC spallation and/or BC-substrate spallation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The graphical illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> generally shows the relationship between the pressure of the assist gas jet (Assist Gas Pressure) which determines the velocity of the assist gas jet accordingly and the bending moment (TBC Bending) acting on the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b>. Point A in the graphic illustration represents a bending moment value of crack limit when the pressure of the assist gas jet reaches a target pressure. Crack occurrence begins when the bending moment value of crack limit is achieved. The target pressure value of the pressure of the assist gas jet according to an embodiment of the laser drilling procedure, must be determined. The pressure of the assist gas jet is then adjusted such that the assist gas jet <b>60</b> is injected into the respective effusion holes <b>37</b> being drilled under a gas pressure which is lower than the determined target pressure value in order to avoid the occurrence of cracks in the interface between the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the base metal <b>30</b>. The gas pressure of the assist gas jet <b>60</b> may be measured by a gas meter <b>62</b> at a gas jet nozzle <b>64</b> which injects the assist gas jet <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Alternatively, the velocity of the assist gas jet <b>60</b> being injected into the respective effusion holes <b>37</b>, may be adjusted to be lower than a predetermined value corresponding to the target pressure value of the assist gas jet <b>60</b>, for example lower than 100 psi, thereby limiting the bending moment <b>59</b> of the assist gas jet <b>60</b> acting on the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> in order to avoid the occurrence of cracks in the interface between the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the base metal <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The embodiments of controlling an assist gas jet used in a laser drilling procedure to avoid the occurrence of cracks between the thermal barrier coating <b>34</b> and the base metal <b>30</b> are optionally combinable with any embodiments of the laser hole drilling procedures described in the previously described embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The described embodiments of the laser hole drilling procedure may be combined in any desired combinations to best fit into the manufacturing procedures of various combustor components in different types of gas turbine engines, and need not be limited to the turbofan gas turbine engine as exemplary illustrated in the drawings and described above.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The above description is meant to be exemplary only, and one skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made to the embodiments described without departure from the scope of the described subject matter. For example, cylindrical and truncated conical effusion holes are provided as examples to illustrate the principle of the laser hole drilling procedure according to various embodiments of the described subject matter. However, the described laser hole drilling procedures in the various embodiments are applicable for drilling effusion holes in various combustor components having a profile other than cylindrical or truncated conical. The described laser hole drilling procedures in the various embodiments are also applicable for drilling effusion holes in a combustor component which has a thermal barrier coating coated directly on a surface of a base metal without a bond coat therebetween. The described laser hole drilling procedures in the various embodiments are also applicable to any components having a thermal barrier coating other than combustor components to drill shallow-angled holes therethrough.
