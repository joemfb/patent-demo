<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) of a Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-0122609, filed on Dec. 4, 2008, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following description relates to an optical disk drive, and additionally, to a hybrid optical disk drive having a semiconductor memory device which is usable by a user, a method of driving the hybrid optical disk drive, and an electronic system adopting the hybrid optical disk drive.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Optical disk drives are used in portable terminals such as notebook computers, as well as in desktop personal computers (PCs). The notebook computers require a high performance similar to that of desktop PCs while being highly mobile. It may be advantageous to reduce power consumption in the portable terminals and to develop a battery of larger capacity than that of a conventional battery. Recently, solid-state drives (SSDs) using a semiconductor memory have been applied to small and portable terminals. In a small portable terminal, a solid state drive (SSD) may be provided as an emulator which may substitute for a hard disk drive (HDD), and thus, may be connected to the portable terminal via an interface applied to a conventional HDD. The SSD has advantages of a high response speed and low power consumption. However, the SSD has a smaller capacity than that of the HDD.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Even with the development in the SSD field, optical disk drives may be utilized for desktop PCs, as well as notebook computers. Therefore, it may be useful to efficiently apply the SSD and the optical disk drive to electronic systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one general aspect, there is provided a hybrid optical disk drive comprising an optical disk drive unit for driving an optical disk, a solid-state drive (SSD) unit having a storage capacity that is equal to or greater than a maximum storage capacity of the optical disk, which is compatible with the hybrid optical disk drive, and an interface device for connecting the optical disk drive unit and the SSD unit to an electronic system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Interfaces of the optical disk drive unit and the SSD unit may have the same standard as each other.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The interface device may include a port multiplier for connecting the interfaces of the optical disk drive unit and the SSD unit to each other.</p>

Accordingly, various changes, modifications, and equivalents of the systems, apparatuses and/or methods described herein will be suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art. Also, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions may be omitted for increased clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a desktop computer <b>10</b><i>a </i>as an example of an electronic system including an exemplary hybrid optical disk drive <b>12</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a notebook computer <b>10</b><i>b </i>as another example of the electronic system including an exemplary hybrid optical disk drive <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the electronic systems, for example, the desk top computer <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the notebook computer <b>10</b><i>b</i>, may include drive bays <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and the hybrid optical disk drives <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be mounted in the drive bays <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The optical disk drives <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be connected respectively to the desktop computer <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the notebook computer <b>10</b><i>b </i>via an interface cable (not shown) for transmitting signals. The interface cable may be a well-known standard cable, for example, an integrated drive electronics (IDE) standard cable, a serial AT attachment (SATA) standard cable, or a universal serial bus (USB) standard cable. However, the interface cable is not limited to these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the exemplary hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>may include an optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> and a solid-state drive (SSD) unit <b>122</b>. The optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> and the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be connected to a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>123</b>. The PCB <b>123</b> may include an interface port for connecting to an electronic system such as a computer. For example, the PCB <b>123</b> may include a SATA port <b>124</b> and a USB port <b>125</b>. In this case, the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be connected to the SATA port <b>124</b>, and the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> may be connected to the USB port <b>125</b>. Otherwise, the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> may be connected to the SATA port <b>124</b>, and the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be connected to the USB port <b>125</b>. The electronic system adopting the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>of the present exemplary embodiment may include a SATA port and a USB port corresponding to the SATA port <b>124</b> and the USB port <b>125</b> of the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another exemplary hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>b </i>may include an optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> and an SSD unit <b>122</b>. The optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> and the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be connected to a PCB <b>123</b>. The PCB <b>123</b> may include an interface port for connecting to an electronic system such as a computer. For example, the PCB <b>123</b> may include an interface port such as a SATA port <b>124</b> which is shared by the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> and the SSD unit <b>122</b>, unlike the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> and the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be connected to a SATA port multiplier <b>125</b>. An interface port multiplier functions as a plurality of SATA devices, for example, the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> and the SSD unit <b>122</b>, connected to one SATA host port. The interface port multiplier may be compatible to the USB standard. That is, the SATA port <b>124</b> may be replaced with a USB port.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The SSD unit <b>122</b> may be a hard disk drive emulator which may substitute for a hard disk drive, which is a high speed data reproducing/recording apparatus, such as a general hard disk drive, that may freely write/read information. In the present exemplary embodiment, the SSD unit <b>122</b> may use a semiconductor memory device such as a flash memory. However, the technical scope of the present disclosure is not limited by the type or structure of the semiconductor memory device. A minimum capacity of the SSD unit <b>122</b> of the present exemplary embodiment may be equal to a maximum capacity of an optical disk which may be used in the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b>. That is, the SSD unit <b>122</b> may have a capacity which may contain all data stored in an optical disk of the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">On the other hand, in an operating system such as MICROSOFT WINDOWS&#xae;, the C drive may be used as a default drive for the operating system, and thus, the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> and the SSD unit <b>122</b> of the present exemplary embodiment may be mapped as the D drive and the E drive, respectively, for example, when the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> and the SSD unit <b>122</b> are connected to the computer via the interface cable. In addition, in an electronic system only including an optical disk drive, the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be mapped as the C drive.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the exemplary hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b </i>may include a mirroring unit <b>126</b> for duplicating to SSD unit <b>122</b> information stored in an optical disk which is inserted in the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b>. When data of the optical disk inserted in the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> is duplicated to the SSD unit <b>122</b> by the mirroring unit <b>126</b>, the electronic system such as the desktop or notebook computer <b>10</b><i>a </i>or <b>10</b><i>b</i>, which accesses the data via an interface cable <b>15</b>, may read the data from the SSD unit <b>122</b>. That is, according to an exemplary embodiment, the electronic system does not directly access the data of the optical disk via the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b>, but accesses the data of the optical disk via the SSD unit <b>122</b> on which the optical disk data is duplicated. Thus, the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b>, which may have relatively higher power consumption than that of the SSD unit <b>122</b> and a slower accessing speed than that of the SSD unit <b>122</b>, is not used, and the SSD unit <b>122</b> having lower power consumption and a faster accessing speed than those of the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b>, is used, thereby, reducing the data processing time. The above performance may be realized due to the SSD unit <b>122</b> functioning as an optical disk drive emulator. In a state where the duplicate of the data is made as described above, when a command to access the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> is generated by an application program in the electronic system such as the desktop or notebook computer <b>10</b><i>a </i>or <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the SSD unit <b>122</b> may actually be accessed instead. Accordingly, power consumption may be reduced, and thus, the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b </i>may be suitable for portable electronic systems such as mini-notebook computers and ultra-mini personal computers (UMPCs). In addition, since the SSD unit <b>122</b> having a higher accessing speed than that of the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> may be used, the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b </i>may be suitable for all kinds of devices requiring high speed data process.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The mirroring unit <b>126</b> may be installed in the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b</i>. According to another exemplary embodiment, the mirroring unit <b>126</b> may be installed in the electronic system such as the desktop or notebook computer <b>10</b><i>a </i>or <b>10</b><i>b </i>so that the mirroring function may be performed remotely. The above mirroring unit <b>126</b> may be implemented as software in a read only memory (RAM) of the electronic system and as firmware such as a custom integrated circuit (IC) included in the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b</i>. However, embodiments are not limited to the above examples.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a command for writing data to the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> may be generated. The data may be duplicated to the SSD unit <b>122</b> first, and then, the duplicated data may be recorded indirectly into the optical disk of the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> via a delayed writing part <b>125</b>. That is, the SSD unit <b>122</b> may operate as a buffer of the data to be recorded in the optical disk, and after buffering the data, the data may be transmitted to the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> by the delayed writing part <b>125</b>. The above operation of the delayed writing part <b>125</b> is similar to that of the mirroring unit <b>126</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The above writing operation using the buffering of the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be performed rapidly due to the high accessing speed of the SSD unit <b>122</b>, and the buffered data may be recorded in the optical disk by the delayed writing part <b>125</b> that internally operates. Therefore, when a user selects to record the data in the optical disk, the data may be buffered into the SSD unit <b>122</b> at a high speed so that the user may rapidly process other operations, and the delayed writing part <b>125</b> records the buffered data in the optical disk of the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> at an appropriately delayed time regardless of the operations performed by the user. The recording of the data by the delayed writing part <b>125</b> may be performed automatically and confidentially to the user when a load applied to the electronic system is small or the electronic system is not used.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The mirroring unit <b>126</b> and the delayed writing part <b>125</b> may be the same as each other in view of buffering the access data or the writing data to the SSD unit <b>122</b> except for directions in which the data flows. Therefore, functions of the mirroring unit <b>126</b> and the delayed writing part <b>125</b> may be realized by an integrated data processing circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the desktop or notebook computer <b>10</b><i>a </i>or <b>10</b><i>b </i>in which the exemplary hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b </i>is mounted. The electronic system <b>10</b><i>a </i>or <b>10</b><i>b </i>may include a built-in hard disk drive <b>16</b> as a default disk drive. The electronic system <b>10</b><i>a </i>or <b>10</b><i>b </i>may include the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b</i>, and the SSD unit <b>122</b> of the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b </i>may function as the optical disk drive emulator or the buffer for writing data. On the other hand, according to another exemplary embodiment, when the SSD unit <b>122</b> is not used as the optical disk drive emulator or the buffer for writing data, the SSD unit <b>122</b> may perform as an external storage device which may support the hard disk drive <b>16</b>. The above function of the external storage device may be effective in a portable electronic system such as the notebook computer which may not include an additional storage device due to a limitation in an internal area. The SSD unit <b>122</b> may be installed in an empty space of the optical disk drive so that a data storage capacity of the portable electronic system may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">On the other hand, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the electronic system may not include an internal storage device of its own. When the electronic system does not include the internal data storage device such as a hard disk drive, the size of the electronic system may be less than when the internal data storage device is included. Instead, the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be installed in the optical disk drive, the size of which is large due to the internal space being occupied by the optical disk, and the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be used as a default drive for the operating system of the electronic system. The SSD unit <b>122</b> of the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b </i>may not be used as the optical disk drive emulator or the buffer for the delayed data writing operation. However, even when the SSD unit <b>122</b> is used as the default drive for the operating system, the SSD unit <b>122</b> may also be used as the optical disk drive emulator or the buffer for writing the data.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method of driving a hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b </i>when the SSD unit <b>122</b> is used as the optical disk drive emulator.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">After starting the electronic system including the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b </i>in <b>90</b>, an optical disk is inserted into the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> in <b>91</b>. The electronic system or the hybrid optical disk drive determines whether a mirroring operation is selected or not. If the mirroring operation is not selected, the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> may operate as a general optical disk drive in <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Otherwise, if the mirroring operation is selected, it may be identified whether the optical disk in the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> is a subject to digital rights management (DRM) in <b>93</b>. If the optical disk is subject to DRM, a verification program is executed to perform the verification of the optical disk in <b>94</b>, and if the optical disk is not subject to DRM, the process goes to <b>95</b>. In <b>95</b>, the duplication of the optical disk may be performed, and in <b>96</b>, the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be operated as the optical disk drive emulator. In addition, the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> may be in a sleep or standby status to reduce power consumption, or the operation of the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> may be stopped in <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flowchart illustrating another exemplary method of driving the hybrid optical disk drive <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>120</b><i>b </i>when an SSD unit <b>122</b> is used as the delayed writing buffer of data that will be recorded to an optical disk of an optical disk drive unit <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <b>101</b>, the electronic system starts to operate, and an optical disk is inserted into the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> in <b>102</b>. When the optical disk is inserted, it may be determined whether the optical disk is a writable disk by reading physical data from the optical disk in <b>103</b>. If it is determined that the optical disk is not a writable disk, the optical disk is a read-only disk, and an auto-run of the optical disk is executed according to the settings of the operating system in <b>111</b>. Otherwise, if it is determined that the optical disk is a writable disk in <b>103</b>, it may be determined whether a delayed writing operation or a stealth (background) writing operation, <b>104</b>, is set in the electronic system or in the hybrid optical disk drive. If the delayed writing operation or the stealth writing operation is not set, the optical disk may be set to a direct recording status like in a normal writing mode of data in <b>110</b>. Otherwise if the delayed writing operation or the stealth writing operation is set, <b>105</b>, the data to be recorded may be duplicated in the SSD unit <b>122</b> which operates as a buffer in <b>106</b>. Here, the data duplicated in the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be duplicated before inserting the optical disk into the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b>. That is, <b>106</b> may be performed before inserting the optical disk in the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b>. After finishing the duplication of data, it may be determined whether the data will be recorded to the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> or not in <b>107</b>. The determination of a data writing operation may be executed at a time set by an operation of a button included in the hybrid optical disk drive, or by the software or firmware. Regarding the determining of the data writing operation, a writing command may be transmitted to the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> in <b>108</b>, and the data buffered in the SSD unit <b>122</b> may be transferred to the optical disk drive unit <b>121</b> to be recorded to the optical disk in <b>109</b>. The delayed writing or the stealth writing operation utilizes the SSD unit <b>122</b>, the storage capacity of which corresponds to that of the optical disk.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The methods described above may be recorded, stored, or fixed in one or more computer-readable storage media that includes program instructions to be implemented by a computer to cause a processor to execute or perform the program instructions. The media may also include, alone or in combination with the program instructions, data files, data structures, and the like. Examples of computer-readable media include magnetic media, such as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD ROM disks and DVDs; magneto-optical media, such as optical disks; and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and perform program instructions, such as read-only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), flash memory, and the like. Examples of program instructions include machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher level code that may be executed by the computer using an interpreter. The described hardware devices may be configured to act as one or more software modules in order to perform the operations and methods described above, or vice versa. In addition, a computer-readable storage medium may be distributed among computer systems connected through a network and computer-readable codes or program instructions may be stored and executed in a decentralized manner.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A computing system or an electronic system may include a microprocessor that is electrically connected with a bus, a user interface, and a memory controller. It may further include a flash memory device. The flash memory device may store N-bit data via the memory controller. The N-bit data is processed or will be processed by the microprocessor and N may be 1 or an integer greater than 1. Where the computing system or electronic system is a mobile apparatus, a battery may be additionally provided to supply operation voltage of the computing system or electronic system.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the computing system or electronic system may further include an application chipset, a camera image processor (CIS), a mobile Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), and the like. The memory controller and the flash memory device may constitute a solid state device/drive/disk that uses a non-volatile memory to store data.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Flash memory devices and/or memory controllers may be included in various types of packages. For example, the flash memory devices and/or memory controllers may be embodied using packages such as Package on Packages (PoPs), Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs), Chip Scale Packages (CSPs), Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier (PLCC), Plastic Dual In-Line Package (PDIP), Die in Waffle Pack, Die in Wafer Form, Chip On Board (COB), Ceramic Dual In-Line Package (CERDIP), Plastic Metric Quad Flat Pack (MQFP), Quad Flatpack (QFP), Small Outline Integrated Circuit (SOIC), Shrink Small Outline Package (SSOP), Thin Small Outline (TSOP), Thin Quad Flatpack (TQFP), System In Package (SIP), Multi Chip Package (MCP), Wafer-level Fabricated Package (WFP), Wafer-Level Processed Stack Package (WSP), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The flash memory devices and/or the memory controllers may constitute memory cards.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The flash memory devices may be non-volatile memory devices that can maintain stored data even when power is cut off. According to an increase in the use of mobile devices such as a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a digital camera, a portable game console, and an MP3 player, the flash memory devices may be more widely used as data storage and code storage. The flash memory devices may be used in home applications such as a high definition television (HDTV), a DVD, a router, and a Global Positioning System (GPS).</p>
