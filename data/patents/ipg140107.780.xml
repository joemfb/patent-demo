<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Work producing devices providing output work are useful in many applications. An automobile provides numerous applications requiring actuation by an output torque (i.e., output work) such as an electric motor. However, using independent electric motors to actuate different features results in increased mass and cost of the automobile. Currently there are methods where electric motors operate several outputs, but actuation is still required.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known, for example, that solenoids, switches, relays, electromagnets, transducers and drivers are capable of providing actuation to multiple shafts from a single electric motor. However, use of such actuation devices often contributes to increased cost and mass of the system, making use of these actuation devices counterproductive. Currently, methods capable of providing actuation with relatively low cost and mass include the use of active materials. Active materials may include shape memory alloys (SMAs), electroactive polymers (EAPs), piezoelectric, magnetostrictive and electrorestrictive materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method for selective power transfer from a primary actuator to at least one of a plurality of outputs includes monitoring a desired output configuration, and selectively actuating an active material actuator to achieve the desired output configuration by mechanically coupling one of the plurality of outputs to the primary actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An apparatus for selective power transfer from a primary actuator to one of a plurality of output shafts includes a transmission including a plurality of output members coupled to an input member, the first input member being coupled to the primary actuator. The apparatus further includes an active material actuator including a mechanical coupling feature coupling one of the plurality of output shafts to one of the plurality of output members when the active material actuator is activated.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the purpose of limiting the same, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> displays a timeline of shape memory alloys (SMAs) that have been discovered since the mid-1900s to late 1900s. Many of these alloys consist of precious metals or only exhibit useful properties as single crystals, which do not lend them to practical use as low cost actuation devices. Some alloys are known that include required functionality at low cost. These alloys include certain copper alloys (CuAlZn) and nickel-titatnium-based alloys, such as near-equiatomic NiTi, known as Nitinol and some ternary alloys such as NiTiCu and NiTiNb. One especially useful embodiment includes NiTi-based SMAs, where NiTi-based SMAs have the best memory properties of all the known polycrystalline SMAs. The NiTi family of alloys can withstand large stresses and can recover strains near 8% for low cycle use or up to about 2.5% for high cycle use. This strain recovery capability can enable the design of SMA-actuation devices in apparatuses requiring the selective transfer of torque from a torque generating device to each of a plurality of output shafts.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>, a phase diagram of critical stresses for conversion of austenite-martensite crystal transformations as functions of temperature for a SMA is displayed. SMAs have the characteristic of very large recoverable strains due to crystallographic transformations between martensite and austenite. As a result, SMAs are desirable because they provide large shape changes or large force generation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 3</figref>, SMA behavior is due to a reversible thermoelastic crystalline phase transformation between a high symmetry parent phase, austenite <b>10</b>, and a low symmetry product phase, martensite <b>12</b>. The phase changes between austenite <b>10</b> and martensite <b>12</b> occur as a result of both stress and temperature. Formation of the martensitic phase <b>12</b> under stress <b>13</b> results in the formation of preferred crystalline variant orientations which leads to a large induced strain.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the temperature dependent strain is recovered either in a hysteresis loop upon heating <b>14</b> or upon unloading the material. This capability for reversible, controllable large strains is the basis of interest in selecting SMAs as control materials. Large shape changes can be induced easily with these materials. In a constrained situation, large stresses can be imparted to the connected structural components.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, under a static load and at a sufficiently low temperature, the material is stabilized at martensite <b>12</b>. At a sufficiently high temperature, the material is stabilized at austenite <b>10</b>. Martensite start (Ms) and finish (Mf) indicate temperatures where the phase transformation to martensite <b>12</b> starts and finishes, respectively. Austenite start (As) and finish (Af) indicate temperatures where the phase transformation to austenite <b>10</b> starts and finishes, respectively. At temperatures below Mf, an SMA material is stable in the martensite <b>12</b> phase. When an SMA material in the martensite <b>12</b> phase is heated under constant stress, the transformation to the austenite phase <b>10</b> begins only when the temperature exceeds As at a third phase <b>20</b>. From this point, the material progressively transforms to the austenite phase <b>10</b> until the transformation is complete at Af. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, at temperatures above Af, the material is stable in the austenite <b>10</b> phase at this static stress <b>22</b>. However, applying a sufficient load <b>24</b> to the material can induce a solid-state, diffusionless transformation from austenite <b>10</b> to tensile martensite thereby resulting in an induced strain to the material. During subsequent unloading <b>26</b> at the same temperature the material reverts to austenite <b>10</b>, wherein the strain is wholly or partially recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a SMA wire in a three-dimensional plot against stress (vertical axis), strain (horizontal axis), and temperature (oblique axis) is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. Between reference points a and b a load is applied to an SMA material in its martensite phase, yielding a strain. While remaining at a static temperature, the material is unloaded between reference points b and c. The load-unload cycle between reference points a-c results in a material stabilized in the martensite phase and having an induced strain. Increasing the temperature of the material results in a relatively static strain between reference points c and d. However, between reference points d and e the strain decreases (i.e., recovers) rapidly at a material specific temperature, wherein the transformation from martensite to austenite occurs. At reference point f, the transformed material is stabilized in the austenite phase. Upon cooling from austenite to martensite, little, if any, strain (or shape change) is usually observed, unless, the material has been heavily processed to have a so-called two-way shape memory effect. An alternative to using an SMA material with two-way shape memory effect involves the use of a biasing member to induce strain on the material upon cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an SMA wire in a three-dimensional plot against stress (vertical axis), strain (horizontal axis), and temperature (oblique axis) is shown illustrating an SMA that exhibits both: the shape memory effect and superelastic effect under different conditions of load and temperature. Between reference points f and g, a load is applied to an SMA material in its austenite phase, yielding a strain between reference points f and h. While remaining at a constant temperature, the material is partially unloaded between reference points h and f, wherein a majority of the induced strain is recovered between reference points i and j. While still remaining at the constant temperature, the material is completely unloaded between reference points j and f, wherein the strain is wholly recovered in the austenite phase. Between reference points f and a, the SMA material is cooled to a material specific temperature, wherein the material changes phase from austenite to martensite.</p>

In the exemplary embodiment the motor <b>34</b> is a DC electric motor benefitting from a DC motor high starting load, low cost and low mass. However, it will be appreciated that alternative embodiments include any primary actuator capable of producing work, such as induction motors, gas turbines, liquid turbines, pneumatic motors, or hydraulic motors. The drive shaft <b>36</b> provides mechanical communication between the motor <b>34</b> and the torque selection system <b>32</b>. The drive shaft <b>36</b> includes first and second ends <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, respectively, wherein the first end <b>38</b> is rotatably coupled to the motor <b>34</b>, and the second end <b>40</b> is rotatably coupled to the toque selection system <b>32</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The torque selection system <b>32</b> further includes a transmission <b>42</b> and the plurality of output shafts A, B and C.

Each output shaft A, B and C is associated with an active material actuator <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> and an output member <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, wherein active material actuator <b>44</b> is associated with output shaft A and output member <b>54</b>; active material actuator <b>46</b> is associated with output shaft B and output member <b>56</b>; and active material actuator <b>48</b> is associated with output shaft C and output member <b>58</b>. For simplification, only operation of output shaft A, output member <b>54</b> and active material actuator <b>44</b> will be described. Activation of active material actuator <b>44</b> causes output member <b>54</b> and output shaft A to be coupled. While output member <b>54</b> is always coupled to the drive input member <b>50</b>, coupling between output member <b>54</b> and output shaft A provides power to be routed from the motor <b>34</b> to the output of load A when active material actuator <b>44</b> is activated. De-activation of the active material actuator <b>44</b> results in decoupling of output member <b>54</b> and output shaft A, wherein the power delivered from the motor <b>34</b> to the output of shaft A is severed. Operation of output shafts B and C, output members <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> and active material actuators <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are identical. In one exemplary embodiment the transmission <b>42</b> is a reduction gear set. However, it will be appreciated that many alternative embodiments of the transmission <b>42</b> are contemplated, including common gears, gear trains, planetary gear sets, fluid transmissions, linkages, belt drives and rope drives well known in the art, and the disclosure is not intended to be limited to the particular exemplary embodiments described herein.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The above output shafts are described in connection with transmission <b>42</b> and output gears <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the configuration described above is exemplary, and many configurations are envisioned for use with the methods described herein. For simplicity, outputs can be discussed being selectively fixed to the primary actuator, but it is understood that gear sets, splitting devices, and other torque management devices are known and likely to exist between an output being driven and the primary actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The active material actuators are controlled by signals from a control device.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts three output shafts with all three shafts including active material actuators to select engagement of each of the shafts individually. However, it will be appreciated that the configuration of a transmission or gearbox enabling use of active material actuators can take many forms. As described herein, selective engagement of different gear configurations can enable selection of a forward or reverse direction of the same output shaft. It will be appreciated that similar selection of gear configurations could allow different gear reduction factors between a motor and an output shaft. Such a configuration could allow, for example, a single shaft to be driven with a minimal gear reduction factor when the output shaft is solely activated, while a different gear configuration with a greater gear reduction factor can be used for the same output shaft when additional output shafts are to be driven at the same time. Similarly, not all output shafts in a configuration need to be selectively actuated. For example, in an exemplary configuration with output shafts D, E, and F, shafts D and E can be selectively actuated, while shaft F can be fixedly connected to the configuration, enabling F, D+F, E+F, and D+E+F actuation states.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Control module <b>5</b> operates programming to control the different actuators within the system. A desired output shaft configuration can be monitored or determined by control module <b>5</b>. The desired output shaft configuration can be determined based upon the available power input to said selective torque transferor <b>28</b> from said torque generating device <b>30</b> and the desired power to be transferred to the plurality of output shafts A, B and C. In one exemplary use, an automotive seat adjustment can be controlled by a single control module controlling a desired output shaft configuration for three output shafts controlling three different seat adjustments, for example, including seat vertical elevation, seat base fore-aft position, and seat back recline, wherein the required power to control the three output shafts controlling the three different seat adjustments is distributed from a DC electric motor benefitting from a high starting load.

Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows three output shafts and three correspondingly located active material actuators, the invention is not limited to any specific number of output shafts or active material actuators. So long as output torque across the drive shaft <b>36</b> may be selectively utilized, engaged output shafts A, B and C may receive torque simultaneously in any combination selected by the operator. However, it should be appreciated that the sum of all the power utilized across the plurality of output shafts A, B and C may not exceed the total output power the motor <b>34</b> is capable of generating. When the active material actuator <b>44</b> is in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; position, the output shaft A is rotatably engaged to the output gear <b>54</b> of the transmission <b>42</b>. Likewise, when the active material actuator <b>44</b> is in the &#x201c;off&#x201d; position, the output shaft A is disengaged from the output gear <b>54</b> of the transmission <b>42</b>.

The active material actuator <b>44</b> includes a tubular housing <b>60</b> having circumferential inner and outer surfaces <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, respectively, and an engagement mechanism <b>66</b> enclosed within the inner surface <b>62</b> of the housing <b>60</b>. The engagement mechanism <b>66</b> further includes an active material member <b>68</b>, a plunger arm <b>70</b>, a biasing member <b>72</b> and a biasing member support <b>74</b>. The exemplary active material member <b>68</b> is a continuous wire of constant cross-section and includes a protruded portion <b>76</b> and two flat terminal ends <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, respectively, wherein each end <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> is crimped to the inner surface <b>62</b> of the housing <b>60</b> for mechanical anchorage and electrical connections. It will be appreciated that active material members can be utilized in a wide variety of shapes and configurations depending upon the desired function of the device and the actuation force required of the member. The active material member <b>68</b> is electrically coupled to an electrical energy source <b>82</b>, wherein the active material member <b>68</b> is initially energized by the electrical energy source <b>82</b> when operation calls for the active material actuator <b>44</b> to be in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; position. The electrical energy source <b>82</b> may provide power to drive the active material member <b>68</b> from a generator, motor or a combination thereof, including power from the vehicle electrical system or from a local stored energy source such as a capacitor bank. Energization of the active material member <b>68</b> is effected by closure of switch <b>84</b> which may take any suitable form including mechanical, electromechanical or solid-state. The plunger arm <b>70</b> includes a shaft section <b>86</b>, an end bar <b>88</b> and a driver section <b>90</b>. The end bar <b>88</b> and the driver section <b>90</b> are located on opposite ends of the shaft section <b>86</b>. The end bar <b>88</b> extends perpendicular to the shaft section <b>86</b> and is mechanically coupled to the active material member <b>68</b>, wherein a top surface <b>92</b> of the end bar <b>88</b> is in contact with the protruded portion <b>76</b> of the active material member <b>68</b>. The driver section <b>90</b> of the plunger arm <b>70</b> is configured to drive a sliding key <b>94</b> to engage the output shaft A to the output gear <b>54</b> of the gearbox <b>42</b> when the active material actuator <b>44</b> is in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; position. Similarly, when the active material actuator <b>44</b> is in the &#x201c;off&#x201d; position, the biasing member <b>72</b> retracts the plunger arm <b>70</b>, wherein the driver section <b>90</b> of the plunger arm <b>70</b> is configured to pull the sliding key <b>94</b> to disengage the output shaft A from the output gear <b>54</b> of the transmission <b>42</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the biasing member <b>72</b> is configured to exert an upward bias force <b>102</b> against the end bar <b>88</b> of the plunger arm <b>70</b> and thereby bias the plunger arm <b>70</b> towards the active material member <b>68</b>, wherein the end bar <b>88</b> and the active material member <b>68</b> are mechanically coupled. It should be appreciated that the end bar <b>88</b> and the active material member <b>68</b> need not be in direct physical contact due to the need to electrically isolate the active material member <b>68</b> from the rest of the active material actuator <b>44</b>. The biasing member support <b>74</b> is stationary and mounted to the inner surface <b>64</b> of the housing <b>60</b>. The biasing member support <b>74</b> further includes a hole through its axial center configured to allow the plunger arm <b>70</b> to slide freely during actuated and unactuated positions.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6A</figref>, the active material actuator <b>44</b> is in the unactuated position. As described above, when the active material actuator is in the &#x201c;off&#x201d; position, the output shaft A is disengaged from the output gear <b>54</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the switch <b>84</b> is open, therefore the active material member <b>68</b> is deenergized at a colder temperature in the martensite phase. It should be appreciated that the active material member <b>68</b> is an SMA material, wherein the SMA material is chosen such that the ambient or operating temperature of the active material actuator <b>44</b> is less than the As temperature of the SMA. Hence, when the active material member <b>68</b> is not electrically heated, it remains in the martensite phase and is protected against accidental actuation due to a rise in the operating temperature. Subsequently, the biasing member <b>72</b> is exerting the bias force <b>102</b> to the plunger arm <b>70</b>, wherein the top surface <b>92</b> of the end bar <b>88</b> of the plunger arm <b>70</b> is exerting a stress or load against the protrusion portion <b>76</b> of the active material member <b>68</b>. The stress exerted against the active material <b>68</b> imposes a strain and thereby deforms the active material member <b>68</b>. When the active material actuator <b>44</b> is unactuated, the biasing member <b>72</b> retracts the plunger arm <b>70</b>, wherein the driver section <b>90</b> of the plunger arm <b>70</b> is configured to pull the sliding key <b>94</b> to disengage the output shaft A from the output gear <b>54</b> of the transmission <b>42</b>.

When the active material member <b>44</b> is unactuated the biasing member is exerting the bias force <b>102</b> in the direction of the arrow and thereby sliding the key <b>94</b> along the key track <b>104</b> away from the key slot <b>106</b> of the output gear <b>54</b>. When the active material actuator <b>44</b> is unactuated, torque supplied from the drive shaft <b>36</b> of the motor <b>34</b> rotates output gear <b>54</b> but does not drive output shaft A because the output shaft A is disengaged from the output gear <b>54</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the switch <b>84</b> is closed, therefore the active material member <b>68</b> is energized. The energy provided by the battery <b>82</b> increases the temperature of the active material member <b>68</b>, wherein the temperature increase transforms the active material member <b>68</b> from the martensite phase to the austenite phase. As discussed earlier, the martensite to austenite transformation is accompanied by the generation of a force that acts to recover the strain imposed on the active material member <b>68</b> in the martensite phase. This strain recovery and the corresponding force developed in the active material member <b>68</b> overcomes the bias force <b>102</b> and slides the plunger arm <b>70</b> in the direction of the actuation arrow <b>108</b>, wherein the driver section <b>90</b> of the plunger arm <b>70</b> drives the sliding key <b>94</b> to engage the output shaft A to the output gear <b>54</b> when the active material actuator <b>44</b> is actuated.

For example, the releasable locking mechanism <b>110</b> may be mechanically coupled to the end bar <b>88</b> of the plunger arm <b>70</b> when the active material actuator <b>44</b> is actuated or in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; position, and hold the plunger arm <b>70</b> in this position when the active material actuator <b>44</b> is unactuated. A separate actuator could be incorporated to be actuated to disengage the locking mechanism <b>110</b>. The locking mechanism may be spring-loaded and have a wedge portion, wherein the end bar <b>88</b> slides over a tapering section of the wedge portion when the active material actuator <b>44</b> is actuated. The plunger arm <b>70</b> locks into position when the end bar <b>88</b> falls over the tapered end of the wedge portion. The auxiliary unlocking actuator is thereby required to overcome the force of the biasing member <b>72</b> for the locking mechanism <b>110</b> to retract the wedge portion and allow the biasing member <b>72</b> to retract the plunger arm <b>70</b> back.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, in accordance with an alternative embodiment of a primary actuator providing a translatory force, a translatory force distributor <b>120</b> for distributing a translatory input <b>122</b> to a plurality of output pins Y and Z is depicted. The translatory primary actuator <b>120</b> includes an input pin X and the output pins Y and Z, wherein the input pin X includes input slots <b>126</b>, <b>124</b>, and the output pins Y and Z comprise respective active material actuators <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. When the active material actuator <b>144</b> is actuated, engagement is provided between input pin X and output pin Y when the input slot <b>126</b> is aligned with the active material actuator <b>144</b> and a mechanical coupling feature <b>123</b> coupled to the active material actuator <b>144</b> is moved by the active material actuator <b>144</b> to partially overlap with input pin X, thereby mechanically coupling input and output pins X, Y, respectively. Likewise, when the active material actuator <b>146</b> is actuated, engagement is provided between input pin X and output pin Z when the input slot <b>124</b> is aligned with active material actuator <b>146</b> and a mechanical coupling feature <b>125</b> coupled to the active material actuator <b>146</b> is moved by the active material actuator <b>146</b> to partially overlap with the input pin X, thereby coupling input and output pins X, Z respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the input pin X is unloaded as represented by arrow <b>128</b>, and therefore, the output pins Y and Z are unloaded as represented by arrows <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, respectively. Additionally, the active material actuators <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> are unactuated, and therefore, no engagement is provided between the input pin X and the output pin Y or between the input pin X and the output pin Z.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, in a non-limiting example, a translatory input <b>122</b> is applied to the input pin X. Before the system is used, the slot <b>126</b> of the input pin X is aligned with the active material actuator <b>144</b> of the output pin Y. Referring to arrow <b>150</b>, when the active material actuator <b>144</b> is activated, the active material actuator thereby provides engagement between the input and output pins X, Y, respectively, as described above. When the input and output pins X, Y, respectively, are engaged, the translatory input <b>122</b> to the input pin X thereafter is shared with the output pin Y, represented by arrow <b>230</b>. However, the input pin X is not mechanically coupled with the output pin Z. Because the input and output pins X, Z, respectively, are not engaged, the translatory input <b>122</b> applied to input pin X is not shared with output pin Z, represented by arrow <b>132</b>. It should be appreciated that the slots on the input pin, and the actuators on the output pins, may be aligned and arranged in any configuration that provides a translatory load from an input pin to one or more output pins. Additionally, in other configurations, the input pin may contain additional slots and the output pins may each contain more than one active material actuator.</p>
