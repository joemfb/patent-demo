<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Described are an FSK modulator and a method for large-alphabet FSK modulation. The FSK modulator and the method are based on filtering of a multi-tone optical source such as a mode-locked laser which provides a comb distribution of tones. A frequency-selective component selects for transmission a subset of the tones. In various embodiments the frequency-selective component is a Mach-Zehnder interferometer filter or a microring resonator filter. A second frequency-selective component selects a subset of the tones from the comb distribution provided by the first frequency-selective component. Still more frequency-selective components can be used according to the number of tones supplied by the multi-tone optical source to the FSK modulator. The optical signal exiting the last frequency-selective component includes only a single tone which corresponds to the symbol to be transmitted.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to optical communications based on frequency-shift keying (FSK). More particularly, the invention relates to large-alphabet FSK modulation at high symbol rates using a serial configuration of filter stages based upon Mach-Zehnder interferometers or microring resonators.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Power efficient optical links are useful for a number of applications such as high-bandwidth free-space communications. The most efficient optical communications links utilize large-alphabet orthogonal modulation formats such as pulse-position modulation or frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation. For FSK modulation, a transmitter transmits k bits of information by sending one of M possible frequencies during each symbol period where M=2<sup>k</sup>. The receiver determines which one of the M frequencies was transmitted in order to receive the k bits of information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a generic configuration for an FSK transmitter <b>10</b>. The transmitter <b>10</b> includes a transmitter source <b>14</b>, an FSK modulator <b>18</b>, an optical power amplifier <b>22</b> and transmit optics <b>26</b>. The FSK modulator <b>18</b> is used to select one of M optical frequency components (i.e., &#x201c;tones&#x201d;) in the optical signal generated by the transmitter source <b>14</b>. The power amplifier <b>22</b> increases the optical power of the signal transmitted by the FSK modulator <b>18</b> and the transmit optics <b>26</b> are used to condition the optical signal for transmission to one or more receivers. For example, the transmit optics <b>26</b> can include optical components to achieve a desired beam geometry for the FSK-modulated optical signal for free-space transmission or for launching into an optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are several techniques that have been demonstrated for transmission of optical FSK waveforms. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a tunable laser <b>30</b> can be used as the combination of the transmitter source <b>14</b> and FSK modulator <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The tunable laser <b>30</b> is tuned to a single tone by varying a bias current or by changing the characteristics of the laser cavity. The illustrated configuration <b>10</b>&#x2032; is typically limited to symbol rates of a few GHz or less. An alternative configuration <b>10</b>&#x2033; is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and includes a number M of source lasers <b>32</b>A to <b>32</b>M (generally <b>32</b>) where each source laser <b>32</b> operates on a unique tone. Each source laser <b>32</b> is intensity modulated by direct modulation of the laser current or, as shown, using an external modulator <b>34</b>A to <b>34</b>M (generally <b>34</b>). The external modulators <b>34</b> are activated by control signals so that an optical signal from only one source laser <b>30</b> is transmitted during a symbol period. The optical signals exiting the external modulators <b>34</b> are combined along a single optical path by a combiner <b>36</b> (e.g., a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) combiner) although during normal operation only one of the external modulators <b>34</b> permits its optical signal to be transmitted to the combiner <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While the transmitter configuration <b>10</b>&#x2033; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is useful at high symbol rates (e.g., rates exceeding 40 GHz), the complexity of the transmitter is impractical for a large number M of source lasers <b>32</b>. For example, if the number M of source lasers <b>32</b> in the transmitter is 1,024, the number of external modulators <b>34</b> required is 1,024.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the invention features an FSK modulator for optical communications. The FSK modulator includes a first filter stage and a second filter stage. The first filter stage has an input optical path, an output optical path and a first microring resonator. The input optical path receives a multi-tone optical signal. The first microring resonator has a first optical path length and is disposed between the input and output optical paths. An electro-optic modulator is disposed on the first microring resonator to modulate the first optical path length in response to a first control signal. A first filtered optical signal having a subset of the tones in the multi-tone optical signal is provided in the output optical path of the first filter stage. The second filter stage has an input optical path in optical communication with the output optical path of the first filter stage, an output optical path and a second microring resonator. The second microring resonator has a second optical path length and is disposed between the input and output optical paths of the second filter stage. An electro-optic modulator is disposed on the second microring resonator to modulate the second optical path length in response to a second control signal. A second filtered optical signal having a subset of the tones in the first filtered optical signal is provide in the output optical path of the second filter stage.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, the invention features an FSK modulator for optical communications. The FSK modulator includes a first filter stage and a second filter stage. The first filter stage has an input optical path, an output optical path and a first microring resonator. The input optical path receives a multi-tone optical signal. The first microring resonator has a first optical path length and is disposed between the input and output optical paths. At least one electro-optic modulator electrode is disposed on the first microring resonator to modulate the first optical path length in response to at least one binary control signal. A first filtered optical signal having a subset of the tones in the multi-tone optical signal is provided in the output optical path of the first filter stage. The second filter stage has an input optical path in optical communication with the output optical path of the first filter stage, an output optical path and a second microring resonator. The second microring resonator has a second optical path length and is disposed between the input and output optical paths of the second filter stage. At least one electro-optic modulator electrode is disposed on the second microring resonator to modulate the second optical path length in response to at least one binary control signal. The numbers of electro-optic modulator electrodes in the first and second microring resonators are different and a length of at least one of the electro-optic modulator electrodes of one of the microrings is less than the lengths of the electro-optic modulator electrodes of the other microring. At least one tone of the multi-tone optical signal is selected for transmission through the first and second filter stages according to the binary voltage signals applied to the electro-optic modulator electrodes of the first and second microrings.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In brief overview, the invention relates to an FSK modulator and a method for large-alphabet (i.e., many different transmission frequencies) FSK modulation at high symbol rates (e.g., greater than 40 GHz). The method is based on filtering of a multi-tone optical source such as a mode-locked laser which provides a comb distribution of tones. A frequency-selective component selects for transmission a subset of the tones (e.g., &#x201c;alternate&#x201d; tones) in the comb distribution. A second frequency-selective component selects a subset of the tones from the comb distribution provided by the first frequency-selective component. Still more frequency-selective components can be used according to the number of tones supplied by the multi-tone optical source to the FSK modulator. The optical signal exiting the last frequency-selective component of the FSK modulator includes only a single tone which corresponds to the symbol to be transmitted. In one embodiment the frequency-selective components are Mach-Zehnder interferometer filter stages as described in detail below. In another embodiment the frequency-selective optical components are microring resonator filter stages as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of an FSK modulator <b>38</b> according to the invention. The modulator <b>38</b> includes multiple filter stages <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, <b>42</b>C (generally <b>42</b>) in serial communication. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates the optical spectrum (having a comb distribution) of a multi-tone optical signal propagating from a transmitter source (not shown) to the first filter stage <b>42</b>A. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates the tones in the optical signal received at the second filter stage <b>42</b>B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> illustrates the tones in the optical signal received at the third filter stage <b>42</b>C and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> illustrates the tone in the optical signal exiting the FSK modulator <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">During operation, the multi-tone optical signal having the discrete optical frequency components, or tones, at frequencies f<sub>1 </sub>to f<sub>8</sub>, (generally f) is received from a transmitter source such as a mode-locked laser. Each frequency component f is at a single, unique frequency which is separated from adjacent frequency components by a free spectral range (FSR). The phrase &#x201c;single frequency&#x201d; as used herein includes a narrow range of frequencies within the linewidth of a laser line or tone as is understood by those of skill in the art. Although only eight frequency components are shown in the illustrated embodiment, the invention contemplates other embodiments in which other numbers of tones can be provided by the transmitter source and that other numbers of filter stages <b>42</b> can be included in the FSK modulator <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first filter stage <b>42</b>A selects, that is, &#x201c;passes&#x201d; tones of alternate frequencies in the received multi-tone optical signal. Thus tones at either a first alternating set of frequencies (i.e., odd-indexed frequencies f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>3</sub>, f<sub>5 </sub>and f<sub>7</sub>) or a second set of alternating frequencies (i.e., even-indexed frequencies f<sub>2</sub>, f<sub>4</sub>, f<sub>6 </sub>and f<sub>8</sub>) are selected to remain in the transmitted optical signal according to the value of a control signal applied to the stage <b>42</b>A. For example, the control signal may be a binary voltage signal having a first value and a second value to select the first and second alternating sets of frequencies, respectively. As illustrated, the control signal has the second value, causing the first filter stage <b>42</b>A to select the even-indexed frequencies f<sub>2</sub>, f<sub>4</sub>, f<sub>6 </sub>and f<sub>8</sub>. The second filter stage <b>42</b>B selects tones of alternate frequencies provided by the first filter stage <b>42</b>A. Thus either tones at frequencies f<sub>2 </sub>and f<sub>6 </sub>are selected or tones at frequencies f<sub>4 </sub>and f<sub>8 </sub>are selected according to an applied, control signal. As shown, the control signal has a value that causes frequencies f<sub>2 </sub>and f<sub>6 </sub>to be selected. Finally, the third filter stage <b>42</b>C selects one of the two tones f<sub>2 </sub>and f<sub>6 </sub>provided by the second filter stage <b>42</b>B according to an applied control signal. As illustrated, the control signal has a value that causes a single tone at frequency f<sub>6 </sub>to be included in the FSK optical signal exiting the FSK modulator <b>38</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) filter <b>46</b> that is used for each filter stage <b>42</b> according to one embodiment of the FSK modulator <b>38</b>. In one embodiment the MZI filters <b>46</b> are fiber-coupled lithium niobate electro-optic modulators. The MZI filter <b>46</b> has a differential propagation time (i.e., differential delay) T defined between the two interferometer arms <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B (generally <b>50</b>) according to the difference in their optical path lengths. The corresponding optical power transfer function for the MZI filter <b>46</b> for a particular optical frequency f is given by
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i><sub>out</sub><i>&#x221d;P</i><sub>in</sub>[1+cos(2<i>&#x3c0;fT</i>)]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where P<sub>in </sub>and P<sub>out </sub>are the input and output optical powers, respectively.
</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the frequency domain, the optical power transfer function of the interferometer is cosinusoidal with frequency 1/T, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. By changing the optical path length of one of the arms <b>50</b> by half the period corresponding to the optical frequency (e.g., by using an electro-optic phase modulator <b>52</b>), the optical power transfer function near the frequency of the optical carrier is shifted so that the peaks of the shifted transfer function shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> align approximately with the nulls of the unshifted transfer function shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. For example, by modulating a voltage applied to the electro-optic modulator <b>52</b>, the optical path length of the lower arm <b>50</b>B is changed. Using conventional high-speed optical modulation techniques, the optical power transfer function of the MZI filter <b>46</b> can be shifted between the two operating points shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</figref> at a rate than exceeds 40 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an embodiment of an FSK modulator <b>54</b> according to the invention. A source laser (not shown) provides a number M of unique tones separated by a frequency difference F. By way of example, the source laser can be multiple continuous-wave lasers or a mode-locked laser having a repetition rate equal to the desired separation between the FSK tones. (In an alternative embodiment, broadband optical noise such as that realized through amplified spontaneous emission from an optical amplifier is transmitted through a Fabry-Perot etalon to generate the multi-tone optical signal.) The multi-tone optical signal from the source laser is modulated using a number k of MZI filter stages <b>58</b>A to <b>58</b>K (generally <b>58</b>) where k=log<sub>2 </sub>M. Filter stage <b>1</b> <b>58</b>A has a differential delay of 1/(2F) seconds and a period of 2F. Thus filter stage <b>1</b> <b>58</b>A can be used to eliminate one-half of the M tones of the source laser, i.e., the odd-indexed frequencies or the even-indexed frequencies as described above. The particular tones that are filtered depend on the differential phase shift imposed by an electro-optic modulator <b>62</b>A according to an applied control voltage V<sub>1</sub>. Thus M/2 tones are provided at the output of filter stage <b>1</b> <b>58</b>A. Filter stage <b>2</b> <b>58</b>B has a differential delay of 1/(4F) so that the width of a transmission peak in the optical power transfer function in the frequency domain (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) is twice the width of a transmission peak in the optical power transfer function for the first filter stage <b>58</b>A. Thus filter stage <b>2</b> <b>58</b>B can be used to select one-half of the tones provided by filter stage <b>1</b> <b>58</b>A. The differential phase shift applied for filter stage <b>2</b> <b>58</b>B is responsive to the voltage V<sub>2 </sub>applied to the electro-optic modulator <b>62</b>B. The voltage V<sub>2 </sub>has one of four values corresponding to differential phase shifts of 0, &#x3c0;/2, &#x3c0; and 3&#x3c0;/2. These values enable the optical power transfer function to be shifted to one of four possible positions in frequency. Each subsequent filter stage <b>58</b> has a differential delay equal to one-half of the preceding filter stage <b>58</b> and twice the number of possible values for its control voltage as used for the preceding filter stage <b>58</b>. In this manner, a single tone from the laser source remains in the optical signal exiting the k<sup>th </sup>filter stage.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably a group filter is used to reject all tones outside the operating frequency range of the FSK modulator <b>54</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the group filter is disposed between the source laser and the FSK modulator <b>54</b>. Alternatively, the group filter can be provided after the FSK modulator <b>54</b>. In either embodiment, all tones outside a frequency band defined by the lowest and highest frequencies of the M tones are rejected. In other embodiments of the FSK modulator, the filter stages <b>58</b> are arranged sequentially such that the differential delays of subsequent filter stages <b>58</b> are not monotonically decreasing while still maintaining the ability to select a single tone for transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Since each of the MZI filter stages <b>58</b> in the FSK modulator <b>54</b> can be tuned at a rate that exceed 40 GHZ using existing electro-optic modulation techniques, the tone available at the output of filter k can also be selected at a rate exceeding 40 GHz. Only k filter stages are required to select one of M=2<sup>k </sup>tones. Thus the modulation technique of the invention enables high-speed (greater than 40 GSymbol/s), large alphabet FSK modulation. The modulation technique can enable future high-bandwidth (greater than 100 Gbit/s) free-space optical links where large transmission alphabets are desirable to obtain high power efficiency at receivers.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Environmental factors such as temperature fluctuations can cause the relative phase difference between the two interferometer arms <b>50</b>A and <b>50</b>B of each filter stage <b>58</b> to drift or otherwise become unstable. Different techniques can be used to stabilize the filter stages <b>58</b> during operation of the FSK modulator. According to one technique, an out-of-band optical signal is employed. For example, the out-of-band optical signal can be from an optical source operating at a different wavelength (e.g., 1330 nm) than the wavelength of the FSK modulated optical signal (e.g., 1550 nm). The out-of-band optical signal is monitored at each filter stage <b>58</b> at a low bandwidth relative to the symbol rate but at a high bandwidth relative to the time scale of environmental changes. Responsive &#x201c;compensation&#x201d; signals are generated to slowly change the bias voltages of the electro-optic modulators <b>62</b>, thereby counteracting any drift in the relative phase differences. According to another stabilization technique, each filter stage <b>58</b> modulates the received (in-band) optical signal about the peak of its optical transfer function at a low modulation frequency (e.g., 1 KHz). The resulting doubled frequency (e.g., 2 KHz) at the output of each filter stage <b>58</b> is monitored to determine changes in the relative phase difference between the two interferometer arms <b>50</b>A and <b>50</b>B and to generate a compensation signal to modify the bias voltage of the electro-optic modulator <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The high-speed FSK modulator <b>54</b> described above can be challenging to implement due to the multi-level modulation required for the MZI filters stages <b>58</b>. In particular, filter stage <b>1</b> <b>58</b>A requires a differential phase shift of 0 or &#x3c0;. Filter stage <b>2</b> <b>58</b>B requires a differential phase shift of 0, &#x3c0;/2, &#x3c0; or 3&#x3c0;/2. The k<sup>th </sup>filter stage <b>58</b>K requires one of 2<sup>k </sup>phase shifts of the form n&#x3c0;/2<sup>k-1</sup>, where n=0, 1, . . . , 2<sup>k</sup>&#x2212;1. The multi-level modulation can be achieved by driving the electro-optic modulators <b>62</b> with an N-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that provides voltages in the range of 0 to 2V<sub>&#x3c0;</sub>, where V<sub>&#x3c0; </sub>is the drive voltage required to obtain a differential phase shift of &#x3c0; in the optical power transfer function. The speed at which modulation is achieved is limited by the speed of the DAC used to generate the drive voltages for the electro-optic modulators <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An alternative method for FSK modulation according to the invention achieves higher modulation rates. The phase shift imparted by an electro-optic modulator is generally proportional to the product of an applied voltage and an interaction length between the applied voltage and the optical signal propagating in a waveguide. Typically, the interaction length corresponds to the length of an electro-optic modulator electrode disposed alongside the waveguide. A k<sup>th </sup>MZI stage <b>66</b> can be fabricated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> with k electrodes <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>D (generally <b>70</b>) of varying length instead of a single electrode. In the illustrated embodiment, the number k of electrodes <b>70</b> is four. As shown, each successive electrode <b>70</b> is one-half the length of the preceding electrode <b>70</b>. If each electrode <b>62</b> is driven with a binary voltage signal (V<sub>b1</sub>, V<sub>b2</sub>, V<sub>b3 </sub>or V<sub>b4</sub>) having a value of 0 or V&#x3c0; (where V&#x3c0; is the drive voltage required to obtain a &#x3c0; phase shift from the first electrode <b>70</b>A), any of the desired FSK modulation levels for the k<sup>th </sup>MZI stage <b>66</b> can be achieved. All the electrodes <b>70</b> in the FSK modulator that have a common length receive the same binary voltage V<sub>b</sub>. Thus, for an FSK modulator having a number N of MZI stages, the binary voltage V<sub>b1 </sub>is applied to the electrode of length L in each MZI stage. Similarly, the binary voltage V<sub>b2 </sub>is applied to the electrodes of length L/2 which are present in all but the first MZI stage. In a more generalized sense, the binary voltage V<sub>bx </sub>is applied to all electrodes of a corresponding length which are present in N&#x2212;x+1 of the MZI stages.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The binary voltages V<sub>bx </sub>applied to the electrodes <b>70</b> are the same voltage signals that would be used as digital inputs to the DAC described above. Thus the illustrated multi-electrode MZI filter architecture eliminates the need for the DAC and enables modulation at greater speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In other embodiments, the arrangement and operation of the electrodes <b>70</b> differ from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and described above. For example, the electrodes <b>70</b> need not be arranged serially according to a monotonically-decreasing length. Also, the electrodes <b>70</b> can be disposed on both arms <b>68</b>A and <b>68</b>B where the binary voltages can be different than those described above yet still achieve the number and value of the modulation levels for each MZI stage as described above. In still other embodiments, the multi-electrode interferometer configurations can be determined according to an alternative translation from bits to tones. In such embodiments, a logical calculation of hits to drive level is performed in addition to the digital to analog conversion.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Microring Resonator Filter Stages</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to an alternative to the embodiment of the FSK modulator <b>38</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a microring resonator (MR) filter <b>74</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is used for each filter stage <b>42</b>. The MR filter <b>74</b> includes a first (input) waveguide <b>78</b>, a microring resonator <b>82</b> and a second (output) waveguide <b>86</b>. The microring resonator <b>82</b> has a closed, loop form such as the illustrated circular shape; however, the resonator <b>82</b> can also be in the form of an ellipse, racetrack or other closed-loop shape that can support traveling wave resonant modes without high loss as is known in the art. Optical power is coupled from the first waveguide <b>78</b> to the microring resonator <b>82</b> by evanescent coupling. The resonator <b>82</b> supports resonant wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>0 </sub>given by
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>=(2&#x3c0;<i>Rn</i><sub>e</sub>)/<i>N </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where R is the radius of the microring <b>82</b>, n<sub>e </sub>is the effective refractive index of the mode supported in the microring <b>82</b> and N is an integer value, and which are not significantly attenuated due to waveguide material attenuation and other loss mechanisms. Energy in the microring resonator <b>82</b> at the resonant frequencies is coupled to the second waveguide <b>86</b>. Tones in the optical signal propagating in the first waveguide <b>78</b> that are not coupled into the microring resonator <b>82</b> continue to propagate in the first waveguide <b>78</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The optical power transfer function of the MR filter <b>74</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. By changing the optical path length of the microring resonator <b>82</b> by half the period, the optical power transfer function near the optical carrier is shifted by approximately half the FSR as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>. For example, the optical path length of the microring <b>82</b> is changed by changing a voltage V applied to an electro-optic modulator electrode <b>90</b>, allowing the modulation of the optical power transfer function at rates that can exceed 40 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">MR filter stages <b>74</b> used in embodiments of the FSK modulator can have radii of tens of microns or less. Thus the MR filter stages <b>74</b> are much smaller than the equivalent MZI filter stages described above. Potentially, a single MR filter stage <b>74</b> can be fabricated to a small dimension to simplify the FSK modulator by achieving an FSR that is at least as great as the modulator wavelength range. For example, for a C-band FSK modulator the operating wavelength range is approximately 30 nm. Consequently, a single MR filter stage <b>74</b> having a microring <b>82</b> with a radius R of 5 &#x3bc;m or less is capable of selecting a single tone; however, fabrication of the desired number of electrodes <b>90</b> of decreasing size presents a significant challenge. Moreover, use of a single MR filter stage <b>74</b> for a large number of tones requires both a large FSR and a small passband. Consequently, the MR filter stage <b>74</b> is required to have a high quality factor (Q) than can limit how rapidly the filter stage can be tuned, making an FSK modulator utilizing multiple MR filter stages more desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates another embodiment of an FSK modulator <b>94</b> according to the invention. A multi-tone optical signal having a number M of unique tones is modulated using a number k of MR filter stages <b>98</b>A to <b>98</b>K (generally <b>98</b>) where k=log<sub>2 </sub>M. Each filter stage <b>98</b> has a microring <b>82</b> of a different radius (and different optical path length) so that the optical power transfer functions have different FSRs. Filter stage <b>1</b> <b>98</b>A is used to eliminate one-half of the M tones provided to the modulator <b>94</b> according to the applied voltage V<sub>1</sub>, filter stage <b>2</b> <b>98</b>B eliminates one-half of the M/2 tones provided by filter stage <b>1</b> <b>98</b>A according to the applied voltage V<sub>2</sub>, and so on until after the k<sup>th </sup>filter stage <b>98</b>K only a single tone from the multi-tone optical signal remains.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Due to the high finesse of the optical power transfer function of the MR filter stages <b>98</b>, the invention contemplates embodiments in which the number of filter stages <b>98</b> is less than k. For example, design constraints such as modulation speed and alphabet size may make it desirable to employ a reduced number of filter stages <b>98</b>. In other embodiments, the configuration of microrings <b>82</b> can be different from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. For example, the microrings <b>82</b> can be positioned near each for direct evanescent coupling between adjacent microrings <b>82</b>. Thus intervening waveguides (e.g., waveguides <b>78</b>B, <b>78</b>C, <b>86</b>A and <b>86</b>B) can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an MR filter stage <b>98</b>C having three electro-optic modulator electrodes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B and <b>102</b>C (generally <b>102</b>). The arc lengths of the electrodes <b>102</b> and the corresponding drive voltages V<sub>b1</sub>, V<sub>b2</sub>, and V<sub>b3 </sub>are similar to the lengths of the linear electrodes <b>70</b> and drive voltages of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Thus an FSK modulator can be fabricated using multiple MR filter stages <b>98</b> with varying numbers and lengths of electrodes <b>102</b> to avoid the need for a DAC and thereby achieve greater modulation speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to specific embodiments, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
