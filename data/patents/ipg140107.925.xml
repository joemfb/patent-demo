<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a tyre for a motor vehicle, in particular to a high-performance tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Motor vehicle tyres having a tread provided with blocks delimited by circumferential grooves extending in a substantially longitudinal direction and by transverse grooves extending in a substantially axial direction are known. The blocks resulting from the intersection of said grooves are formed in various suitably designed shapes and are arranged in adjacent circumferential rows, each of which is located between two successive circumferential grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The circumferential grooves may influence the directional and travel stability properties of the tyre in relation to the lateral (slip) thrusts directed parallel to the rotation axis of the tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The transverse grooves, in turn, may influence the traction properties of the tyre, namely its capacity to transmit efficiently to the road surface the tangential thrusts parallel to the direction of travel during acceleration and braking of the motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The circumferential grooves may also influence the draining of the water in the area making contact with the road surface-(footprint area) during travel on a wet road surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, the presence of transverse and circumferential grooves influences the rolling noise of the tyre. In fact, one of the main causes of noisiness is the continuous succession of impacts of the edges of the blocks on the road-surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further cause of noisiness consists in dragging of the blocks on the road surface when they enter and leave the area of contact with the road surface. This dragging is due essentially to the deformation of the tread both when the tyre is flattened against the road surface and when it recovers its inflated condition, as it leaves the area of contact with the road surface.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The deformations of the tread when coming into contact with and leaving the area of contact with the road surface also produce a cyclical volumetric variation of the grooves which delimit the blocks and a consequent cyclical action of compression and expansion of the air trapped inside the grooves. These phenomena of compression and expansion of the air increase the rolling noise of the tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various measures which tend to limit the rolling noise of a tyre are known. One of these consists in providing the blocks with different longitudinal dimensions by adopting two or more different-pitch values distributed in circumferential succession&#x2014;called &#x201c;pitch sequence&#x201d; &#x2014;such as to provide the maximum possible lack of uniformity over the circumferential extension of the tread. The aim is to distribute the acoustic energy due to the impacts and dragging of the blocks over a wide spectrum of frequencies, thus avoiding concentrating it in a specific frequency and producing bothersome noise.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The noisiness of a tyre, measured in accordance with New Dir. 2001/43/EC Aug. 4, 2001, is considered unacceptable when it exceeds the following limits:</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The noisiness of tyres is a problem which is difficult to solve because some measures which tend to reduce it adversely affect the directional, traction and water drainage properties.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">EP 1 189 770 B1 describes a high performance tyre for a motor vehicle provided with a tread having an overall width L and comprising two deep circumferential grooves which separate a central region from two lateral shoulder regions, said shoulder regions being provided with shoulder blocks, the sum of the widths of said lateral shoulder regions being equal to or less than 60% of the overall width L, the width of each of the shoulder regions being not less than 20% of said overall width L, each of said circumferential grooves being adjacent, on the side further from the central region, to a continuous track from which are branched transverse grooves which delimit said shoulder blocks, said continuous track terminating in a continuous wall which forms a lateral wait of said circumferential groove, characterized in that said continuous lateral wall of at least one circumferential groove has a profile, in a radial plane, which is more inclined, with respect to a center-line axis of said circumferential groove, than the profile of the facing lateral wall of said circumferential groove, and in that the blocks of the central rows are separated by transverse grooves having a bottom wall with a shaped profile of variable depth.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">EP 0 812 709 describes a tyre having a tread comprising two regions at least one of which is provided with a plurality of inclined main grooves, each of which comprises a segment with a steep inclination and a segment with a slight inclination. A lateral band of the two regions has an auxiliary groove with a steep inclination communicating with two adjacent, inclined, main grooves and an auxiliary groove with a slight inclination, situated between the two adjacent, inclined, main grooves. In a first embodiment, the inclined main grooves extend from a circumferential groove close to the equatorial plane of the tyre, while in a second embodiment they have a blind bottom. In a third embodiment, the steeply inclined segments of two adjacent, inclined, main grooves are joined by a thin transverse groove.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">EP 0 867 310 describes a tyre comprising blocks formed in a tread portion by means of a plurality of circumferential grooves and a plurality of directionally inclined grooves. At least some of the directionally inclined grooves extend from a circumferential groove close to the equatorial plane of the tyre and extend towards one end of the area of the tread making contact with the ground. Each, of the blocks has an angled portion which forms an acute angle of 10&#xb0;-60 defined by a circumferential groove and a directionally inclined groove. The surface of the angled portion of the block is chamfered over a distance of 10-30 mm from a tapered end thereof in a longitudinal direction so as to vary gradually towards, a portion of larger width.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Nowadays high performance vehicles more and by electronic systems. Such systems manage different driving conditions and modify the dynamic behavior of the vehicle for improving, for instance, stability, braking and acceleration performances thereof. In this scenario, high performance tyres are required to work in a different way with respect to tyres of the past and need to be redesigned (in terms of tread pattern and internal, structure thereof) so as to meet the relevant changes introduced in the vehicle behavior by the electronic systems.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It can be pointed out that high performance vehicles have a negative camber while running under normal driving conditions, but have null or positive camber when high lateral accelerations and/or quick load transfers, occur. Since the electronic systems sensibly and actively intervene on the vehicle; behavior, the tread pattern designs have, to take into account said fact.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the following description, the terms &#x201c;HP&#x201d; (High Performance) or &#x201c;UHP&#x201d; (Ultra High Performance) tyres indicate tyres which are suitable for applications involving high operating speeds (e.g. higher than 200 km/h) and/or extreme driving conditions. In particular the terms High Performance or Ultra High Performance tyres are intended to indicate tyres which belong to Classes &#x201c;H&#x201d; and &#x201c;V&#x201d; (maximum speed over 210 Km/h) and to Classes &#x201c;W&#x201d; and &#x201c;Y&#x201d; (maximum speed over 240 Km/h).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The Applicant has perceived the necessity of improving the handling properties of a high performance tyre, in particular (but not exclusively) of an asymmetric tyre, meanwhile ensuring good aquaplaning, grip and noiseness properties.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In particular, the Applicant has perceived the necessity of increasing the lateral stiffness of at least one shoulder region, particularly of the external one, of a high performance tyre so as to withstand the relevant lateral thrusts which arise, for instance, during high speed cornering maneuvers or in extreme driving conditions, e.g. while running at the limit of adherence.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Even though the maximum lateral stiffness can be achieved by a slick tyre (wherein the maximum amount of rubber contacts the rolling surface in the tyre footprint area), it is apparent that such a technical solution is not acceptable for a tyre which is required to be used on roads and not on race circuits since a slick tyre has no aquaplaning performance at all.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">On the contrary, even though the aquaplaning performances can be improved by providing at least one longitudinal groove in the external shoulder region, this would generally lead to a reduction of the lateral stiffness since a lower amount of rubber would be in contact with the rolling surface. However, this reduction is at least partially compensated by a hinge effect which causes an increase of the tyre footprint area in correspondence of the zone adjacent to said at least one longitudinal groove.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The Applicant has thus perceived the necessity of providing a tyre which combines high performances in terms of handling, especially lateral stiffness, and aquaplaning, without negatively affecting grip and noise characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The Applicant has found that such a combination of performances can be advantageously achieved by providing the tyre tread pattern with at least two circumferential grooves which define two distinct shoulder regions, one of said shoulder regions being provided with a shoulder circumferential cut&#x2014;located at a certain distance from the adjacent circumferential groove&#x2014;and with a plurality of main transverse grooves that are positioned in the tread area comprised between said circumferential cut and the circumferential groove adjacent to said shoulder region. According to the present invention, said shoulder region is the external shoulder region (i.e. external with respect to the vehicle side, as described in the following of the present description) since, as mentioned above, during high speed cornering maneuvers, the external wheel, and thus the external shoulder region, is required to support a prevailing portion of the vehicle load.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the present invention said main transverse grooves are remarkably inclined (with respect to a radial plane of the tyre) towards said circumferential groove so as to provide the tyre with good handling performances as well as with good aquaplaning performances.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In fact, as far as the handling performances are concerned, the inclined main transverse grooves confer a suitable flexibility to the shoulder region in the lateral direction so that the tyre footprint area is advantageously increased. Meanwhile, said inclined main transverse grooves do not negatively affect the lateral stiffness of the shoulder region thanks to the positive contribution of the hinge effect mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, the inclination of the main transverse grooves compensates the ply steer force which is generated&#x2014;in each tyre&#x2014;by the inclination of the metallic cords of the tyre outermost belt layer, said ply steer force being directed along the cords inclination. The main transverse grooves according to the tread pattern of the present invention allow to balance said ply steer forces so that the equilibrium of the tyre is advantageously increased.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As far as the aquaplaning performances are concerned, the inclined main transverse grooves contribute in discharging the water from the tyre footprint area and thus support the discharging effect carried out by the circumferential grooves. In particular, while the circumferential grooves discharge the water from the central rear (with respect to the rolling direction) side of the tyre footprint area, the main-transverse grooves discharge the water from a lateral (external) side of the tyre footprint area. This effect remarkably contributes in increasing the aquaplaning performance of the tyre, especially the aquaplaning performance when high speed cornering maneuvers are performed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Moreover, the Applicant has found that the shoulder circumferential cut of the tread pattern of the present invention has a positive hinge effect which contributes in increasing the flexibility of the tyre shoulder region and thus, as mentioned above, the handling performance is advantageously increased.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, the tread pattern of the present invention allows to achieve good noisiness performances both inside and outside a vehicle, with an excellent performance on wet and dry road surfaces at high speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the present invention, a tyre for a motor vehicle, in particular a high-performance tyre, is provided, said tyre being provided with a tread having an overall width L. The tread comprises a first and a second circumferential grooves which separate a central region from a first and a second shoulder regions.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partial plan view of a tread <b>3</b> of the tyre shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. Tyre <b>1</b> is of the asymmetric type; in other words, it has a pattern which is different (i.e. asymmetric) on each side of an equatorial plane <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The structure of the tyre is of the conventional type and comprises a carcass, a tread band located on the crown of said carcass, a pair of axially superimposed sidewalls terminating in beads reinforced with bead wires and corresponding bead fillers, for securing said tyre to a corresponding mounting rim. The tyre preferably also comprises a belt structure interposed between the carcass and the tread band. More preferably, the tyre is of the type with a markedly flattened section, for example in the range from 0.65 to 0.30, where these figures express the percentage value of the ratio between the height of the cross right section of the tyre and the maximum chord of said section. In the art, this ratio is usually referred to as H/C.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The carcass is reinforced with one or more carcass plies associated to said bead wires, while the belt structure generally comprises two belt layers, usually comprising metal cords, parallel to each other in each layer and crossing over those of the adjacent layers, preferably inclined symmetrically with respect to the equatorial plane, and radially superimposed on each other. Preferably, the belt structure also comprises a third belt layer, in a radially outermost position, provided with rubberized cords, preferably textile cords, oriented circumferentially, i.e. with a disposition at substantially zero degrees with respect to said equatorial plane.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Tyre <b>1</b> has a tread <b>3</b> of elastomeric material, provided with three circumferential grooves <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. Grooves <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> divide a tread central region <b>7</b> from two shoulder regions <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, located on the left and on the right of the equatorial plane <b>2</b>, respectively. Shoulder region <b>8</b> will be also referred to as &#x201c;external shoulder region&#x201d;. Similarly, shoulder region <b>9</b> will be also referred to as &#x201c;internal shoulder region&#x201d;. The terms &#x201c;internal&#x201d; and &#x201c;external&#x201d; are referred to a vehicle on which the tyre is mounted: &#x201c;internal&#x201d; stands for &#x201c;internal with respect to the vehicle&#x201d;, while &#x201c;external&#x201d; stands for &#x201c;externally with respect to the vehicle&#x201d;. The tread central region <b>7</b> of tyre <b>1</b> comprises the central circumferential groove <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Preferably, shoulder circumferential groove <b>6</b> has a width less than that of circumferential grooves <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. Unless otherwise indicated, a width of a groove, a cut, a notch or similar elements is a measure taken on the top thereof, in correspondence of the tread surface.

According to a preferred embodiment, circumferential grooves <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> have substantially the same shape and dimensions. In such a preferred embodiment, also groove <b>5</b> is provided with a raising portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>similar to raising portion <b>4</b><i>a </i>of groove <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The tread <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is formed by a number p, typically from 28 to 40, of transverse groove modules <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>), the top end of the second substantially rectilinear portion <b>42</b><i>d </i>is connected to the circumferential groove <b>4</b> through a slightly curve portion <b>42</b><i>e </i>which has a reduced depth with respect to the rectilinear portion <b>42</b><i>d</i>.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Alternatively, according to a further embodiment of the present invention (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>), the main transverse groove <b>42</b> is not provided with a curve portion <b>42</b><i>e </i>and the second substantially rectilinear portion <b>42</b><i>d </i>smoothly terminates at about 4.0-10.0 mm from groove <b>4</b>. Preferably, the second substantially rectilinear portion <b>42</b><i>d </i>terminates at a distance (L<b>5</b>) from about 5% to about 40% of <b>12</b>, more preferably from about 15% to about 30% of L<b>2</b>. Preferably, the second substantially rectilinear portion <b>42</b><i>d </i>terminates at a distance from about 30% to about 40% of the width of groove <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Preferably, the distance between two circumferentially consecutive (adjacent) main grooves <b>42</b> is substantially constant. Preferably, the distance between two circumferentially consecutive (adjacent) main grooves <b>42</b> is from about 25% and 35% of the tyre diameter. Said aspect positively contributes to the noiseness and longitudinal stiffness performances of the tyre of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The circumferential cut <b>15</b> is provided in the tyre according to the present invention in order to contribute to the hinge effect in the shoulder region. Profitably, circumferential cut <b>15</b> has a width of about 1.0-3.0 mm. The depth of the circumferential cut <b>15</b> varies from a reduced depth of about 1.0 to 4.0 mm to a full depth of about 4.0-7.5 mm. The parts (<b>15</b><i>a</i>) of circumferential cut <b>15</b> that have a reduced depth are those in correspondence of main transverse grooves <b>42</b>; the parts (<b>15</b><i>b</i>) of circumferential grooves that have a full depth are those in proximity of secondary transverse grooves <b>43</b>. Preferably, secondary transverse grooves <b>43</b> do not cross the cut portions <b>15</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The number of blocks in the external shoulder (when each block is defined between two main transverse grooves <b>42</b>) ranges from 28 to 40. Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pitch of the tread pattern is the same in the two shoulder regions as well as in the central region. The most axially external part of external shoulder region <b>8</b> (i.e. the part which is external to the circumferential cut <b>15</b>&#x2014;the part on the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) has a pattern similar to that of the internal shoulder region <b>9</b> with secondary transverse grooves <b>43</b>, <b>13</b> that are arranged between, and are preferably substantially parallel to, main transverse grooves <b>42</b>, <b>12</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">This arrangement of transverse grooves (<b>12</b>, <b>13</b> in the internal shoulder region <b>9</b> and <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> in the external shoulder region&#x2014;all of them belonging to the same transverse groove module <b>10</b>) is advantageous in reducing the noise of the tyre tread pattern of the present invention since the grooves belonging to one shoulder are circumferentially staggered with respect to the grooves belonging to the opposite shoulder so that they enter the tyre footprint area at different time instants, thereby splitting the tread noise on a wide range of frequencies and favorably improving the noiseness performance of the tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The other (axially inner) part of the external shoulder region <b>8</b> (the one between circumferential cut <b>15</b> and circumferential groove <b>4</b>) is provided with the highly inclined main transverse grooves <b>42</b>. If the main transverse grooves of the tread pattern are considered, it can be noted that, in combination with the transverse grooves <b>22</b> of the remaining central portion <b>7</b> and with the transverse grooves <b>12</b> of the internal shoulder portion <b>9</b>, they form a substantially continuous wave pattern which starts at one tyre shoulder and reaches the opposite one.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In considering a plan view (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the blocks which are defined among the circumferential cut <b>15</b>, the adjacent circumferential groove <b>4</b> and two circumferentially consecutive main transverse grooves <b>42</b> are substantially rhomboid shaped, whilst the blocks defined among the circumferential cut <b>15</b>, the external tyre shoulder and two circumferentially consecutive main transverse grooves <b>42</b> are substantially rectangular in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The width of the tyre pattern according to the present invention is indicated with L (L is generally &#x2267;about 200 mm). The external shoulder <b>8</b> has a width L<b>1</b> which ranges from about 25% to 35% of L. In particular, the region between circumferential cut <b>15</b> and circumferential groove <b>4</b> has a width L<b>2</b> that ranges from 20% to 35% of L<b>1</b>. The internal shoulder <b>9</b> has a width L<b>3</b> which is less than L<b>1</b> and is preferably between about 20% and 30% of L. Finally, the central region <b>7</b> has a width L<b>4</b> between about 25 and 40% of L.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The external shoulder of the tyre according to the present invention is substantially stiff; but the circumferential cut <b>15</b> provides a positive and controlled flexibility of the tyre shoulder in a plane parallel to the equatorial plane and passing through said circumferential cut. Circumferential cut <b>15</b> is not to be considered as a circumferential groove and does not contribute to aquaplaning performances. The aquaplaning performances are highly increased by the presence of the main transverse grooves <b>42</b> in combination with the circumferential grooves <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>. As mentioned above, circumferential cut <b>15</b> provides a &#x201c;hinge effect&#x201d; which results in a larger contact area so that a larger rubber area is in contact with the rolling surface and thus both grip and handling performances are advantageously increased.</p>

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">It can be pointed out that the tread pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which possesses only three longitudinal (circumferential) grooves, provides the tyre with a lateral stiffness which is higher than that of a similar-tyre having four longitudinal grooves, while the aquaplaning performance is even higher than that of a similar tyre having four longitudinal grooves, while ensuring very good grip, braking, noiseness and wear performances.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Tyres having a tread pattern according to the first embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>) were subjected to comparative tests with tyres manufactured by the same Applicant and commercially known as &#x201c;Pzero Rosso&#xae;&#x201d;. Said comparative tyres have been chosen because they are high performance tyres with excellent characteristics and have been approved for fast and very-high performance sport cars. The rear wheel tyres according to the present invention has a size of 265/35 R18; the front wheel tyres according to the present invention had a size of 225/40 R18. The inflation pressure was 2.5 bar for the front wheels and 3.0 bar for the rear wheels. The comparative tyres had the same structure, sizes and inflation pressures of the invention tyres.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A car, model &#x201c;Porsche 996&#x201d;, was first equipped with four tyres according to the invention and then with four comparative tyres.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Aquaplaning tests were carried out along straight road sections and around bends, together with braking tests on dry and wet road surfaces, tests for noise inside and outside the car, and comfort tests.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The aquaplaning test along straight road sections was carried out along a straight section of smooth asphalt, of predefined length (100 m), with a layer of water of predefined constant height (7-mm) which was automatically restored after each test vehicle had passed by. The vehicle entered at a constant speed (approximately 100 km/h) in conditions of perfect grip and accelerated until the conditions of total loss of grip occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The aquaplaning test around bends was carried out along a road section with smooth and dry asphalt, around a bend with a constant radius (100 m), having a predefined length and comprising, along a final section, a zone of predefined length (20 m) flooded with a layer of water of predefined thickness (6 mm). The test was carried out at a constant speed for different speed values.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The braking test was carried out both on a dry surface and on a wet surface where a rain fall of 60 mm of water per hour was simulated. The dry braking test consisted in decreasing the speed, of the test car from 100 Km/h to 5 Km/h; the wet braking test consisted in decreasing the speed of the test car from 80 Km/h to 5 Km/h. The test was carried out along a straight road section and braking distances were measured.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The results of the aquaplaning and braking tests are shown in Table I where the values assigned are expressed as a percentage against the values of the comparative tyre fixed at 100. Thus, values higher than 100 indicate an improvement with respect to the comparative tyres.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The graphs show the result of the so-called &#x201c;coast-by-noise&#x201d; tests (ISO 362-1981, Amendment 1, published 1985) carried out with the car described above in accordance with the standard ISO 10844. During these tests the reference speed was 80 km/h.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows that the tyre according to the invention had proved to be less noisy than the comparative-tyre. In particular, as it can be derived from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a reduction of noise was experienced at frequencies higher than about 500 Hz. Also in frequencies ranges 115-145 Hz and 183-230 Hz a big reduction of noise was detected.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Furthermore, lateral and longitudinal stiffness of a tyre according to the first embodiment of the present invention was calculated by, computer simulation. The tread was finite element modeled as a rubber plate having a thickness equal to that of the tread band. As the tyre carcass structure, is known, the contact area is experimentally established for a number of loads. In the finite element modeled plate, an area having a shape correspondent to the contact area is considered. All the nodes that are in contact with the ground are constrained so that they become fixed. All the other nodes (those that are not in contact with the ground) are moved in a first direction X (resulting in a shift S<sub>X </sub>in such a first direction) and in a second direction Y (resulting in a shift S<sub>Y </sub>in such a second direction). Thus, it becomes possible to calculate the forces which are requested for moving the nodes into the first and second directions (F<sub>X </sub>and F<sub>Y</sub>, respectively). Finally, the stiffness in the first direction X (longitudinal stiffness) is given by K<sub>X</sub>=F<sub>X</sub>/S<sub>X </sub>and the stiffness in the second direction Y (lateral stiffness) is given by K<sub>Y</sub>=F<sub>Y</sub>/S<sub>Y</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The results of the stiffness computer simulation are shown in Table III where the values assigned are expressed as a percentage against the values of the comparative tyre fixed at 100. Thus, values higher than 100 indicate an improvement with respect to the comparative tyre.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Thus, the tyre according to the present invention has shown a high stiffness.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Finally, a handling test in dry surface conditions was carried out along predefined sections. For the handling test a car Ferrari, model 575, was used. For this test, the rear wheel tyres according to the present invention had a size of 305/35 R19; the front wheel tyres according to the present invention had a size of 255/40 R19. The inflation pressure was 2.5 bar for the front wheels and 3.0 bar for the rear wheels. The comparative tyres Pzero Rosso&#xae; had the same structure, sizes and inflation pressures of the invention tyres.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In order to evaluate the tyre behavior, the test driver simulated some characteristic maneuvering (change of lane, entering a bend, leaving a bend, for example) carried out at constant speed, in acceleration and in deceleration. Then the test driver judged the tyre behavior and assigned a score depending on the tyre performance during said maneuvering.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The handling is generally divided into two voices (soft handling and hard handling) depending on the type of manoeuvre carried out by the test driver. The soft handling relates to the use of the tyre under normal driving conditions, i.e. in conditions of normal speed and good transversal grip. On the contrary, the hard handling tests describe the behaviour of the tyre at the limit of adherence, i.e. under extreme driving conditions. In the latter case the test driver executes manoeuvres which an average driver might be forced to carry out in the case of unforeseen and hazardous circumstances: sharp steering at high speed, sudden changing of lanes to avoid obstacles, sudden braking, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Two different types of tests were carried out: behaviour at normal speed (soft handling) and behaviour at the limit of adherence (hard handling).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As far as the soft handling tests were concerned, the test driver assessed: emptiness in the centre, that is the delay and the degree of response of the vehicle to small steering angles; the promptness of response to the steering coming into a bend; the progressiveness of response to the steering travelling in a bend; centering in a bend, that is the tyre capacity to keep the vehicle on a bend with a constant radius without continuous steering corrections; realignment, that is the capacity of the tyre to allow the vehicle to return to a rectilinear trajectory at the exit of a bend with contained and dampened transverses oscillations.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As far as the hard handling tests were concerned, the test driver assessed: the force on the steering wheel when turning violently; the promptness of insertion, that is the behaviour of the tyre in transition at the entrance of the bend taken at the limit speed; the balancing, that is the degree of over-steering or under-steering of the vehicle; the yield, that is the tyre capacity to absorb a strong fast transfer of the load as a consequence of a sudden change of lane without excessive deformation, and therefore without compromising vehicle stability and controllability; release in a bend, that is the tyre capacity to dampen the effects of instability resulting from the sudden release of the accelerator during a bend taken at the limit speed; controllability, that is the tyre capacity to maintain and/or return the vehicle to the trajectory after the loss of adherence.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Table IV sums up the test driver's score sheet for the tyres controllability. The results of said tests are expressed by means of an evaluation scale representing the subjective opinion expressed by the test driver through a point system. The values reproduced in the following table represent a mean value between those obtained in several test sessions (5-6 tests, for example) and given by several test drivers</p>
