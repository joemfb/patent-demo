<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">According to a first aspect, the invention concerns a safety device for a linear actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">According to a second aspect, the invention concerns a linear actuator comprising a safety device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Linear actuators are used in many different applications. In most cases, e.g. during normal operation it is wanted to perform these operations in a controlled manner. However, in case of an emergency it may be needed to automatically perform a certain operation of the actuator, even during loss of power. To ensure that, some actuators are equipped with an emergency operation function that often is designed to cause the actuator to automatically go to a specific position. However, in some applications high, and very high, forces and speeds are required. If an actuator in such an application, and which has an emergency operation function, is damaged, subjected to a faulty operation, or if something is blocking the actuation of the actuator, severe human injuries and damages to equipment and buildings may occur if the emergency operation is executed. If, for instance, the dampering is not working properly, the speed and forces will be so high that bursts and cracks may occur. The bursts or cracks may not always be visible. If the actuator then is reset and later performs another emergency operation, parts of the actuator may break and be thrown away due to the high speeds and forces. It is usually not economically or practically feasible to over dimension the actuator. Furthermore, to overdimension an actuator does not solve the problem, since sooner or later, after a few emergency operations with failed dampering, the actuator will most probably not be able to withstand the high forces and speeds anymore, thus increasing the risk of severe damages anyways. To dismount and disassemble the actuator after every emergency operation to visually inspect the condition would be costly and not practical.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Consequently, there is a need for a safety device for an actuator that allows and ensures an emergency operation while reducing the risk of human injuries and property damages.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the invention is to provide a safety device for a linear actuator. More specifically, it is an object to provide a safety device that is safe, reliable and reduces the risk of human injuries and property damages.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the first aspect of the invention, the object is achieved by a safety device for a linear actuator. The safety device comprises a connection means that allows a connection to a releasable holding means, the movement of which is controlled by a nut and screw arrangement. The connection means is fixed via a sacrificing means to a supporting means. A resilient means acts between the supporting means and a supporting portion that is in fixed relation to the nut and screw arrangement. An extension means is fixed to the supporting means via the connection means. The sacrificing means has a mechanical strength such that the sacrificing means breaks when subjected to a force exceeding a predetermined force. Consequently is a re-connection of the supporting means and the releasable holding means made impossible. When the sacrificing means breaks, the extension means is no longer fixed to the supporting means. The predetermined force is lower than the mechanical strength of the extension means and the supporting means. An advantage of this arrangement is that even though the sacrificing means has broken, the resilient means will still act upon the supporting means, which in turn will act upon the extension means and keep it in a desired position, e.g. holding it in an end state. But, since the sacrificing portion has broken, it is not possible to re-connect the releasable holding means to the supporting means, which means that it is not possible to reset the actuator, i.e. to pull or push the extension means from e.g. the end state, without for instance servicing and replacement of parts. It may still be possible to drive the screw and nut arrangement back and forth, and also to re-connect the releasable holding means to the connection means. This will however not affect the supporting means and the extension means, since these are no longer fixed to the connection means. The advantage of this is by using the safety device according to the invention, it may be ensured that, if the actuator comprising the safety device has been subjected to damaging forces, the sacrificing means will be broken. Consequently, since it is no longer possible to reset the actuator without servicing, there is a reduced risk of human injuries or equipment damages due to actuator parts rapidly thrown away.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, the force is resulting from a collision between the extension means, or the supporting means, and an object within an actuator. In an embodiment, the force is resulting from a collision between the supporting means and a part of the housing, or a part fixed to the housing. This may e.g. occur when a dampering function of the actuator has failed or is disabled. In an embodiment, the force is resulting from a collision between the extension means and a blocking element outside of an actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the force is resulting from a collision between an object and an element connected or fixed to the extension means. The object may be a broken part. It may also be an end stop to which the actuator is supposed to go to, but if e.g. the dampering has failed, the extension means, or the element connected to the extension means, may hit the end stop at too great speed, which may cause a damaging collision.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of the invention, a linear actuator includes a housing having a support wall, a releasable grip, a nut and screw assembly controlling movement of the releasable grip, and a motor for driving the nut and screw assembly, the motor being fixed to the housing, and a safety device. The safety device includes a connection element configured to be gripped by the grip, a support connected to the connection element and including an elongate member projecting outside the housing, and a spring between the support wall and the support. The support is connected to the connection element at a joint, and the joint is configured to break when subjected to a force exceeding a predetermined force to disconnect the elongate element from the connection element.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, the extension means may be an extension tube or an extension rod.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the supporting means is any of a plate, a disc, a sleeve, or a cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the sacrificing means has a zone of rupture comprising any of an attenuation, a groove, a flange, or a material of lower strength. This may be an easy and cheap solution.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the sacrificing means is any of a screw, a nail, or a rivet. This may be a cheap and reliable solution.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment, the sacrificing means comprises a snap fit mechanism. A snap fit mechanism is a mechanical joint system with locating and locking features that are integrated with one or the other of the components being joined. Joining by snap fit requires a flexible locking feature to move aside for engagement with a mating component. When in the right place, the locking feature returns toward its original position and thus accomplish the interference that is necessary to fasten the components to each other. An advantage with a snap fit mechanism is a fast and facilitated assembly operation.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the locating part of the snap fit mechanism may be fixed to the connecting means, and the locking part of the snap fit mechanism may be fixed to the supporting means. In another embodiment, a locating part of the snap fit mechanism may be fixed to the supporting means, and a locking part of the snap fit mechanism may be fixed to the supporting means.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, the sacrificing means is glue, which is applied at least partly on the surfaces between the supporting means and the connection means.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, the sacrificing means is a weld seam.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment the extension means has a protrusion that extends perpendicularly to a direction of movement of the extension means. If the sacrificing means is broken, the protrusion will limit the movement of the extension means in relation to the supporting means, so that the resilient means acts on the supporting means, and the supporting means acts on the extension means leading to that the extension means is maintained in a desired state.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the second aspect of the invention, a linear actuator is provided. The linear actuator comprises the safety device according to the first aspect of the invention. Furthermore, it comprises a housing to which the supporting portion is fixed. In an embodiment, the supporting portion is integral with the housing. The supporting portion may be located at different positions, as understood by a man skilled in the art. The linear actuator further has a releasable holding means, the movement of which is controlled by a nut and screw arrangement, and a motor for driving the nut and screw arrangement. The motor is fixed to the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, the linear actuator further comprises damper means for dampering the movement of the supporting means.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">All embodiments and features of the first aspect of the invention are applicable to the second aspect, and vice versa.</p>
