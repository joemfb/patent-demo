<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to protein concentrates and protein isolates comprising combinations of proteins, peptides and amino acids, as well as processes for their production. In particular, the disclosure relates to a process for removing fiber from an oilseed meal to produce edible protein products.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Oilseeds typically contain from about 20 percent oil to about 50 percent oil by weight, with the percentages varying with the type of oilseed. Generally, the seed is pressed, with or without a prior heat treatment step, to obtain a pressed oil and a pressed seedcake. Generally, the pressed seedcake is then solvent extracted to remove or reduce the remaining oil. After removal of the solvent from the pressed seedcake and drying of the seedcake, there generally remains a defatted meal, which contains from about 25% to about 55% of protein on a dry weight basis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some defatted meals, depending upon the oilseed, contain a high amount of fiber, as well as other anti-nutritional factors and undesirable compounds, such as glucosinolates, phytic acid or phytates, sinapine and sinigrin. The fiber and antinutritional factors present in the protein render the defatted meal unattractive for commercial uses.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case of canola defatted meal, one method of separating the protein from the fiber, antinutritional factors and other undesirable compounds has been to dissolve the canola protein in a high ionic strength (i.e. high salt content) aqueous solution. This results in the canola protein dissolving in the aqueous solution, while the fiber is insoluble. However, the salt is difficult and uneconomical to remove and recover from the resultant canola protein solution.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">(I) Definitions</heading>
<p id="p-0280" num="0377">The term &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; as used herein refers to various natural compounds containing two or more amino acids linked by the carboxylic acid group of one amino acid to the amino group of another amino acid. Peptides generally have 4-100 amino acids (US Patent Office Classification Index Glossary) and a molecular weight of less than about 10,000 Daltons.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0378">The term &#x201c;protein&#x201d; as used herein refers to peptides with more than about 50-100 amino acids and a molecular weight in excess of about 10,000 Daltons. The US Patent Office Classification Index Glossary defines protein as peptides with more then 100 amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0379">The term &#x201c;partially defatted meal&#x201d; (alternatively called &#x201c;seedcake&#x201d; or &#x201c;presscake&#x201d;) as used herein refers to an oilseed meal in which the oilseed has been pressed to remove the oil contained within. The pressing of the oilseed results in pressed oil and a partially defatted meal, which contains from about 15% to about 50% of protein on a dry weight basis and from about 10% to about 20% oil, optionally about 14% to 16%, on a dry weight basis.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0380">The term &#x201c;defatted meal&#x201d; (alternatively called &#x201c;fully defatted meal&#x201d;) as used herein refers to an oilseed which has been ii) pressed to remove oil, which forms a seedcake and pressed oil, and ii) subjected to solvent extraction, using, for example, hydrophobic and low-boiling solvents, such as butane, pentane, hexane and/or other refrigerants such as iodotrifluoromethane (ITFM) and R134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), to remove or reduce residual oil from the seedcake and form the defatted meal. A defatted meal will typically have a protein content of about 25% to about 55%, optionally 30% to about 50%, suitably about 35% to about 50%, on a dry weight basis, and from about 0% to about 4% oil, optionally about 0.5% to about 4%, optionally about 1% to about 3%, on a dry weight basis.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0381">The term &#x201c;protein-enriched meal&#x201d; as used herein refers to a defatted meal as described above, which has subsequently been treated to remove fiber from the defatted meal. Accordingly, the defatted meal is typically subjected to a milling step and a screening step to remove fiber and obtain a protein-enriched meal having a protein content of about 30% to about 60%, optionally 40% to 55%, suitably 50% to 55% on a dry weight basis, and about 5% to about 6.5% fiber, optionally less than about 6%. Collectively, a partially defatted meal, fully defatted meal and a protein-enriched meal may be referred to as &#x201c;meal&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0382">The term &#x201c;protein concentrate&#x201d; as used herein refers to a defatted or protein-enriched meal that has been treated using the processes of the present disclosure to provide an insoluble protein content, thereof, when measured at room temperature where the protein concentrate has greater than 60% protein water insoluble content but less than 90% water insoluble protein content on a dry weight basis. The balance may comprise carbohydrate, ash, fiber and oil. In an embodiment, the protein concentrate is generally produced from the insoluble protein fraction or soluble/insoluble protein fractions of a protein mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0383">The term &#x201c;hydrolyzed protein concentrate&#x201d; as used herein refers to a protein concentrate that has been treated to hydrolyze the proteins within the protein concentrate into amino acids and smaller peptides. Proteins can be hydrolyzed using various chemicals, such as strong acids and bases, and enzymes, preferably proteases.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0384">The term &#x201c;protein isolate&#x201d; as used herein refers to a defatted or protein-enriched meal that has been treated using the processes of the present disclosure to provide a soluble protein content thereof, when measured at room temperature, where the protein isolate has 90% or greater than 90% water soluble protein on a dry weight basis. The balance may comprise carbohydrate, ash, and oil. In an embodiment, the protein isolate is generally produced from the soluble protein fraction of a protein mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0385">The term &#x201c;hydrolyzed protein isolate&#x201d; as used herein refers to a protein isolate that has been treated with proteases to hydrolyze the proteins within the protein isolate into amino acids and smaller peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0386">The term &#x201c;mixing solvent&#x201d; as used herein refers to a solvent that forms a protein slurry or mixture when mixed with a partially defatted, fully defatted or protein-enriched meal. In addition, the fiber present in the meal possesses minimal solubility in the mixing solvent (e.g. typically less than 1% (w/w) solubility, or about 0% solubility), and suitably, is not soluble in the mixing solvent. Examples of mixing solvents include, but are not limited to, water, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, polysaccharide solutions such as guar gum solution, saline solutions, or mixtures of any of the above.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0387">The term &#x201c;blending solvent&#x201d; as used herein refers to any aqueous solvent (typically at least: 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% water by weight) that forms a slurry or mixture when mixed with a partially defatted, fully defatted or protein-enriched meal. Typically the blending solvent is free from organic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, iso-propanol, tetrahydrofuran since these solvents are not desirable as residues in a protein isolate, concentrate or hydroxylate for human consumption, however, if organic solvents are present, they are in the blending solvent in small amount (e.g. typically equal to or less than: 20%, 10%, 10%, 5% or 1%) so that their presence in the final product is negligible. Examples of blending solvents include water, acidic water, alkaline water, saline salt solutions (such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride), polysaccharide solutions (such as guar gum), and aqueous protein solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0388">The invention contemplates using a variety of solvents, which could include blending solvents, mixing solvents or other combinations or alcohols (e.g. 80% ethanol), water and/or aqueous solvents. The use of the term blending solvents should not be construed as precluding the use of organic solvents in processes as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0389">The term &#x201c;extraction solvent&#x201d; as used herein refers to a solvent which is capable of solubilizing antinutritional compounds, or other constituents, that are present in the oilseed and which are desirably removed. Examples of antinutritionals include, but are not limited to, glucosinolates, phytic acid, phytates and other compounds that reduce the nutritional or commercial value of the protein concentrate or protein isolate. Antinutritional compounds are compounds that are, for example, not digestible by mammals (e.g. humans), have adverse effects, such as toxicity or are bitter tasting, and are desirably removed from the protein product. Accordingly, the concentration of antinutritionals in a protein product produced in accordance with a process of the present disclosure is less than about 1% (w/w), optionally less than about 0.5% (w/w), optionally less than about 0.1% (w/w), and optionally less than about 0.05% (w/w). Examples of other compounds include, but are not limited to, materials that undesirably effect the quality, color, taste, odor, appearance or characteristics of the end product. Examples include compounds that cause a darkening or variation in the color, cause a bitter taste or a pungent odor, such as sinapine or sinigrin, or affect the handling or agglomeration of the end product. While the antinutritionals or other components are not desirable in the protein concentrates or isolates they may constitute commercially valuable side products which can have utility as medicinal or industrial ingredients or end products once separated from the protein concentrate or isolate. Examples of extraction solvents include, but are not limited to, water, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or mixtures of any of the above. Other extractions solvents which are useful include tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), and ethers, such as methyl t-butyl ether. However, it will be known to those skilled in the art that solvents such as THF, DMF or ethers, as a result of their higher toxicity as compared to, for example, ethanol, require lower limits in the protein product.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0390">The term &#x201c;homogeneous agitation&#x201d; as used herein refers to the mixing of a protein meal, such as a partially defatted meal, a fully defatted meal or a protein-enriched meal with a solvent to form a homogenous mixture or suspension. Such agitation is accomplished, for example, by mixing the slurry or mixture at a speed of about 30 rpm to about 300 rpm in a standard mixer.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0391">The term &#x201c;washed&#x201d; used herein refers to a protein fraction that has been mixed with an extraction solvent, such as ethanol, to remove antinutritional compounds, or other constituents, from the protein fraction.</p>

It will be understood though that not all of the protein will separate from the insoluble fiber fraction, and likewise, not all of the insoluble fiber will separate from the protein fraction. Moreover, not all of the insoluble protein fraction will separate from the soluble protein fraction. Accordingly, when the mixture has been subjected to a g-force sufficient to separate the mixture, the insoluble fiber fraction will comprise at least 10% crude fiber, optionally 15%, 20%, 25, 30% crude fiber on a dry weight basis. Likewise, the protein fraction will comprise less than 10% crude fiber, optionally less than 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1% and less than 1% crude fiber with the majority of other material comprising soluble and insoluble proteins, carbohydrate, ash and oil.

<p id="p-0301" num="0398">The present disclosure relates to processes for the production of a protein concentrate or a protein isolate from oilseed. A protein concentrate is an isolated protein extract of pressed oilseed, wherein the extract has greater than 60% protein content but less than 90% protein content on a dry weight basis. A protein concentrate has been treated to separate protein in the oilseed from the fiber and other unwanted antinutritional factors. A protein isolate is an isolated protein extract of pressed oilseed, wherein the extract has greater than or equal to 90% protein content on a dry weight basis. Typically, the protein isolate has up to 98%, 99%, 99.5% or 100% protein content on a dry weight basis. Examples of pressed oilseed include seedcake, defatted meal or protein-enriched meal, as explained below. Typically, the non-protein content includes non-protein compounds such as antinutritional substances, fiber, and other components or impurities such as coloring agents.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0399">In an embodiment, the disclosure provides a process for the removal of fiber, antinutritionals and other constituents, that are present within the oilseed. A person skilled in the art would recognize that antinutritionals include glucosinolates, phytic acid, phytates and other compounds that reduce the nutritional or commercial value of the protein concentrate or protein isolate. For example, antinutritional compounds may not be digestible by mammals (e.g. humans), have adverse effects, such as toxicity, and are desirably removed from the protein product. Certain antinutritionals have other undesirable properties, such as undesirable organoleptic properties. Examples of such compounds are sinapine, which has a bitter taste, and sinigrin which has a pungent and very bitter flavor. Further, other antinutritional constituent of oilseeds that are typically removed include, but are not limited to, coloring agents and/or other inert compounds. In an embodiment, the constituents which are removed or are reduced to safe or acceptable levels, are undesirable constituents or impurities using the processes of the present disclosure. A person skilled the art would recognize the safe and/or acceptable levels of particular antinutritionals in the final protein product.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">(III) Processes of the Disclosure</heading>
<p id="p-0341" num="0438">A person skilled in the art would be able to produce a protein-enriched meal using methods that are well known in the art. A general method for obtaining a protein-enriched meal is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. For example, when beginning with an oilseed, such as canola, rapeseed, mustard seed, broccoli seed, flax seed, cotton seed, hemp seed, safflower seed, sesame seed or soybean meal, in particular canola, the moisture content of the oilseed is adjusted. The moisture adjusted oilseed is optionally exposed to a heat treatment. In an embodiment of the processes of the present disclosure, the oilseed is heat treated to a temperature of about 60&#xb0; C. to about 120&#xb0; C., optionally about 70&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C., or about 80&#xb0; C. to about 90&#xb0; C., or about 80&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the heat treatment is carried out at a temperature of 100&#xb0; C. The heat treatment of the oilseed results in the inactivation of the enzymes present in the oilseed, for example, myrosinase, lipase, phospholipase. If the oilseed is not heat treated, the enzymes (such as myrosinase, lipase, phospholipase), as a result of their enzymatic action, can degrade the oil and breakdown glucosinolates releasing sulphur into oil. However, a heat treatment can also denature the proteins in the concentrate or isolate. At a temperature of about 75-100&#xb0; C., the enzymes are deactivated, and are therefore not able to degrade the oil and breakdown glucosinolates releasing sulphur into oil, while the protein within the oilseed is not denatured. The selection of a heat treatment temperature is a compromise between the opposing effects on oil quality, meal quality and economics. Accordingly, in an embodiment, a heat treatment temperature of 75-100&#xb0; C. results in a reasonably high protein dispersibility index (PDI), lower sulphur, FFA and phosphorus in pressed and butane/R134a extracted oils.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0439">Alternatively, in an embodiment, the oilseed is not exposed to a heat treatment and its moisture content is not adjusted. It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that the moisture content of the seed is typically in the range of about 7% to about 10% for a pressing operation. If the moisture content of the seed is not in this range, the moisture of the seed is optionally adjusted to about 7% to about 10% by adding water or drying, which is followed by blending and tempering.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0440">The oilseed is then pressed to remove the oil from within the oilseed. Generally, an oilseed such as canola, rapeseed, mustard seed, broccoli seed, flax seed, cotton seed, hemp seed, safflower seed, sesame seed or soybean, contains about 15% to about 50% oil (w/w), depending on the particular oilseed. Typically, oil is removed from an oilseed by pressing the oil from the oilseed to form a pressed oilseed. Examples of pressed oilseeds are a seedcake (or a presscake), while a defatted meal or a protein-enriched meal begin from a seedcake (or presscake), as explained below. It will be understood that a seedcake and a presscake define the same pressed seed meal. Methods of pressing oil from an oilseed are well known in the art. A typical pressing will remove about 30% to about 70% of the oil in the oilseed, and results in pressed oil and a pressed seedcake (or presscake).</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0441">In an embodiment, the removal of much of the remaining oil from the seedcake is accomplished by solvent extraction of the seedcake. Solvent extraction is a well known process in the art and utilizes low boiling solvents, such as hexane, methyl pentane or other refrigerants such as ITFM and R134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), to remove residual oil from the seedcake.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0442">The solvent extraction process results in a defatted seedcake meal and a solution of solvent and oil. The oil is separated from the solvent and utilized for other purposes. Generally, depending on the extraction process, the seedcake will contain residual amounts of solvent that are removed from the seedcake. Typically, the removal of the residual solvent from seedcake is accomplished by heating the seedcake in a desolventizer toaster (DT), flash desolventizer (such as a ring dryer) or vacuum oven, which causes the residual solvent to evaporate. The seedcake is subsequently dried. The above process removes much of the oil from the pressed oilseed and leaves material known as defatted meal. In an embodiment, the defatted meal will contain less than about 6% of oil, optionally about 0.5% to about 3% (w/w).</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0443">The defatted meal is then subjected to a milling step and a screening step to obtain a pressed oilseed known as a protein-enriched meal.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0444">The defatted meal is typically milled, for example with a disc mill or a hammer mill, to reduce the particle size of the defatted meal. When using a disc mill, the defatted meal is forced through two rotating discs which crush the defatted meal. When a hammer mill is used to reduce the particle size of the defatted meal, the meal is loaded into the hammer mill, wherein the hammers reduce the particle size of the defatted meal.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0445">After the particle size of the defatted meal has been sufficiently reduced, the milled defatted meal is screened through mesh screens, which results in an initial separation of a fiber fraction from the defatted meal, resulting in a protein-enriched meal. Fiber tends to have a larger particle size which is not able to pass through the screen. However, a portion of the fiber will be able to pass through the screen, and as such, only a portion of the fiber is removed by screening. Typically, about a 45 US mesh screen is used for the initial fiber separation. This is a dry screening process which results in a fiber enriched meal, which does not pass through the screen, and the protein-enriched meal, which does pass through the screen. The protein-enriched meal, however, still contains a significant amount of fiber and other antinutritional factors. From the milled defatted material, about a 30% to about 60% by weight protein-enriched meal is typically obtained, while the fiber fraction constitutes about 40% to about 70% of the original weight of the defatted material. The protein-enriched meal possesses a protein content of about 40% to about 60%, optionally 50% to about 55%, while the fiber fraction possesses about 35% to about 48% protein content. In an embodiment of the disclosure, it is this protein-enriched meal that is utilized to produce the protein concentrates and protein isolates of the present disclosure. However, in another embodiment, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a seedcake, defatted meal or protein-enriched meal is utilized with the processes of the present disclosure. The use of such a defatted or protein-enriched meal, and processing with a minimum amount of heat during conditioning, pressing, solvent extraction, desolventization and drying, leads to better protein concentrates and protein isolates.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0446">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, there is a process for removing fiber from a partially defatted, fully defatted or protein-enriched meal or &#x201c;meal&#x201d;). In particular, the process relates to separating and removing fiber from a meal based on the density and particle size differences between the fiber particles and the protein particles. The separation and removal of fiber is accomplished by using separation methods, at specific speeds, which can separate particles based on their density or particle size such as centrifugation, gravity sedimentation, a gravity table or hydrocyclone to separate the fiber from the mixture and form the protein slurry. In an embodiment, the separation is accomplished using centrifugation. In another embodiment, the separation is accomplished using a decanter centrifuge. In another embodiment, the separation is accomplished using a decanter centrifuge at a speed of about 1,000 rpm to about 2,000 rpm. In another embodiment, the separation is accomplished using a decanter centrifuge at a speed of about 1,500 rpm. In an embodiment, the centrifugation of a meal mixture results in three layers: i) an insoluble fiber layer and a protein slurry on top of the fiber, which is comprised of ii) an insoluble protein fraction and iii) a soluble protein fraction. Separation of the top and middle layers (the soluble protein extract and the insoluble fine protein fraction) from the bottom layer (coarse fiber solids), results in a protein slurry with fiber removed.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0447">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a process for the production of a protein concentrate possessing a protein content of about 60% to about 70% is obtained from a defatted or protein-enriched meal. An optional general process for the production of a protein concentrate is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0448">In an embodiment, a defatted or protein-enriched meal is produced by the process above, and is then washed at least once with about 5% to about 100%, optionally about 20% to about 90%, or about 40% to about 80% (v/v) ethanol in water, resulting in an ethanol extract and an ethanol washed defatted or protein-enriched meal. Other alcohols, such as methanol or isopropanol, can be utilized for washing the defatted or protein-enriched meal. In an embodiment, ethanol is used for washing the defatted or protein-enriched meal because it is less toxic than other alcohols, and a higher percentage of ethanol residue is allowed in the final product.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0449">In another embodiment, the defatted or protein-enriched meal is washed once with ethanol, wherein the ratio of ethanol to the protein-enriched meal is about 1:3 to about 1:15, typically about 1:4 to about 1:8, optionally 1:6, on a weight-to-weight basis of protein-enriched meal to ethanol.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0450">In another embodiment, the defatted or protein-enriched meal is washed twice with ethanol, wherein the amount of ethanol added to the protein-enriched meal results in a ratio of about 1:2 to about 1:15, typically about 1:5 to about 1:8, optionally 1:6, on a weight-to-weight basis of protein-enriched meal to ethanol. Typically, washing the defatted or protein-enriched meal at least twice results in the removal of more impurities from the defatted or protein-enriched meal and therefore increases the protein content in the protein concentrate.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0451">In a further embodiment, the defatted or protein-enriched meal is washed in a counter-current extractor. In this embodiment, the defatted or protein-enriched meal is washed about 2 times to about 10 times, wherein the ratio of solvent to the defatted or protein-enriched meal is about 1 to about 10 of meal to about 1 of meal.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0452">In another embodiment, the defatted or protein-enriched meal is washed with ethanol at a temperature of about 10&#xb0; C. to about 90&#xb0; C., optionally 20&#xb0; C. to about 60&#xb0; C., suitably at a temperature of about 40&#xb0; C. to about 60&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0453">The ethanol extract is optionally separated from the ethanol washed defatted or protein-enriched meal by centrifugation, filtration, vacuum filtration, pressure filtration, sedimentation, decantation or gravity draining. With respect to centrifugation, the ethanol mixture is typically fed to a decanter centrifuge or a basket centrifuge. The ethanol extract is then separated from the ethanol washed defatted or protein-enriched meal by centrifugal force. For the decanter centrifuge, a screw conveyer is contained within a solid bowl and both rotate at high speeds. Solids settling on the bowl are conveyed by the screw conveyer out of the centrifuge. For a basket centrifuge, which consists of a perforated basket rotating inside a stationary housing, the ethanol mixture is fed into the basket and centrifugal force pushes it against the filter liner. The solids are retained by the liner while the liquid passes through. For filtration, the ethanol extract is typically separated from the ethanol washed defatted or protein-enriched meal by draining through a perforated belt or basket in a reactor. For vacuum filtering or pressure filtering, the separation is aided by vacuum or pressure. In an embodiment, the ethanol extract is concentrated by evaporation of the ethanol to form a high sugar fraction, optionally containing antinutritional factors that can be further purified. The antinutritional compounds may be purified into valuable pharmaceutical, medicinal or chemical compounds, such as glucosinolates, phytic acid or phytates, sinapine and sinigrin. In an embodiment, the ethanol extract is heated under vacuum at about 30&#xb0; C. to about 90&#xb0; C., which results in the evaporation of ethanol and water, and soluble solids are left behind. Ethanol is further separated from water by distillation and re-used in the process. The concentrated high-sugar fraction is dried by spray drying, rotary drum drying, vacuum drying, flash drying, ring drying, microwave drying, freeze drying or using a fluidized bed dryer.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0454">In another embodiment, the washed defatted or protein-enriched meal is dried to form the protein concentrate, possessing a protein content of about 60% to about 70%. In a further embodiment, the washed protein-enriched meal is dried in a spray dryer, drum dryer, vacuum dryer, fluidized bed dryer or ring dryer to form the protein concentrate possessing a protein content of about 60% to about 70%. These dryers remove the solvent by drying the protein concentrate under a vacuum or at atmospheric pressure at elevated temperatures of about 30&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0455">In an embodiment, the protein concentrate is dried to a moisture content of about 1% to about 10%, optionally about 4% to about 8%.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0456">In another embodiment, the ethanol that is removed through drying is recovered and recycled so it can be used again in further ethanol extractions. The ethanol is recovered through evaporation and distillation.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0457">In another embodiment, the dried protein concentrate possessing a protein content of about 60% to about 70% is further milled into powder form without coarse particles.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0458">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a process for producing a protein concentrate possessing a protein content of about 70% to about 75% on a dry weight basis. In an embodiment, a general process for the production of a protein concentrate possessing a protein content of about 70% to about 75% is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, where the removal of fiber is also detailed. In an embodiment, the use of an extraction solvent, such as ethanol, leads to a protein concentrate or protein isolate having superior organoleptic properties, as well as superior water solubility properties, which therefore possesses better functional properties.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0470">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the mixing solvent is any solvent which forms a slurry with the defatted or protein-enriched meal when mixed together and is able to suspend the protein within the mixture. In another embodiment, the mixing solvent comprises water, methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, or mixtures thereof. In a further embodiment, the mixing solvent comprises water or ethanol, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0471">In another embodiment, the defatted or protein-enriched meal comprises a canola, rapeseed, mustard seed, broccoli seed, flax seed, cotton seed, hemp seed, safflower seed, sesame seed or soybean meal. In a further embodiment, the protein-enriched meal comprises a canola meal, a soybean meal, a mustard seed meal or a flax seed meal.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0472">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the defatted or protein-enriched meal is mixed with a mixing solvent in a ratio of about 3 to about 10 parts solvent to about 1 part of the defatted or protein-enriched meal, on a weight-to-weight basis.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0473">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the pH of the first mixture is adjusted to a pH of about 3.0 to about 10.0, optionally about 6.8 to about 7.2 with a solution of an alkali metal base or an acid, such as phosphoric, hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. In a further embodiment, a solution of an alkali metal base comprising about 1% to about 40% by weight, optionally about 5% to about 30%, of the alkali metal base and water is added to the first mixture. In another embodiment, the alkali metal base comprises sodium hydroxide (NaOH).</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0474">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the first mixture is thoroughly agitated. In another embodiment, an inline mixer is used for thorough mixing of the first mixture. Thorough mixing of the first mixture disperses the protein particles and releases natural sugar compounds that are trapped inside the insoluble protein particles in the mixing solvent. In addition, the agitation suspends the solids of the protein-enriched meal in the mixing solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0475">In a further embodiment, the thoroughly mixed first mixture is wet screened resulting in a separation of the fiber from the mixture which contains the protein. In another embodiment of the disclosure, the mesh screen comprises a US mesh screen of about 20 to about 200 US mesh. In a further embodiment, the mesh screen is a vibratory screen. A person skilled in the art would recognize that other screens, for example revolving screens, shaking screens or oscillating screens, could be used in place of vibratory screens to perform substantially the same function of vibrating the mixture which aids in separation of the first mixture from the fiber. In an embodiment of the disclosure, the fiber in the meal swells upon addition of the mixing solvent, increasing the particle size of the fiber. Consequently, the mesh screen prevents the fiber from passing through, while the protein in the first mixture passes through the screen, resulting in a separation of the fiber from the protein. In an embodiment, the fiber fraction is dried and can be used in dietary fiber products. The fiber fraction optionally contains protein and carbohydrates.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0476">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the defatted or protein-enriched meal is thoroughly mixed with water to form the second mixture. In an embodiment, wet milling is used to mix the second mixture. In another embodiment, an inline mixer is used to thoroughly mix the second mixture. In an embodiment, the mixing of the defatted or protein-enriched meal in water, results in the internal fiber structure being exposed, which allows for the cellulase complex to efficiently hydrolyze the fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0477">In a further embodiment of the disclosure, the pH of the second mixture is optionally adjusted with an acid. In an embodiment, the pH of the second mixture is adjusted to a pH that is suitable for the activity of an enzyme within the second mixture. In an embodiment, the pH of the second mixture is adjusted to a pH of about 3 to about 7. The pH of the second solution is adjusted with an acid solution. In an embodiment, the acid solution is phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. In an embodiment, the natural pH of the second mixture is about 6.8 to about 7.2, and therefore the pH of the second mixture is not adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0478">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the cellulase complex is added to the second mixture in an amount of about 1 to about 10 grams (about 0.1% to about 1%) to about 1 kg of dried solids in the second mixture. In a further disclosure, the cellulase complex is mixed with the second mixture for about 0.5 hours to about 5 hours. In another embodiment, the cellulase complex is mixed with the second mixture for about 1 to about 3 hours. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that cellulase complex contains different types of cellulase enzyme. For example, cellulase complex contains at least one of endocellulase, exocellulase, cellobiohydrolase, cellobiase, endohemicellulase and exohemicellulase. Cellulase enzymes possess enzymatic activity which are able to hydrolyze the fiber to constituent sugars within the second mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0479">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the first or second mixture is washed at least once with about 5% to about 100%, optionally about 25% to about 85%, or about 50% to about 85%, or about 60% to about 85%, of the extraction solvent (v/v) in water. The addition of the extraction solvent precipitates proteins in the first or second mixture, while the carbohydrates from the oilseed and from the hydrolyzation of the fiber remain in the extraction solvent, which allows for separation. It will be understood that an extraction solvent will be any solvent which dissolves the carbohydrates and other undesirable compounds, but precipitates the protein. In embodiment, the extraction solvent is water, methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, and mixtures thereof. In another embodiment, the extraction solvent is ethanol. It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that if the extraction solvent comprises 100% extraction solvent, no water will be present in the extraction solvent. For example, the extraction solvent could be 100% ethanol. In another embodiment, the extraction solvent is 60% ethanol in water.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0480">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the extraction solvent is added in an amount to adjust the ratio of the extraction solvent to the first or second mixture of about 5% to about 95%, optionally about 10% to about 90%, or about 40% to about 80% (v/v) of the extraction solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0481">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the first or second mixture is washed with an extraction solvent at a temperature of about 10&#xb0; C. to about 90&#xb0; C.</p>

<p id="p-0377" num="0484">In another embodiment of the disclosure, steps 2) and 3) are optionally repeated at least once. In an embodiment, steps 2) and 3) are repeated at least twice. Repeating steps 2) and 3) results in a protein product containing less impurities, such as fiber and other antinutritional factors.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0485">In another embodiment, the washed defatted or protein-enriched meal is dried to form the protein concentrate, possessing a protein content of about 70% to about 75% on a dry weight basis.

<p id="p-0393" num="0509">In another embodiment, the protein slurry is then centrifuged using a disc stack centrifuge to separate insoluble proteins from soluble proteins, forming a protein precipitate and a soluble protein fraction. In an embodiment, the protein slurry is pumped to a disc centrifuge. The centrifuge has a bowl which spins at about 7500 rpm.

<p id="p-0400" num="0525">In an embodiment, the soluble protein fraction is obtained using the same process as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0526">It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that the steps of the process do not have to be followed exactly. For example, a person skilled in the art would recognize that the milling step could be performed before the screening step.</p>

In a further embodiment, the protein-enriched meal comprises a canola meal. In an embodiment, the protein-enriched meal comprises a soybean meal. In another embodiment, the protein-enriched meal comprises mustard seed meal. In a further embodiment, the protein-enriched meal comprises flax seed meal.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0528">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the mixing solvent comprises water or a salt solution. In an embodiment, the salt solution comprises less than 5%, optionally about 3% to about 4%, or 3.5% by weight of salt in solution. In a further embodiment, the mixing solvent comprises water. In another embodiment, the ratio of defatted or protein-enriched meal to the mixing solvent is about 1:3 to about 1:20. In a further embodiment, the ratio is about 1:6 to about 1:10. In an embodiment, the ratio is about 1:6 to about 1:8.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0529">In an embodiment, the soluble protein fraction is purified by ultrafiltration and diafiltration using a membrane filtration apparatus. In an embodiment, when ultrafiltration is utilized, the soluble protein fraction is heated to a temperature of about 1&#xb0; C. to about 60&#xb0; C., optionally 40&#xb0; C. to about 55&#xb0; C., before being passed through an ultrafiltration apparatus fitted with membranes to filter proteins larger than about 10,000 daltons, optionally about 30,000, or about 100,000 daltons. The filtered protein is recycled back to the feed tank while the liquid is discarded. The ultrafiltration process is continued until the amount of protein that has been filtered in the feed tank is equal to about 30% to about 40% of its initial weight of the soluble protein fraction.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0530">In a further embodiment, when diafiltration is utilized, it is conducted at about 1&#xb0; C. to about 60&#xb0; C., optionally about 40&#xb0; C. to about 55&#xb0; C., using the diafiltration unit, which is fitted with the membranes to filter proteins larger than about 10,000 daltons, optionally about 30,000, or about 100,000 daltons. The original volume of soluble protein fraction in the feed tank is held constant by adding water to make up for the removed liquid. The filtered protein is recycled back to the feed tank. The amount of water added to maintain the original volume of protein solution is about 2 times the original volume of soluble protein fraction. For example, if 100 L of soluble protein fraction is used, 200 L of water is added to the soluble protein fraction in the feed tank during the cycle of diafiltration. The volume of the feed tank is kept constant at 100 L with the continued addition of water to the feed tank while the liquid is removed from the system through diafiltration.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0531">In an embodiment, after the soluble protein fraction has been filtered, the filtered soluble protein is spray dried to form a high functional protein isolate comprising a protein content of greater than about 90% on a dry weight basis. It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that spray drying is the transformation of a feed from a fluid state into a dried form by spraying the feed into a circulating hot air medium. Generally, spray drying transforms the filtered protein into many droplets which are then exposed to a fast current of hot air. As a result of the very large surface area of the droplets the water in the protein evaporates almost instantaneously and the droplets are transformed into powdery dry protein particles. In an embodiment, the inlet temperature is about 180&#xb0; C. to about 220&#xb0; C. which is the temperature of the hot air entering the spray dryer chamber, the outlet temperature is about 75&#xb0; C. to about 90&#xb0; C., which is the temperature of the exhaust, and the feed temperature is about 40&#xb0; C. to about 50&#xb0; C. It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that the washed protein precipitate can be used as a protein isolate without drying. However, the dried protein isolate has a better shelf life as removal of the solvent, for example water, results in a more stable protein isolate.</p>

<p id="p-0413" num="0548">In a further embodiment, the mixture is wet screened resulting in a separation of the fiber from the mixture which contains the protein. In another embodiment of the disclosure, the mesh screen comprises a US mesh screen of size about 20 to about 200 mesh. In an embodiment, the mesh screen is of size 40 US mesh size. In a further embodiment, the mesh screen is a vibratory screen. The mesh screen prevents the fiber from passing through, while the protein in the mixture passes through the screen, resulting in a separation of the fiber from the protein. This results in a mixture of protein which passes through the screen and a fiber fraction which is trapped by the screen. In an embodiment, the fiber fraction is dried and can be used in dietary fiber products.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0549">In an embodiment, some protein and carbohydrates are present in the fiber fraction.</p>

<p id="p-0419" num="0554">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the precipitated protein is mixed with water and its pH optionally adjusted for the addition of cellulase complex, in a similar manner as described above. This additional enzymatic step hydrolyzes residual fiber and allows the removal of fiber from the protein precipitate.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0555">In another embodiment, after treatment with the cellulase complex, the protein precipitate is washed at least once with an extraction solvent to remove water-soluble sugar compounds as a result of the fiber hydrolyzation by the cellulase complex. In an embodiment, the extraction solvent is water. In an embodiment, the protein precipitate mixture is washed at least twice with the extraction solvent. In an embodiment, the ratio of extraction solvent to the precipitated protein is about 10:1 to about 1:1, optionally about 4:1 to about 2:1. The mixture is then further centrifuged to obtain a protein precipitate that has been further purified.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0556">In an embodiment, the further purified protein precipitate is then subjected to high pressure jet cooking to obtain a high functional protein isolate having a protein content of greater than about 90% on a dry weight basis. In an embodiment, the jet cooking of the protein isolate occurs at a temperature of about 90&#xb0; C. to about 120&#xb0; C. for about 1 second to about 2 minutes, optionally about 3 seconds to about 30 seconds. As will be understood by a person skilled in the art, jet cooking involves the injection of steam into the purified protein, and results in the pasteurization of the protein and improves the functional properties of the protein isolate.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0557">In another embodiment, the further purified protein precipitate is hydrolyzed using proteases to form a hydrolyzed protein extract containing hydrolyzed proteins, peptides and amino acids having a protein content of greater than about 90% on a dry weight basis. In an embodiment, the proteases are, for example, Alcalase&#xae; and Flavourzyme&#xae;. Alcalase&#xae; and Flavourzyme&#xae; were obtained from Novozymes North America, Inc., Franklinton, N.C. USA. This step hydrolyzes the protein in the protein precipitate into smaller peptides and amino acids, which are soluble in nutritional drinks and are easily adsorbed. In an embodiment, the purified protein precipitate is mixed with water to form a protein slurry, which is optionally followed by pH adjustment to a pH of about 6.0 to about 10.0, optionally about 7.5 to about 8.5.

The pH of the mixture is then adjusted to a pH of about 5.0 to about 7.0, or about 6.0 to about 7.0, or about 6.5, and a protease to form a hydrolyzed protein extract, such as Flavourzyme&#xae;, is then added to the mixture. In an embodiment, the protease to form a hydrolyzed protein extract, such as Flavourzyme&#xae;, is added in a ratio of about 0.5% based on the dry weight of the protein slurry. In a further embodiment, the mixture is then heated to a temperature of about 20&#xb0; C. to about 60&#xb0; C., optionally about 40&#xb0; C. to about 60&#xb0; C., or about 45&#xb0; C. to about 55&#xb0; C., for about 1 to about 4 hours.

In an embodiment, the mixture is centrifuged using a decanter centrifuge.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0571">The centrifugation of the mixture results in three layers: i) an insoluble fiber layer and a protein slurry on top of the fiber, which was comprised of ii) an insoluble protein fraction and iii) a soluble protein fraction. Separation of the top and middle layers (the soluble protein extract and the insoluble fine protein fraction) from the bottom layer (coarse fiber solids), resulted in the protein slurry with fiber removed.

It was determined that when the speed of the centrifugation is too high, for example at 5,000 rpm, the insoluble protein fraction settles with the fiber. If the speed of the centrifugation is too low, fiber will remain in the protein slurry. Accordingly, in an embodiment, when the speed of the centrifugation is between about 1,000 rpm and about 2,000 rpm, optionally 1,400 to about 1,600 rpm, suitably about 1,500 rpm, the fiber in the mixture is separated from both the soluble and insoluble protein.</p>

<p id="p-0480" num="0646">In an embodiment, the temperature suitable for phytase activity is between 20&#xb0; C. and 60&#xb0; C., optionally between 40&#xb0; C. and 55&#xb0; C., suitably between 50&#xb0; C. and 55&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the pH suitable for phytase activity is between 2.0 and 7.0, optionally between 4.0 and 6.0, suitably between 4.5 and 5.5, optionally 5.0 to 5.5. In another embodiment, the concentration of the phytase enzyme is between 0.01% to 1.0% (w/w) based on the weight of the oilseed meal, optionally 0.01% and 0.5% optionally 0.01% and 0.1%. In another embodiment, the mixture is incubated with the phytase enzyme under good agitation. The addition of phytase enzyme to the protein mixture results in the hydrolysis of phytates and/or phytic acid present in the oilseed meal to organic phosphates and inositol. It is known to those skilled in the art that phytates and phytic acid may constitute undesirable anti-nutritional compounds in a protein meal, and accordingly, are desirably removed from the oilseed meal and the final protein products. Accordingly, the addition of phytase enzyme results in the hydrolysis of the phytates and/or phytic acid which are subsequently removed from the mixture. In addition, it has also been determined that phytates and/or phytic acid complex with proteins to form an insoluble gel complex. Accordingly, in an embodiment, when filtration, such as diafiltration or ultrafiltration, is utilized to purify and separate protein concentrates and/or protein isolates, the insoluble protein/phytate (or phytic acid) gel complexes block the filtration apparatus, reducing the flow through the filtration apparatus, and accordingly, reducing the amount of recoverable protein and filtration efficiency. It will be understood that the addition of phytase to the mixture and the conditions recited for reduction or removal of phytates and/or phytic acid apply to all of the processes and embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>

<p id="p-0482" num="0648">In another embodiment of the disclosure, the mixture is subjected to a g-force sufficient to separate the mixture to form a fiber fraction and protein fractions comprising an insoluble protein fraction and a soluble protein fraction. The separation of the mixture using a sufficient g-force is described herein with reference to a centrifuge, such as a decanter centrifuge or a disc stack centrifuge, but a person skilled in the art would understand that other methods of separation that create a separation force, including a hydrocyclone, are also included. Accordingly, in an embodiment, when the mixture is subjected to a sufficient g-force using a centrifuge, the mixture separates into three-phases as a result of the sedimentation principle: (i) an insoluble fiber fraction, and (ii) protein fractions comprising (ii.a) an insoluble protein fraction, and (ii.b) a soluble protein fraction. The centripetal acceleration acting on the mixture results in the insoluble fiber fraction, which has a relatively higher density and/or greater particle size compared to the other fractions, moving further along the radial direction in which the centripetal force is acting (perpendicular to the axis of rotation). When a centrifuge is utilized, the insoluble fiber fraction (or phase) moves towards the bottom of the centrifuge tube, as a result of its relatively higher density and/or greater particle size, resulting in one of the phases of separation. As a result of the proteins in the insoluble protein fraction having a lower relative density and/or smaller particle size as compared to the insoluble fiber fraction, the insoluble protein fraction forms another phase of separation (the middle phase). Finally, the proteins in the soluble protein fraction, being soluble in the blending solvent and/or having a lower relative density compared to the fiber fraction and insoluble protein fraction, remain near the top of the centrifuge tube. If oil seed meal is partially defatted meal, a fourth phase may also form on top of the soluble protein phase comprising residual oil. It will be understood that subjecting the mixture to a sufficient g-force will not result in a total separation of the three fractions, and accordingly, a minor amount of fiber will be present in the protein fraction, while protein will be present in the insoluble fiber fraction. There will be a certain amount of protein trapped within the structure of the insoluble fiber fraction that is not separable using mechanical means (i.e. using a centrifuge). In an embodiment, the amount of protein trapped within the fiber fraction will be 30%, optionally 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%. In another embodiment, proteases (such as Protames, Alcalase 2.4 L FG and/or Flavourzyme 1000 L) are used to hydrolyze the protein trapped within the fiber fraction, which releases the protein from the fiber, and can be recovered therefrom, and such a process is also included in the present disclosure. In this embodiment, the hydrolyzed protein is separated from the fiber using any of the means disclosed herein (e.g. centrifugation, hydrocyclone). It will be understood that the disclosure concerning the g-force sufficient to separate the mixture as described above applies to all of the processes and embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0649">In an embodiment, the mixture is subjected to a g-force of between 100 g and 500 g, suitably between 150 g and 400 g, optionally between 180 g and 350 g.

<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Analysis</p>
<p id="p-0546" num="0716">Mixing of the materials was performed using a Ribbon Blender (Torco Model R-12, Toronto Coppersmithing International Ltd., Scarborough, Ontario, Canada). Heat treatments of seed samples were conducted using an Infra Red Cereal Processing System (Micronizing Company Limited, Framlingham, Sulfolk, England) or a two-tray Simon-Rosedown cooker (Laboratory cooker-press, Simon-Rosedowns Limited, Hull, England). Pressing of the oil seeds is performed using a Gusta Laboratory Screw Press. Ultrafiltration was carried out using a Millipore&#xae; Ultrafiltration Unit (Model A60, Millipore&#xae; Corporation, Bedford, Mass., USA). Protein content of the samples was determined by the Leco&#xae; Protein Analyzer (Model FP-428, Leco&#xae; Corporation, ST. Joseph, Mich. U.S.A.) based on AOCS Official Method Ba 4e-93. Moisture content of the samples was determined by drying samples in a 105&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. convection oven for 16 hours or to a constant weight based on AOCS Official Method Ba 2a-38. Oil content of the samples was determined based on AOCS Official Method Ba 3-38 with the following changes: (a) 2 g of sample was used instead of 5 g in the analysis; (b) extraction continued for 4 hours, and (c) extraction flask was heated to remove residual petroleum ethers. Ash content of the samples was determined based on AOCS Official Method Ba 5a-49 with the following changes: (a) samples were pre-ashed on a hot plate prior to being placed into the muffle furnace; (b) samples were incinerated for 18 hours in muffle furnace; and (c) nitric acid was added if sample remained black. Crude fiber content of the samples was determined based on AOCS Official Method Ba 6-84 with the following changes: (a) samples with oil contents below 3% were not defatted and (b) digest was dried for 2 hours at 130&#xb0; C. Protein dispersibility index (PDI) of the samples was determined based on A.O.C.S. Official Method Ba 10-65. Free fatty acid (FFA) of the oil samples was determined based on AOCS Official Method Ca 5a-40. Phosphorus and sulphur of the samples were determined based on the modified methods of AOCS Ca20-99 and AOCS Ca 17-01 (modified), respectively. Crude fiber content of the samples was determined based on AOCS Official Method Ba 6-84 with the following changes: (a) samples with oil contents below 3% were not defatted and (b) digest was dried for 2 hours at 130&#xb0; C. Protein dispersibility index (PDI) of the samples was determined based on A.O.C.S. Official Method Ba 10-65. Glucosinolate content of the samples was determined based on the Method of the Canadian Grain Commission, Grain Research Laboratory (Daun, J. K. and McGregor, D. I., Glucosinolate Analysis of Rapeseed (Canola), Dec. 15, 1981). Solvent residues were determined using GC/MS techniques based on a modified method of A.O.C.S. Official Method, Ba 13-87.</p>

<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Effect of Heat Treatment on Canola Seed (<i>Brassica juncea</i>) at Temperatures Between 75&#xb0; C.-95&#xb0; C.</heading>
<p id="p-0547" num="0717">Seven samples containing about 4 kg of canola seed (28 kg in total) were adjusted from an original moisture content of about 6.25% to about 11% by adding water to the canola seed in a plastic pail with manual agitation for a few minutes. The canola seed in the pails was then covered and tempered overnight in the laboratory.</p>
<p id="p-0548" num="0718">After the canola seed had been tempered overnight, six samples containing about 4 kg of the tempered seed (about 24 kg in total) were subjected to individual heat treatments with a combination of high temperatures and short residence times using a lab scale as listed in Table 1. For control, a control sample (about 4 kg) of canola seed was heated in a microwave oven for 2 minutes (heat to 85-95&#xb0; C.). The canola seed was then covered with an aluminum foil and heated at 95&#xb0; C. in a forced air oven for 30 minutes (Table 1).</p>
<p id="p-0549" num="0719">After heat treatment, seven samples (about 4 kg each) of the heat treated canola seeds were flaked using a lab flaking mill and then pressed, resulting in pressed oils and pressed protein cakes. The pressed oils were analyzed for sulfur and free fatty acid (FFA) contents. The pressed cakes were stored in a freezer.</p>
<p id="p-0550" num="0720">Seven samples (about 1 kg each) of the pressed cakes from the six heat treatment trials and one control were extracted using a solvent mixture of butane and R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) to produce extracted oils and defatted canola meals. The press cake was loaded in a column and the solvent mixture under 300 PSI pressure was flowed through the press cake to fluidize the press cake particles. The oil was extracted from the cake at 50&#xb0; C. The solvent mixture with oil in a liquid form was pumped to a low pressure zone and the pressure was released. The solvent mixture turns into gas while the oil remains in a liquid state for the separation of oil from the solvent mixture. The defatted canola meals were analyzed for protein dispersibility index (PDI), the results of which are shown in Table 3. The extracted oil samples were analyzed for sulfur, phosphorus and FFA contents, the results of which are shown in Tables 4-6.</p>
<p id="p-0551" num="0721">The remaining pressed cakes were extracted with methyl pentane for five hours using a lab Soxhlet system. Approximately 6-8 L of fresh methyl pentane were required for each extraction lot. The extracted oil was recovered by evaporation and desolventization to remove the solvent from the miscella under vacuum at 60&#xb0; C. The extracted oil was analyzed for sulfur, phosphorus and FFA contents. The methyl pentane extracted meals were desolventized in a laboratory fume hood for three days at room temperature. The moisture and oil contents of the pressed cake are shown in Table 7.</p>

<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Effect of Heat Treatment on Canola Seed (<i>Brassica juncea</i>) at Temperatures Between 100&#xb0; C.-130&#xb0; C.</heading>
<p id="p-0552" num="0722">Five samples containing about 4 kg (about 20 kg in total) of canola seed were adjusted from an original moisture content of about 6.25% to about 11% by adding water to the canola seed in a plastic pail with manual agitation for a few minutes. The canola seed in the pails was then covered and tempered overnight in the laboratory.</p>
<p id="p-0553" num="0723">After the canola seed had been tempered overnight, five samples containing about 4 kg of the tempered seed (about 20 kg in total) were subjected to individual heat treatments with a combination of high temperatures and short residence times using a lab scale as listed in Table 2. After heat treatment, the five samples (about 4 kg each) of the heat treated canola seeds were flaked using a lab flaking mill, and then pressed. The pressed oils were analyzed for sulfur, phosphorus and FFA contents. The pressed cakes were stored in a freezer.</p>
<p id="p-0554" num="0724">Five samples (about 1.5 kg each) of the pressed cakes from the five heat treatment trials were extracted using a solvent mixture of butane and R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) to produce extracted oils and defatted canola meals. The extracted oils were analyzed for sulfur and FFA contents. The defatted canola meals were analyzed for protein dispersibility index (PDI).</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Discussion</p>
<p id="p-0555" num="0725">In the heat treatment process, rapid heating makes it possible to expose the canola seed to an increased temperature very quickly and thus to inactivate the enzymes (e.g. myosinase, lipase, phospholipase, etc.) This is a more economical way for consistent inactivation of enzymes without loss of lysine or other heat sensitive amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0556" num="0726">As shown in Table 3, the increase in the heat treatment temperature from 75&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. resulted in the gradual decrease in the PDI of the defatted meal. The decrease in PDI of the defatted meal accelerated when the temperature was increased from 105&#xb0; C. to 130&#xb0; C. The sharp drop in PDI occurred when the temperature was above 110&#xb0; C. Typically, the higher the heat treatment temperature, the higher the percentage of protein molecules being denatured and thus the lower the PDI of the defatted meal.</p>
<p id="p-0557" num="0727">The sulphur content in the pressed oil from canola seed without heat treatment was 46.9 ppm, which decreased sharply to 21.5 ppm and 9.77 ppm with heat treatment at 75&#xb0; C. and 80&#xb0; C. for 15 seconds, respectively. Heat treatment at higher temperatures from 80&#xb0; C. to 130&#xb0; C. did not have any major effect on the sulphur content in the pressed oil (as shown in Table 4).</p>
<p id="p-0558" num="0728">The sulphur in the butane/R134a extracted oil decreased from the level of 303 ppm without heat treatment to 99.3 ppm at 75&#xb0; C. and 101 ppm at 80&#xb0; C. The sulphur level showed continuous reduction with increase in the temperature of heat treatment except at 85&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0559" num="0729">The sulphur content in the methyl pentane extracted crude oil decreased continuously in relation to the increase in temperature from 222 ppm at 75&#xb0; C. to 34.5 ppm at 95&#xb0; C. Methyl pentane extracted oil had higher sulphur levels at 75&#xb0; C. and 80&#xb0; C., but lower at 85-95&#xb0; C. as compared with butane/R134a extracted oils.</p>
<p id="p-0560" num="0730">The sulphur content in the pressed oil, the butane/R134a and methyl pentane extracted oils of the control samples were high. In the heat treatment of the control samples, the canola seed was covered using an aluminum foil and heated at 95&#xb0; C. in a forced air oven for 0.5 hour. Because the heat transfer efficiency is low, the temperature of the seed in the oven might have been lower than 95&#xb0; C. even though the oven temperature was set at that temperature. Therefore, myrosinase was still mostly active, causing the breakdown of glucosinolates and release of the sulphur into the pressed and extracted oils.</p>
<p id="p-0561" num="0731">The free fatty acid in the pressed oil decreased slightly with the increase in the heat treatment temperature from 75&#xb0; C. to 95&#xb0; C. (as shown in Table 5). A sharp drop in FFA occurred at 100&#xb0; C. and FFA showed little change from 100-130&#xb0; C. The FFA in the butane/R134a extracted oil showed significant decrease with the increase in temperature from 75-100&#xb0; C., however a further increase in temperature gained little benefit for the reduction in FFA (Table 5). The FFA in methyl pentane extracted oil also decreased with the increase in temperature from 75 to 95&#xb0; C. The increase in heat treatment temperature enhanced the degree of inactivation of lipase, which in return reduced the hydrolysis of oil by lipase and thus reduced the FFA content.</p>
<p id="p-0562" num="0732">The FFA content in the oil is mainly dependent on the quality of seed. Improper handling or storage can cause elevated levels of FFA.</p>
<p id="p-0563" num="0733">The phosphorus content of butane/R134a extracted oil was very low ranging from 2.93 ppm at 75&#xb0; C. to 22.8 ppm at 95&#xb0; C. as listed in seen in Table 6. The phosphorus content of the pressed oil was also low at heat treatment temperatures of 100, 105, 110, and 130&#xb0; C. The phosphorus content of pressed oil from the heat treatment of 120&#xb0; C. was 117 ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0564" num="0734">The selection of a heat treatment temperature is a compromise between the opposing effects on oil quality, meal quality and economics. Accordingly, in an embodiment, a heat treatment temperature of 100&#xb0; C. results in a reasonably high PDI, lower sulphur, FFA and phosphorus in pressed and butane/R134a extracted oils.</p>
<p id="p-0565" num="0735">Heat treatment of canola seed above 80&#xb0; C. reduced the sulphur content in pressed oil to levels below 10 ppm. The pressed oil accounted for about 50-60% of total crude oil from the crushing operation. The heat treatment of canola seed reduced the sulphur content of butane/R134a and methyl pentane extracted oils substantially with an increase in temperature. The high sulphur in the extracted oil is related to high glucosinolates content in the canola seed. The canola seed (<i>B. juncea</i>) contained about 22.95 &#x3bc;moles/g of glucosinolates on a dry weight basis. If canola seed with a glucosinolate content of 12 &#x3bc;moles/g or lower is used, the sulphur content in the extracted oil can be reduced further using the same heat treatment condition.</p>
<p id="p-0566" num="0736">For a heat treatment of 100&#xb0; C. for 15 seconds, the phosphorus content in the pressed and butane/R134a extracted oils was below 50 ppm.</p>

<p id="h-0021" num="0000">(a) Defatted Meal</p>
<p id="p-0567" num="0737">Approximately 4 kg of canola seed (<i>B. juncea</i>) was adjusted from the original 6.25% moisture to 11% moisture by adding water to canola seed in a plastic pail with manual agitation for a few minutes. The canola seed in the pail was then covered and tempered overnight in the laboratory. The tempered canola seed was then heat treated at 100&#xb0; C. for 15 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0568" num="0738">After heat treatment, the canola seed was flaked using a lab flaking mill and then pressed. The pressed cake was stored in a freezer before solvent extraction. The pressed oil was recovered and stored in a freezer. The pressed cake was extracted with 6-8 liters of methyl pentane at about 58-67&#xb0; C. for 5 hours using a lab scale Soxhlet system. The extracted oil was recovered by evaporation and desolventization to remove the solvent from the miscella under vacuum at 60&#xb0; C. The extracted oil was stored in a freezer. The methyl pentane extracted meal or defatted meal was desolventized in a laboratory fume hood for three days at ambient temperature. Approximately 2 kg of defatted meal was produced and stored at ambient temperature before further evaluation.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">(b) Protein Enriched Meal</p>
<p id="p-0569" num="0739">Approximately 2 kg of defatted meal was ground using a coffee grinder for 15-20 seconds. The ground meal was screened through a 60 US mesh screen. Approximately 0.94 kg of fine meal (protein-enriched meal) and 1.06 kg of coarse meal (fiber enriched meal) were obtained.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">(c) 65% Protein Concentrate</p>
<p id="p-0570" num="0740">Approximately 0.94 kg of protein-enriched meal was extracted by mixing with 5.64 kg of 65% (v/v) ethanol at ambient temperature for 1 hour. The mixture was centrifuged at 4,000 g force for 15 minutes to separate the liquid sugar extract from the protein solids using a lab centrifuge. The sugar extracts were combined together and concentrated using a lab Buchi Rotavapor at 80&#xb0; C., which was followed by freeze drying of the concentrated sugar extract using a lab freeze dryer. The washed protein-enriched meal was desolventized in a lab fume hood, which was followed by drying in a lab forced air oven. Approximately 0.67 kg of protein concentrate containing 65% protein on a dry weight basis and 0.21 kg of dried sugar fraction were produced, respectively. The analysis of the defatted meal, protein-enriched meal and 65% protein concentrate are shown in Table 8.</p>

<p id="p-0571" num="0741">The process for preparation of the protein-enriched meal was the same as in Example 2 except for (1) canola seed was cooked at 80&#xb0; C. for 25 minutes before pressing, and (2) the defatted meal was milled using a disc mill before screening through a 60 US mesh screen as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0572" num="0742">Approximately 1 kg of protein-enriched meal was mixed under homogeneous agitation with 6 kg of 80% (v/v) ethanol at 50&#xb0; C.&#xb1;5&#xb0; C. for 1 hour, which was followed by screening the mixture through a 40 mesh US screen to remove fiber. The screened mixture was centrifuged at 4,000 g force using a lab centrifuge for 15 minutes to separate the sugar extract from the protein solids. The protein-solids were mixed under homogeneous agitation with 6 kg of 80% (v/v) ethanol at 50&#xb0; C.&#xb1;5&#xb0; C. for 0.5 hour. The washed protein solids was separated from the sugar extract by centrifugation at 4,000 g force for 0.5 hour. The protein solids were again washed 6 kg of 80% (v/v) ethanol for at 50&#xb0; C.&#xb1;5&#xb0; C. 0.5 hour, which was followed by centrifugation at 4,000 g force for 15 minutes. Finally the washed protein solids were dried to give a protein concentrate containing 70% protein on a dry weight basis. The ethanol was recovered from the combined sugar extract through evaporation under vacuum at 80&#xb0; C. using a lab Buchi Rotavapor. The concentrated sugar extract was spray dried into a dried sugar sample.</p>

Further, the moisture and oil contents of the press cakes of Sample 1 are given in Tables 14 and 15.</p>
<p id="p-0584" num="0768">The average oil content in the flaked press cake (Sample 1b) as calculated from the results in Table 15 is 15.18% (dwb). The average moisture content in the flaked press cake (Sample 1b) is 7.87%. The oil content in the starting canola seed is 44.39% (dwb) (Table 11). Moreover, 1,566 kg of flaked press cake (Sample 1b) contained 219 kg of crude oil, while the starting 2,676 kg of canola seed after the moisture adjustment contained 1,091 kg of crude oil (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). Approximately 872 kg of crude oil or 79.93% of the total crude oil was pressed out of the flaked seed during the pressing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0585" num="0769">The average oil content in the non-flaked press cake (Sample 1a) as calculated from the results in Tables 10 and 11 was 29.83% (dwb). The average moisture content in the non-flaked press cake (Sample 1a) was 8.31% (Tables 11 &#x26; 14). Moreover, 181.6 kg of non-flaked press cake Sample 1) contained 49.7 kg of crude oil, while the 301 kg of starting canola seed after the moisture adjustment contained 122.8 kg of crude oil. Approximately 73.1 kg of crude oil or 59.52% of the total crude oil was pressed out of the non-flaked seed during the pressing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0586" num="0770">Non-flaked press cake (Sample 1a) contained much higher crude oil content than that of flaked press cake (Sample 1b). Higher ratio of press oil was obtained from the flaked seed than from the non-flaked seed in the pressing operation. After solvent extraction, defatted canola meal (Sample 1c) from non-flaked press cake still contained a high oil content of 8.75%-12.73% (dwb) while defatted meal (Sample 1d) from flaked press cake contained less than 3.13% of crude oil (Tables 14 &#x26; 16). Visual inspection of the non-flaked press cake showed that it contained many intact seeds, making it difficult for oil extraction by the solvent mixture of butane and R134a. Flaking would be required to rupture the oil cells before pressing to obtain high ratio of press oil in the pressing operation and lower oil content in the solvent extracted meal. Defatted meal (Sample 1d) from flaked press cake was used as the starting material for the preparation of a protein concentrate. Defatted meal from non-flaked press cake was not used for the preparation of protein concentrate due to its high oil content.</p>

Antinutritional factors such as glucosinolates and sinapines were reduced dramatically by 80% ethanol washings of protein enriched meals. Protein concentrates contained 6.37-7.16% crude fiber on a dry weight basis, which was still higher than the crude fiber content of around 3.8-4.5% for soy protein concentrate. A wet separation method was utilized to reduce the crude fiber content to 3.20-4.88% (dwb) in the canola protein concentrates (Samples 1g, 2d and 3d) using a decanter centrifuge to separate the fiber from insoluble and soluble proteins based on the difference in density.</p>

Co., Springfield, Ohio, U.S.A.) at 0.02&#x2033; gap, 2340 rpm rotational speed and 100 kg/h throughput. Only one pass through the disc mill was conducted. A schematic flowchart for milling and screening of the defatted meal is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Approximately 193 kg of milled defatted canola meal was produced. Approximately 8.4 kg of material was lost in the milling operation with a recovery yield of 95.83%.</p>
<p id="p-0604" num="0788">The milled defatted canola meal was screened through a 45 US mesh screen using the Rotex Vibratory Screen at a feed rate of 100 kg/hr. Only one pass through the screen was conducted. Approximately 76.85 kg of protein enriched meal (fine fraction) and 114.8 kg of fiber-enriched meal (coarse fraction) were produced, respectively. Approximately 1.35 kg of material was lost in the screening operation with a recovery yield of 99.30%. After screening, 40.1% of the total material was protein enriched meal and 59.9% was fiber enriched meal, respectively.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">(v) Wet Separation to Remove Fiber</p>
<p id="p-0605" num="0789">Approximately 71.9 kg of protein enriched meal was mixed with 575 kg of tap water at a ratio of about 1 to 8 (by weight) under homogeneous agitation to form a protein slurry. The protein slurry was adjusted to pH 8.9 by slow addition of 7.6 kg of 11.06% NaOH solution under homogeneous agitation. This was followed by centrifugation at room temperature using a Bird Decanter Centrifuge (Bird 6&#x2033; Continuous Bowl Centrifuge, Bird Machine Company of Canada, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan). The protein slurry was pumped through the Bird Decanter at ambient temperature and a feed rate of 150 kg/h and it was operated at a bowl speed of 1,500 rpm with a low pool depth to separate the coarse fiber solids from the soluble and insoluble protein fractions. Approximately 161.9 kg of wet fiber solids containing 15.42% solids and 511.5 kg of protein slurry containing soluble and insoluble proteins at 8.26% solids were produced, respectively. 161.9 kg of wet fiber solids was mixed with 161.9 kg of water in a tank for 0.5 hour as a second extraction, which was followed by centrifugation at room temperature using the Bird Decanter at a bowl speed of 1,500 rpm and a feed rate of 160 kg/hr. Approximately 74.2 kg of washed wet fiber and 299 kg of protein slurry containing soluble and insoluble proteins were produced. Protein slurries containing soluble and insoluble proteins from these two centrifugations were combined and approximately 810.5 kg of the combined protein slurry was obtained. A schematic flowchart illustrating the wet separation of fiber is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0037" num="0000">Discussion</p>
<p id="p-0606" num="0790">The Bird Decanter can operated at a bowl speed of 1,000-5,000 rpm (100-2130 g) and a pool depth of 5 to 19 mm. A spin down of the protein slurry sample in a centrifuge tube using a bench top centrifuge showed three layers, liquid extract as the top layer, insoluble protein cake of fine protein particles as the middle layer and the coarse fiber solids as the bottom layer. The objective was to separate the top and middle layers (the soluble protein extract and the insoluble fine protein solids) from the bottom layer (coarse fiber solids). The bird decanter was operated at a low pool depth and a bowl speed of 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500 and 3,000 rpm and the separation efficiency was evaluated by spin down tests of the feed, the fiber fraction and the protein slurry using the bench top centrifuge. Separation of the coarse fiber solids from the insoluble fine protein solids and the soluble protein extract was obtained at a bowl speed of about 1,000 rpm to about 2,000 rpm, optionally about 1,500 rpm (&#x2dc;760 g) and a low pool depth.</p>

<p id="p-0607" num="0791">Approximately 8.7 kg of protein slurry containing soluble and insoluble proteins after the fiber removal using the Bird Decanter was mixed with 8.6 kg of SDAG-13 denatured ethanol (containing 99% ethanol and 1% ethyl acetate) for 0.5 hours at room temperature. This was followed by centrifugation for 10 minutes using a lab centrifuge at 4,200 rpm to obtain 14.8 kg of a first sugar extract containing 1.42% solids and 2.5 kg of a first wet protein solid fraction. The wet protein solid fraction (2.5 kg) was further mixed with 4.3 kg of SDAG-13 denatured ethanol for 1 hour at room temperature. This was again followed by centrifugation for 10 minutes using the lab centrifuge at 4,200 rpm to obtain 4.7 kg of a second sugar extract and 2.1 kg of a second wet protein solid fraction. Finally, the wet protein solid fraction (2.1 kg) was mixed with 4.3 kg of SDAG 13 denatured ethanol for 1 hour at room temperature, which was followed by centrifugation for 10 minutes using the lab centrifuge at 4,200 rpm to obtain 4.3 kg of a third sugar extract and 2.1 kg of a third wet protein solid fraction. The wet protein solids were dried in a lab forced air oven at 50&#xb0; C. until the moisture content was about 6%. The dried protein solids were milled using a lab pin mill to obtain the final protein concentrate containing 70.6% protein on a dry weight basis.

<p id="p-0608" num="0792">Approximately 770 kg of a protein slurry containing soluble and insoluble proteins prepared in the same manner as in Example 5a(i)-(v) (including fiber removal using the Bird Decanter), was centrifuged using a Westfalia&#xae; Decanter (Model CA 225-010, Centrico Inc., Northvale, N.J., USA) at ambient temperature and a bowl speed of 5,200 rpm (3,300 g) to separate the soluble protein extract from insoluble protein solids. Approximately 650 kg of a first protein extract containing soluble proteins and 120 kg of a first protein solid fraction were produced. The first protein solid fraction was mixed with 360 kg of water at room temperature for 0.5 hour under homogeneous agitation, which was followed by centrifugation using the Westfalia&#xae; Decanter to obtain 368.5 kg of a second protein extract containing soluble proteins and 91.3 kg of a second protein solids fraction.</p>
<p id="p-0609" num="0793">The first and second protein extracts were combined together and the combined extract was centrifuged using a Westfalia&#xae; Disc Stack Centrifuge (Model SA14-02-073, Centrico., Northvale, N.J., USA) at ambient temperature and a bowl speed of 8,500 rpm (6,549 g) to remove trace insoluble solids in the soluble protein extract. Approximately 978.5 kg of clarified protein extract and 21.9 kg of a third protein solids fraction were produced.</p>
<p id="p-0610" num="0794">The clarified protein extract was adjusted to pH 7.0 by addition of 1.8 kg of 11% NaOH solution, which was followed by concentration of the protein extract in the feed tank from 978.5 kg to 140 kg at ambient using a Millipore&#xae; Ultrafiltration Unit from Millipore&#xae;, Mass., USA. The Ultrafiltration Unit (UF) was fitted with three hollow fiber cartridges with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000 daltons, with each cartridge containing 5 m<sup>2 </sup>of membrane surface area. The protein extract was pumped through the hollow fiber cartridges at a rate of 800-1000 kg/hr. The retentate was recycled back to the feed tank and the permeate was collected in another tank. The UF unit was operated at an inlet pressure of 25 psi maximum and a retentate back pressure of 15 psi maximum. The flux rate or permeate rate was about 120 kg/hr initially and gradually decreased to about 70 kg/hr and stabilized at that level for a period of time before decreasing further. Back flushing was conducted to increase the flux rate periodically. The ultrafiltration process continued until the amount of protein solution in the feed tank was equal to about 15% of its initial weight.</p>
<p id="p-0611" num="0795">Approximately 60 kg of water was added into the feed tank and diafiltration was conducted at ambient temperature using the same UF unit fitted with the same three hollow fiber cartridges. The original volume of protein solution in the feed tank was held constant by adding water to make up for the removed permeate. The retentate was recycled back to the feed tank. The amount of water added to maintain the original volume of protein solution was about 2.8 times the original volume of protein solution or 560 kg.</p>
<p id="p-0612" num="0796">Approximately 311 kg of purified protein extract was obtained from the ultrafiltration and diafiltration process. The purified protein extract was heated to 40&#xb1;10&#xb0; C. using a heat exchanger prior to being fed to a Komline Sanderson&#xae; spray dryer (Komline Sanderson&#xae; Ltd., Brampton, Ontario, Canada) by pumping at a feed rate of 150-165 kg per hour. The spray drying operation was conducted at an inlet air temperature of 185&#xb1;5&#xb0; C. and an outlet air temperature of 85&#xb1;5&#xb0; C. Approximately 7.85 kg of spray dried protein isolate was produced. A schematic flowchart illustrating the preparation of a canola protein isolate is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>

<heading id="h-0042" level="1">Preparation of Hydrolyzed Protein Concentrates</heading>
<p id="p-0614" num="0798">Approximately 91.3 kg of the second protein solid fraction and 21.9 kg of the third protein solid fraction (obtained from Example 5(b)) were added to 260 kg of water in a tank, resulting in a slurry of about 5% solids in a 2000 L scraped surface tank. This was followed by pH adjustment to 8.3&#xb1;0.1 using 8% NaOH solution. Approximately 200 g of a first protease (Alcalase&#xae; 2.4 L FG) was added to the slurry. The slurry was then heated to 60&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. and held at temperature for 4 hours. The slurry was cooled down to 50&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. and 200 g of a second protease (Flavourzyme&#xae;) was added to the slurry, which was followed by holding at 50&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. for 4 hours. The slurry was centrifuged using the Westfalia&#xae; Decanter at 3300&#xd7;g to separate the hydrolyzed protein extract from the insoluble fiber fraction. The insoluble fiber was washed further with 100 kg of filtered tap water, which was again followed by centrifugation at 3300&#xd7;g to separate the washed protein extract from the washed fiber solids using the Westfalia&#xae; Decanter. A sample of the washed protein extract was taken to analyze the protein content.</p>
<p id="p-0615" num="0799">Hydrolyzed protein concentrates were also produced from the combined protein slurry after fiber removal using the Bird Decanter (Example 5a(i)-(v)). Approximately 7.48 kg of protein slurry containing soluble and insoluble proteins was adjusted from pH 8.3 to pH 7.0 by addition of 25% phosphoric acid. After pH adjustment, the protein slurry was centrifuged at 4,000 RPM to separate the soluble protein extract from the insoluble solids. Approximately 1.15 kg of insoluble solids was mixed with 3.4 kg of water, which was followed by centrifugation at 4,000 RPM to separate the first washing extract from the first washed solids fraction. Approximately 1.07 kg of the first washed solids was mixed with 3.4 kg of water. This was followed by centrifugation at ambient temperature at 4,000 RPM to separate the second washing extract from the second washed solids fraction.</p>
<p id="p-0616" num="0800">Approximately 1.07 kg of the second washed solids fraction was mixed with 2.2 kg of water to obtain a slurry, which was followed by pH adjustment to 8.2 with the addition of 1 M NaOH solution. Approximately 1.16 g of a first proteinase (Alcalase&#xae; 2.4 L FG) was added to the slurry. The slurry was heated to about 62&#xb0; C. and held at this temperature for 4 hours. The slurry was cooled down to about 50&#xb0; C. and approximately 1.16 g of a second proteinase (Flavourzyme&#xae;) was added to the slurry, which was followed by holding at 50&#xb0; C. for 4 hours. Finally, the slurry was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the hydrolyzed protein extract from the insoluble fiber fraction. The hydrolyzed protein extract was spray dried into hydrolyzed protein concentrate using a lab spray dryer. A schematic flowchart illustrating the preparation of hydrolyzed protein extract is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0617" num="0801">Using gel permeation chromatography, the hydrolyzed protein had a molecular weight profile wherein 63.3% of the hydrolyzed protein has an approximate molecular weight of 9,500 daltons while 16.4% hydrolyzed protein has approximate molecular weight of 7,000 daltons. The remaining 20.3% of the hydrolyzed protein has an approximate molecular weight of less than 5,000 daltons.</p>
<p id="h-0043" num="0000">Discussion</p>
<p id="p-0618" num="0802">The results of the proximate analysis for canola seed, press cake, defatted meal, protein enriched meal, fiber enriched meal, protein concentrate, hydrolyzed protein concentrate and protein isolate are shown in Table 26.</p>
<p id="p-0619" num="0803">As shown in Table 26, dry separation by milling using a disc mill and screening using a vibratory screen of 45 US mesh increased the protein content from 47% in the extracted meal to 52% in the protein enriched meal on a dry weight basis. The fiber content was reduced from 7.75% in the extracted meal to 5.53% in the protein enriched meal by dry separation. Wet separation to remove fiber using the Bird Decanter and to remove sugar compounds by the ethanol extraction process further increased the protein content from 52% in the protein enriched meal to 70.6% in the protein concentrate. The fiber content was reduced from 5.53% in the protein enriched meal to 4.88% in the protein concentrate by wet separation using the bird decanter.</p>
<p id="p-0620" num="0804">As shown in Table 27, wet separation to remove fiber by the Bird Decanter decreased the crude fiber content from 5.53% in the protein enriched meal (see Table 26) to 3.20% in the protein slurry (see Table 27) after the first fiber removal. The fiber fraction after the first fiber separation contained about 10.2% crude fiber. The fiber fraction was washed with water at a ratio of 1 to 1 by weight, which was followed by centrifugation using the Bird Decanter to separate the washed fiber fraction from the washing protein slurry. The washed fiber fraction contained 12.7% crude fiber. The fiber washing step was able to increase the crude fiber content in the fiber fraction from 10.2% to 12.7% on a dry weight basis. More importantly, the washing step significantly reduced the weight of fiber fraction from 161.9 kg to 74.2 kg or about 54% and thus increased the protein recovery yield in the final protein concentrate. The washed fiber fraction contained 11.34 kg of total dry solids (74.2 kg&#xd7;15.33% solids=11.34 kg) or 16.91% of starting protein enriched meal on a dry weight basis.</p>
<p id="p-0621" num="0805">After dry separation by screening, the protein enriched meal produced by this process still contained a high crude fiber content of 5.53% on a dry weight basis (see Table 26). A wet separation process was employed to separate and remove fiber from the soluble protein extract and the insoluble protein particles taking advantage of the difference in density and particle size between the fiber and insoluble protein particles.</p>
<p id="p-0622" num="0806">Several spin down tests were performed on a protein slurry sample of 10.4% solids in a centrifuge tube in the laboratory using a lab centrifuge, three layers of top liquid layer, the middle protein particle layer and the bottom fiber layer were obtained in the tube. The fiber particles settled faster than the smaller insoluble protein particles. The settling rate was dependent on the g force&#x2014;the higher the g force, the higher the settling rate. If the decanter centrifuge is run at a full bowl speed of 5,000 rpm or 3000 g force, both fiber and insoluble protein particles settle and would be separated from the liquid extract and be removed by the decanter as the combined insoluble solids. If the decanter is run at a lower bowl speed of 1,500 rpm or a lower g force of 750 g, the large fiber particles settle, but the fine protein particles have not yet had sufficient time to settle, therefore the fiber particles can be separated from the insoluble protein particles and the protein extract. The separation of fiber from protein particles is mainly caused by the difference in density between the insoluble fiber and protein particles. A schematic flowchart for the fiber removal process is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0623" num="0807">The protein enriched meal was mixed with water at a ratio of 1 to 8 by weight and pH was adjusted to 8.9. After 1 hour of hold time under agitation at room temperature, the protein slurry was centrifuged at a low bowl speed of 1,500 RPM (&#x2dc;750 g force) using the Bird Decanter. Larger fiber particles with higher density were separated from smaller insoluble protein particles with lower density as well as soluble protein solution. The fiber fraction was washed with water at a ratio of 1 to 1, which was followed by centrifugation at 1,500 RPM using the Bird Decanter to separate the large fiber particles with higher density from the insoluble smaller protein particles with lower density as well as protein extract. In an embodiment, the efficiency of a wet fiber separation is affected by viscosity and density of the liquid medium. The soluble protein extract would be cycled and re-used to increase the soluble solid content in order increase the density and viscosity of the liquid medium. This also helps to reduce the volume of water usage.</p>
<p id="p-0624" num="0808">The results of the amino acid profiles for the canola protein concentrates and isolate on a dry weight basis are shown in Table 28. In addition, a comparison of amino acid profiles for the canola protein concentrate, canola protein isolate and commercially available soy and pea protein isolates is shown in Tables 29 and 30.</p>
<p id="p-0625" num="0809">From the amino acid profiles as shown in Tables 28, 29 and 30, canola protein compares favorably to that of soy protein or pea protein. Canola protein is of high nutritional quality and capable of providing adequate amounts of all essential amino acids. Canola protein contains much higher sulphur containing amino acids such as methionine and cystine than soy and pea proteins. Canola protein contains 48-72% higher methionine than soy protein and 70-97% higher methionine than pea protein. Usually, cereals tend to be low in lysine but adequate in the sulphur containing amino acid methionine. Legumes are adequate in lysine but low in methionine. Canola protein is unique in that it contains both adequate lysine and sulphur containing amino acid methionine. Therefore, it exhibits a better amino acid balance than cereal proteins and legume proteins (such as pea protein and soy protein). Canola protein has excellent nutritional quality and can be used in applications such as baby formula and foods required for good nutrition.</p>
<p id="p-0626" num="0810">From the essential amino acid profiles as shown in Table 30, canola protein is very rich in the muscle building essential amino acids such as valine, methionine, leucine and isoleucine. It also contains a much higher content of the essential amino acid threonine, which is important for brain activity. Canola protein concentrate and isolate may be suitable ingredients for sports nutritional supplements.</p>
<p id="p-0627" num="0811">With respect to the molecular weight and characterization of the canola protein concentrate, the concentrate obtained in Example 5(a) contained three major subunits as listed below:</p>
<p id="p-0628" num="0812">(a) 10,000-12,000 dalton molecular weight</p>
<p id="p-0629" num="0813">(b) 15,000-20,000 dalton molecular weight</p>
<p id="p-0630" num="0814">(c) 25,000-37,000 dalton molecular weight</p>
<p id="p-0631" num="0815">The results obtained using a technique of Gel Permeation Chromatography show that canola protein isolate contains 64.7% of the proteins at molecular weight of 70 kDa, 26.2% at 12 kDa and 9.1% at &#x3c;10 kDa.</p>
<p id="p-0632" num="0816">With respect to the functional properties of the canola protein isolate, the emulsifying and foaming properties of the canola protein isolate (obtained in Example 5(b)) as compared to soy and pea protein isolates are shown in Table 31. As seen in Table 31, the canola protein isolate of the present disclosure has much better foaming capacity than soy and pea protein isolates at pH 7.0 and a protein concentration of 0.5%. At pH 7 and concentration of 1.0%, canola protein isolate has slightly lower foaming capacity than soy protein isolate, but much higher foaming capacity than pea protein isolate. The canola protein isolate has a much better foam stability than soy and pea protein isolates. Further, the canola protein isolate has similar emulsifying properties as compared to soy and pea protein isolates at pH 7 and concentrations of 0.5% and 1.0%, and also has similar emulsion stability at pH 7 and concentrations of 0.5% and 1.0%.</p>
<p id="p-0633" num="0817">The foaming capacity of a protein is characterized by whipping the dissolved protein at 0.5% protein content with a milk foamer (Aeroflott&#x2122;) at 20&#xb0; C. for 1 minute. Foam height was determined in a 100 ml scaled cylinder for 1 hour. Additionally, the protein solution at 0.5% protein was heated at 60&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes and then cooled to 20&#xb0; C. before foam test</p>
<p id="p-0634" num="0818">The emulsifying capacity of a protein is defined as the maximum amount of oil which can be emulsified with a defined amount of protein forming a stable emulsion. The higher the emulsifying capacity, the higher the effectiveness of the protein substance. The emulsifying capacity is measured by using the following emulsifying conditions:</p>
<p id="p-0635" num="0819">(1) measuring temperature at 20&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0636" num="0820">(2) protein concentration at 0.5%</p>
<p id="p-0637" num="0821">(3) stepwise addition of coloured plant oil (starting point at 50%)</p>
<p id="p-0638" num="0822">(4) Emulsification using Ultra-Turrax (13,000 min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>; 60 s)</p>
<p id="p-0639" num="0823">(5) Evaluation of oil separation 30 minutes after emulsification.</p>
<p id="p-0640" num="0824">As shown in Table 32, the emulsifying results of a 0.5% canola protein isolate solution were very good as compared to a 5% egg yolk solution. Further, as described in Table 32, the canola protein isolate possesses the functional property of gel formation and water immobilization, and therefore, would act as a stabilizer. The results of gel firmness for canola protein isolate are good and comparable to other vegetable proteins. The results of water immobilization of canola protein isolate gels are good as compared to that of whey protein isolate gels, which is an important parameter for stability and shelf-life of a final product containing canola protein isolate.</p>
<p id="p-0641" num="0825">Because of its emulsifying and foaming properties, in an embodiment, the canola protein isolate is a suitable protein and functional ingredient in food applications that require good emulsifying and foaming capacity and stability such as in cakes, coffee toppings, and specialty coffee drinks, cr&#xe8;mes, dressings and pastes. In another embodiment, the canola protein isolate is used for laundry and cosmetic products that require good foaming capacity and stability such as in laundry detergents, bath soaps, conditioning shampoos, and cream hand and skin cleansers. In a further embodiment, the canola protein isolate is used for soups, salad dressings, sausages, bologna and other comminuted and emulsified meat products that require good emulsifying capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0642" num="0826">As seen in Table 33, the solubility of the canola protein isolate, in addition to the solubility for pea and soy protein isolates is shown. The results show that 99.81% of the crude protein canola isolate crude is soluble. The test results demonstrate that the canola protein isolate of the present disclosure has 99.81% soluble crude protein as compared to 25.21% and 18.85% soluble crude protein for soy and pea protein isolates, respectively. Accordingly, in an embodiment, the canola protein isolate is a suitable protein ingredient for nutritional beverages such as protein fortified soft drinks, fruit juices, sports drinks and high protein drinks. In another embodiment, it is also useful for healthy food applications to improve absorption and digestibility.</p>
<p id="p-0643" num="0827">As shown in Table 34, the concentrations of antinutritional factors in the canola protein isolate obtained in Example 5(b) are illustrated. Accordingly, the canola protein isolate contains very low levels of total glucosinolates, phytic acid and allyl isothiocyanate.</p>
<p id="p-0644" num="0828">The results of glucosinolates in the canola seed, the canola press cake, the defatted meal, the protein and fiber enriched meals, the protein concentrates and isolate are shown in Table 35. The content of total aliphatic glucosinolates in seed, press cake, extracted meal, protein and fiber enriched meals is high and at similar level on an oil free basis. Dry separation by screening to separate the extracted meal into the protein and fiber enriched meals did not alter the concentration of total aliphatic glucosinolates significantly. Wet separation processing reduced the total aliphatic glucosinolates dramatically from 17.31 &#x3bc;moles/g in the protein enriched meal to 0.11 &#x3bc;mole/g in canola protein concentrate, 0.23 &#x3bc;mole/g in hydrolyzed protein concentrate and 0.17-0.41 &#x3bc;mole/g in protein isolate.</p>
<p id="p-0645" num="0829">Accordingly, based on the above described properties of the canola protein concentrates and isolates, the concentrates and isolates have:

<p id="p-0651" num="0841">Approximately 698.9 kg of protein slurry containing soluble and insoluble proteins after the fiber removal in the using the Bird Decanter was mixed with 650 liters of SDAG 13 denatured ethanol (containing 99% ethanol and 1% ethyl acetate) for 1 hour at room temperature. This was followed by centrifugation using a Wesffalia&#xae; Decanter to obtain 889.1 kg of a first sugar extract containing 1.89% solids and 307.9 kg of a wet protein solids fraction containing 14.07% solids. The wet protein solids fraction (307.9 kg) was mixed with 332 kg of SDAG 13 denatured ethanol for 1 hour at room temperature.

<p id="h-0049" num="0000">(iv) Preparation of Hydrolyzed Protein Concentrate</p>
<p id="p-0652" num="0842">Approximately 126.3 kg of insoluble fiber solids were mixed with 100 kg of water in a tank. This was followed by pH adjustment to 8.3&#xb1;0.1 using 0.9 kg of 11.06% NaOH solution. Approximately 0.5 kg of a first protease (Alcalase&#xae; 2.4 L FG) was added to the slurry. The slurry was then heated to 60&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. and held at this temperature for 4 hours. The slurry was cooled down to 50&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. and pH adjusted to 6.5. Approximately 0.5 kg of a second protease (Flavouzyme) was added to the slurry, which was followed by holding at 50&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. for 4 hours. The slurry was centrifuged using the Westfalia&#xae; Decanter at 3300&#xd7;g to separate the hydrolyzed protein extract from the insoluble fiber fraction. The insoluble fiber was washed further with 120 kg of filtered tap water, which was again followed by centrifugation at 3300&#xd7;g to separate the wash protein extract from the washed fiber solids using the Westfalia&#xae; Decanter. The hydrolyzed protein extract and the wash hydrolyzed protein extract were combined. The combined hydrolyzed protein extract was fed to a Millipore&#xae; Ultrafiltration Unit (Model A60, Millipore&#xae; Corporation, Bedford, Mass., USA) at ambient temperature. The Ultrafiltration Unit (UF) was fitted with three hollow fiber cartridges with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000 daltons, with each cartridge containing 5 m<sup>2 </sup>of membrane surface area. The hydrolyzed protein extract was pumped through the hollow fiber cartridges at a rate of 800-1000 kg/hr. The retentate was recycled back to the feed tank and the permeate was collected in another tank. The UF unit was operated at an inlet pressure of 25 psi maximum and a retentate back pressure of 15 psi maximum. The flux rate or permeate rate was about 190-300 kg/hr throughout the ultrafiltration process. The ultrafiltration process continued until about 40 kg of retentate remained in the feed tank. Approximately 260 kg of water was added continuously into the feed tank and ultrafiltration was conducted at ambient temperature using the same UF unit fitted with the same three hollow fiber cartridges. The original volume of retentate in the feed tank was held constant by adding water to make up for the removed permeate. The retentate was recycled back to the feed tank. The ultrafiltration process continued until all 260 kg of water was added to the retentate. A schematic flowchart illustrating the preparation of a hydrolyzed protein concentrate is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0653" num="0843">Approximately 540 kg of permeate and 47.7 kg of retentate were obtained from the ultrafiltration process. The permeate was spray dried to produce hydrolyzed protein concentrate using a Komline Sanderson&#xae; spray dryer (Komline Sanderson&#xae; Ltd., Brampton, Ontario, Canada). The spray drying operation was conducted at an inlet air temperature of 185&#xb1;5&#xb0; C. and an outlet air temperature of 85&#xb1;5&#xb0; C. Approximately 3.36 kg of spray dried hydrolyzed protein concentrate containing 82% protein (dwb) was produced.</p>
<p id="h-0050" num="0000">Discussion</p>
<p id="p-0654" num="0844">The results of the proximate analysis for defatted canola meal, protein enriched meal, fiber enriched meal, protein concentrate and hydrolyzed protein concentrate are shown in Table 36. As shown in Table 36, dry separation by milling using a disc mill and screening using a vibratory screen of 45 US mesh increased the protein content from 48% in the defatted meal to 51.5% in the protein enriched meal. The fiber content was reduced from 7.75% in the extracted meal to 5.48% in the protein enriched meal by dry separation. Wet separation to remove fiber using the Bird Decanter and to remove sugar compounds by the ethanol extraction process further increased the protein content from 51.5% in the protein enriched meal to 68.2% in the protein concentrate.</p>
<p id="p-0655" num="0845">The enhancement in the protein content by ethanol washing is shown in Table 37. The protein content in the ethanol washed protein solids was increased to 61.4%, 66.3% and 67.8% in the ethanol precipitation, first and second ethanol washings. The large increase in the protein content was achieved in the 1<sup>st </sup>ethanol washing of the ethanol precipitated protein solids, from 61.4% protein to 66.3% protein.</p>
<p id="p-0656" num="0846">In order to produce a protein concentrate containing about 70% protein (dwb), it is necessary to separate and remove fiber from the soluble protein extract and the insoluble protein particles taking advantage of the difference in density and particle size between the fiber and insoluble protein particles. The protein enriched meal was mixed with water at a ratio of 1 to 8 by weight and pH was adjusted to 7.0. After 1 hour of holding time under agitation at room temperature, the protein slurry was centrifuged at a low bowl speed of 1,500 RPM (&#x2dc;750 g force) using the Bird Decanter. Larger fiber particles with higher density were separated from smaller insoluble protein particles with lower density as well as soluble protein solution. In an embodiment, the soluble protein extract would be re-cycled and re-used to increase the soluble solid content in order increase the density and viscosity of the liquid medium, which would help to reduce the volume of water usage.</p>
<p id="p-0657" num="0847">Hydrolyzed protein concentrate containing 82% protein (dwb) was obtained. The hydrolyzed protein concentrate was 100% water soluble and its solution was crystal clear since it was purified by a membrane filtration process. A shown in Table 38, the protein recovery yield through protein hydrolysis and membrane purification was about 85.15% before spray drying, which was calculated based on the hydrolyzed proteins including amino acids and peptides in the permeate of the ultrafiltration divided by the total proteins in the starting material of the insoluble fiber solids before the hydrolysis process (6.88 kg of protein weight in the permeate divided by 8.08 kg of protein weight in the insoluble fiber solids gave 85.15% protein recovery yield). The loss of proteins through membrane filtration is about 3.22% (0.26 kg of protein weight in the retentate divided by 8.08 kg of protein weight in the permeate gives 3.22% protein loss in the UF process).</p>
<p id="p-0658" num="0848">The hydrolyzed protein concentrate produced in accordance with the processes of the present disclosure contained 82% protein (dwb). It was determined that the protein dispersibility index of the hydrolyzed protein concentrate was 99.8% and its solution was clear and transparent since it was purified by a membrane filtration process. The absorbance and transmittance of 1%, 3% and 5% hydrolyzed protein solutions using distilled water as the control is shown in Table 39. The absorbance and transmittance of 1% soy and pea protein isolate solutions were also determined for comparison. The absorbance and transmittance of the samples were determined at 720 nm wavelength using a Shimadzu&#xae; UV-Visible Spectrophotometer (UV-VIS 265, Mandel Scientific&#xae; Company Ltd., Guelph, Ontario, Canada).</p>

The protein concentrate contained 73.3% protein on a dry weight basis.</p>
<p id="h-0068" num="0000">Discussion</p>
<p id="p-0696" num="0888">As shown in Table 47, canola protein concentrate containing 73.3% protein (dwb) and 3.78% crude fiber (dwb) was produced from defatted canola meal (<i>B. juncea</i>) the wet fiber separation method based on the density and particle size difference between the insoluble fiber particles and the insoluble protein particles. In an embodiment, dry screening to prepare a protein enriched meal from defatted meal is not required, which increases the protein recovery yield in the protein concentrate.</p>
<p id="p-0697" num="0889">As shown in Table 48, after the wet fiber separation by centrifugation, the protein slurry containing soluble and insoluble proteins is recycled to mix with the defatted meal before the fiber separation. The solid content of the protein slurry containing soluble and insoluble proteins was increased from 6.31% solids to 12.46% solids after 4 recycling trials. Higher solid content in the canola slurry did not affect the fiber separation by the wet fiber separation process. The protein content of the protein slurry containing insoluble and soluble proteins was increased while the crude fiber content remained at similar level with the increased in the solid content (Table 48). Interestingly, canola protein slurry #6A contained 57.6% protein (dwb) and 1.60% crude fiber (dwb) after the fiber separation and before ethanol precipitation. Canola protein concentrate containing 73.3% protein (dwb) and 3.78% crude fiber was produced. In an embodiment, the fiber separation by the decanter centrifuge based on the density difference results in a low crude fiber content in the protein slurry containing soluble and insoluble proteins after fiber separation and removal.</p>
<p id="p-0698" num="0890">As shown in Table 49, the 1<sup>st </sup>ethanol precipitation increased the protein content to 69.3% (dwb), the 1<sup>st </sup>ethanol washing increased the protein content to 70.6% (dwb) and the 2<sup>nd </sup>ethanol washing increased the protein content to 73.3% (dwb). In an embodiment, a one step ethanol precipitation is sufficient to produce a protein concentrate containing 70% protein (dwb) and a low fiber content comparable to soy protein concentrate. In another embodiment, a membrane filtration process is conducted on the protein slurry containing soluble and insoluble proteins at high solid content after fiber separation to concentrate and purify proteins before spray drying to produce protein concentrate containing 70% protein (dwb). In an embodiment, an ultrafiltration is utilized since the protein slurry at high solid content already has reasonable purity in terms of protein content.</p>
<p id="p-0699" num="0891">In an embodiment, the increase in the solid content of the protein slurry containing soluble and insoluble proteins serves the purpose of reducing the processing volume and the amount of ethanol usage. This would reduce the size of the equipment, energy consumption, processing cost and capital investment.</p>

The proteins precipitated in ethanol. The majority of precipitated proteins was recovered by centrifugation using a Westfalia&#xae; Decanter (Model CA-365) at 3,200 g (4,000 RPM). The remaining precipitated proteins in the supernatant were recovered using a Westfalia&#xae; Disc Stack Centrifuge (Model SA-14, Germany) at 6,715 g (7,560 rpm). The recovered protein solids were mixed with 85% ethanol (v/v) at ambient temperature for 1 hour. The amount of 85% ethanol (v/v) was equivalent to 6 times of the starting weight of defatted canola meal. The washed protein solids were recovered by centrifugation using the Wesffalia&#xae; Decanter (Model CA-365) at 3,200 g (4,000 RPM) and ambient temperature. The washed protein solids were again mixed with 85% ethanol (v/v) equivalent to 6 times of starting weight of defatted canola meal. The second washed protein solids were also recovered by centrifugation using the Westfalia&#xae; Decanter (Model CA-365) at 3,200 g (4,000 RPM) and ambient temperature. Finally, the second washed protein solids were dried to 3.11-6.66% moisture using a Barr-Rosin Closed Circuit Ring Dryer. Approximately 760 kg of protein concentrate at 69.2-72.7% protein (dwb) was produced from 3,325 kg of defatted canola meal (as seen in Table 51). The produced protein concentrate was a free flow powder with cream white color. It contained a very low glucosinolate content of 0.2 &#x3bc;mole/g, a sinapine content of 0.019% and a phytate content of &#x3c;0.05%.</p>
<p id="p-0719" num="0911">The recovered yield of canola protein concentrate can be increased significantly by washing of the fiber solids once or twice in order to recover more soluble and insoluble proteins. Ethanol was reclaimed and recycled from the liquid streams through evaporation and distillation using a single stage falling film evaporator and a bubble sieve tray distillation system.</p>
<p id="p-0720" num="0912">As shown in Table 50, the wet fiber separation process by centrifugation at 274-350 g using the Andritz&#xae; Decanter (as seen in Table 50) reduced the crude fiber content to 2.60-3.28% in the protein slurries from 6.98% in the defatted canola meal on a dry weight basis. The crude fiber content in the fiber solids was increased to 12.14-14.03% (dwb). Ethanol precipitation process increased the protein content from 52.1-54.2% (dwb) in the protein slurries to 63.8-67.4% (dwb) in the precipitated proteins. Wash of the precipitated proteins with 85% ethanol (v/v) twice further increased the protein content to 69.2-72.7% protein (dwb) in the final protein concentrates.</p>

<p id="p-0736" num="0928">Approximately 126.3 kg of insoluble fiber solids were mixed with 100 kg of water in a tank. This was followed by pH adjustment to 8.3&#xb1;0.1 using 0.9 kg of 11.06% NaOH solution. Approximately 0.5 kg of a 1<sup>st </sup>protease (Alcalase&#xae; 2.4 L FG) was added to the slurry. The slurry was then heated to 60&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. and held at this temperature for 4 hours. The slurry was cooled down to 50&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. and pH adjusted to 6.5. Approximately 0.5 kg of the 2<sup>nd </sup>protease (Flavouzyme&#xae;) was added to the slurry, which was followed by holding at 50&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. for 4 hours. The slurry was centrifuged using a Westfalia&#xae; Decanter at 3300&#xd7;g to separate the hydrolyzed protein extract from the insoluble fiber fraction. The insoluble fiber was washed further with 120 kg of filtered tap water, which was again followed by centrifugation at 3300&#xd7;g to separate the wash protein extract from the washed fiber solids using the Westfalia&#xae; Decanter. The hydrolyzed protein extract and the wash hydrolyzed protein extract were combined. The combined hydrolyzed protein extract was fed to a Millipore&#xae; Ultrafiltration Unit (Model A60, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, Mass., USA) at ambient temperature. The Ultrafiltration Unit (UF) was fitted with three hollow fiber cartridges having a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000 daltons. Each cartridge contained 5 m<sup>2 </sup>of membrane surface area. The hydrolyzed protein extract was pumped through the hollow fiber cartridges at a rate of 800-1000 kg/hr. The retentate was recycled back to the feed tank and the permeate was collected in another tank. The UF unit was operated at an inlet pressure of 25 psi maximum and a retentate back pressure of 15 psi maximum. The flux rate or permeate rate was about 190-300 kg/hr throughout the ultrafiltration process. The ultrafiltration process continued until about 40 kg of retentate remained in the feed tank. Approximately 260 kg of water was added continuously into the feed tank and ultrafiltration was conducted at ambient temperature using the same UF unit fitted with the same three hollow fiber cartridges. The original volume of retentate in the feed tank was held constant by adding water to make up for the removed permeate. The retentate was recycled back to the feed tank. The ultrafiltration process continued until all 260 kg of water was added to the retentate.</p>
<p id="p-0737" num="0929">Approximately 540 kg of permeate and 47.7 kg of retentate were obtained from the ultrafiltration process.

<p id="p-0738" num="0930">Aliquots of each of a protein isolate, protein concentrate and a protein hydrolyzate were dissolved in 3% NaCl at a weight concentration of 10 mg of powder per mL. After sitting overnight, a small portion of each was diluted 10-fold to make a solution for sedimentation velocity analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0739" num="0931">Samples of the protein isolate, protein concentrate and protein hydrolyzate were loaded into cells with 2-channel charcoal-epon centerpieces with 12 mm optical pathlength. The 3% NaCl dilution buffer was loaded into the reference channel of each cell. The loaded cells were then placed into an AN-60Ti analytical rotor, loaded into a Becker-Coulter ProteomeLab&#xae; XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with both absorbance and Rayleigh interference (refractive index) optical detection, and brought to 20&#xb0; C. The rotor was then brought to 3,000 rpm and the samples were scanned (using both absorbance scans and refractive index scans) to confirm proper cell loading. The rotor was then brought to the final run speed of 55,000 rpm. Scans were recorded at this rotor speed approximately every 3.2 min for about 6.2 hours (114 total scans for each optical system for each sample), and then the scan rate was dropped to every 20 minutes for an additional 15 hours (30 additional scans). Only the refractive index scans were analyzed.</p>
<p id="h-0094" num="0000">Discussion</p>
<p id="p-0740" num="0932">The refractive index scans were analyzed using the c(s) method and analysis program SEDFIT (version 11.3) (see Schuck, P. (2000), Size-distribution analysis of macromolecules by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and Lamm equation modeling, <i>Biophys. J., </i>78, 1606-1619, herein incorporated by reference). In this approach, many raw data scans are directly fitted (about 195,000 data points for each sample), to derive the distribution of sedimentation coefficients, while modeling the influence of diffusion on the data in order to enhance the resolution. The method works by assigning a diffusion coefficient to each value of sedimentation coefficient based on an assumption that all species have the same overall hydrodynamic shape (with shape defined by the frictional coefficient ratio relative to that for a sphere, f/f<sub>0</sub>). The f/f<sub>0 </sub>values were varied to find the best overall fir of the data for each sample. A maximum entropy regularization probability of 0.683 (1 &#x3c3;) was used, and both time-dependent and radially-independent noise were removed. To convert the raw sedimentation coefficients to approximate standardized values all proteins in the samples were assumed to have a partial specific volume of 0.73 mL/g. A density of 1.01919 g/mL and viscosity of 1.0503 cp at 20&#xb0; C. were calculated for 3% NaCl using the program SEDNTERP (see Laue, T. M., Shah, B. D., Ridgeway, T. M., and Pelletier, S. L.

<p id="p-0741" num="0933">The high-resolution sedimentation coefficient distributions for the canola protein isolate and canola protein concentrate samples are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 44</figref>, respectively. The graphs show a vertical axis giving the concentration and the horizontal axis showing the separation on the basis of sedimentation coefficient. Each distribution has been normalized to account for any concentration differences among the samples, by setting the total area under the curve to 1.0 (100%) so the area for each peak gives the fraction of that species. The sedimentation coefficients have been approximately converted to standard conditions (adjusted for the fact that the density and viscosity of 3% NaCl are greater than those for pure water). This conversion is approximate because the information needed to make a precise buoyancy correction for each individual component is not known, and therefore a typical value is used for all components (the as-measured raw sedimentation coefficients were multiplied by 1.1108 to convert to s<sub>20,w </sub>values).</p>

The main component (largest fraction weight) is a species at 12.3S which is 56.7% of the total, which corresponds to a 12S protein. The two next most abundant species are at 1.7S (16.7%) (corresponding to &#x201c;2S&#x201d; protein) and 0.75S (9.6%) (which could also correspond to &#x201c;2S&#x201d; protein). Five additional minor peaks or shoulders occur between those species and the main 12.3S peak, and three other peaks sedimenting faster than the main peak. There is also a peak at 22.2S, it is possible that some or all of this 2.8% is actually sedimenting faster than 22.2S. It is also possible that the isolate sample contained some very large aggregates or incompletely-dissolved components that pelleted during the rotor acceleration to 55,000 rpm and therefore were not detected.</p>
<p id="p-0746" num="0938">The results for the canola protein concentrate sample are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, possessing a total of 71.2% protein on a dry weight basis. The protein concentration (total signal) of this sample is more than 2-fold lower than that of the protein isolate, presumably due to loss of insoluble material. In this case the principal component is the peak at 1.7S (corresponding to a &#x201c;2S&#x201d; protein), which is 51.9% of the total, with the 12S protein still a major component (36.5%). This sample contains little of a 7S component. It is important to note that equivalent peaks will not necessarily appear at exactly the same sedimentation coefficient. With this method it is normal for the positions of minor peaks to shift somewhat from one sample to another&#x2014;the sedimentation coefficients for species at levels of a few percent or less cannot be determined with high precision (there is noise on the x-axis).</p>
<p id="p-0747" num="0939">The results for the hydrolyzed canola protein sample are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, possessing a total of 82% protein on a dry weight basis. The normalization to give percentages of the total was handled differently for this sample, as it was not possible to measure the total signal for this sample because some of the peptide fragments are so small that even after over 21 hr at 55,000 rpm they have not sedimented sufficiently to deplete the concentration to zero at the inner regions of the cell. Therefore the total signal was estimated based on the weight concentration (1 mg of powder per mL), a peptide content for the powder of 82% by weight, and the nominal detector sensitivity of 3.3&#xb1;0.1 fringes per (mg/mL). The vertical scaling in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> is identical to that for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>. Therefore in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> the area under each peak measures the fraction of that protein species remaining after hydrolysis (fraction of the total, not fraction of that individual species), and the total area under the curve is less than 100%. The actual total area is 12.0% (that is, peptides or proteins that are still large enough to sediment significantly represent 12.0% of the total expected signal). Note that the peak at 0.78S represents nearly three-fourths of that total of 12.0%, and this peak could represent a fragment of one of the larger proteins. Because the areas for many of the other peaks in this sample are so small the ones below 1% are listed to the nearest 0.01% to limit the round-off error. The peak at 1.7 S was not detected in this sample. The peak at 11.4 S (0.32%) may represent a partially-digested (clipped) form of the 12.3 S species; whether or not that is correct, it is clear that species at 11-13 S are at least 100-fold less abundant than in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 44</figref>.</p>
