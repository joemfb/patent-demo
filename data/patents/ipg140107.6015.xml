<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to data systems and, more particularly, to data protection systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Data durability is of paramount importance at an enterprise level, as device failure may result in the loss of data. Accordingly, if a reliable data protection system is not utilized, permanent data loss may result.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While various types of data arrays may be utilized to protect data stored within a centralized data repository, data is often stored within internal memory devices located within separate and discrete computing devices. Often, this data stored within these internal memory devices may be unprotected and, therefore, a device failure may result in permanent (i.e., non-recoverable) data loss.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a first implementation, a computer-implemented method includes monitoring a first data portion written to a first storage device accessible by a first computing device. At least a second data portion written to at least a second storage device accessible by at least a second computing device is monitored. Recovery data is written to a recovery storage device external to and accessible by the first and the at least a second computing devices, wherein the recovery data is based, at least in part, upon the first and second data portions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One or more of the following features may be included. The recovery storage device may be accessible by a recovery computing device, and the recovery computing device may be coupled, via a network fabric, to the first computing device and the at least a second computing device.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">System Overview:</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the present disclosure may be embodied as a method, system, or computer program product. Accordingly, the present disclosure may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a &#x201c;circuit,&#x201d; &#x201c;module&#x201d; or &#x201c;system.&#x201d; Furthermore, the present disclosure may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable storage medium having computer-usable program code embodied in the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Any suitable computer usable or computer readable medium may be utilized. The computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a transmission media such as those supporting the Internet or an intranet, or a magnetic storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Note that the computer-usable or computer-readable medium could even be paper or another suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via, for instance, optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted, or otherwise processed in a suitable manner, if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory. In the context of this document, a computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be any medium that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer-usable medium may include a propagated data signal with the computer-usable program code embodied therewith, either in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. The computer usable program code may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to the Internet, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present disclosure may be written in an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like. However, the computer program code for carrying out operations of the present disclosure may also be written in conventional procedural programming languages, such as the &#x201c;C&#x201d; programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the disclosure. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 &#x26; 2</figref>, there is shown data protection process <b>10</b> that may reside on and may be executed by data protection system <b>12</b>, which may be connected to network <b>14</b> (e.g., the Internet or a local area network).

Accordingly, execution of the instruction sets and subroutines of data protection process <b>10</b> may be distributed amongst the various devices included within data protection system <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Users <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may store and/or retrieve various data portions (e.g., data portions <b>56</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>) from the various devices (e.g., server computers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>) included within data protection system <b>12</b> using client electronic devices <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> (respectively). Examples of client electronic devices <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may include, but are not limited to, personal computer <b>22</b>, laptop computer <b>24</b>, personal digital assistant <b>26</b>, a server computer (not shown), a notebook computer (not shown), a data-enabled, cellular telephone (not shown), and a dedicated network device (not shown).

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The various client electronic devices may be directly or indirectly coupled to network <b>14</b>. For example, personal computer <b>22</b> and laptop computer <b>24</b> are shown directly coupled to network <b>14</b> via a hardwired network connection. Further, personal digital assistant <b>26</b> is shown wirelessly coupled to network <b>14</b> via wireless communication channel <b>28</b> established between personal digital assistant <b>26</b> and wireless access point (i.e., WAP) <b>30</b>, which is shown directly coupled to network <b>14</b>.

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">The Data Protection Process:</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For illustrative purposes, assume that server computers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are data servers within a corporate infrastructure and that users <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are corporate users that use client electronic devices <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to access (i.e., store and retrieve) data on server computers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. While in this particular example, data protection system <b>12</b> is shown to include three server computers (e.g., server computers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>), this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure, as other configurations are possible. For example, the number of server computers included within data protections system <b>12</b> may be increased/decreased depending upon various design criteria and considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As stated above, data protection process <b>10</b> may monitor <b>100</b> a first data portion (e.g., data portion <b>57</b>) written to a first storage device (e.g., storage device <b>58</b>) accessible by a first computing device (e.g., server computer <b>50</b>). Assume for illustrative purposes that data portion <b>57</b> is written to storage device <b>58</b> included within server computer <b>50</b> due to actions taken by user <b>16</b> on client electronic device <b>22</b>. For example, data portion <b>57</b> may be a word processor file (or a portion thereof) that user <b>16</b> would like to store on storage device <b>58</b> included within server computer <b>50</b>. As discussed above, examples of storage device <b>58</b> may include but are not limited to solid-state memory devices, such as random access memory (RAM) devices; read-only memory (ROM) devices; and flash-based memory devices (e.g., a flash drive).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Additionally and as stated above, data protection process <b>10</b> may monitor <b>102</b> at least a second data portion (e.g., data portion <b>60</b>) written to at least a second storage device (e.g., storage device <b>62</b>) accessible by at least a second computing device (e.g., server computer <b>52</b>). Assume for illustrative purposes that data portion <b>60</b> is written to storage device <b>62</b> included within server computer <b>52</b> due to actions taken by user <b>18</b> on client electronic device <b>24</b>. For example, data portion <b>60</b> may be a spreadsheet file (or a portion thereof) that user <b>18</b> would like to store on storage device <b>62</b> included within server computer <b>52</b>. As discussed above, examples of storage device <b>62</b> may include but are not limited to solid-state memory devices, such as random access memory (RAM) devices; read-only memory (ROM) devices; and flash-based memory devices (e.g., a flash drive).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further assume for illustrative purposes that data portion <b>70</b> is written to storage device <b>68</b> included within server computer <b>54</b> due to actions taken by user <b>20</b> on client electronic device <b>26</b>. For example, data portion <b>70</b> may be a presentation file (or a portion thereof) that user <b>20</b> would like to store on storage device <b>68</b> included within server computer <b>54</b>. As discussed above, examples of storage device <b>68</b> may include but are not limited to solid-state memory devices, such as random access memory (RAM) devices; read-only memory (ROM) devices; and flash-based memory devices (e.g., a flash drive).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Data protection process <b>10</b> may calculate recovery data <b>64</b>, which may be based, at least in part, upon the various data portions (e.g., data portions <b>56</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>). As discussed above, the recovery data (e.g., recovery data <b>64</b>) may be written <b>104</b> to a recovery storage device (e.g., storage device <b>66</b>) external to and accessible by the various computing devices (e.g., server computers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>). Illustrative examples of recovery data <b>64</b> may include but are not limited to an erasure code and mirrored data.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If recovery data <b>64</b> is mirrored data, when recovery data <b>64</b> is written <b>104</b> to storage device <b>66</b>, a redundant copy of each of data portions <b>56</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>70</b> may be stored on storage device <b>66</b> that is coupled to recovery computing device <b>56</b>. As discussed above, examples of storage device <b>66</b> may include but are not limited to solid-state memory devices, such as random access memory (RAM) devices; read-only memory (ROM) devices; and flash-based memory devices (e.g., a flash drive). These redundant copies of data portions <b>56</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>70</b> may be maintained on storage device <b>66</b> until one or more of the related original copies (that are stored on storage devices <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>68</b> respectively) are overwritten with newer data, at which point a new redundant copy of the overwritten data portion would be written <b>104</b> to storage device <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If recovery data <b>64</b> is an erasure code (such as parity data), data protection process <b>10</b> may calculate the appropriate parity information using one of many known methodologies. For example and referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each of storage devices <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> may be divided into an equal number of data storage areas in which corresponding data storage areas across the various storage devices form a data stripe. For example and for illustrative purposes only, data area three (i.e., D3) of each of storage devices <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>68</b> may be combined with data area three (i.e., P3) of storage device <b>66</b> to form data stripe <b>150</b>. In this particular example, the data stored within data area three (i.e., D3) of each of storage devices <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>68</b> may be used to calculate recovery data <b>64</b>, which in this example is parity data that is stored within data area three (i.e., P3) of storage device <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Assume for illustrative purposes that: data portion <b>57</b> is stored within data area three (i.e., D3) of storage device <b>58</b>; data portion <b>60</b> is stored within data area three (i.e., D3) of storage device <b>62</b>; and data portion <b>70</b> is stored within data area three (i.e., D3) of storage device <b>68</b>. Accordingly, data protection process <b>10</b> may calculate recovery data <b>64</b> (which may be stored within data area three (i.e., P3) of storage device <b>66</b>) using data portions <b>56</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, when calculating recovery data <b>64</b>, data protection process <b>10</b> may exclusive-or (XOR) data portion <b>57</b> and data portion <b>60</b>. The result of this exclusive-or process may be exclusive-or'd with data portion <b>70</b> to generate recovery data <b>64</b>. Recovery data <b>64</b> may be maintained on storage device <b>66</b> until one or more of data portions <b>56</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>70</b> are overwritten with newer data, at which point recovery data <b>64</b> would be recalculated by data protection process <b>10</b> and updated recovery data <b>64</b> would be written <b>104</b> to storage device <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Assume for illustrative purposes that the value of data portion <b>57</b> changes and is overwritten with newer data. Accordingly, the value of recovery data <b>64</b> would need to be recalculated and written <b>104</b> to storage device <b>66</b>. For example, when recalculating recovery data <b>64</b>, the old value of data portion <b>57</b> may be exclusive-or'd with the current value of recovery data <b>64</b> to extract out the old value of data portion <b>57</b>. The resulting parity value may be exclusive-or'd with the new value of data portion <b>57</b> to generate updated recovery data <b>64</b>, which may be written <b>104</b> to storage device <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As an alternative way of generating updated recovery data, the new value of data portion <b>57</b> may be exclusive-or'd with the old value of data portion <b>57</b>, and the result of this process may be exclusive-or'd with the old value of recovery data <b>64</b> to generate updated recovery data <b>64</b>, which may be written <b>104</b> to storage device <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As is known in the art, in the event of a device failure and/or a data read error that e.g., renders data portion <b>57</b> inaccessible, the inaccessible data (e.g., data portion <b>57</b>) may be recovered using the accessible data portions (e.g., data portion <b>60</b> and data portion <b>70</b>) in combination with recovery data <b>64</b>.</p>
