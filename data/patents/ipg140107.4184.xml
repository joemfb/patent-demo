<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A fluid cooled electrical capacitor assembly (<b>10</b>) includes a stack of honeycomb sheet-like structures (<b>12</b>) of dielectric material with an electrode (<b>16</b>) between each pair of honeycomb sheet-like structures. Alternate electrodes are electrically coupled together to each other and may be coupled to respective terminals of an electrical circuit. Fluid passages (<b>20</b>) in the honeycomb sheet-like structures provide a place for fluid (<b>20</b><i>a</i>) to affect electrical characteristics of the capacitor assembly and/or to provide for cooling while preventing the fluid from contacting the electrodes. A method of assembling a capacitor assembly includes placing capacitor subunits including a dielectric honeycomb sheet-like structure and an electrode in parallel planar, overlying relation with the honeycomb. A method of cooling a capacitor assembly of dielectric honeycomb structure and electrodes includes directing a fluid through flow channels in the honeycomb structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of electrical capacitors, and more particularly, to a fluid cooled electrical capacitor and methods of making and using a fluid cooled electrical capacitor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Capacitors are prevalent in a wide variety of industries and applications. A known problem with standard capacitors, and with high voltage capacitors in particular, is the generation of corona, sometimes referred to as corona discharge, which may lead to failure of the dielectric in the capacitor and, thus, failure of the capacitor. Another problem with standard high voltage capacitors is the generation of heat due to corona, due to high frequency operation of the capacitor, or for some other reason; heat may cause deterioration of the capacitor dielectric, also leading to capacitor failure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Corona and the accompanying generation of ultra-violet (UV) light may degrade the dielectric used in capacitors, also leading to premature failure. For example, corona discharge and UV light may cause the crystallization of glass and the breakdown of certain polymers used in the manufacture of dielectrics for capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To reduce corona generation and its accompanying negative effects, it is known in the art that a capacitor may be immersed in a fluid (e.g., oil) to exclude ionizable fluid or gases from the areas and/or surfaces subject to corona generation. A fluid such as oil also may be used to cool a capacitor. The oil also may be used as a self-healing component to eliminate air bubbles; eliminating air bubbles avoids the generation of corona.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One problem with using a liquid (e.g., oil) to cool capacitors and to prevent corona generation, is that the addition of fluid increases the weight of the capacitor. Another problem results from the need to stabilize the fluid to prevent breakdown and/or oxidation of the fluid. One method of stabilization has been achieved through the addition of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) to the oil. The perceived negative health and environmental implications of these additions have made oil leakage from such a capacitor and disposal of the oil an additional concern.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is an increasing need in the art for an alternative method of cooling capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some instances, there also is a need for reducing and/or preventing corona discharge in capacitors and the associated negative effects.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a need for inexpensive and environmentally friendly self-healing dielectric for capacitors.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. Primed reference numerals may be used to designate parts similar to those designated by the same unprimed reference numeral. It will be understood that the figures are not necessarily to scale and that directions may be mentioned for convenience of the description, but are not necessarily limiting or required.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> (collectively referred to as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a capacitor assembly <b>10</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. As is described more fully below, a single capacitor includes a pair of dielectric sheets, one or more fluid channels between the sheets, and electrodes respectively at the dielectric sheets, e.g., attached thereto or spaced apart therefrom but in relatively close proximity thereto. The electrodes generally are separated from the channels so as not to contact the fluid therein. The sheets and fluid are a dielectric between the electrodes. The capacitor assembly may include a plurality of such capacitors, for example, arranged in stacked relation, and electrodes may be shared by two capacitors, as is described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> includes a number of capacitor subunits <b>11</b>, which are assembled in a stacked relation. The capacitor subunits <b>11</b> are formed of a honeycomb structure <b>12</b> (sometimes referred to as honeycomb) that has a pair of generally planar dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> separated by dielectric separators <b>15</b>, which may be referred to below as &#x201c;ribs&#x201d; or as &#x201c;supports.&#x201d; The honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is electrically non-conductive, e.g., made of dielectric material. In addition to a honeycomb structure <b>12</b>, a capacitor subunit <b>11</b> also includes an electrode <b>16</b>. As is illustrated, capacitor subunits are stacked together, and an electrode <b>16</b> is between respective relatively adjacent honeycomb structures <b>12</b>. Being spaced apart by honeycomb structures <b>12</b>, respective pairs (or more) of electrodes <b>16</b> may provide a capacitive effect, e.g., a capacitance, and sometimes will be referred to below as a capacitor <b>17</b>. Accordingly, in assembled relation of capacitor subunits <b>11</b> to form the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, respective pairs of electrodes <b>16</b>, which are separated by a honeycomb structure <b>12</b>, function as capacitors <b>17</b>. Electrodes between adjacent honeycomb structures may be shared in respectively adjacent capacitors so only one electrode may be needed for each capacitor subassembly in the stack. The capacitors <b>17</b> may be combined to provide a larger capacitance function of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, e.g., as a stack of capacitors. The honeycomb structure may provide for controlled and relatively accurate spacing of the electrodes at each surface of a respective honeycomb to provide for relatively accurate control of the capacitance of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Dotted lines at the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> indicate that top and base pieces (described below) or more capacitor subunits may be included in the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> the top-most honeycomb structure <b>12</b> does not have an upper electrode and may serve as the top of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>; the bottom of the capacitor assembly may be similar to the top in that sense. As is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, several of the electrodes <b>16</b> may be electrically connected to each other. For example, with several capacitor subunits <b>11</b> in the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, the electrodes <b>16</b><i>a </i>may be electrically connected together and the electrodes <b>16</b><i>b </i>(only one of which is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be electrically connected together. In operation of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> to provide capacitance, the electrodes <b>16</b><i>a </i>are at the opposite polarity from the electrodes <b>16</b><i>b</i>. In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, tab portions <b>18</b><i>a </i>of electrodes <b>16</b><i>a </i>extend beyond an edge of honeycomb structures <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the tab portions <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>are folded or bent into engagement to make the electrical connection thereof with other respective tab portions <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b</i>. These electrical tab portions <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>may connect the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> in an electrical circuit <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A number of flow through channels <b>20</b> (sometimes referred to as passages, paths, pathways, flow channels, fluid channels, channels or the like) are in respective honeycomb structures <b>12</b> of the capacitor subunits <b>11</b>. The flow-through channels may provide for cooling or other purpose, as is described below. There may be only one channel <b>20</b> or, as is illustrated in a number of the exemplary embodiments, there may be a plurality of channels <b>20</b> in a capacitor subunit <b>11</b>. The channels <b>20</b> of a capacitor subunit <b>11</b> may be the space between the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and the ribs <b>15</b> of the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> of the capacitor subunits. The ribs <b>15</b> separate the dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> from each other and divide the space between the dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> into respective flow channels. The ribs <b>15</b> and dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> may be, for example, integrally formed as a single structural unit or several parts thereof may be separately formed and assembled to make the honeycomb structure <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A respective channel <b>20</b> may be fluidically isolated from some or all of the other channels <b>20</b>, or it may be connected to one or more other channel(s), e.g., by an opening in a rib <b>15</b> between adjacent channels. A fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>may be disposed in or passed through one or more of the channels <b>20</b>, for example, to effect cooling of a capacitor subunit <b>11</b>, to affect capacitance of the capacitor subunit, or for other purposes. The honeycomb structure <b>12</b> and fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>in the channels <b>20</b> provide a (or the) dielectric between respective electrodes of capacitors <b>17</b> in the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as an example, a fan or blower <b>21</b> blows fluid, for example, air or other gas <b>20</b><i>a</i>, toward the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, through the channels <b>20</b> of respective capacitor subunits <b>11</b>, and out of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>may be a liquid, e.g., oil, a polymer or another liquid, which may be in the channels or may be flowed through them, e.g., by a pump <b>21</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, if desired, flow of gas or liquid <b>20</b><i>a </i>through the channels <b>20</b> may be provided by convection; as an example, with channels <b>20</b> in vertical orientation a chimney effect may occur whereby warmer fluid rises and flows through the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As an example of operation of a capacitor assembly <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the electrodes <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>may be connected to an electric circuit or component, e.g., as is shown at <b>22</b>, of the electrical circuit <b>19</b>. Terminals, wire connections, etc. <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>a </i>electrically couple the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> to the electric circuit <b>22</b> via respective terminals, wire connections, etc. <b>23</b><i>b</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>, to function as a capacitor in the electrical circuit <b>19</b>. The capacitance of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> may depend on, for example, the number of capacitor subunits <b>11</b>, the size and shape of the capacitor subunits <b>11</b> and parts thereof, the size, shape and relative location of respective electrodes <b>16</b>, the material used to form the electrodes <b>16</b>, spacing of the electrodes as provided by the thickness of the dielectric honeycomb structure <b>12</b>, electrical or dielectric characteristics of the honeycomb structures <b>12</b> and the fluid(s) in channels <b>20</b>, the electrical connections <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>a </i>of electrodes <b>16</b>, to respective terminals or the like <b>23</b><i>b</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the electric circuit <b>22</b>, the voltage applied to or by the electric circuit, environmental conditions, or other variables. During operation of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, the fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>in the channels <b>20</b> may affect capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">An example of operating capacitor assembly <b>10</b>: An electrical voltage is applied across the electrodes <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The honeycomb structure supports the electrodes in parallel, spaced apart, and at least partially overlapping relation. The capacitor assembly <b>10</b> may operate as a standard electrical capacitor operates. During normal operation, if desired, the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> may be cooled by fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>that may be blown or pumped through the channels <b>20</b>. The fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>cools the capacitor assembly and respective parts thereof. The honeycomb structure <b>12</b> and the fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>provide a dielectric for the capacitors <b>17</b> of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>. The honeycomb structure maintains separation of the fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>from the electrodes <b>16</b> so that the fluid does not contact the electrodes while permitting thermal transfer from the electrodes via the honeycomb structure to the fluid. Thus, the fluid and the electrodes are thermally coupled. The fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>may be freshly supplied to the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> from a separate source, e.g., ambient air, oil storage supply, etc.; and/or the fluid may be recirculated or recycled, possibly after first undergoing treatment, for example, to cool it, to ground it to remove any excess charge, and/or to dry it.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As is described in greater detail below, if a circumstance were to occur that the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> becomes hotter than desired for desired operation, for example, due to the input electrical voltage thereto having at least a portion that exceeds the break down voltage of dielectric of the capacitor assembly or due to a high frequency input electrical voltage, the fluid may be used not only to cool the capacitor assembly but also to tend to blow out from a channel a corona discharge or the electron leakage at the start of a corona discharge buildup thereby to avoid break down of the dielectric. Such capabilities of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> lead to a robust apparatus. Also, as will be appreciated, a number of capacitor assemblies <b>10</b> may be used together to increase the capacitance characteristics thereof and of the electrical circuit in which used. The capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is modular in that several may be used together; also the capacitor subunits <b>11</b> are modular in that more or fewer may be used in a capacitor assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, an example of honeycomb structure <b>12</b> used in the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown. The honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is a multi-wall honeycomb and includes at least two substantially parallel and at least partially overlapping dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> that are separated by at least two dielectric ribs <b>15</b>. One or more flow through channels <b>20</b> are in the honeycomb structure <b>12</b>. For example, the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and a pair of the ribs <b>15</b> may define at least one flow through channel <b>20</b>; and with more than two ribs <b>15</b>, there may be more than one flow channel <b>20</b> as illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In an embodiment of the invention there are a number of channels <b>20</b> and they are relatively deep, e.g., much longer than the smaller of the respective cross sectional dimensions thereof, which straightens fluid flow and thus promotes laminar flow through the channels. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, the length of the channels <b>20</b> is much longer than both cross sectional dimensions of the channels. As a non-limiting example, the length of a channel may be greater than about four times the smaller cross sectional dimension of the channel. Also, in an embodiment the cross sectional shape and dimensions of each of the channels in the honeycomb are approximately the same, which promotes uniform distribution of fluid to and through the channels. Laminar flow promotes even (e.g., substantially uniform) heat removal and avoids the occurrence of or eliminates hot spots along the channels; and the substantially uniform fluid distribution helps to maintain substantially uniform temperature of the capacitor assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the illustrated capacitor assembly <b>10</b> the flow channels <b>20</b> are of substantially the same cross sectional size and shape and substantially the same length. This shape, size, length and arrangement helps to assure substantially equal flow of fluid through the flow channels or containment of fluid therein for substantially uniform cooling, substantially uniform electrical characteristics, etc. over the area of each respective capacitor <b>17</b>, capacitor subunits <b>11</b> and the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, as may be desired.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The honeycomb structure <b>12</b> may be made from electrically non-conductive material, e.g., glass, ceramic, clay, plastic, thermoplastic, polymer, acrylic, polycarbonate, polypropylene, polyethylene, phenolic, etc. or the like. The honeycomb structure <b>12</b> may be made by any suitable method (e.g., extrusion, molding, machining, etc.). A suitable commercial example of honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is manufactured by GALLINA USA LLC of Janesville, Wis., USA and is sold under the trademark or designation &#x201c;POLYCARB.&#x201d; The sheets, which are generally parallel to the electrode <b>16</b>, may be twin-wall, e.g., two layer form, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> in which dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> are respective layers, or may be more than two layers, e.g., three layers <b>13</b>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, or more.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The electrodes <b>16</b> of capacitor subunits <b>11</b> are on or at the external surface of a dielectric sheet <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, i.e., not the internal surface of the dielectric sheet that faces directly into or forms channels <b>20</b>. For a stack of capacitor subunits <b>11</b> that form the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, it will be appreciated that two electrodes <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>adjacent a respective honeycomb structure <b>12</b> are at the external surfaces of dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> thereof and those electrodes are relatively uniformly spaced apart from each other over their area by the honeycomb structure <b>12</b>. Those electrodes <b>16</b> are not in the channels <b>20</b> and do not make contact with the fluid in the channels. The electrode <b>16</b> between two directly adjacent capacitor subunits <b>11</b> may be shared to provide capacitance with the two other electrodes at the relatively remotely opposite dielectric sheets of those capacitor subunits, as is illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As a non-limiting example, for use with alternating current (AC) voltages in the range of from about 600 volts to about 15,000 volts rms, a thickness of the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> may be approximately 6 millimeters as measured between the external surfaces of the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. Exemplary cross sectional size of the channels <b>20</b> for such honeycomb may be about 3/16 inch by about 3/16 inch. A smaller size honeycomb structure material from GALLINA USA LLC is 4.5 millimeter thick and may be used, but the smaller cross sectional size channels <b>20</b> may cause undesirable back pressure opposing the fluid flow therethrough and also may impede uniformity of fluid flow. Larger size honeycomb structures also are available and may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The sizes and other values expressed herein are examples; others may be used depending on various requirements of the capacitor assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Another example of coextruded twin wall (two layers) polycarbonate sheet material useful as the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is sold under the trademark MAKROLON by Sheffield Plastics Inc. of Sheffield, Mass.; and other honeycomb structures are available from TAP Plastics, Inc. and COEX Corporation of Wallyford, Conn. LEXAN polycarbonate material sold by General Electric Company also may be used for the honeycomb structure <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An advantage to using polycarbonate material for the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is that it does not support combustion. The cooling provided by fluid in the channels, e.g., air flow or some other fluid flow, and the tendency for the honeycomb structure to not be combustible, tends to enhance safe operation of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, even at high voltage and/or high frequency operating conditions or uses. Although the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> would function as a capacitor at many different voltages, the capacitor assembly is useful at relatively high input AC voltages, e.g., from about 600 volts to about 15,000 volts rms or even higher or lower voltages. The capacitor assembly also is operative at many different frequencies, even for direct current (DC) circuits; exemplary frequencies are in the range of from about 60 Hertz to about 120 Hertz, but other frequencies may be used. The capacitor assembly also is operative with direct current (DC) input voltage or pulsed DC voltage. In capacitors usually the higher the frequency, the more heat produced. Thus, cooling provided the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is advantageous at high voltages and at high frequencies. The values mentioned herein are exemplary only and are not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A honeycomb structure <b>12</b> with ribs <b>15</b> providing walls separating respective flow channels <b>20</b> prevents an inadvertent or unintended corona within the cooling fluid of a fluid channel from spreading to another fluid channel. This helps to maintain the dielectric integrity of the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is available in a number of thicknesses and colors. Some readily available thicknesses include, for example, 4 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm, as measured between the exteriors of the respective sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. Other thicknesses also are possible. The honeycomb structure may be colored or clear. An exemplary honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is a clear UV stabilized polycarbonate. The honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is available in large sheets and may be cut to desired dimensions. Exemplary standard sheets of the described honeycomb material are available in 4 feet by 8 feet sheets; extended lengths of 20 feet or more may be available. An example of cross-sectional size of the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> for the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is 6 inches by 6 inches; however, such sizes are not limiting and it will be appreciated that other sizes may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> may be planar or substantially planar, e.g., as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, or may be non-planar, e.g., curved as in the illustration of honeycomb structure <b>12</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. The dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> are relatively uniformly separated by the ribs <b>15</b>. The capacitor assembly <b>10</b> usually will function best, e.g., substantially uniformly, with the electrodes <b>16</b> of respective sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> substantially uniformly spaced apart. By spacing the electrodes <b>16</b> uniformly, capacitance is maximized and is uniform, and stress points that would lead to break down of the fluid dielectric <b>20</b><i>a </i>in the channels <b>20</b> are minimized or eliminated. By eliminating stress points at which the dielectric fluid in channels <b>20</b> may break down and lead to corona discharge that would produce ultraviolet light, the materials used to form the honeycomb and the electrodes would experience less failure due to thermal and/or UV breakdown.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Substantially uniform spacing of the dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, and substantially uniform spacing of the ribs <b>15</b>, and, if possible, spacing of the ribs such that the cross section dimensions of the channels <b>20</b> are about the same, which together tend to yield uniform channels <b>20</b>, leads to substantially even fluid flow and substantially uniform cooling effect. Eliminating electrical stress points tends to minimize single point breakdown in the structure, e.g., corona discharge, and this combination with uniform cooling tends to provide an arc or corona quenching effect, e.g., the blowing out of an electric arc or corona discharge, and tends to maintain even temperatures that protect the material, e.g., plastic or polymer, of which the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is made.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It will be appreciated that the combination of the fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>in the fluid flow channels together with the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is the dielectric for the capacitor <b>17</b> formed by each stack of two capacitor subunits <b>11</b>. The fluid is directed through the channels <b>20</b> between the spaced apart electrodes <b>16</b> without contacting the electrodes. The fluid cools the capacitor. The directing of the fluid affects dielectric characteristics of the capacitor. For example, if the fluid is provided at a sufficiently fast rate to blow out from a channel a corona discharge or the electron leakage at the start of a corona discharge buildup, the dielectric value of the fluid and, thus, of the combination dielectric of the fluid and honeycomb, would be somewhat greater as compared to a lower dielectric value if a corona discharge or electron leakage were occurring in a channel generating ions and freeing electrons in the channel. Other possibilities of controlling dielectric characteristics of the capacitor via the fluid would be to control the moisture content of a gaseous fluid, control the temperature of the fluid, and/or determine what are the constituents of the fluid, e.g., whether the fluid is or contains oxygen, nitrogen, helium, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the exemplary embodiments illustrated, honeycomb structure <b>12</b> with substantially parallel, substantially planar, and overlying or stacked dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> is used. Though the honeycomb <b>12</b> is illustrated as having dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of the same thickness, the thickness of the respective sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> does not necessarily have to be the same. However, the thickness of each of the honeycomb structures of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is substantially the same in the illustrated embodiments. The walls of the dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> provide in a sense a static, e.g., unchanging, dielectric as compared to the possibly changing dielectric characteristics of the fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>flowing in channels <b>20</b>. Although the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is illustrated as having two substantially parallel dielectric sheets, honeycomb structure material with more than two dielectric sheets may be used in the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, e.g., three or more spaced apart dielectric sheets, which may be in parallel planar and overlying relation. An example of a tri-wall honeycomb structure <b>12</b><i>b </i>useful in a capacitor subunit for a capacitor assembly is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> having dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>and ribs <b>15</b>. Electrodes <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are at the exterior surfaces of the exterior dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. Using tri-wall or even more wall dielectric honeycomb structures provides additional static (unchanging) dielectric for the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The ribs <b>15</b> may be made of dielectric material and may be of the same material used to make the dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. The ribs <b>15</b> may be substantially planar and arranged substantially perpendicular to the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, as illustrated. It should be appreciated, however, that the ribs <b>15</b> may have alternative configurations. For example, instead of ribs <b>15</b> configured as illustrated, tubular structures formed from dielectric material may be disposed between the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. In such a configuration, the interior space of the tubular structures may define a channel <b>20</b>. The space exterior to the tubes and between the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> also may serve as channels <b>20</b>. In yet another contemplated embodiment, a thin dielectric material, may be disposed between the two substantially parallel sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> instead of or in addition to ribs <b>15</b>. Such dielectric material may be similar to material used to form the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, or may be another material. Instead of being substantially parallel to the two sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, however, the dielectric material may have a sinus wave shape cross section (similar to corrugated cardboard), a &#x2018;zig-zag&#x2019; shape cross section (similar to the shape of multiple W's), or an alternative configuration. In such a manner, channels <b>20</b> may be formed between the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> in the open areas provided by the ribs and sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. Alternatively, a piece of solid dielectric material could be provided and channels <b>20</b> could be drilled or cut in the material.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The ribs <b>15</b> tend to hold the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> relatively uniformly spaced apart and the use of more than two ribs to provide relatively uniform spacing allows for the use of thinner sheets in making relatively large area honeycomb structures <b>12</b> than would be possible without more than two ribs. The use of two or more ribs in this configuration also allows for the use of thinner dielectrics or dielectric sheets for a rated voltage of the capacitor. The use of thinner dielectric material for the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> also may allow for the material to be cooled more easily since the material will have less of a tendency to store heat than thicker sheets and can more easily transmit heat between the electrodes <b>16</b> and the fluid <b>20</b><i>a</i>, which may remove heat from and, thus, cool the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Separation of the flow channels <b>20</b> from each other may avoid a cumulative heat problem, for example, as follows. Ionization of gas usually occurs more easily at a higher temperature than at a relatively lower temperature, and if the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> were to generate heat, heat pockets may form; resistance to fluid flow due to a heat pocket may build in one or more flow channels <b>20</b>. The fluid may begin to flow around these areas of higher fluid flow resistance and the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> may not be cooled evenly and/or efficiently. As heat builds in an area of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, there may be a tendency for corona discharge to occur in that area, further raising the temperature of the fluid and the materials in that area, e.g., the honeycomb and/or the electrodes, and producing ultraviolet light, which degrades plastic and crystallizes glass. Hence, the hot spot area may become prone to material breakdown or thermal failure, for example, crystallization, melting, pitting or burning of the electrodes <b>16</b> and/or the honeycomb structure <b>12</b>. By dividing the volume of air space between the dielectric sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of a honeycomb structure <b>12</b> into multiple flow channels <b>20</b> and generally maintaining even fluid flow through the flow passages, the tendency to develop such fluid flow resistance may be decreased and the ability to cool and the efficiency of cooling the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> may be increased. The fluid flow in these passages tends to be smooth and relatively turbulence free (laminar-like) which enhances cooling efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The fluid may be used to exclude ionizable gases from around the electrodes <b>16</b> and between the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and may be used to cool the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> as explained above. The fluid itself may be cooled to facilitate cooling of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>. A liquid fluid may be transported or moved by a pump <b>21</b><i>a </i>and a gaseous fluid, e.g., air, nitrogen, or some other gas or combination of gases, may be transported or moved by a fan or blower <b>21</b> through the channels <b>20</b>. The fluid also may be transported by convection currents, as is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As another alternative, the fluid used to cool the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> may be recycled. For example, the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> may be disposed in a closed case in which a recirculating gas is contained. Dry gas, e.g., a gas that contains relatively little or no water (moisture), may be used, for example, because it has a higher ionization potential than humid air or gas. For example, in air the primary gas constituent that requires the greatest voltage for ionization (ionization potential) is nitrogen, oxygen is second, and water is third. Water acts as an electrical conductor and when it is in the gaseous state facilitates electrical conduction in air; thus to avoid conducting electricity and formation of corona discharge in air (or other fluid) flowing through the channels, it is advantageous to minimize moisture in the air. The air may be dried, e.g., using a silica drying agent, or another gas, e.g., nitrogen that does not contain moisture, may be used. The fluid may be directed through the channels <b>20</b> of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, through the case where it may be treated, e.g. cooled, dried, filtered, and electrically grounded to reduce its conductivity and potential to become ionized, etc., and back through the channels <b>20</b> of the capacitor assembly. The case may sink heat away from the gas and the capacitor assembly, thereby cooling the entire capacitor assembly <b>10</b> and case. Instead of using the case to sink heat, the fluid may be passed through the channels <b>20</b> and then through a fluid cooler (e.g., a heat exchanger) before recycling through the channels <b>20</b>. The case also may provide for electrical grounding to discharge the fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>before being recycled through the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> and/or exhausted from the capacitor assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Briefly referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, instead of passing a fluid through the fluid channels <b>20</b>, the entire capacitor assembly <b>10</b> may be placed into a fluid that is not easily ionized (e.g., oil).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B, a capacitor subunit <b>11</b> is illustrated to show an exemplary method of assembling the capacitor subunits <b>11</b> to make a capacitor assembly <b>10</b>. An electrode <b>16</b> is disposed at or near a desired sheet <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of the honeycomb <b>12</b>. An electrode <b>16</b> is disposed such that at least one layer of dielectric sheet <b>13</b> or <b>14</b> separates the electrode from the flow through channels <b>20</b>. The electrode <b>16</b> may be a conductive foil, as illustrated; and other examples of electrodes include conductive tape, or plating on the surface of the respective dielectric sheet <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. The conductive foil <b>16</b> may be made from a metal such as, for example, aluminum, copper, gold, silver, iron, nickel, tin, or other electrically conductive material. Alternatively, the electrode <b>16</b> may be a conductive paint containing, for example, metal and/or metal additives, or other electrically conductive material. A non-limiting example of conductive paint is sold under the trademark RUST-OLEUM cold galvanizing that contains 93 percent (93%) zinc. Virtually any electrically conductive material of suitable size and shape may be used for the electrode <b>16</b>. The electrode may be thin and conformal so it tends to follow irregularities in the adjacent dielectric sheets and minimizes space needed for the electrode between dielectric sheets of respective honeycomb structures.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The electrode <b>16</b> may include an adhesive <b>25</b> to facilitate attachment to a respective sheet <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> or an adhesive <b>25</b> may be located on a sheet and used to adhere the electrode to the sheet. An advantage of using adhesive backed electrically conductive tape is the cushion effect of the adhesive, which helps fill voids and, thus, enhances conformance to irregularities in the dielectric sheet. Instead or in addition to adhesive, the sheets <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> may be provided with mechanical connectors that mechanically engage the electrode or reciprocal connectors on the electrode <b>16</b>. Alternatively, the electrode <b>16</b> may be taped, e.g., using double sided tape, or otherwise fastened in the correct position or held in place by an adjacent capacitor subunit <b>11</b>. Other possible methods of locating the electrode <b>16</b> at a sheet <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> will occur to those skilled in the art and are intended to be included in the scope of the appended claims. In an optimum circumstance, for example, on the one hand the electrode <b>16</b> would be between two dielectric sheets of respective capacitor subunits <b>11</b>, and there would be no voids or space, etc. between the confronting surfaces of those two dielectric sheets; by avoiding such voids or space, the likelihood that corona discharge or electric arc formation there is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, for example, the capacitor subunits <b>11</b> include a conductive foil used as the electrode <b>16</b>. The conductive foil <b>16</b> includes an adhesive <b>25</b> on the surface that contacts a respective sheet <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. The conductive foil <b>16</b> may be disposed at a desired sheet <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> with an excess material portion <b>26</b> extending beyond an edge <b>27</b> (e.g., the tab edge where the tab <b>18</b> of the electrode may be exposed) of the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to provide electrode tab portions <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>for convenient electrical connection thereof. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the excess material portion may be folded along the edge <b>27</b> of the honeycomb structure with the adhesive <b>25</b> facing the edge <b>27</b> of the honeycomb structure.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As is seen in several drawing figures, the electrode <b>16</b> is positioned in spaced apart relation from three of the side edges <b>28</b> of the honeycomb structure <b>12</b>, as is represented by space <b>28</b><i>a</i>, to avoid electrical leakage from one electrode to another electrode around the edge of the honeycomb dielectric <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, before the excess material portion <b>26</b> (also referred to as &#x201c;tab portion&#x201d;) contacts the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> at the edge <b>27</b>, a dielectric insulator material spacer <b>30</b> may be placed between the honeycomb structure edge (tab edge) <b>27</b> and the excess material portion <b>26</b> to straddle the two adjacent honeycomb structures <b>12</b>, as is seen in the drawing figure. The dielectric insulator <b>30</b> may be made from any suitable material (e.g., plastic, thermoplastic, glass, clay, ceramic, polymer, etc.). As an example, the dielectric insulator <b>30</b> may be cut from a thin (e.g., about 0.127 millimeters or less to about 0.254 millimeters or more thick) sheet of MYLAR&#xae; film. Other insulators of the same or different sizes may be used as insulator <b>30</b>. The dielectric insulator <b>30</b> may, for example, reduce the likelihood of unwanted electrical leakage between the tab portion <b>18</b> of one electrode and the next adjacent electrode of the opposite polarity, e.g., from the electrode <b>16</b> of one capacitor subunit <b>11</b> and the electrode <b>16</b> of an adjacent capacitor subunit <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Instead of folding the excess material portion <b>26</b> at this point, a plurality of capacitor subunits <b>11</b> may be assembled in overlying relation, e.g., as is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and the excess material portions <b>26</b> may be folded as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> after the capacitor subunits have been assembled together as in the arrangement of tabs <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b</i>, for example. Alternatively, the excess material portion <b>26</b> of some or all capacitor subunits <b>11</b> may be folded prior to assembly (stacking) and the excess material portion <b>26</b> of some or all capacitor subunits <b>11</b> may be folded after stacking to form the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Each capacitor subunit <b>11</b> may be made in the same manner and with the same configuration. This would facilitate production of the capacitor subunits and may help increase overall quality and consistency of the capacitor subunits and the capacitor assemblies <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, a method of assembling capacitor subunits <b>11</b> into a capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is shown. It should be noted that some of the following steps may be performed in an alternative order and are set forth in the illustrated order only for convenience of description.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">A plurality of capacitor subunits <b>11</b> is shown. In the illustrated exemplary capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, six capacitor subunits <b>11</b> are provided. Starting at the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a first capacitor subunit is provided and may be arranged as illustrated. A second capacitor subunit is provided in parallel to the first capacitor subunit but is oriented in reverse direction to the first capacitor subunit, e.g., in a sense rotated 180&#xb0; (180 degrees) about an axis <b>31</b> relative to the adjacent capacitor subunit. Third, fourth, fifth and sixth capacitor subunits <b>11</b> are in the same alternate rotational orientation as the first and second capacitor subunits <b>11</b>. The capacitor subunits <b>11</b> are stacked together and are held together to make the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>. The steps may be repeated until a capacitor assembly <b>10</b> of desired characteristics, dimensions and layers (more or fewer than the illustrated six layers) is formed. The stacked assembled capacitor subunits are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> prior to folding over or otherwise attaching respective electrodes <b>16</b><i>a </i>to each other and electrodes <b>16</b><i>b </i>to each other. A piece of honeycomb <b>12</b> without an electrode <b>16</b> may be placed at the top and/or bottom of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> to function as a top and/or base (not illustrated). Other top and base members may be used, as may be desired.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Thus, it will be appreciated that the respective electrodes <b>16</b><i>a </i>and their associated tabs <b>18</b><i>a </i>may be exposed at one part of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> and the respective electrodes <b>16</b><i>b </i>and their associated tabs <b>18</b><i>b </i>may be exposed at another part of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, not in direct electrical connection with the electrodes <b>16</b><i>a</i>. In this way it is relatively easy to electrically couple respective electrodes <b>16</b><i>a </i>together and to the electrical circuit <b>19</b> and respective electrodes <b>16</b><i>b </i>together and to the electrical circuit <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is generally of rectangular cross section and the tabs <b>18</b> of respective electrodes are exposed at opposite sides of the rectangle. As also is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the tabs <b>18</b> of respective electrodes <b>16</b> may be exposed at adjacent sides of the rectangular cross section capacitor assembly. Separation of the respective electrodes and their tabs by locating them at different respective sides of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> and by spacing the electrodes <b>16</b> from the edges of the dielectric honeycomb may facilitate constructing the capacitor assembly, maintaining electrical isolation of the electrodes <b>16</b><i>a </i>from electrodes <b>16</b><i>b</i>, and may also provide for enhanced accurate control of the capacitance provided by the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>. It will be appreciated that although the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is shown in the several embodiments as having a rectangular cross section or footprint, it may have another shape, e.g., a different polygonal cross section or footprint or even a curved cross section or footprint, such as circular, oval, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the channels <b>20</b> of capacitor assembly <b>10</b> may be similarly oriented to pass fluid through the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> in one direction.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the channels <b>20</b> of capacitor subunits <b>11</b> of capacitor assembly <b>10</b> may be oriented with some flow channels <b>20</b> in different respective directions, e.g. orthogonal directions.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, capacitor subunits <b>11</b> may be joined together with a suitable fastening mechanism <b>32</b>. The fastening mechanism <b>32</b> may be, for example, an adhesive (e.g., epoxy, silicone, foam tape, etc.), tape or other material such as one or more straps (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), a bolt or screw (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), one or more bands of metal or other material (electrically conductive or non-conductive), a clamp, pressure fitting, or other suitable means. The capacitor subunits <b>11</b> may be pressed or squeezed together in a stack with an electrode between respective capacitor subunits to make the capacitor assembly in a manner that minimizes the amount of ionizable material between the capacitor subunits <b>11</b>. By reducing the amount of ionizable material from the space between adjacent capacitor subunits <b>11</b>, unintended corona generation in that space may be reduced or avoided. An insulator material, e.g. silicone, may be included between the capacitor subunits <b>11</b> further to occupy any such space and to reduce the amount of ionizable material, e.g. air, between capacitor subunits. If such insulation material were curable, settable or the like, it may be used to glue, cement, etc., together the stack of capacitor subunits <b>11</b> forming the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>, an alternative embodiment of capacitor subunits <b>11</b>&#x2032; and capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; and method of assembling the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; are illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; includes a number of capacitor subunits <b>11</b>&#x2032; that are in stacked relation generally as was described above. As is described in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>, the capacitor subunits <b>11</b>&#x2032; are held together between a base member <b>11</b><i>b </i>and a top member <b>11</b><i>t </i>by a number of rods <b>33</b> or other elongate fasteners. In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> there are two rods that are threaded at opposite ends, and a nut that is threaded onto each end holds the rods to the base member and top member with the stack of capacitor subunits <b>11</b>&#x2032; pressed or squeezed together between the base member and top member. The rods may be located in notches of the capacitor subunits <b>11</b>&#x2032; to tend to restrict lateral movement of the capacitor subunits in the stack of them in the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032;. Also, the rods may be electrically conductive and may be electrically connected to respective electrodes <b>16</b> of the capacitor subunits <b>11</b>&#x2032; to provide electrical connections thereof in an electrical circuit <b>19</b>. For example, one electrically conductive rod may be electrically connected to the electrodes <b>16</b><i>a </i>and a different electrically conductive rod may be electrically connected to the electrodes <b>16</b><i>b</i>, thereby providing the two polarities of electrical connection for the respective electrodes of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032;. Terminal electrodes <b>33</b><i>t </i>at the top member <b>11</b><i>t </i>of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; may be used to provide electrical connections for the electrically conductive rods to the electrical circuit <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>, a notch <b>34</b> is cut into each side edge <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> at approximately midway along the length of the side edge. &#x201c;Side edge&#x201d; in this instance refers to the edges <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the honeycomb structure that run parallel to the flow-through channels <b>20</b>; placing the notch <b>34</b> at such side edge <b>12</b><i>a </i>avoids obstructing fluid flow through channels <b>20</b> at the central area <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; where there may be more heating than at the edges <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the capacitor assembly during use. In the illustrated embodiment, the notch <b>34</b> is about &#xbc; inch wide, measured on the side edge <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the honeycomb <b>12</b>, and &#xbd; inch deep, measured from the side edge <b>12</b><i>a </i>toward the center area <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the honeycomb <b>12</b>. An electrode <b>16</b> is located at a sheet <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and extends out to the edge <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the honeycomb structure, including electrode material extending over the notch <b>34</b>. The electrode may be an electrically conductive foil, electrically conductive tape, electrically conductive paint, plating, or other material, e.g., as is described elsewhere herein and/or equivalents. A cut <b>35</b> in the electrode <b>16</b> extends approximately along the depth of the notch and is approximately centered on the width of the notch. Two flaps <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>of material that arc part of the electrode <b>16</b> are formed by the cut <b>35</b> and may be manually or otherwise depressed slightly into the notch toward the other sheet of the honeycomb structure <b>12</b>. This depression biases bending or folding of the flaps into the notch to ensure that as the rod is pressed into the notch <b>34</b> and the rod and/or an associated sleeve makes electrical connection with the electrode <b>16</b>, and so that adhesive, which may hold the electrode to the honeycomb structure <b>12</b>, would not be between the electrode and the rod or sleeve. A number of capacitor subunits <b>11</b>&#x2032; and connection of electrodes <b>16</b> thereof in the electrical circuit <b>19</b> may be made and provided according to this method.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the embodiment of FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>D the notch <b>34</b> is rectangular cross section. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13E</figref> the notch <b>34</b><i>v </i>is V-shape. Using a V-shape notch helps to avoid the possibility that the flaps <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>might be stressed and tear where they are attached to the main body of the electrode material in the area of the notch.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>, the capacitor subunits <b>11</b>&#x2032; may be assembled in stacked relation between a base <b>11</b><i>b </i>and a top <b>11</b><i>t </i>to form a capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032;. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the base and the top are each &#xbd; inch thick polypropylene sheets, but it will be appreciated that other materials and other sizes may be used. Notches <b>34</b> are cut or otherwise formed in the base <b>11</b><i>b </i>and the top <b>11</b><i>t </i>with dimensions substantially similar to the notches <b>34</b> in the sheets of honeycomb <b>12</b>. Each successive capacitor subunit <b>11</b>&#x2032; is oriented about 180 degrees (180&#xb0;) relative to adjacent capacitor subunit <b>11</b>&#x2032; so that the electrodes <b>16</b> of alternate, e.g., every second, capacitor subunit align in the same direction. A desired number of the capacitor subunits <b>11</b>&#x2032; may be stacked in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">After the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; components are in their appropriate configuration (orientation), they may be mechanically and electrically connected to form a functioning capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032;. Threaded rods <b>33</b> are provided for this purpose. If desired, around at least a portion of the rod <b>33</b> there may be placed an electrically conductive engaging material <b>41</b>. This conductive engaging material may be, for example, a piece of conductive foil or a conductive sleeve. The threaded rod <b>33</b> is inserted through the sleeve <b>41</b> and the assembly is pushed into the notches <b>34</b> formed in the base <b>11</b><i>b</i>, the top <b>11</b><i>t </i>and the capacitor subunits <b>11</b>&#x2032;. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13D</figref>, as the rod <b>33</b> and the sleeve <b>41</b> are pushed into the notches, the flaps <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>of the electrodes <b>16</b> are pushed into the notch and make contact with the sleeve. In this way, each capacitor subunit <b>11</b>&#x2032; is connected to the sleeve <b>41</b>. The sleeve <b>41</b> and the rod <b>33</b> may be selected so that the outer diameter of the threaded rod <b>33</b> is approximately identical to the inner diameter of the sleeve <b>41</b> for electrical connection therebetween. Hence, the rod and the sleeve will be electrically connected so the rod is electrically connected to each capacitor subunit <b>11</b>&#x2032; electrodes <b>16</b>. The notch may be V-shape, as at <b>34</b><i>v </i>to avoid a tendency of the flaps <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>to tear as they are folded under the force of the inserted rod.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">If desired, electrically conductive material <b>41</b><i>a</i>, e.g., some slightly crushed aluminum foil (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref>) or the like, may be inserted in the notch <b>34</b> or <b>34</b><i>v </i>prior to insertion of the rod and sleeve or just the rod to enhance electrical connection thereof to the electrodes; such electrically conductive material may be further crushed or wedged into the notch as the rod and sleeve or just the rod is forced into the notch.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the illustrated exemplary embodiment the threaded rod <b>33</b> approximately is the same height as the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032;, as shown. A washer <b>42</b> and a nut <b>43</b> may be attached to each end of the rod <b>33</b> to join and hold the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; together in operational relation. The rod may be a bolt to hold the stacked capacitor subunits together between the bolt head at one end and washer and nut at the other end. Other devices, such as clamps, rivets, tape, bands, etc., e.g., as are described herein, alternatively or additionally may be used to hold the parts of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; together. The use of rod <b>33</b>, sleeve <b>41</b>, washer <b>42</b> and nut <b>43</b> can be suitably tightened to hold the parts of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; securely together, e.g., to press or to squeeze these together, to tend to minimize air or other fluid in areas where not desired, e.g., between an electrode and the sheet material of a honeycomb structure or between sheet material of respectively adjacent honeycomb materials and between the top and bottom capacitor subunits and the top and base of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032;. The capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; is self-supporting structure even by its own dielectric, e.g., the honeycomb structure, and/or in that the components are retained together as described and also the top and base facilitate supporting the capacitor assembly on a surface, in a case, etc., and stacking of capacitor assemblies, as well as side-by-side placement.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">A recess <b>44</b> in the base <b>11</b><i>b </i>allows for recessing the end of the threaded rod <b>33</b>, the washer <b>42</b> and the nut <b>43</b> from the surface of the base and allow for a flat surface on the bottom of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032;. In the illustrated embodiment, the recess is formed by making a groove approximately &#xbc;&#x2033; (one fourth inch) deep and about 7/16&#x2033; (seven sixteenths inch) wide across the base <b>11</b><i>b </i>in a straight line from approximately the midpoint of one side to the midpoint of the opposite side of the base. The groove is centered over the notches <b>34</b> or <b>34</b><i>v</i>. Using a groove, instead of a more traditional recess, such as, for example, a wide hole around the washer and nut, allows for lower tolerances since the rod can shift in toward the center of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; (providing improved electrical contact with capacitor electrodes) or out toward the edge without having to adjust the recess location. The recessed nut and bolt allow the base to be flat to rest securely on another surface on which it is placed, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The rod <b>33</b> and, if used, the conductive engaging material <b>41</b> are selected so the outer diameter of the rod and engaging material is approximately equal to the width of the notches <b>34</b>. When the rod and engaging material firmly engage the notch and the capacitor components in stacked relation, no or extremely limited movement is possible in the vertical and horizontal directions, helping to keep the entire capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; in the illustrated operational configuration. Also, the base <b>11</b><i>b </i>and top <b>11</b><i>t </i>members protect the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; from physical damage, electrically insulate the top and bottom, and may facilitate securing the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; in a machine or other support structure, case, etc., without damaging what may be more fragile material of the respective capacitor subunits <b>11</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> at the top <b>11</b><i>t </i>are conductive tape or other electrode or electrically conductive members <b>33</b><i>t </i>that may facilitate making electrical connections to the respective rods <b>33</b>. The conductive tape <b>33</b><i>t </i>may be adhered to the top surface and to a front edge <b>37</b> of the top <b>11</b><i>t</i>. The conductive tape <b>33</b><i>t </i>is in electrically conductive engagement with the washer <b>42</b> and nut <b>43</b> of rod <b>33</b>. Electrically conductive screws <b>38</b> may be screwed into the top or front edge <b>37</b> of the top <b>11</b><i>t </i>through each of the conductive tape members <b>33</b><i>t </i>to serve as a terminal connection for wires <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>a </i>for connection of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; in the electrical circuit <b>19</b></p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-17</figref>, various features of the capacitor assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; and components thereof are shown. These features may be employed in the described and illustrated embodiments as well as equivalent structures.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, alternative placement configurations are possible for an electrode <b>16</b> at a sheet <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of a honeycomb structure <b>12</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the electrode <b>16</b> of one capacitor subunit <b>11</b> is oriented about 90 degrees (90&#xb0;) relative to the electrode <b>16</b> of a second capacitor subunit <b>11</b>. The capacitive effect of a capacitor assembly <b>10</b> made from the two illustrated capacitor subunits <b>11</b> would be substantially similar to the effect created by two capacitor subunits <b>11</b> assembled according to the method described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6A</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, alternative electrode <b>16</b> patterns are possible. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the electrode <b>16</b> is provided with a relatively narrower connection tab <b>46</b> than the relatively wider main part of the electrode <b>16</b> that provides input via the honeycomb to the fluid <b>20</b><i>a </i>in the channels <b>20</b>. A relatively narrow tab <b>46</b>, or a similar configuration, may be beneficial to simplify electrical connection of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> to avoid obstructions external of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>. Alternatively, there may be no excess material portion <b>26</b> and instead the tab <b>46</b> may be replaced by a wire electrically connected to the electrode <b>16</b> of desired capacitor subunits <b>11</b> and may extend for electrical connection to an electrical circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the fastening mechanism <b>32</b> may include the use of a conductive bolt or screw <b>32</b><i>s </i>that pierces through the electrode <b>16</b> on the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> and electrically connects to the electrode <b>16</b>. In this manner, the fastening mechanism <b>32</b> may be used to electrically connect the electrodes <b>16</b> of a desired number of capacitor subunits <b>11</b>. For example, a long screw <b>32</b><i>s </i>may be used to connect all of the capacitor subunits <b>11</b> of a capacitor assembly <b>10</b> and in particular provide electrical connection to desired electrodes <b>16</b>. Electrical connection of the electrodes in an electrical circuit <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be provided via the screw <b>32</b><i>s</i>; the screws act as terminals <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In operation a charge may be applied to the electrodes <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>directly via the screws <b>32</b><i>s</i>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the electrodes <b>16</b> may be electrically conductive paint, electrically conductive plating, etc. Such an electrode material may be used in other embodiments hereof. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the screw <b>32</b><i>s </i>pierces and electrically connects with electrically conductive paint <b>16</b> to create an electrical connection between the screw and the conductive paint.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the electrode <b>16</b> is provided with a rounded edge <b>47</b>. Corners create electrical stress points. By eliminating corners on the electrode <b>16</b>, high electrical stress points may be reduced and the possibility for occurrence of undesired corona discharge may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> and as explained above, a capacitor assembly <b>10</b> may be placed in a fluid <b>50</b> for cooling and/or to exclude ionizable fluid from the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is placed into a container <b>51</b> of oil <b>50</b>. The oil enters the passages <b>20</b> and may be selected to have a desired effect on the capacitance of the capacitor assembly, too.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a chart (graph) <b>55</b> illustrates voltage as a function of time of a functioning capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032;. A high voltage from an AC voltage source, e.g., which may be part of the electric circuit <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 20</figref>) or another voltage source (not shown) is applied to the capacitor assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> depicts one full cycle of operation of the voltage v: as the voltage v rises from 0, the capacitor assembly begins to store energy. When the voltage v is approximately equal to the break down voltage v<sub>1 </sub>of the cooling fluid <b>20</b><i>a</i>, e.g., air or other fluid (referred to below as &#x201c;break down voltage&#x201d;), the capacitor could generate a corona discharge in the cooling fluid. Corona discharge may continue in the cooling fluid until the applied voltage v drops below the break down voltage v<sub>1</sub>. If the intersections of the applied voltage v and break down voltage v<sub>1 </sub>lines shown in the drawing are projected onto the time axis t, the time during which the capacitor assembly could generate a corona in each half cycle of the AC input voltage to the capacitor assembly may be calculated and is shown in the chart. Duty cycle is the time per half cycle of the AC input voltage that the capacitor assembly could generate a corona. It is noted that as shown in the illustrated chart, there are two duty cycles in each cycle of the AC input voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; may function as a capacitor or as an ionizer, which may, be determined by adjusting the flow rate of air (or other fluid) flowing through the flow channels <b>20</b>. Whether the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; functions as a capacitor or as an ionizer may be determined by adjusting the flow rate (one complete replenishment of air in the flow channels <b>20</b>) relative to the duty cycle. The time it takes for one complete replenishing of air (or other fluid) in the flow channels also may be referred to as the residence time. If the flow rate is approximately equal to or greater than the duty cycle, the unit <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; functions as a capacitor by blowing out the electrical arc or corona discharge, e.g., because the electrical arc or corona discharge or the start of fluid breakdown and, thus, the tendency to create an electrical arc or corona discharge in the fluid quickly is blown out of the flow channels <b>20</b>. If the flow rate is less than the duty cycle, the unit <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; functions as an ionizer by creating a corona discharge and, thus, ionizing the fluid or at least some of the fluid in the flow channels <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Other factors that may determine whether the capacitor assembly functions as a capacitor or as an ionizer may include, for example, voltages, duty cycle, and/or frequency of the input power supply to the capacitor assembly, the thickness of the honeycomb <b>12</b>, the material of which the honeycomb is made, the dielectric characteristics of the honeycomb and/or the fluid <b>20</b><i>a</i>, the material used for the electrodes <b>16</b>, and possibly other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a fragmentary view of a capacitor assembly <b>10</b> in a capacitor system <b>60</b> is illustrated. The capacitor system <b>60</b> includes the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, blower <b>21</b>, sensors <b>61</b>, and control <b>62</b>. Several of the fluid flow channels <b>20</b><i>b </i>are blocked by suitable blocks, e.g., sheet material, putty, clay, or other material <b>63</b> to block air or other fluid from being blown therethrough by the blower <b>21</b> if those flow channels are not needed for cooling and the electrodes <b>16</b> do not overlie those flow channels. As the blower <b>21</b> blows air or other fluid (or as a pump <b>21</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) pumps fluid), through the unblocked channels <b>20</b>, such flow is directed to the area of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> where the capacitors <b>17</b> are formed and where the fluid may be more needed to provide cooling effect than areas where there is substantially no capacitance, e.g., where electrodes of adjacent capacitor subunits <b>11</b> or <b>11</b>&#x2032; do not have overlap of respective electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As is illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the sensors <b>61</b> include a temperature sensor <b>61</b><i>t</i>, voltage indicator, voltmeter or the like <b>61</b><i>v</i>, and frequency sensor <b>61</b><i>f</i>. If desired, the voltage indicator <b>61</b><i>v </i>may be a device that sets the voltage at which the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is operated or may be a device that measures the voltage across the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, for example, as it is in use in an electrical circuit <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Similarly, the frequency sensor <b>61</b><i>f </i>may be a device that sets the frequency at which the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is operated or may be a device that measures the frequency of the electrical input to the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, for example, as it is in use in an electrical circuit <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The sensors also may include one or more light sensors, such as a photosensor, photocell or other visible light sensor <b>61</b><i>p </i>and a photosensor <b>61</b><i>u </i>for sensing ultraviolet light (also referred to as ultraviolet radiation).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The control <b>62</b> may be a digital control, computer, other electronic circuitry, programmed logic device, etc. to determine operation of at least part of the capacitor system <b>60</b>, for example, as is described below. It will be appreciated that the description with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> may be applied similarly to the other embodiments and illustrations herein. For example, although the description pertains to use of a blower <b>21</b> for blowing air, it will be appreciated that the blower may blow other gas, vapor, or other fluid and/or the pump <b>21</b><i>a </i>may be operated similarly with regard to a fluid, whether liquid, gas, vapor, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">It is possible that during operation of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, there will be the occurrence of an electrical effect, such as corona discharge, electric arc or possibly the tendency to cause ionization of the fluid in the fluid flow channels <b>20</b>. Such electrical effect may have one or more deleterious affects on the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>; several of these, for example, include generating ultraviolet radiation (light) or generating heat. These may cause degradation of material of which the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is made or the overall system or device in which the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> is used. Also, the generating of heat may waste energy due, for example, to the energy used to create the heat and/or the energy needed to provide cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In operation of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> (and also in other drawing figures also as capacitor assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032;, for example), the capacitor assembly is electrically connected in the electrical circuit <b>19</b> to receive electrical charge and to function as an electrical capacitor. The blower <b>21</b> blows air through respective fluid flow passages <b>20</b> to cool the capacitor assembly. The blower speed and/or the volume of cooling air and/or the flow rate of the cooling air may be controlled by the control <b>62</b> that controls operation of the blower speed, output volume, etc. The temperature sensor <b>61</b><i>t </i>may be strategically positioned relative to the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, e.g., at the capacitor area <b>17</b>, at the outlet of one or several flow passages <b>20</b>, or at some other location to detect the temperature of the capacitor assembly or a temperature representative of the capacitor assembly, thereby to determine in effect the heating that is occurring during operation. The control may respond to such temperature detection and, accordingly may be programmed to effect appropriate operation of the blower <b>21</b> to maintain a given temperature, to avoid exceeding a maximum temperature, to effect a given amount of cooling, etc. For example, if the detected temperature were to exceed a predetermined level, the blower <b>21</b> may be operated by the control <b>62</b> to increase the cooling of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>. As was mentioned above, corona discharge, electrical arcing, and ionization tend to occur more easily at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures, and the occurrence thereof may tend to cause a further temperature increase of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>. By increasing the cooling of the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, the extent of such corona discharge, arcing and/or ionization can be decreased as will be their contribution to heating. As the temperature decreases, the control <b>62</b> may reduce the blower output speed, air flow output, etc. and, thus, reduce power requirements of the capacitor system <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In the present invention, if it were desired to eliminate ionization of fluid in the flow passages <b>20</b> or at least to try to reduce or to minimize the occurrence of such ionization, the blower output <b>21</b> may be adjusted manually or automatically by the control <b>62</b> to ensure that the flow rate of fluid in the flow through channels <b>20</b> would be relatively fast so that any electrical arc, corona discharge or ionization that would tend to occur in the channel would be quickly blown out of the channel. As an example, since the electrical input to the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> ordinarily would be an alternating current (AC) voltage of a given frequency, ionization of fluid in the channels <b>20</b> could be minimized or avoided by using a flow rate through the channels that is at least as fast as or faster than the duration of the duty cycle of the AC voltage. According to this example, if the AC signal were at 60 Hertz, one half cycle requires about eight milliseconds; and if the duty cycle were a duration of about one half of each half cycle of the input voltage, then the flow through the channels <b>20</b> would be at a speed that takes approximately less than 4 milliseconds to change the air in each channel or faster. This fast speed of flow represents the residence time for fluid in the channels, and tends to minimize the exposure of fluid in the channels <b>20</b> to a voltage that is at or above the breakdown voltage of the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the voltage detector <b>61</b><i>v </i>may be used to detect the voltage being applied to the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> and to provide an input to the control <b>62</b> to adjust the blower <b>21</b> according to the detected voltage. For example, a higher voltage ordinarily would cause increased heating and, thus, the desire for increased fluid flow provided by the blower. Still further, if the voltage detector <b>61</b><i>v </i>were instead a voltage setting device to limit the voltage drop across the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, that voltage setting could be provided to the control <b>62</b> to provide desired operation of the blower to provide fluid output according to the given voltage setting. Similarly, the frequency detector <b>61</b><i>f </i>may be used to detect frequency of the signal on the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>, e.g., in an inductor capacitor resonant circuit or in some other circuit. Usually heating in a capacitor increases with increased frequency; and the blower <b>21</b> may be controlled by the control <b>62</b> according to either detected frequency and/or according to the set frequency (the latter if the frequency detector were used to set the frequency of the signal applied to the capacitor assembly <b>10</b>). The occurrence of corona discharge or electric arcing in the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> would tend to create visible light or ultraviolet light. The light sensors <b>61</b><i>p</i>, <b>61</b><i>u </i>may sense the occurrence of such light and provide an input to the control <b>62</b> to cause it to operate the blower <b>21</b> to increase flow through the channels <b>20</b> to reduce such electric arcing or corona discharge, and then the amount of such light likely would decrease, the decrease would be detected by the sensors <b>61</b><i>p </i>and/or <b>61</b><i>u</i>, and the control may accordingly operate the blower <b>21</b> to reduce flow output. The control <b>62</b> may be programmed, set adjusted, etc. to respond to inputs from the various sensors and/or by a user to adjust fluid flow to provide desired operation of the capacitor assembly as a capacitor or as an ionizer and to determine various operating parameters, e.g., voltage, frequency, cooling, operating temperatures, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Briefly referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, a capacitor assembly <b>70</b>, which is similar to the capacitor assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032;, etc., described herein, includes a single honeycomb structure <b>12</b>, electrodes <b>16</b> and top <b>11</b><i>t </i>and bottom <b>11</b><i>b</i>. Operation may be as was described above. The honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is used as a structural member by which the capacitor assembly <b>70</b> may be attached to another supporting mechanism <b>71</b> from which the capacitor assembly is mounted. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> screws <b>72</b> and standoffs <b>73</b> may be used to space the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> from the supporting mechanism. Thus, the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> has adequate strength to provide support of the capacitor assembly from the supporting member <b>71</b>. Being mountable as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the capacitor assembly <b>10</b> can be placed in many different locations for various uses to provide the desired functions thereof. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is oriented laterally, e.g., generally parallel, with respect to the surface <b>74</b> of the wall <b>71</b> or other supporting mechanism. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> the honeycomb structure <b>12</b> is suspended vertically from the supporting mechanism <b>71</b> using a bracket <b>75</b> and screws <b>76</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref> show only a single honeycomb structure <b>12</b> and associated electrodes <b>16</b>, it will be appreciated that the capacitor assemblies shown may include a stack of capacitor subunits <b>11</b>, <b>11</b>&#x2032;, etc., as was described above; and the honeycomb structures thereof may provide the structural support member, as was described just above, for the capacitor assembly.</p>
