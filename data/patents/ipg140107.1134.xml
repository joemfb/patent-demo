<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under all applicable rules and statutes to International Application No. PCT/GB2008/003201, filed Sep. 22, 2008, and entitled A FLUID INJECTOR HAVING A REED VALVE, which claims priority to GB 0718371.8 filed 20 Sep. 2007, and GB 0814982.5 filed 15 Aug. 2008, incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a fluid injector having a reed valve, the fluid injector being suitable for injecting gasoline fuel into charge air in an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most internal combustion engines in automobiles currently use fuel injection systems to supply fuel to the combustion chambers of the engine. Fuel injection systems have replaced the earlier technology of carburettors because they give more control of delivery of fuel and enable the engine to meet emission legislation targets as well as improving the overall efficiency of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some fuel injectors in current use include a positive displacement pump and one or more one-way valves. A one-way valve may be located at a fuel outlet from the fuel injector, in order to allow fuel to be dispensed from the fuel injector and prevent fuel from returning into the fuel chamber. It is known to use a reed valve as a one-way valve. The reed valve may be a thin flexible strip which is secured at one end. The other end of the blade lies over a fuel outlet. Applied fluid pressure causes the strip to flex and open outwardly, allowing fuel to be dispensed. The reed valve blade closes again due to the resilience of the strip when the pressure decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known reed valves have the disadvantage that the selection of opening characteristics of the reed valve blades is restricted by the small size of the fuel injector.</p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">The reed valve blade may therefore not open as quickly as desired and/or does not open as wide as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides, a fluid injector comprising:</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present invention relates to a fluid injector having a reed valve. The fluid injector is for use in an internal combustion engine comprising a cylinder in which reciprocates a piston, with the cylinder and piston defining between them a combustion chamber. The engine is preferably a simple engine, e.g. a single cylinder engine of, for instance, a lawn mower or other garden equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The engine has a fuel injection system comprising a fluid injector according to the present invention arranged to deliver gasoline fuel into an inlet passage upstream of an inlet valve. A throttle valve is placed in the inlet passage to throttle the flow of charge air into the combustion chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a fluid injector <b>19</b> with a piston <b>30</b> located in a fluid pumping chamber, <b>36</b>. A fluid inlet <b>42</b> is provided for fluid to enter the fluid injector <b>19</b> and flow into a fuel passage passing through a piston <b>30</b>. A one-way inlet valve <b>35</b> controls flow of fluid from the inlet passage the pumping chamber <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An electrical coil <b>32</b> is provided in the injector along with an associated back-iron <b>33</b> for generating a field which pulls the piston <b>30</b> downwardly (as shown) when the electrical coil <b>32</b> is energised, to increase the volume of pumping chamber <b>36</b>. A piston spring <b>34</b> biases the piston <b>30</b> away from the back-iron <b>33</b> and when the electrical coil is de-energised the spring <b>34</b> forces the piston <b>30</b> to reduce the volume of the pumping chamber <b>36</b> and thereby expel fluid from the pumping chamber <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Fluid is dispensed from the pumping chamber <b>36</b> to a fluid outlet <b>37</b> via a one-way outlet valve <b>38</b>. The operation of the fuel injector <b>19</b> will be described further with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 11</figref><i>b </i>show in detail the one-way inlet reed valve of the fuel injector.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show a reed valve <b>60</b> comprising three independent reed valve blades <b>61</b>. Each of the reed valve blades <b>61</b> has a valve head <b>62</b> and a spring arm <b>64</b> extending from the valve head <b>62</b>. The three reed valve blades <b>61</b> all extend from a surrounding annular support <b>66</b>. The reed valve blades are each shaped like a comma, with a circular valve head providing a sealing surface and a curved spring arm extending from the valve head in a swirl-like manner. The curved shape is needed to achieve a desired length of spring arm (a certain length is needed to ensure that the arm provides a desired spring force and a desired range of motion of the valve head whilst not overstretching).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The reed valve <b>60</b> is formed from a thin plate of an elastically deformable material, e.g. metal, in particular stainless steel. At rest, the three reed valve blades <b>61</b> and rim <b>66</b> lie in the same plane. At rest, the valve heads <b>62</b> and arms <b>64</b> of each reed valve blade <b>61</b> also extend in the same plane.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The valve head <b>62</b> and spring arm <b>64</b> of each reed valve blade <b>61</b> are integrally formed. The annular support <b>66</b> is integrally formed with the spring arms <b>64</b> of the reed valve blades <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The arm <b>64</b> of each reed valve blade <b>61</b> extends from a radially inner surface of the annular rim <b>66</b>. The three arms <b>64</b> are equally spaced around the circumference of the annular support <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The arms <b>64</b> are curved in the plane (at rest) of the valve heads <b>62</b>. The arms <b>64</b> extend adjacent to the annular support <b>66</b>. Each arm <b>64</b> subtends an angle of approximately 90&#xb0; of the circumference of the rim. Alternatively, the or each arm <b>64</b> can extend across an arc of 30&#xb0;, 110&#xb0; or 150&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Each valve head <b>62</b> is substantially disc-shaped. Each valve head <b>62</b> has a diameter larger than the width of the spring arm <b>64</b> to which it is attached. Each valve head <b>62</b> extends radially inwardly of a respective spring arm <b>64</b>, i.e. the spring arms <b>64</b> are connected to the valve heads <b>66</b> at a radially outward parts of the valve heads <b>62</b>. Each valve head <b>62</b> and attached arm <b>64</b> together form a comma-shaped reed valve blade <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Each of the reed valve blades <b>61</b> is independently operable. The opening and closing characteristics of the reed valve will depend on the resilience of the arms <b>64</b>. The curvature of the arms <b>64</b> means that the arms <b>64</b> have a long length relative to the overall size of the reed valve <b>60</b>. The curvature of the arms <b>64</b> allows them to be located substantially parallel and alongside the annular rim <b>62</b>. This allows three valve heads to be packaged within a small overall area, each having a relatively long arm <b>64</b> to provide a good opening characteristics. Each spring arm <b>64</b> has a length greater than a largest dimension of its associated valve head <b>62</b>. Each spring arm <b>64</b> has a width uniform along its length.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The annular support <b>66</b> is provided with an alignment protrusion <b>68</b> extending radially outwardly. The alignment protrusion <b>68</b> can engage in a notch to ensure that the reed valve <b>60</b> is properly orientated. The alignment protrusion <b>68</b> also inhibits rotation of the reed valve <b>60</b> during use.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show a piston body <b>70</b> forming a part of the piston of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The piston body <b>70</b> has a fluid passage <b>72</b> through which flows fluid from inlet port <b>74</b> to three outlet orifices <b>76</b>. The outlet orifices <b>76</b> open onto a stepped recess forming a valve seat <b>78</b> and a cap seat <b>80</b>. The reed valve <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> is received on the valve seat <b>78</b>. The alignment protrusion <b>68</b> is received in the alignment recess <b>79</b>. The valve heads <b>62</b> are aligned one each with the orifices <b>76</b>. A cap, as will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> is received in the cap seat <b>80</b> to secure the reed valve <b>60</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> show a cap <b>84</b> for attaching to the piston body <b>70</b> to keep the reed valve <b>60</b> in position. The cap <b>84</b> is formed of a plate <b>86</b> having three apertures <b>88</b>. The apertures <b>88</b> are aligned with the orifices <b>76</b> in the piston body <b>70</b>, and with the valve heads <b>62</b>. The apertures <b>88</b> have a diameter larger than the valve head <b>62</b>. The plate <b>86</b> is provided with an annular flange <b>90</b>. The annular flange <b>90</b> contacts the annular support <b>66</b> of the reed valve <b>60</b>, and is located in the valve seat <b>78</b>. The cap <b>84</b> as well as holding the reed valve <b>60</b> in place also prevents the spring arms overstretching. The reed valve <b>60</b> is sandwiched between the valve seat and the cap <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Alternatively, the cap <b>84</b> may be an annular ring defining a single aperture, extending around the periphery of the reed valve <b>60</b>. Fluid flowing from each of the outlet orifices <b>76</b> would pass through the single aperture. The cap <b>84</b> would still retain the reed valve blade assembly in place, and would not limit movement of the reed valve heads.</p>

The location and number of outlet orifices <b>76</b> will be varied to ensure that the or each valve head is operable to open and close a respective orifice in the valve seat. The location and size of the or each aperture <b>88</b> in the cap <b>84</b> may need to be varied to ensure fuel flow through the reed valve when the or each orifice is open.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b </i>show a reed valve <b>160</b> comprising three independent reed valve blades. Each of the reed valve blades <b>161</b> has a valve head <b>162</b> and a resilient curved spring arm <b>164</b>. The reed valve <b>160</b> has an annular support <b>166</b> surrounding the reed valve blades <b>161</b>, the three reed valve blades <b>161</b> extending inwardly from the annular support <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The reed valve blades <b>161</b> are each shaped like a comma, having a circular head <b>162</b> and a curved spring arm <b>164</b>. As each spring arm <b>164</b> joins a head <b>162</b> it is substantially aligned with a diameter of the valve head <b>162</b>. This contrasts with the valve blades <b>61</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, where the arm <b>64</b> joins to the valve head <b>66</b> tangentially to a diameter of the valve head <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>show a third embodiment of a reed valve <b>260</b>. The reed valve <b>260</b> comprises three independent reed valve blades <b>261</b> each having a circular valve head <b>262</b> and a resilient curved spring arm <b>264</b>. The reed blade <b>260</b> has an annular support surrounding the three reed valve blades <b>261</b> from which the curved spring arms <b>264</b> extend inwardly. The curved arms are longer than in the other described embodiments. Each spring arm <b>264</b> extends approximately 180&#xb0; around a periphery of an associated valve head <b>262</b>, to partially encircle the head <b>262</b>. Each spring arm <b>264</b> is joined to an associated valve head <b>262</b> at a side opposite to the side facing the point at which the spring arm <b>264</b> join the annular support <b>266</b>. The reed valve blades <b>261</b> are arranged to extend substantially circumferentially alongside the inner surface of the annular support <b>266</b>, which allows packaging of the three blades <b>261</b> within the annular support <b>266</b>. The long spring arms <b>264</b> provide a spring rate suitable for control of opening of the valve heads <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>show a fourth embodiment of reed valve <b>360</b>. The reed valve <b>360</b> comprises a single reed valve blade <b>361</b> having a valve head <b>362</b> and two resilient curved spring arms <b>364</b>. Each of the curved spring arms <b>364</b> is joined to an annular support <b>366</b> which surrounds the valve blades <b>361</b>.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Each of the spring arms <b>364</b> lies alongside and partially encircles the head <b>362</b>, each spring arm <b>364</b> subtending an angle of approximately 150&#xb0;. The spring arms <b>364</b> extend on opposite sides of the circular head <b>361</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The presence of two spring arms for a single head means that the head <b>362</b> lifts straight up from a valve seat, and remains in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of an orifice defined by the valve seat. This contrasts with the embodiments having a single arm per head, in which resilient bending of the curved arm means that the valve head is lifted at an angle to the valve seat.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>show a fifth embodiment of a reed valve <b>460</b>. The reed valve <b>460</b> comprises three independent reed valve blades <b>461</b>. Each of the reed valve blades <b>461</b> has a valve head <b>462</b> and a resilient straight spring arm <b>464</b>. The reed valve <b>460</b> has an annular support <b>466</b> surrounding the reed valve blades <b>461</b>, the three reed valve blades <b>461</b> extending inwardly from the reed valve <b>466</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At the point that each spring arm <b>464</b> joins its respective valve head <b>462</b> it is aligned with a diameter of the valve head.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Each spring arm <b>464</b> connects a respective valve head <b>462</b> to a point on the rim spaced apart circumferentially from the nearest point of the annular support to the valve head <b>462</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">During operation as the piston <b>30</b> moves to draw fuel into the fuel chamber the spring arms of the valve blades allow the valve heads to move out of engagement with the valve seat to open the orifices in the valve seat and allow fuel flow. Then when the piston comes to a stop the elasticity in the spring arms returns the valve heads into engagement with the valve seat to close the orifices. During movement of the piston to expel fuel from the fuel chamber both the elasticity of the spring arms and also the pressure differential across the reed valve will keep the valve heads in firm engagement with the valve seat and the orifices in the valve seat remain closed. The cycle will then begin again.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Testing has shown that the reed valves described above performs better than the known disc valves. Partly this is because they close automatically under the spring force in a no flow situation. They achieve a higher operating speed and a better efficiency. The valves improve flow area and gives a smoother flow path (the fluid does not have to flow right around the periphery of a disc); this more than makes up for the initial resistance to opening occasioned by the spring force. The valves in any event improve expulsion of fluid from the chamber by shutting quicker. The reed valves are easy to manufacture.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A cylinder head <b>1408</b> is clamped to the cylinder block <b>1403</b> by bolts such as <b>1409</b>. The cylinder head <b>1408</b> has a fluid inlet passage <b>1410</b> therethrough which terminates in an annular gallery <b>1411</b> in the cylinder head <b>1408</b>. The cylinder block <b>1408</b> also has a fluid outlet passage <b>1412</b> which opens on to a lower surface of the cylinder head <b>1408</b> at a point radially central to the annular gallery <b>1411</b>. A one-way outlet valve <b>1413</b> is formed by a valve seat <b>1414</b> secured in a recess in a top surface of the cylinder head <b>1408</b> and by a valve member <b>1415</b> biased into abutment with the valve seat <b>145</b> by a valve spring <b>1416</b> which acts between the member <b>1415</b> and a spring seat <b>1417</b> which is provided by an externally threaded member threadably engaged in a cap <b>1418</b> secured to the valve head, with the pre-load of spring <b>1416</b> set by rotating the spring seat <b>1417</b> relative to the cap <b>1418</b>. The one-way valve <b>1413</b> controls flows of fluid through the outlet passage <b>1412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Defined between the piston <b>1401</b>, the cylinder <b>1402</b> and the cylinder head <b>14</b> is a pumping chamber <b>1420</b>. Controlling flow of fluid into the pumping chamber <b>1420</b> is a reed valve <b>1500</b>, shown in situ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>and <b>15</b><i>c</i>. The reed valve <b>1500</b> has an annular support <b>1501</b>, an annular valve head <b>1505</b> and three spring arms <b>1502</b>, <b>1503</b> and <b>1504</b> which extend between the annular support <b>1501</b> and the annular valve head <b>1505</b>. The spring arms extend from radially inward points on the annular support <b>1501</b> spaced 120&#xb0; apart around the annular support <b>1501</b>. The spring arms each extend through an arc of approximately 180&#xb0;, with the point at which each spring arm joins the annular valve head <b>1505</b> lying approximately diametrically across from the point on the valve head <b>1505</b> nearest the location of the joining point of the spring arm with the annular support. The reed valve <b>1500</b> is formed out of a single sheet of metal.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The reed valve <b>1500</b> is secured in place between the insert <b>1402</b> and the cylinder head <b>1408</b>, with the annular valve head <b>1505</b> aligned with the annular galley <b>1411</b>. The valve head <b>1505</b> is sprung by the spring arms <b>1502</b>, <b>1503</b> and <b>1504</b> to a position in which it seals off the annular galley <b>1411</b> and hence the fluid inlet to the pumping chamber <b>1420</b>. When the piston <b>1401</b> slides under influence of the field generated by coil <b>1404</b> to increase the volume of the pumping chamber <b>1420</b>, then reed valve <b>1500</b> will open by the annular valve head <b>1505</b> opening the annular galley <b>1411</b> to the chamber <b>1420</b>. Then, when the spring <b>1406</b> slides the piston <b>1401</b> to reduce in volume the chamber <b>1420</b> (once the field generated by coil <b>1404</b> has died away), the reed valve <b>1500</b> will close to prevent fluid flowing back out of pumping chamber <b>1420</b> to the inlet <b>1410</b>, whilst the outlet valve <b>1413</b> opens to allow fluid to be expelled from the pumping chamber <b>1420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The flow of fluid from an annular inlet to the pumping chamber <b>1420</b> to a central outlet <b>1412</b> gives good flow characteristics. The location of the fluid inlet in the cylinder head <b>1408</b>, rather than in the piston (as described in previous embodiments), keeps the fluid away from the heat generated by the coil <b>1404</b> in operation. Indeed the head <b>1408</b> can be cooled easily. The annular galley <b>1411</b> gives a large flow inlet area, which is also advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The rim surrounding the or each valve blade has been described as annular. Alternatively, the rim may form an ellipse, square, or other regular or non-regular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The valve heads in the above embodiments have been described as substantially circular. Alternatively, the valve heads may be triangular in shape. In one embodiment, three triangular heads may be provided. Each triangular head defines a sector covering just under a third of a circle, and located within an annular rim. A curved arm joins each head to the rim, each curved arm extending substantially circumferentially around the radially outer edge of each head. The apertures in the valve seat may also be triangular in this embodiment. Alternatively, any of the apertures described may be non-circular, i.e. square, rectangular.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In each of the above embodiments the curved arm extends both circumferentially and radially to connect the or each valve head to the rim. For an annular support, the or each spring arm connects a respective valve head to a point on the annular support circumferentially spaced from the point of the annular support closest to where the spring arm meets the valve head. In other words, applicable to a non-circular rim or support, each spring arm connects a respective valve head to a point on the rim spaced apart peripherally from a point of intersection of a line extending from the centre of the rim through the centre of that valve head. This provides for good packaging of one or more valve heads within a certain overall area.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The spring arm in some embodiments extends inwardly from the support into proximity with the valve head, and extends proximal to and spaced apart from the valve head around part of the circumference of the valve head before joining with the valve head. Preferably, the spring arm is proximal to and spaced apart from the valve head for substantially half of the circumference of the valve head.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As an alternative the reed valve blades are arranged on a conical or frustro-conical end surface of a piston, such that the reed valve blades starts with a pre-load which can improve closing of the blades. Alternatively, the reed valve assembly of any of the above described embodiments may be located at the end of an inwardly tapered channel. The tapering of the channel increases the pressure, improving the opening of the blades.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The valve seat of any of the embodiments may be provided with a flange around each the orifices <b>76</b>. The reed valve head(s) contact the respective flange, and so are spaced apart from the remainder of the valve seat when closed. This may improve sealing of the reed valve heads against the valve seat.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The reed valves of any of the embodiments may be formed with a deformation out of the plane of the annular support, such that at rest they are biased against the valve seat. Such reed valves would therefore be pre-loaded against the opening forces. This would also counter plastic deformation of the reed valves during use, which tends to bend the reed valves upwardly, i.e. away from the valve seat.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In an alternate embodiment, the cap or securing ring may be integrally formed with the piston body, and the valve seat formed as a separate component. The valve seat may be secured in place by the spring which also actuates movement of the piston to expel fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Where in this specification, including the claims, reference is made to &#x2018;comma-shaped&#x2019; this does not require the valve head to be circular in shape and must be read as permitting the valve head to have any shape. The term comma-shaped is used to denote a shape comprising a head portion extending from which is a curved tail.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The reed valves above has been described as having three reed valve blades. Alternatively, four reed valve blades may be located within each annular support.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Any feature of any embodiment may be used with or present in any other embodiment.</p>
