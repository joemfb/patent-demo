<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus, an information processing method, and a program.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A user authentication technique using biometric information, i.e., information unique to a living body, such as a fingerprint and a finger vein is widely used. For example, when a user logs in to a certain system or apparatus such as an operating system controlling a personal computer (PC), a method for inputting a user account name and a password has been used in general. Nowadays, however, biometric information of the user in association with an account name is registered in advance, and the user can log in to a corresponding account by just presenting the biometric information of the user (for example, see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 2003-150557, 2006-163875, 2007-34521, and 2007-226293). In these systems, it is assumed that respectively different pieces of biometric information are registered to respectively different accounts in order to distinguish combinations of accounts and biometric information.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Now, a home PC is considered, for example. It is quite usual that a user having an administrator account of this PC is the same as a user having a user account for normally using a PC. Therefore, for example, in biometric authentication using a fingerprint and a finger vein, different pieces of biometric information are usually registered as follows. A user registers an index finger of the right hand to an administrator account, a middle finger of the left hand to an ordinary account, and another finger to a different account. In this case, the user has to remember which finger corresponds to which account, which increases the burden on the user. Therefore, there is an issue in that the convenience is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, biometric authentication methods include not only the method using fingerprints and the like but also a method using one unique portion existing on a living body such as a method using an image of a face. In this case, there is basically only one type of biometric information usable by one person. Therefore, it is difficult to register and present different biometric information for each account, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention addresses the above-identified, and other issues associated with the methods and apparatuses in the related art, and provides an information processing apparatus, an information processing method, and a program allowing a user to easily log in to one of a plurality of user accounts possessed by the user using one piece of biometric information.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an information processing apparatus including a biometric authentication unit that authenticates one piece of biometric information based on registered biometric information, and a login processing unit that selects, based on user specification information for specifying user information used for login processing, one of the plurality of pieces of user information associated with the biometric information successfully authenticated by the biometric authentication unit so that the login processing unit uses the selected one of the plurality of pieces of user information to perform the login processing. The one piece of biometric information is image information unique to a living body, and a plurality of pieces of user information are associated with the one piece of biometric information, and the registered biometric information is biometric information registered in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When operation for switching user information is performed, the login processing unit may determine whether biometric information associated with new user information is the same as biometric information associated with current user information, and when the biometric information associated with the new user information is determined to be the same as the biometric information associated with the current user information, the login processing unit may perform login processing using the new user information without performing authentication processing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a case where newly registered user information is specified to be associated with already registered biometric information during registration of the new user information, the biometric authentication unit may associate the already registered biometric information with the newly generated user information when newly obtained biometric information and the already registered biometric information are successfully authenticated.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the already registered biometric information is associated with the newly registered user information, the biometric authentication unit may also generate the user specification information to be referred to during login processing using the registered biometric information.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The login processing unit may display, on a display screen, an object representing a plurality of pieces of user information associated with the biometric information successfully authenticated, and may adopt, as the user specification information, information identifying the user information selected by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The user information preferentially used for login processing may be previously set as the user specification information.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">User specification information may include additional operation information about additionally-performed operation during login processing using predetermined user information, and the login processing unit may select the user information based on whether the additional operation is performed or not during the login processing.</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">&#x3c;Configuration of Information Processing Apparatus&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0045">First, a configuration of an information processing apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of the information processing apparatus according to the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating an example of user information in the information processing apparatus of the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0046">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment mainly includes a login processing unit <b>101</b>, an imaging control unit <b>103</b>, a biometric imaging unit <b>105</b>, a biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b>, a biometric authentication unit <b>109</b>, a display control unit <b>115</b>, a communication unit <b>117</b>, and a storage unit <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0047">The login processing unit <b>101</b> according to the present embodiment is realized with, for example, a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a ROM (Read Only Memory), a RAM (Random Access Memory), and the like. For example, when the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> is turned on or a biometric portion of a user is located at a predetermined position of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>, the login processing unit <b>101</b> performs login processing in order to allow the user to use various functions and services provided by the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0048">It should be noted that the login processing unit <b>101</b> can perform login processing using identification information and a password for distinguishing a user such as a user ID in the same manner as the related art. However, in the explanation below, login processing using biometric authentication processing performed by the login processing unit <b>101</b> will be explained in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0049">The login processing performed by the login processing unit <b>101</b> is carried out based on a biometric authentication result given by the later-explained biometric authentication unit <b>109</b>. The login processing unit <b>101</b> performs login processing in a case where an authentication result indicating success of biometric authentication is notified from the biometric authentication unit <b>109</b>. The login processing unit <b>101</b> outputs an error and does not perform login processing in a case where an authentication result indicating failure of biometric authentication is notified.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0050">Further, when a user performs operation to request start of generation of an account, the login processing unit <b>101</b> starts generation of user information as described later in cooperation with each processing unit of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0051">First, the processing of generating user information will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0052">When the user performs operation to request start of generation of an account, the login processing unit <b>101</b> starts processing of generating user information as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example. As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the user information includes an account ID, i.e., identification information uniquely given to user information, an authority given to a user corresponding to user information, and a password for proving the user to be an authentic user. Alternatively, when the user requests login processing using biometric authentication, the later-explained biometric authentication unit <b>109</b> registers biometric information (image information unique to a living body), and information representing a storage location of this registered biometric information is associated with user information. The information representing the storage location of this registered biometric information may be a memory address of a memory (secure memory) storing registered biometric information as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example, or may be a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and the like representing a storage location.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0053">Further, the number of pieces of user information allowed to be generated for each user is not limited to one piece. One user may have one piece of user information, or a plurality of pieces of user information according to a executable authority and an environment and the like in which the information processing apparatus is used.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0054">Herein, in the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment, a plurality of pieces of user information can be associated with one piece of biometric information. Accordingly, when the user who requests generation of an account ID &#x201c;DDDD&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> uses registered biometric information associated with the account ID &#x201c;AAAA&#x201d; for the account ID &#x201c;DDDD&#x201d;, each piece of user information contains information representing the same storage location. Thus, the user can have the plurality of pieces of user information associated with one piece of biometric information.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0055">The user information as described above is generated by the login processing unit <b>101</b>, and is stored in the later-explained storage unit <b>119</b> and the like. The user can thus possess the accounts for the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment. It should be noted that the user information may be stored in the storage unit <b>119</b> and the like in a manner as shown in an account management table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or may be stored in the storage unit <b>119</b> and the like in a database manner. Alternatively, the user information may be stored in a server and the like arranged externally, instead of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0056">Subsequently, the login processing of the user will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0057">When a biometric portion of the user is located at a predetermined position of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>, the login processing unit <b>101</b> requests the later-explained imaging control unit <b>103</b> to start taking an image of the predetermined biometric portion. Thereby, the biometric authentication using the predetermined biometric portion is started. Herein, examples of biometric authentications carried out by the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment include various kinds of biometric authentications such as fingerprint authentication, vein authentication, face authentication, iris authentication, and voiceprint authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0058">When the biometric authentication processing is started, the login processing unit <b>101</b> waits for a notification of an authentication result of the biometric authentication processing from the later-explained biometric authentication unit <b>109</b>. When a failure of biometric information authentication is notified from the biometric authentication unit <b>109</b>, the login processing unit <b>101</b> causes the later-explained display control unit <b>115</b> to display a message and the like indicating failure of authentication on a display unit (not shown), and terminates the login processing. When a success of biometric information authentication is notified from the biometric authentication unit <b>109</b>, user information associated with registered biometric information determined to be similar to the biometric information is used to perform the login processing.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0059">Herein, one piece of registered biometric information is associated with a plurality of pieces of user information, and there may be a case where the biometric authentication unit <b>109</b> notifies that the registered biometric information similar to the biometric information used for the authentication is associated with a plurality of pieces of user information. In this case, the login processing unit <b>101</b> refers to an account ID of the user information associated with the successfully authenticated registered biometric information notified by the biometric authentication unit <b>109</b>. Thereafter, the login processing unit <b>101</b> causes the later-explained display control unit <b>115</b> to display a list and the like of accounts available for login on the display unit using objects such as icons and to display a message asking the user which account is used for login.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0060">When the user selects an account for login, information identifying the account selected by the user is used as user specification information, i.e., information for specifying user information used for login processing. The login processing unit <b>101</b> performs the login processing using an account specified by the user (i.e., user information) based on this user specification information.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0061">As described above, in the login processing to the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment, when the user having biometric information registered performs login processing, the user can start the login processing by just scanning the biometric portion over the information processing apparatus. Thus, the user does not have to perform operation such as inputting the account ID and the password in the same manner as the related art. On the other hand, when a plurality of accounts (user information) are associated with one piece of biometric information, a list of accounts available for login is displayed, and a user is prompted to make a selection. Therefore, a user having a plurality of accounts can perform the login processing in a simpler manner.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0062">Subsequently, a switching processing (account switching processing) of user information will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0063">For example, in a home PC and the like, an ordinary user authority is sufficient for everyday works. However, when a work for installing an application is performed, a processing in an account having an administrator authority may be required in some case. In such occasion, when the currently used account is authenticated by the login processing using biometric authentication processing, the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment performs switching processing of an account as shown below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0064">It is assumed that while the user is logged in to the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>, the user performs operation to switch the account, and specifies user information of a new account (for example, account ID and the like) to which the current account is to be switched. At this occasion, the login processing unit <b>101</b> determines whether registered biometric information associated with the user information of the account currently being logged in is the same as registered biometric information associated with user information of the new account. When the registered biometric information is determined to be the same, the login processing unit <b>101</b> performs login processing again using the user information of the new account without performing the biometric authentication processing for authenticating the user information of the new account.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0065">When the registered biometric information of the current account is determined not to be the same as the registered biometric information of the new account, the login processing unit <b>101</b> requests start of biometric authentication processing for authenticating the user information of the new account, and performs the same processing as the normal login processing using the biometric authentication processing.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0066">As described above, in the switching method of the account according to the present embodiment, the processing making use of the feature of the biometric information being unique to the user is carried out. More specifically, the login processing unit <b>101</b> uses biometric authentication for the login processing of the currently used account, and when both of the current account and the new account are associated with the same registered biometric information, the login processing unit <b>101</b> performs switching of the account without performing the biometric authentication processing again. Therefore, the user of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> can switch the account in a simpler manner, and the convenience for the user can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0067">The registration processing of user information, the login processing, and the switching processing of the account as described above will be explained later in detail again.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0068">Subsequently, the imaging control unit <b>103</b> will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0069">The imaging control unit <b>103</b> is realized with, for example, a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, and the like. The imaging control unit <b>103</b> controls the later-explained biometric imaging unit <b>105</b> to generate image data (biometric image data) used for extracting biometric information. Thereafter, the imaging control unit <b>103</b> causes the later-explained biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> to output biometric image data generated by the biometric imaging unit <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0070">It should be noted that the imaging control unit <b>103</b> may cause the later-explained storage unit <b>119</b> to record the generated image data. When the image data are recorded in the storage unit <b>119</b>, the imaging control unit <b>103</b> may associate the generated image data with a date, a time, and the like when the image data are taken. It should be noted that the generated biometric image data may be an RGB (Red-Green-Blue) signal, or may be image data in other colors or image data such as grayscale.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0071">Under the control of the imaging control unit <b>103</b>, the biometric imaging unit <b>105</b> takes an image of a biometric portion B located at a predetermined position of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>, and generates biometric image data. This biometric imaging unit <b>105</b> has an imaging optical unit (not shown) for taking an image of the biometric portion B. Further, when the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment performs biometric authentication processing which requires a special light source such as vein authentication processing, the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> may further include a light source unit (not shown) for emitting light having a predetermined wavelength to the biometric portion B.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0072">The imaging optical unit includes imaging devices such as a CCD (Charge Coupled Devices) and a CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) and an optical system constituted by optical devices such as lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0073">The optical system constituting the imaging optical unit includes one or a plurality of optical devices and one or a plurality of imaging devices. The optical system of the imaging optical unit according to the present embodiment may be an optical system for imaging the biometric portion, or an optical system already existing may be used as the optical system for imaging the biometric portion. For example, when the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment is implemented in a portable apparatus such as a portable telephone, an optical system already implemented on the portable apparatus may be used as the optical system for imaging the biometric portion.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0074">The biometric imaging unit <b>105</b> outputs the biometric image data generated by the imaging optical unit to the later-explained biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0075">The biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> is realized with, for example, a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, and the like. The biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> extracts biometric information using the biometric image data transmitted from the biometric imaging unit <b>105</b>. For example, this biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> has a function of extracting biometric information. In addition, the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> may have, as necessary, a function of performing preprocessing for extracting biometric information and a function of performing postprocessing on extracted biometric information.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0076">Examples of preprocessing include a processing for extracting an outline and the like of biometric portion from biometric image data and determining where in the biometric image data the biometric portion is located. Another example of preprocessing is a processing for rotating biometric image data within a plane using an outline and the like of a detected biometric portion and correcting an angle of the biometric image data. Another example of preprocessing is a processing for removing noise overlapped on biometric image data.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0077">The biometric information is extracted according to various methods suitable for biometric information to be extracted. Such extraction methods include various kinds of methods suggested according to the types of biometric information to be extracted such as fingerprint authentication, vein authentication, face authentication, iris authentication, and voiceprint authentication, and the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment can use any method according to biometric information to be extracted. The biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> uses this extraction processing of biometric information to extract biometric information characterizing an imaged biometric portion (i.e., user). Examples of such biometric information include a position of a branching point or an end point of a fingerprint in fingerprint authentication, positions of an end point, a branching point, and a bending point of a vein in vein authentication, a position of a feature point such as an eye, a nose, and a mouth in face authentication, an iris code in iris authentication, a voiceprint in voiceprint authentication, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0078">The biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> transmits the thus extracted biometric information to the later-explained biometric authentication unit <b>109</b>. Further, the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> may store extracted biometric information in the later-explained storage unit <b>119</b> and the like. It should be noted that the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> may refer to various kinds of databases and the like stored in the storage unit <b>119</b> and the like in order to perform each of the above processings, and may store generated parameters, progress of processing, and the like in the storage unit <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0079">The biometric authentication unit <b>109</b> is realized with, for example, a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, and the like. The biometric authentication unit <b>109</b> registers biometric information transmitted from the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> as registered biometric information (hereinafter referred to as template), and authenticates the biometric information transmitted from the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> based on the registered biometric information. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, this biometric authentication unit <b>109</b> further includes a registration processing unit <b>111</b> and an authentication processing unit <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0080">The registration processing unit <b>111</b> is realized with, for example, a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, and the like. While the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment performs registration processing of user information, the registration processing unit <b>111</b> registers biometric information transmitted from the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> as registered biometric information (template) in a predetermined position of the later-explained storage unit <b>119</b> and the like. At this occasion, the registration processing unit <b>111</b> refers to an account ID associated with user information in registration processing notified from the login processing unit <b>101</b>, and associates the corresponding account ID with information representing the storage location of the registered biometric information. When storing of the registered biometric information and association of information representing the storage location with the user information are finished, the registration processing unit <b>111</b> notifies a notification indicating that the processing is finished to the login processing unit <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0081">The authentication processing unit <b>113</b> is realized with, for example, a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, and the like. When the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment performs login processing of a user, the authentication processing unit <b>113</b> performs authentication processing of biometric information transmitted from the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b>. This authentication processing of the biometric information is performed using registered biometric information stored in the storage unit <b>119</b> and the like and biometric information transmitted from the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b>. The authentication processing unit <b>113</b> calculates the degree of similarity between all the registered biometric information and the biometric information transmitted from the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b>, and determines whether there is any registered biometric information whose calculated degree of similarity is equal to or more than a predetermined threshold value. When there is registered biometric information having the degree of similarity equal to or more than the threshold value, the authentication processing unit <b>113</b> determines that authentication of the user associated with the corresponding registered biometric information is successful.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0082">When the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> performs account switching processing of a user being logged in, the authentication processing unit <b>113</b> performs authentication processing using registered biometric information associated with the user information of the switched user notified from the login processing unit <b>101</b>. This authentication processing is performed using the corresponding registered biometric information and the biometric information transmitted from the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b>. A determination as to whether the authentication is successful or not is determined based on whether the degree of similarity between these pieces of biometric information is equal to or more than the predetermined threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0083">Further, when the user corresponding to the newly generated user information selects the use of the already registered biometric information for the newly generated user information, the authentication processing unit <b>113</b> performs authentication processing of the corresponding registered biometric information. This authentication processing is performed using the registered biometric information and the biometric information transmitted from the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b>. A determination as to whether the authentication is successful or not is determined based on whether the degree of similarity between these pieces of biometric information is equal to or more than the predetermined threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0084">When the authentication result of the biometric information transmitted from the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> is determined, the authentication processing unit <b>113</b> notifies this authentication result to the login processing unit <b>101</b>. Further, the authentication processing unit <b>113</b> may display the obtained authentication result by way of the display control unit <b>115</b>. When the functions or services provided to the user by the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment is provided from an external apparatus (such as a server), such authentication result may be notified to the external apparatus by way of the later-explained communication unit <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0085">The display control unit <b>115</b> is realized with, for example, a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, and the like. The display control unit <b>115</b> performs display control of the display unit (not shown) such as a display arranged in the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>. In response to a request given by the imaging control unit <b>103</b>, the display control unit <b>115</b> displays, on the display unit, a message such as &#x201c;please place biometric portion on a predetermined position.&#x201d; Further, in response to a request given by the biometric authentication unit <b>109</b>, the display control unit <b>115</b> displays, on the display unit, a message indicating that the registration processing of biometric information is finished, a message indicating that the registration processing of biometric information has failed, or the authentication result of the biometric information. Further, in response to the request given by the login processing unit <b>101</b>, the login processing unit <b>101</b> performs a series of login processing, whereby a message to be notified to the user is displayed on the display unit.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0086">The communication unit <b>117</b> is realized with, for example, a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, and a communication apparatus.

<p id="p-0089" num="0091">When the login processing unit <b>101</b> of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> is requested to start processing for registering new user information by way of an input device (not shown) such as a mouse and a keyboard arranged on the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>, the login processing unit <b>101</b> of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> starts generation of user information (step S<b>101</b>). This user information is generated by writing predetermined information about newly generated user information in a user information management table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example. For example, the login processing unit <b>101</b> generates an account ID unique to the newly generated user information and writes the account ID in the management table. In addition, the login processing unit <b>101</b> writes information representing authority given to this user information in the management table based on a specification given by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0092">Subsequently, the login processing unit <b>101</b> determines a password corresponding to this user information, and registers this password in a password field of the user information (step S<b>103</b>).

When an input is given by a user, the login processing unit <b>101</b> determines information representing the selection result input by the user (step S<b>105</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0094">When the user input indicates that the account control using biometric authentication processing is not used, the login processing unit writes, in a field of registered biometric information of user information, that the account control using biometric authentication processing is not used, and terminates the registration processing of user information.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0095">On the other hand, when the user input indicates that the account control using biometric authentication processing is to be used, the login processing unit <b>101</b> causes the display control unit <b>115</b> to display, on the display unit (not shown), a message asking whether already registered biometric information is used or not. Thereafter, the login processing unit <b>101</b> waits for an input of selection result given by a user. When an input is given by the user, the login processing unit <b>101</b> determines information representing the selection result input by the user (step S<b>107</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0096">Herein, when the user selects non-use of registered biometric information, the login processing unit <b>101</b> requests the imaging control unit <b>103</b> to start taking an image of the biometric portion, and starts obtaining the biometric information (step S<b>109</b>). In this case, the biometric imaging unit <b>105</b> controlled by the imaging control unit <b>103</b> takes an image of the biometric portion, and the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> extracts predetermined biometric information from the obtained biometric image data.

<p id="p-0102" num="0104">Subsequently, the login processing method carried out by the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment will be explained in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of a login processing method carried out by the information processing apparatus of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0105">In the explanation below, a login processing method using an account ID and a password will not be explained, but a login processing using biometric authentication processing will be explained in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0106">First, when biometric portion of a user is located at a predetermined position of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>, the login processing unit <b>101</b> requests the imaging control unit <b>103</b> to start taking an image of the predetermined biometric portion, and starts obtaining biometric information (step S<b>201</b>). In this case, the biometric imaging unit <b>105</b> controlled by the imaging control unit <b>103</b> takes an image of the biometric portion, and the biometric information extraction unit <b>107</b> extracts predetermined biometric information from the obtained biometric image data.

The login processing unit <b>101</b> receives the notification of the failed authentication, and causes the display control unit <b>115</b> to display, on the display unit (not shown), an error output indicating that the authentication has failed (step S<b>205</b>). Then, the login processing is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0108">On the other hand, when there is registered biometric information whose degree of similarity calculated is determined to be equal to or more than the predetermined threshold value, the authentication processing unit <b>113</b> determines that the extracted biometric information has been successfully authenticated. In this case, the authentication processing unit <b>113</b> refers to the registered user information, and identifies user information associated with the corresponding registered biometric information. Thereby, the authentication processing unit <b>113</b> determines whether the successfully authenticated registered biometric information corresponds to a plurality of pieces of user information (step S<b>207</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0109">When the successfully authenticated registered biometric information does not correspond to a plurality of pieces of user information (in other words, the successfully authenticated registered biometric information corresponds to only one piece of user information), the authentication processing unit <b>113</b> notifies the account ID described in the corresponding user information to the login processing unit <b>101</b>.

<p id="p-0109" num="0111">When the user sees the list of accounts available for login, the user operates an input device (not shown) such as a mouse, a keyboard and a stylus to select an account used for login.

The login processing unit <b>101</b> uses the obtained information representing the selection result of the account as user specification information for specifying user information, and uses the corresponding user information to carry out step S<b>213</b> explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0112">When the user information used for the login processing is identified, the login processing unit <b>101</b> carries out the login processing using the corresponding account while referring to the corresponding user information (step S<b>213</b>).

<p id="p-0113" num="0115">When the user who logs in to the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> performs operation to request switching of the account, the login processing unit <b>101</b> obtains information for identifying user information (such as account ID) of the new account (step S<b>301</b>). The login processing unit <b>101</b> refers to the user information of the new account using the obtained information, and determines whether registered biometric information associated with the user information currently being logged in is the same as registered biometric information associated with the user information of the new account (step S<b>303</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0119">When the registered biometric information corresponding to the user information of the new account is determined to be the same as that of the user information of the account currently being logged in, or when the authentication processing of the user information of the new account has been successful, the login processing unit <b>101</b> carries out the login processing based on the user information of the new account (step S<b>309</b>). Thus, the user can log in to the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> again using the specified user account.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0120">On the other hand, when the login processing unit <b>101</b> receives a notification of failed authentication, the login processing unit <b>101</b> causes the display control unit <b>115</b> to display, on the display unit (not shown), the error output indicating that the authentication has failed (step S<b>311</b>), and terminates the switching processing of the account.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0121">Therefore, the user of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> can switch the account in a simpler manner, and the convenience for the user can be improved.</p>

When there is additional operation information, the login processing unit <b>101</b> reviews the content of the additional operation information, and determines whether information generated by such additional operation has been notified or not. Thus, the login processing unit <b>101</b> can identify user information used for the login processing from among the plurality of pieces of user information associated with one piece of registered biometric information.</p>

<p id="h-0019" num="0000">(Summary)</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0218">As explained above, the following case may have to be considered. When a user uses a certain information processing apparatus, the user may have a plurality of accounts for different authorities to be executed, and may want to assign different accounts to different uses such as home use and office use. In such a case, in the information processing apparatus according to the embodiments and the modifications of the present invention as explained above, one piece of registered biometric information may be shared by a plurality of pieces of user information (i.e., accounts). Therefore, the convenience for the user can be improved by the information processing apparatus according to the embodiments and the modifications of the present invention as explained above.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0219">An example of the login processing method heretofore used includes a method for using not only an account ID but also a password. In this case, when the user logs in to an information processing apparatus, the ID and the password are input to the apparatus without distinguishing the accounts. However, the drawback of the method using the password is a lack of variation of the password.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0220">Many users are afraid of forgetting passwords, and the users prefer using an easy-to-remember text string, a short text string, a text string having a meaning, and the like as a password, to using a random, long test string. Therefore, for example, when an English-Japanese dictionary is considered, a space from which a user can choose passwords is considered to include about several thousand to one million passwords. On the other hand, there is a system allowing only a limited range of options, i.e., only 10000 options, such as PIN numbers for ATM of a bank.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0221">Suppose that M users randomly choose passwords from N options. In this case, according to a theory called Birthday Paradox, it is known that when the number M of users is N<sup>1/2 </sup>or more, the chance of coincidence of passwords becomes more than &#xbd;. Therefore, in the system in which the password space includes 10000 options and which has more than 100 users, or in the case of 1 million options with more than 1000 users, the chance that a plurality of users select the same password is more than &#xbd;. In such a situation, the following case is considered: a user inputs a password without specifying an account, and the system presents a list of accounts associated with the password. In this case, there is a drawback in that another user may use the same password to log in to another account different from the account that should be managed by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0222">On the other hand, when a user distinguishing method using biometric information is used, a wide range of options are available as biometric information. This can be easily expected from that fact that it is impossible to obtain the same information when biometric information on the same portion of the same user is presented to the system a plurality of times. This is because a mechanism for reading the biometric information handles analog information such as images and audio. Accordingly, in individual authentication using biometric information, presented data are hardly in complete agreement with registered biometric information. When the data somewhat agrees within a range of error, the authentication is deemed to have succeeded. Also for this reason, it is expected that accidental agreement of registration information hardly occurs when the biometric information is used as the password.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0223">As described above, in the information processing apparatus according to the embodiments and the modifications of the present invention using biometric authentication processing, the convenience for the user can be improved while maintaining the security of the apparatus itself.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0224">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0225">The present application contains subject matter related to that disclosed in Japanese Priority Patent Application JP 2009-264821 filed in the Japan Patent Office on Nov. 20, 2009, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
