<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a wiring layer structure. In particular, the present invention relates to a wiring layer structure used in a semiconductor device such as a transistor and the like and a method for manufacturing the wiring layer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application claims priority on Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-141440 filed on Jun. 12, 2009, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">From the viewpoint of high-speed driving and reduction in cost, expectations have been focused on a Cu-based wiring layer having a lower resistivity than that of an Al-based wiring layer which is the mainstream of a wiring layer for a TFT panel at present.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, there are problems in that Cu is inferior in an adhesion property to underlying substrate materials such as glass, Si, and the like, compared to adhesion properties of wiring materials such as Al and the like, and Cu is diffused to an underlying substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to overcome such problems, a Cu wiring was developed in which an oxide layer of a Cu alloy was formed on a glass substrate or an amorphous Si substrate and a layer of Cu alone or a Cu alloy was formed thereon, by a method of sputtering a Cu alloy in an oxygen atmosphere (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 1). In this wiring layer, the layer of Cu alone or the Cu alloy secures a low electrical resistance, and the oxide layer of the Cu alloy enhances the adhesion of the interface between the Cu wiring and an underlying substrate, and in addition, the oxide layer of the Cu alloy serves as a barrier layer for preventing Cu from being diffused to the underlying substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With regard to the wiring layer in which a Cu alloy is used, wiring layers which contain a variety of additive elements are proposed (see Patent Documents 1 and 2).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These Patent Documents disclose a technique in which a pure copper target (or a target in which at least one selected from Mg, Al, Si, Be, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra, Sc, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, and Dy is added) is sputtered while introducing oxygen gas so as to form a barrier layer which contains copper as a main component and oxygen, and then the introducing of the oxygen gas is stopped, and the above-mentioned target is sputtered so as to form a low-resistivity layer of pure copper. The above-mentioned barrier layer which contains copper as a main component and oxygen has a high adhesion property to silicon and glass and a low electrical resistance, and the barrier layer also prevents copper from being diffused to a silicon substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the wiring layer formed as mentioned above, a wiring layer pattern is formed as follows. An opening is formed in a resist film along a predetermined pattern, and a material of the wiring layer exposed to the opening is removed by dry or wet etching. As a result, a portion of an underlying layer becomes in an exposed state.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is known that in the case where the above-mentioned Cu wiring layer pattern is formed on a non-single crystal semiconductor thin film such as an amorphous silicon thin film or a polycrystalline silicon thin film and a portion of the semiconductor thin film is exposed, a large number of dangling bonds (bonding partners which are not involved in a bond due to losing their covalent bonding partners) exist in the surface of the exposed semiconductor thin film The dangling bonds are unstable. Therefore, a hydrogen plasma treatment is generally conducted so as to terminate and stabilize the dangling bonds after the wiring layer pattern (source and drain electrode and the like) is formed in a process of manufacturing a semiconductor element (such as a TFT) which includes the non-single crystal semiconductor thin film.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following phenomenon is reported which occurs in the hydrogen plasma treatment. Hydrogen ions easily infiltrate and penetrate into the wiring layer. Then, the oxide layer of the Cu alloy is reduced, and the reduced oxygen is bonded to hydrogen to generate water (water vapor). As a result, the layer is peeled off at the interface and the adhesion property is deteriorated (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 2).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, the development of a Cu wiring layer having a high hydrogen plasma resistance (resistance to hydrogen plasma) is required in which troubles such as the deterioration of the adhesion property do not occur after the above-mentioned hydrogen plasma treatment.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the wiring layer structure according to the present invention includes: an underlying substrate of a semiconductor substrate or a glass substrate; an oxygen-containing Cu layer or an oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer which is formed on the underlying substrate; an oxide layer containing at least one of Al, Zr, and Ti which is formed on the oxygen-containing Cu layer or the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer; and a Cu alloy layer containing at least one of Al, Zr, and Ti which is formed on the oxide layer. Here, examples of &#x201c;the semiconductor substrate or the glass substrate&#x201d; include a substrate which includes a semiconductor layer or a silica layer provided in one surface.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present invention, the oxide layer containing at least one of Al, Zr, and Ti is formed between the Cu alloy layer containing at least one of Al, Zr, and Ti and either of the oxygen-containing Cu layer or the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer, and the oxygen-containing Cu layer or the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer is provided in order to improve the adhesion property to the underlying substrate such as a semiconductor substrate and a glass substrate. Even when the hydrogen plasma treatment is further performed, hydrogen ions hardly penetrate into the oxygen-containing Cu layer or the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer (the hydrogen plasma resistance is improved) due to the existence of the oxide layer. Thereby, the reduction of oxygen in the oxygen-containing Cu layer or the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer hardly occurs; and as a result, the layer is hardly peeled off at the interface, and the adhesion property can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer may contain at least one additive element selected from a group consisting of Ca, Mg, Li, Al, Zr, Ti, Si, Mn, Cr, and rare earth metals. In this case, these additive elements cause the oxide layer to be more easily formed in the interface between the Cu alloy layer and either of the oxygen-containing Cu layer or the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer. In addition, these additive elements also have an effect of enhancing the adhesion property between the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer and the underlying substrate.</p>

In the case where the content of the additive elements is 20 atom % or less, the amount of oxides or intermetallic compounds generated in the oxygen-containing Cu layer or the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer is limited; and thereby, the value of electrical resistance does not remarkably increase, and problems do not occur when utilizing the wiring layer structure as the wiring layer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The content of oxygen contained in the oxygen-containing Cu layer or the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer may be in a range of 1 atom % to 30 atom %. In the case where the content of the oxygen is 1 atom % or more, sufficient adhesion property to a material of the underlying substrate and sufficient diffusion barrier property (barrier property to prevent diffusion) can be obtained. In the case where the content of the oxygen is 30 atom % or less, the amount of oxides generated in the oxygen-containing Cu layer or the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer is limited. Thereby, the value of electrical resistance does not remarkably increase, and problems do not occur when utilizing the wiring layer structure as the wiring layer.</p>

In the case where the content of the additive elements is 1 atom % or more, the oxide layer is sufficiently formed in the interface between the Cu alloy layer and either of the oxygen-containing Cu layer or the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer; and as a result, the peeling resistance (resistance to peeling) of the interface, that is, the adhesion property can be sufficiently improved. In the case where the content of the additive elements is 15 atom % or less, the value of electrical resistance of the Cu alloy layer does not remarkably increase, and problems do not occur when utilizing the wiring layer structure as the wiring layer.

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the present invention, a Cu conductive layer formed on the Cu alloy layer may be further included. The Cu conductive layer may contain Cu at a content in a range of 99 atom % or more. Thereby, it is possible to provide a low-resistive wiring layer.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Hereinafter, embodiments for carrying out the invention will be described in detail. Meanwhile, in the drawings used in the following description, the thickness of each layer is not shown at a reduced scale of the reality, in order to make the description easier to understand.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating a basic configuration of a wiring layer structure according to a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> containing oxygen is formed on an underlying substrate <b>1</b> consisting of a semiconductor substrate or a glass substrate. The Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> is provided in order to improve the adhesion property to the underlying substrate <b>1</b>. An oxide layer <b>3</b> containing Al (which is in the form of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in many cases) is formed on the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b>, a Cu alloy layer containing Al (Cu&#x2014;Al alloy layer) <b>4</b> is formed on the oxide layer <b>3</b> containing Al, and a Cu conductive layer <b>5</b> is formed on the Cu&#x2014;Al alloy layer <b>4</b>. Here, examples of &#x201c;the semiconductor substrate or the glass substrate&#x201d; include a substrate which includes a semiconductor layer or a silica layer provided in one surface.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, a method for manufacturing the wiring layer structure having the basic configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At first, a semiconductor substrate or a glass substrate is prepared as the underlying substrate <b>1</b>, and sputtering is performed on the surface thereof in an O<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere using a target containing copper. The target containing copper used in this sputtering may contain at least one additive element selected from a group consisting of Ca, Mg, Li, Al, Zr, Ti, Si, Mn, Cr, and rare earth elements.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">This sputtering process is performed as follows. A vacuum chamber is evacuated by a vacuum pumping system, and then sputtering gas (inert gas such as Ar) and O<sub>2 </sub>are introduced to prepare the O<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. The semiconductor or the glass substrate which is a film formation object is loaded into the vacuum chamber in a state of the O<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. A voltage is applied from a sputtering electrical power supply to the target containing copper while controlling the flow rate of oxygen gas. When the target containing copper is sputtered by plasma, minute particles composed of atoms or atomic groups of copper and the additive elements are emitted in the direction towards the underlying layer <b>1</b> and the atoms or the atomic groups react with oxygen. As a result, the Cu&#x2014;O layer (barrier layer) <b>2</b> composed of copper (and the additive elements) and oxides thereof is formed on the surface of the underlying layer <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The sputtering of the target containing copper is continued to grow the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b>, and the introducing of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas is stopped when the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> having a predetermined film thickness is formed. Then, the target is switched to a Cu&#x2014;Al alloy, and the Cu&#x2014;Al alloy target is sputtered while continuing the introducing of the sputtering gas (inert gas such as Ar). Thereby, the Cu&#x2014;Al alloy layer <b>4</b> is formed on the surface of the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, the sputtering of the Cu&#x2014;Al alloy is continued to grow the Cu&#x2014;Al alloy layer <b>4</b>, and then, the target is switched to a pure copper (Cu) target when the Cu&#x2014;Al layer <b>4</b> having a predetermined film thickness is formed. The pure copper (Cu) target is sputtered while continuing the introducing of the sputtering gas (inert gas such as Ar). Thereby, the Cu conductive layer (low-resistivity layer) <b>5</b> is foamed on the surface of the Cu&#x2014;Al alloy layer <b>4</b>. The sputtering of the pure copper target is continued to grow the Cu conductive layer <b>5</b>, and the sputtering is stopped when the Cu conductive layer <b>5</b> having a predetermined film thickness is formed, and the resultant object is taken out from a sputtering apparatus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The ratio (percentage) of copper and the additive element contained in the sputtering target is the same as the ratio (percentage) of copper and the additive element in a metal layer formed using the sputtering target in both of the case where the film formation is performed in a vacuum atmosphere to which only the sputtering gas is introduced, and the case where the film formation is performed in a vacuum atmosphere to which both of the oxygen gas and the sputtering gas are introduced. In addition, even in the case where the introduced amount of the oxygen gas is altered, the ratio (percentage) remains unchanged. Therefore, for example, in the case where the sputtering target of which the ratio of the additive element to the total amount of copper and the additive element is 15 atom % or less is sputtered, it is possible to obtain a metal layer of which the ratio of the additive element to the total amount of copper and the additive element is 15 atom % or less.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, a resist film is disposed on the surface of a laminated film <b>11</b>, a normal patterning such as exposure, development, and the like is performed to expose a portion of the surface of the laminated film <b>11</b>. Then, the laminated film <b>11</b> in that state is exposed to an etchant (wet etching) or an etching gas (dry etching). Thereby, the laminated film <b>11</b> is patterned (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>). Thereafter, the unnecessary resist film is removed by a normal method to form a wiring layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the case where the wiring layer pattern is formed on a non-single crystal semiconductor thin film such as an amorphous silicon thin film, a poly crystal silicon thin film, or the like as mentioned above, a portion of the semiconductor is exposed. In this case, a large amount of dangling bonds exist in the surface <b>13</b> of the exposed semiconductor thin film. The dangling bond means a bonding partner which is not involved in a bond by losing a covalent bonding partner. These dangling bonds are unstable. Therefore, hydrogen plasma treatment is performed to terminate and stabilize the above-mentioned dangling bonds after the wiring layer pattern is formed in a process of manufacturing a semiconductor element including a non-single crystal semiconductor thin film.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the present embodiment, hydrogen annealing is performed before the hydrogen plasma treatment. Thereby, oxygen atoms (O) in the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> are diffused to the Cu&#x2014;Al alloy layer <b>4</b> containing Al, and an oxide layer <b>3</b> containing Al (which is in the form of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in many cases) is formed in the interface between the Cu&#x2014;Al alloy layer <b>4</b> and the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>). Even when the hydrogen plasma treatment is further performed, hydrogen ions hardly penetrate into the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> due to the existence of the oxide layer <b>3</b>. Thereby, the reduction of oxygen in the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> hardly occurs; and as a result, the layer is hardly peeled off at the interface, and the adhesion property can be further improved. In the present embodiment, the thickness of the oxide layer <b>3</b> is secured to some extent by performing the hydrogen annealing before the hydrogen plasma treatment. Thereby, it is possible to further strengthen the hydrogen plasma resistance which causes the hydrogen ions to hardly penetrate into the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b>. The hydrogen annealing is a process desirable to obtain a sufficient thickness of the oxide layer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the present embodiment, the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> may further contain at least one additive element selected from a group consisting of Ca, Mg, Li, Al, Zr, Ti, Si, Mn, Cr, and rare earth metals. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the additive element is denoted by &#x201c;x&#x201d; within parentheses. In addition, the content of the additive elements (one or more of Ca, Mg, Li, Al, Zr, Ti, Si, Mn, Cr, and rare earth metals) contained in the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> may be in a range of 20 atom % or less, and preferably in a range of 15 atom % or less. The reason why the additive elements such as Ca, Mg, Li, Al, Zr, Ti, Si, Mn, Cr, and rare earth metals are preferably included is as follows. These additive elements cause the oxide layer to be more easily formed in the interface between the Cu alloy layer and either of an oxygen-containing Cu layer or an oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating a basic configuration of the wiring layer according to the second embodiment of the present invention. The point in which the second embodiment of the present invention is structurally different from the first embodiment (structural difference between the first and second embodiments) is that the Cu conductive layer is not formed in the present embodiment, and other layers of the configuration are the same as those of the first embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the same layers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are assigned the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> containing oxygen is formed on an underlying substrate <b>1</b> consisting of a semiconductor substrate or a glass substrate. The Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> is provided in order to improve the adhesion property to the underlying substrate <b>1</b> similarly to the first embodiment. An oxide layer <b>3</b> containing Al (which is in the form of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in many cases) is formed on the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b>, and the Cu alloy layer containing Al (Cu&#x2014;Al alloy layer) <b>4</b> is formed on the oxide layer <b>3</b> containing Al.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the second embodiment, a Cu conductive layer is not formed, and the Cu&#x2014;Al alloy layer <b>4</b> functions similarly to the Cu conductive layer.

In the second embodiment, thickening of the Cu&#x2014;Al alloy layer <b>4</b> used as the conductive layer is an effective way to attain a low electrical resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Similarly, in the second embodiment, hydrogen annealing is performed before the hydrogen plasma treatment.

When the hydrogen plasma treatment is performed, the hydrogen ions hardly penetrate into the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> due to the existence of the oxide layer <b>3</b>. Thereby, the reduction of the oxygen in the Cu&#x2014;O layer <b>2</b> hardly occurs; and as a result, the layer is hardly peeled off at the interface, and the adhesion property can be further improved.

<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The hydrogen annealing was not performed in Comparative Example 1, and the Cu alloy layer did not substantially contain alloy elements in Comparative Example 2(hydrogen annealing was performed). From the results of the cross-cut adhesion test, it was identified that with regard to with regard to Comparative Examples 1 and 2, the results of the cross-cut adhesion test after the hydrogen plasma treatment were bad; and therefore, the hydrogen plasma treatment resistances (resistances to hydrogen plasma treatment) thereof were poor. In particular, with regard to Comparative Example 2, since the additive elements were not contained in the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer, the adhesion property between the oxygen-containing Cu alloy layer and the underlying substrate became low; and thereby, the results of the cross-cut adhesion test before the hydrogen plasma treatment were bad. It was identified that with regard to the wiring layer structures (Examples 1 to 17) according to the present invention, the results of the cross-cut adhesion test after the hydrogen plasma treatment were good; and therefore, the adhesion properties were high, and the hydrogen plasma treatment resistances (resistances to hydrogen plasma treatment) thereof were excellent.</p>
