<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Distributed power railroad train operation supplies motive power and braking action from a lead locomotive (or lead unit) and one or more remote locomotives (or remote units) spaced apart from the lead unit in a train. In one configuration, a distributed power train comprises a lead locomotive at a head end of the train, a remote locomotive at an end of train (EOT) position and one or more mid-train locomotives disposed between the head end and the end of train. Distributed train operation may be preferable for long train consists to improve train handling and performance, and especially for trains operating over mountainous terrain.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a distributed power train, each lead and remote locomotive supplies motive power and braking action for the train. Motive and braking command messages are issued by an operator in the lead locomotive and supplied to the remote locomotives over a radio frequency communications system, (such as the prior art LOCOTROL&#xae; distributed power communications system, available from the General Electric Company of Schenectady, N.Y.) comprising a radio frequency link (channel) and receiving and transmitting equipment at the lead and the remote units. The receiving remote locomotives respond to these commands to apply tractive effort or braking effort to the train, and advise the lead unit of the receipt and execution of the command. The lead unit also sends other messages to the remote units, including status request messages. The remote units respond by sending a status reply message back to the lead unit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a train having two or more directly coupled remote locomotives, the coupled locomotives function in unison via control signals transmitted over their connected MU (multiple unit) lines. One of the locomotives is designated as a controlling remote unit with respect to the distributed power communications system. Only the controlling remote unit is configured to receive commands transmitted by the lead unit and respond to the lead unit with appropriate reply messages.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One of the most critical aspects of train operation is the predictable and successful operation of the air brake system. The air brake system comprises locomotive brakes in each locomotive (including the lead locomotive and all the remote locomotives) and car brakes at each railcar. The lead unit locomotive brakes are controlled by the locomotive operator in response to a position of a locomotive brake handle, and the rail car brakes are controlled in response to a position of an automatic brake handle. The locomotive brakes can also be controlled by the automatic brake handle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The automatic brake handle or controller controls a pressure in a fluid carrying brake pipe that extends the length of the train and is in fluid communication with a car brake system for applying or releasing car brakes at each railcar in response to a pressure change in the brake pipe. Specifically, a control valve (typically comprising a plurality of valves and interconnecting piping) at each railcar responds to changes in the brake pipe fluid pressure by applying the brakes (in response to a decrease in the brake pipe fluid pressure) or by releasing the brakes (in response to an increase in the brake pipe fluid pressure). The fluid within the brake pipe conventionally comprises pressurized air. Operator control of the automatic brake handle in the lead locomotive initiates a pressure drop at the lead unit that propagates along the brake pipe to the end of the train. The control valve at each railcar senses the pressure drop and in response thereto supplies pressurized air from a local railcar reservoir to wheel brake cylinders that in turn draw brake shoes against railcar wheels. The railcar reservoir is recharged by air withdrawn from the brake pipe during non-braking operational intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A brake release is also commanded by the lead operator by controlling the automatic brake handle to effect a pressure increase in the brake pipe. The pressure increase is sensed at the railcars and in response the brake shoes are released from the railcar wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a distributed power train, in addition to regulating the brake pipe pressure to effect application and release of the railcar brakes, the lead unit commands remote unit brake applications and releases by sending an appropriate signal to the remote units via the communications channel. As described further below, brake applications and releases are thus more rapidly affected along the length of the train due to the participation of both the lead unit and the remote units. With some limitations as required to maintain train control, in a distributed power train a brake command or brake release can also be commanded by the lead or the remote locomotives.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The railcar brakes can be applied in two modes, i.e., a service brake application or an emergency brake application. In a service brake application, braking forces are applied to the railcar to slow or bring the train to a stop at a forward location along the track. During service brake applications the brake pipe pressure is slowly reduced and the brakes are applied gradually in response thereto. The operator controls the rate at which the pressure is reduced by operation of the automatic brake control handle. A penalty brake application is one form of a service brake application in which the brake pipe is reduced to zero pressure, but the evacuation occurs at a predetermined rate, unlike an emergency brake application as described below, and the railcars do not vent the brake pipe during the penalty brake application.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An emergency brake application commands an immediate application of the railcar brakes through an immediate evacuation or venting of the brake pipe at the lead unit (and the remote units of a distributed power train). When a railcar senses a predetermined pressure reduction rate indicative of an emergency brake application, the railcar also vents the brake pipe to accelerate propagation of brake pipe evacuation along the train. Unfortunately, because the brake pipe runs for several thousand yards through the train, the emergency brake application does not occur instantaneously along the entire length of the brake pipe. Thus the braking forces are not uniformly applied at each railcar to stop the train.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">distributed power trains, braking is accomplished by venting the brake pipe at both the lead and remote locomotives, thus accelerating the brake pipe venting and application of the brakes at each railcar, especially for those railcars near the end of the train. As can be appreciated, brake pipe venting at only the lead unit in a conventional train requires propagation of the brake pipe pressure reduction along the length of the train, thus slowing brake applications at railcars distant from the lead unit. For a distributed power train with an operative communications link between the lead and remote units, when the train operator commands a brake application (e.g., a service or an emergency brake application) by operation of the automatic brake control handle at the lead unit, the brake pipe is vented and a brake application command is transmitted to each remote unit over the radio frequency communications link. In response, each remote unit also vents the brake pipe. Thus braking action at the remote locomotives follows the braking action of the lead unit in response to signals transmitted by the communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A brake release initiated at the lead unit is also communicated over the radio frequency link to the remote units so that the brake pipe is recharged to a nominal pressure from all locomotives, reducing the brake pipe recharge time.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">If an emergency brake application is initiated at the lead locomotive by the train operator or in response to a detected failure condition, the radio frequency communication system sends an emergency brake signal to each of the remote locomotives over the radio frequency link. In response, the remote locomotives evacuate the brake pipe. This technique permits faster execution of the emergency brake application since the brake pipe is evacuated from all of the locomotives, rather than from only the lead locomotive as in a conventional train.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> schematically illustrate an exemplary distributed power train <b>10</b>, traveling in a direction indicated by an arrowhead <b>11</b>, wherein one or more remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C are controlled from either a lead unit <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or a control tower <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). A locomotive <b>15</b> is controlled by the lead unit <b>14</b> via an MU line <b>17</b> connecting the two units. The teachings of aspects of the present inventive subject matter can be applied to the distributed power train <b>10</b> and a communications system operative therewith as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It should be understood that the only difference between the systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is that the issuance of commands and messages from the lead unit <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is replaced by the control tower <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and certain interlocks of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are eliminated. Typically, the control tower <b>16</b> communicates with the lead unit <b>14</b>, which in turn is linked to the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, a communications channel of the communications system comprises a single half-duplex communications channel having a three kHz bandwidth, where the messages and commands comprise a serial binary data stream encoded using frequency shift keying modulation on one of four available carrier frequencies. The various bit positions convey information regarding the type of transmission (e.g., message, command, alarm), the substantive message, command or alarm, the address of the receiving unit, the address of the sending unit, conventional start and stop bits and error detection/correction bits. The details of the messages and commands provided by the system and the transmission format of individual messages and commands are discussed in detail in commonly owned U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The distributed power train <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, further comprises a plurality of railcars <b>20</b> interposed between the remote units <b>12</b>A/<b>12</b>B and between the remote unit <b>12</b>C (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The arrangement of the locomotives <b>14</b> and <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C and railcars <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is merely exemplary, as aspects of the present inventive subject matter can be applied to other locomotive/railcar arrangements. The railcars <b>20</b> are provided with an air brake system (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) that applies the railcar air brakes in response to a pressure drop in a brake pipe <b>22</b>, and releases the air brakes upon a pressure rise in the brake pipe <b>22</b>. The brake pipe <b>22</b> runs the length of the train for conveying the air pressure changes specified by the individual air brake controls <b>24</b> in the lead unit <b>14</b> and the remote units <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B and <b>12</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain applications, an off board repeater <b>26</b>, further described below, is disposed within radio communication distance of the train <b>10</b> for relaying communications signals between the lead unit <b>14</b> and the remote units <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B and <b>12</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The lead unit <b>14</b> and the remote units <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B and <b>12</b>C are provided with independent transceivers <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B operative with respective antennas <b>29</b>A and <b>29</b>B for receiving and transmitting communications signals over the communications channel. The off board repeater <b>26</b> and the control tower <b>16</b> are each provided, with the transceiver <b>28</b> operative with the antenna <b>29</b> for receiving and transmitting communications signals over the communications channel.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The lead unit transceiver <b>28</b> is associated with a lead station <b>30</b> for generating and issuing commands and messages from the lead unit <b>14</b> to the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C, and receiving reply messages therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Commands are generated in the lead station <b>30</b> in response to operator control of the motive power and braking controls within the lead unit <b>14</b>, as described elsewhere herein or automatically as required. Each remote unit <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C and the off board repeater <b>26</b> comprises a remote station <b>32</b> for processing, repeating and/or responding to transmissions from the lead unit <b>14</b> and for issuing reply messages and commands. The lead station <b>30</b> and the remote stations <b>32</b> are responsive to independent signals from both the transceivers <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The four primary types of radio transmissions carried by the communications system include: (1) link messages from the lead unit <b>14</b> to each of the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C that &#x201c;link&#x201d; the lead unit <b>14</b> and the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C, i.e., configure or set-up the communications system for use by the lead unit <b>14</b> and the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C, (2) link reply messages that indicate reception and execution of the link message, (3) commands from the lead unit <b>14</b> that control one or more functions (e.g., application of motive power or braking) of one or more remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C and (4) status and alarm messages transmitted by the one or more remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C that update or provide the lead unit <b>14</b> with necessary operating information concerning the one or more remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each message and command sent from the lead unit <b>14</b> is broadcast to all of the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C and includes a lead unit identifier for use by the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C for determining that the sending lead unit is the lead unit of the same train. An affirmative determination causes the remote unit <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C to execute the received command.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Messages and alarms sent from one of the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C also include the sending unit's address. As a result of a previously completed link-up process, the receiving unit, i.e., the lead or another remote locomotive, can determine whether it was an intended recipient of the received transmission by checking the sending unit's identification in the message, and can respond accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">These four message types, including the address information included in each, ensure a secure transmission link that has a low probability of disruption from interfering signals within radio transmission distance of the train <b>10</b>. The messages allow for control of the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C from the lead unit <b>14</b> and provides remote unit operating information to the lead unit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although most commands are issued by the lead unit <b>14</b> and transmitted to the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C for execution as described above, there is one situation where a remote <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C issues commands to the other remote units and the lead unit <b>14</b>. If a remote unit <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C detects a condition that warrants an emergency brake application, the remote transmits an emergency brake command to all other units of the train. The command includes identification of the lead locomotive of the train and will therefore be executed at each remote unit, as if the command had been issued by the lead unit.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Throughout the description of the present inventive subject matter, the terms &#x201c;radio link&#x201d;, &#x201c;RF link&#x201d; and &#x201c;RF communications&#x201d; and similar terms describe a method of communicating between two links in a network. It should be understood that the communications link between nodes (locomotives) in a system in accordance with the present inventive subject matter is not limited to radio or RF systems or the like and is meant to cover all techniques by which messages may be delivered from one node to another or to plural others, including without limitation, magnetic systems, acoustic systems, and optical systems. Likewise, a system of the present inventive subject matter is described in connection with an embodiment in which radio (RF) links are used between nodes and in which the various components are compatible with such links; however, this description of the presently preferred embodiment is not intended to limit the inventive subject matter to that particular embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a distributed power train, responsive to an operator-initiated command, the communications system at the lead unit transmits to each remote unit a radio frequency (RF) message representing the command. Such commands can include locomotive throttle or traction commands and air brake, dynamic brake and electric brake commands. In the case of an air brake command, upon message receipt, the brake command is executed at each remote unit to accelerate command response at the railcars, since the remote units receive the radio frequency message before they sense the brake pipe pressure change. For example, if the operator commands a brake application, the brake pipe is vented at the lead unit and the pressure reduction propagates along the length of the train until reaching the end-of-train car. Depending on train length, several seconds may elapse before the pressure reduction reaches the last railcar. Venting the brake pipe at the lead and remote locomotives, the latter in response to the RF message, accelerates the brake pipe venting and application of the brakes at each railcar, especially for the railcars near the end of the train. Thus braking actions at the remote locomotives follow the braking actions of the lead unit in response to the RF signals transmitted by the communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A brake release initiated at the lead unit is also communicated over the radio frequency link to the remote units so that the brake pipe is recharged to its nominal pressure from all locomotives, reducing brake pipe recharge time.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If the train operator initiates an emergency brake application at the lead locomotive, the communication system sends an emergency brake signal to each of the remote locomotives over the radio frequency link. The remote locomotives evacuate the brake pipe to provide faster execution of the emergency brake application since the brake pipe is evacuated from all of the locomotives, rather than from only the lead locomotive as in a conventional train.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In general, messages sent over the communications system permit the application of more even tractive forces to the railcars and improve braking performance as each locomotive can effect a brake application at the speed of the RF signal, rather than the slower speed at which the pneumatic brake pipe braking signal propagates along the train.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the distributed power train is operating in an environment where each remote unit is expected to receive command messages sent by the lead unit, for example when the train is traveling along a relatively straight length of track with no proximate obstructions to a radio frequency signal, the communications system is operative in a normal mode. In this mode, no communications losses, interruptions or repeated messages (because the message did not reach its intended destination when first transmitted) are anticipated. Most messages issued in the normal mode are controlled according to a fixed priority message protocol, according to which each remote unit transmits a status message responsive to a lead-issued command message after a predetermined interval from transmission of the command. Thus each remote unit is assigned a time slot, measured from transmission of the lead unit command message, during which each remote unit transmits its message.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, where the system is described for a railroad train comprising a lead unit and four remote units, illustrates the concepts associated with the fixed priority message protocol for normal communications. The concepts described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can be applied to a train comprising more or fewer than four remote locomotives.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to this scheme, at a time t=650 msec, the lead unit transmits a command message (for example, a brake command, a traction command, a dynamic brake command, etc.) that is expected to be received by all remote locomotives in the distributed power train. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each transceiver (also referred to as a radio) is allocated a 30 msec interval to turn on, and an exemplary command message length is 193 msec. After a lapse of the predefined interval from the lead transmission, for example 50 msec as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first remote locomotive retransmits the command message and its status message (for example, the first remote locomotive is venting the brake pipe in response to the brake command). The status message is intended for the lead locomotive so that the train operator is advised of the first remote unit's response to the command. Also note that each remote unit retransmits the command message with its status message to maximize the likelihood that the command is received by all remote locomotives. The turn-on time, message duration, etc. illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are merely exemplary and can vary depending on the application and specifications of the components that comprise the communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The second remote locomotive repeats the command message and transmits its status message after a predetermined delay, for example 50 msec, from the end of the first remote's transmission. The command repeating and status transmitting process continues until all remote locomotives have repeated the command message and transmitted their respective status message. An end of message condition occurs when the last remote has transmitted its status, after which the lead unit is free to transmit another command message to the remote locomotives. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> embodiment, the end of message occurs at t=2896 msec or 2271 msec after the lead unit's initial transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the lead unit transmits a command message, the lead unit will not know whether the message was received by all the remote units in the train until a remote status message is received from each remote unit (wherein the status messages indicates receipt and execution of the command message) or a status message is not received from one or more of the remote units (lack of a status message indicates the command message was not received). Thus according to one embodiment of the communications system, to ensure that each remote unit receives the command messages, it is repeated by each remote unit.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Note that it is possible that one or more remote status messages may not be received by the lead unit. When this is the case, the lead unit retransmits the command message and awaits a reply status message from each remote unit in the train. One feature of the present inventive subject matter, to be described below, increases the likelihood that all status messages are received at the lead unit, thus reducing the retransmit probability, without significantly impacting the overall transmission timing for the command and status messages.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition to the fixed priority protocol described above, certain commands, e.g., an emergency brake application, are classified as high priority command messages and are transmitted according to a different priority protocol than the fixed priority protocol. Still other command messages, e.g., a communications system check, operate according to other priority protocols that control transmission of these commands and the reply by the remote units.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As the distributed power train passes through certain terrain topographies or track segments with proximate natural or man-made obstructions, a line-of-sight communications link between the sending and the receiving units may be interrupted. Thus commands and status messages may not be reliably received by the receiving unit, i.e., the lead locomotive for messages sent from a remote unit, and a remote locomotive for messages sent from the lead unit. Although high-power, robust transceivers may be capable of successfully transmitting the signal to the receiving unit under certain operating conditions, such equipment can be relatively expensive. Further, in some operating scenarios even a high-power transceiver cannot successfully effect communications, such as when a long train travels a curved track segment adjacent a natural obstruction such as a mountain, where the communications path between the lead unit and one or more remote units is obstructed by the mountain. Also, as the train passes through a tunnel certain transceivers may be unable to communicate with other transceivers aboard the locomotives.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To improve system reliability, one embodiment of the distributed power train communications system comprises the off-board repeater <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for receiving messages sent from the lead unit <b>14</b> and repeating (retransmitting) the message for receiving by the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C. This embodiment may be practiced along a length of track that passes through a tunnel, for example. In such an embodiment the off-board repeater <b>26</b> comprises an antenna <b>29</b> (e.g., leaky coaxial cable mounted along the tunnel length) and the remote station <b>32</b> for receiving and retransmitting lead messages that are received by all the remote units <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C within RF communications range of the repeater antenna <b>29</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In accordance with common practice, the various described features are not drawn to scale, but are drawn to emphasize specific features relevant to the inventive subject matter. Reference characters denote like elements throughout the figures and text.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Before describing in detail the particular method and apparatus for a priority message protocol for an on-board message repeater system in accordance with the present inventive subject matter, it should be observed that aspects of the present inventive subject matter reside primarily in a novel combination of hardware and software elements related to said method and apparatus. Accordingly, the hardware and software elements have been represented by conventional elements in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to aspects of the present inventive subject matter, so as not to obscure the disclosure with structural details that will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to a preferred embodiment comprising a priority message protocol for an on-board message repeater system in a distributed power train, such as the distributed power train <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, messages transmitted from the lead unit <b>14</b> leapfrog down the train from the head end to the end-of-train as each successive remote unit <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C receives and retransmits the message.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, when the train enters an environment where the lead locomotive unit may not successfully communicate directly with each remote unit (for example, when the train enters a tunnel), the communications system may automatically switch to the priority protocol for on-board message repeating (OBMAR) according to the teachings of the present inventive subject matter. Such a switch occurs, for example, when the communications system experiences an interrupt of more than a predetermined fixed duration, one minute for example. Once activated, in one embodiment the OBMR protocol is active for fifteen minutes, after which the communications system returns to normal priority message protocol operation, i.e., as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In another embodiment, the communications system can be configured for continual OBMR operation or OBMR operation can be manually activated by the lead locomotive operator.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary OBMR protocol for a train comprising a lead unit and four remote units. In this mode, the lead unit transmits a command message (i.e., a message that commands a new function at the remote units or a status update message that requests remote unit status information and also includes the most recent previously-transmitted command). The first remote unit receives the outbound command message and repeats the message for receiving by other remote units in the train.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the lead unit transmission begins at 625 msec after a time t=0. This interval is merely exemplary and represents a predetermined minimum interval between receipt of a message at the lead unit and a transmission of a later command from the lead unit. Note the exemplary 50 msec delay interval between the end of a message transmission and retransmission of the message, and also the allotted exemplary 30 msec radio (transceiver) turn-on time. Generally, the command messages sent by the lead unit, the messages sent by the remote units and the interval between message transmissions are fixed in length. However, these lengths may vary as needed for a particular application of the present inventive subject matter and may differ among different railroad operators.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Unlike the normal communications mode described above, according to one embodiment of the inventive subject matter the first remote does not transmit a return status message upon receipt of the outbound message that was sent from then lead locomotive. Instead, the first remote unit (and each subsequent remote unit) repeats the outbound message, thereby permitting the outbound message to propagate along the length of the train, without incurring the time penalty of the inbound (i.e., in a direction toward the lead locomotive) status messages transmissions from each remote unit. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each remote unit retransmits the outbound message within its respective predefined time slot, a predetermined time interval after receiving the outbound message, after another remote unit has transmitted the transmitted the outbound message, or after another remote unit has transmitted a response. Thus the message leapfrogs down the train for receiving by each remote unit. When the outbound message is retransmitted by the last remote, no status messages have been returned to the lead locomotive.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">One premise of certain embodiments of the inventive subject matter is that each locomotive of the train receives (e.g., &#x201c;hears&#x201d;) messages sent from the lead locomotive and from the remote locomotive(s), although this may not always be true due to interference, low signal strength, etc. The signal timing parameters and actions at the lead and remote units as described herein are based on this premise. If a remote unit fails to receive a lead message, for example, this situation is discovered when the lead unit fails to receive a response from that remote locomotive. The lead locomotive takes corrective action, including retransmitting the original message.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Also, it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that each remote locomotive waits a predetermined time from receiving the message (either from receiving the outbound message or from receiving the inbound message) from the lead locomotive or from a prior remote locomotive, where &#x201c;prior&#x201d; refers to a locomotive that received the message earlier in time and transmits a response message or retransmits the received message. However, if the prior remote locomotive did not receive the message, it obviously cannot transmit a response message or retransmit the original message. Under these circumstances a remote locomotive expecting a response from the prior locomotive will not receive that response. The remote locomotive expecting the response will therefore wait a predetermined time from receipt of the last message until sending its own message or retransmitting the original message.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When setting up the communications system as described above, each locomotive is configured to reflect its position in the train. Thus each message sent by a locomotive includes an identifier of the transmitting locomotive. Each locomotive receiving the message can therefore determine the locomotive that transmitted the message and can also determine the position of the transmitting locomotive in the train relative to the position of the receiving locomotive.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the last remote (the nth remote) receives the command message, the last remote sends its status message (i.e., an inbound, message) back to the previous (n&#x2212;1)th remote. According to standard practice, when the communications system is configured or the lead and remote units are linked, the remote unit farthest from the lead unit is configured as the last remote, i.e., the last remote &#x201c;knows&#x201d; that it is the last remote in the train. Thus when the last remote unit receives the outbound message it responds with its status message. Remote unit three (in the case where n=4) receives the status message from remote unit four and stores the received status message until its designated time slot, at which time remote unit three repeats the remote unit four status message and appends its own status message, transmitting both status messages in a direction of the lead unit, i.e., to the second remote. Remote unit two receives the status messages from remote units four and three, and transmits these status messages, plus its own status message, in the direction of the lead unit. The process continues until each remote unit's status message reaches the lead unit as a concatenated message comprising the status message from each remote unit.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, this occurs at t=4377 msec, or a total elapsed time of 3752 msec from the start of transmission of the outbound command message to receipt of all status messages at the lead unit.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to standard operation procedure of the distributed power train communications system, in the event that a remote unit did not receive the outbound message as it was originally transmitted from the lead unit or as the message was successively repeated by the remote units, a non-receiving remote unit will not have a status message to report back to the lead unit. The lead unit expects a status message from each of the remote units and can determine from the received status messages (each remote unit status message includes a remote unit identifier) which if any of the remote units did not receive the command message. Thus if the lead unit does not receive a status message from one or more remotes, the command is retransmitted by the lead unit. According to one embodiment, the lead operator is informed of this remote unit miss by an appropriate indication on a lead unit display.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As can be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, a status message transmitted by a remote unit may be received by remote units in addition to the intended receiving remote unit, i.e., where the intended receiving remote unit is that remote unit adjacent to the transmitting remote unit in a direction toward the lead unit of the train. For example, in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> distributed power train having four remote units, both remote units two and three may receive the status message transmitted by the remote unit four. Remote unit two stores the remote four status message until its designated transmitting time slot or until a designated time interval from receipt of the message from the last remote to transmit the message. Thus remote unit two may receive the remote four status message twice: (1) when initially transmitted by the remote unit four, and (2) when retransmitted by remote unit three. The capability of multiple receptions of a status message improves the probability that the lead unit receives the status message from each remote unit that received the command message.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one embodiment, a remote unit receiving the message twice, as described immediately above, compares the two messages, byte by byte. Each byte of the message includes an error detection code (for example, a parity check), thus permitting a determination that each byte is error-free (the parity check indicated that no errors had occurred) or contains errors (the parity check indicated that at least one error occurred). If a byte in a first message failed the parity check and the same byte in a second message passed the parity check, then the failed byte in the first message is replaced by the correct byte from the second message.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another embodiment, a message is received at both antennas <b>29</b>A and <b>29</b>B and processed through associated transceivers <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B of any of the remote locomotives <b>15</b>, <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B and <b>12</b>C and the lead locomotive <b>14</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Both messages are the processed through the lead station <b>30</b> or the remote station <b>32</b>, as appropriate, where the two messages are compared byte by byte. Each byte of each message includes an error detection code (for example, a parity check), thus permitting a determination that a byte is error-free (the parity check indicating that no errors were present) or a byte contains at least one error (the parity check indicating that at least one error is present). If a byte in a first message failed the parity check and the same byte in a second message passed the parity check, then the failed byte in the first message is replaced by the correct byte from the second message to assemble a corrected message. The corrected message is then processed through the associated lead station <b>30</b> or the remote station <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a table indicating the relative transmission order, delay time, and message content for the message priority protocol for on-board message repeating for a train comprising one lead locomotive and four remote locomotives as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, when a remote unit transmits, the time delay period from the third column of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for each later-transmitting remote is decremented as explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The time delay between the end of a transmission from one unit and the beginning of a transmission from another unit is 50 msec in the illustrated embodiment. As each remote unit transmits, the time delay for each subsequent remote to transmit is reduced by 50 msec thus allowing each remote unit to transmit in order while maintaining 50 msec between each unit's transmission. If a remote unit does not transmit after its defined time delay then each subsequent remote recognizes this and adjusts its own time delay accordingly when a subsequent unit's transmission is received.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, if remote unit one does not transmit, remote unit two waits 100 msec from the end of the lead unit transmission before it transmits. If remote unit two transmits, then each subsequently transmitting remote unit recognizes that two remotes should have transmitted in this time frame and subtracts 100 msec from its time delay; remote unit three transmits 50 msec (150&#x2212;100 msec) after the end of the remote unit two transmission, with remote four transmit delay adjusted to 100 msec (200&#x2212;100 msec) after the end of the remote unit two transmission, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">But if remote unit two does not transmit (and remote unit one did not transmit) then remote unit three is set to transmit 150 msec after the end of the lead unit transmission and when remote unit three transmits each subsequently transmitting remote unit recognizes that three remote units should have transmitted in this time frame and each subtracts 150 msec from its time delay.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Finally, if the remote units one, two and three do not transmit, then remote unit four waits 200 msec from the end of the lead unit transmission to transmit and when remote four transmits each subsequently transmitting remote unit will recognize that four remote units should have transmitted in this time frame and each therefore subtracts 200 msec from its time delay.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In another example, if the lead unit and the first remote unit transmit, then the second remote unit transmits at 100&#x2212;50=50 msec from the end of the first remote transmission. The third and fourth remote units also subtract 50 msec from their delay period and they are set to transmit at 100 msec and 150 msec, respectively, from the end of the first remote transmission if remote unit two does not transmit.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When the second remote units transmits 50 msec after the end of the first remote transmission, then all subsequent remotes subtract 50 msec from their previously adjusted time delay (i.e., the previous adjustment of subtracting 50 msec due to the transmission of remote unit one) and the third remote unit transmits at 100&#x2212;50=50 msec. from the end of the second remote transmission. The fourth remote unit also subtract 50 msec from its previously adjusted delay and is set to transmit at 150&#x2212;50 msec=100 msec, from the end of the second remote transmission if remote unit three does not transmit. When the third remote units transmits 50 msec after the end of the second remote transmission, then all subsequent remotes again subtract 50 msec from their previously adjusted time delay and the fourth remote unit transmits at 100&#x2212;50=50 msec from the end of the third remote transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Generally, as each remote unit transmits and the message is received by all other remote units, then each remote unit that has not yet transmitted the message subtracts 50 msec from its assigned time delay period. This shortening of the time delay period reduces the time required for the message to leap frog up and down the train.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Consider a scenario where one or more remote units do not transmit. For example assume the lead unit transmits a command message and 50 msec after the command message ends remote unit one transmits the command message. At this point each remote unit has heard the transmission from remote unit one and therefore has subtracted 50 msec from its assigned time delay. Assume further that remote unit two did not transmit 50 msec after remote unit one ended its transmission. Remote unit three has therefore reduced its time delay to 150&#x2212;50=100 msec, where the 50 msec reduction is due to the transmission by remote unit one. Remote unit three will transmit 100 msec after the end of the last transmission, which in this case is the transmission from remote unit one.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Assume instead that remote unit one did not transmit the message from the lead unit and remote unit two did not transmit the message. Remote unit three therefor transmits at 150 msec from the end of the lead unit transmission. Remote unit four subtracts 150 msec (due to recognizing that remote <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> should have transmitted in this time frame) from its assigned time delay; 200&#x2212;150=50 msec. Remote unit four will transmit 50 msec after the end of the remote unit three transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As can be seen, the 50 msec interval is a sliding interval, such that whenever a remote unit transmits a signal, the next remote waits 50 msec from the end of the transmission before initiating its transmission. If a remote unit does not transmit a signal then the subsequent remote units wait their assigned time delay period less 50 msec for each remote unit that transmitted or should have transmitted the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to a variant of the OBMR protocol described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, during the period when status messages are transmitted by the remote units in the direction of the lead unit, the outbound command message is also transmitted by the remote units to maximize the opportunity for each remote unit to receive the command message. This scenario, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, extends the time between transmission of the command message from the lead unit and receipt of the remote status messages at the lead unit, with the benefit of increasing the probability that each remote unit receives the outbound message.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a timing diagram for the message priority protocol for on-board message repeater for a train comprising a lead locomotive and three remote locomotives. The implementation principles for a distributed power train comprising three remote units are identical to the implementation for a four remote unit distributed power train as described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As can be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> wherein the remote units retransmit the command message can also be applied to a train comprising a lead unit and three remote locomotives (or a train comprising any number of remote units).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a timing diagram for the normal communications timing protocol when operative with the off-board message repeater <b>26</b> described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The lead unit transmits a command message during time interval <b>200</b> that is received and retransmitted by the message repeater <b>26</b> during time interval <b>202</b>. Each of four remote units receives the repeated command message and responds with its status message during its allotted time slot. The repeater <b>26</b> receives all the remote unit status messages and retransmits them for receiving by the lead unit <b>14</b> during time interval <b>206</b>, after which the message interval ends.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A utility message <b>210</b> referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a message sent by the repeater <b>26</b> to all lead units in radio range of the repeater <b>26</b>, causing all receiving lead units to delay transmissions. For example, the utility message prevents a lead unit that is outside of a tunnel from transmitting simultaneously with a remote unit that is inside the tunnel.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> compares message delay times of the prior art normal message protocol, the OBMR protocol of embodiments of the present inventive subject matter, and the normal message timing protocol when operative with the off-board message repeater.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In other embodiments, a communications system inventive subject matter further comprises an antenna/radio diversity feature and/or a signal selection feature that are advantageous to overcome signal transmission path impairments such as caused by multi-path signal propagation, signal reflections and signal obstructions (such as due to a locomotive-mounted pantograph for supplying electrical power to the locomotive from overhead power cables).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Each consist of two locomotives comprises a forward locomotive <b>250</b>A/<b>250</b>B/<b>250</b>C and a rearward locomotive <b>252</b>A/<b>252</b>B/<b>252</b>C (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), each locomotive further comprising a forward radio <b>260</b>A/<b>260</b>B/<b>260</b>C and a rearward radio <b>262</b>A/<b>262</b>B/<b>262</b>C, each forward radio operative in conjunction with an antenna <b>266</b>A/<b>266</b>B/<b>266</b>C and each rearward radio operative in conjunction with an antenna <b>268</b>A/<b>268</b>B/<b>268</b>C, respectively for receiving messages sent from other locomotives of a train <b>270</b>. The consist locomotives are coupled by an MU (multiple unit) cable <b>253</b>A/<b>253</b>B/<b>253</b>C. According to conventional railroad parlance, the forward locomotive <b>250</b>A/<b>250</b>B/<b>250</b>C is designated the &#x201c;A&#x201d; unit controlling the locomotive <b>252</b>A/<b>252</b>B/<b>252</b>C or &#x201c;B&#x201d; unit by control signals initiated by the train operator in the &#x201c;A&#x201d; unit and supplied to the &#x201c;B&#x201d; unit over the MU cable <b>253</b>A/<b>253</b>B/<b>253</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">It is noted that the concepts described herein also apply to a single locomotive comprising two radios and associated two antennas, one located at each end of the locomotive, with a pantograph or another obstruction located between the two antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When the communications system is activated, the forward radios <b>260</b>A/<b>260</b>B/<b>260</b>C and the rearward radios <b>262</b>A/<b>262</b>B/<b>262</b>C in each locomotive consist are activated. Thus both radios in each consist receive messages transmitted by other units in the train <b>270</b>. Both the forward radios <b>260</b>A/<b>260</b>B/<b>260</b>C and the rearward radios <b>262</b>A/<b>262</b>B/<b>262</b>C determine a signal quality metric (such as the signal strength, hit error rate, or the reception of valid data) for each received message. The signal quality metrics are compared in a comparator/processor <b>276</b>A/<b>276</b>B/<b>276</b>C, and the message having the better signal quality metric is selected as the operative message for use by the locomotives consist.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">According to a preferred embodiment, the signal quality metric is determined for all messages received at the forward radios <b>260</b>A/<b>260</b>B/<b>260</b>C and the rearward radios <b>262</b>A/<b>262</b>B/<b>262</b>C to select the operative message for that consist. For example, each received radio message can be verified to be correct by subjecting the message to an error detection and correction algorithm, followed by processing according to aspects of the present inventive subject matter to determine the signal quality metric of the signal received at each radio of the consist, from which the operative message for the consist is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Alternatively, in lieu of processing the entire signal for determining the signal quality metric, only a first group of message bits are analyzed to determine the signal quality metric of the message. The message with the better signal quality metric is selected as the operative message for the consist.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Typically, outbound messages are transmitted from the antenna/radio <b>268</b>A/<b>262</b>A of the lead consist and status messages are transmitted from the antennas/radios <b>266</b>B/<b>260</b>B and <b>266</b>C/<b>260</b>C of the remote consists. In yet another embodiment, to minimize interference that can disrupt accurate reception of received signals, one of the antennas <b>266</b>A/<b>266</b>B/<b>266</b>C (and the corresponding radio <b>260</b>A/<b>20</b>B/<b>260</b>C) or one of the antenna <b>268</b>A/<b>268</b>B/<b>268</b>C (and the corresponding radio <b>262</b>A/<b>262</b>B/<b>262</b>C) is selected as the transmitting antenna in response to a desired direction for the transmitted signal. Note that the antennas <b>266</b>A/<b>266</b>B/<b>266</b>C are disposed proximate a forward end of the associated locomotive consist (assuming a direction of travel indicated by the arrowhead <b>11</b>) and the antennas <b>268</b>A/<b>268</b>B/<b>268</b>C are disposed at a rearward end of the associated locomotive consist.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The radio <b>260</b>A/<b>260</b>B/<b>260</b>C/<b>262</b>A/<b>262</b>B/<b>262</b>C determines an intended direction for the transmitted signal (e.g., inbound or outbound based on the type of signal and/or information contained in the signal) and selects the transmitting antenna/radio that is closest to the intended receiving antenna/radio. For example, if the locomotive consist comprising the locomotives <b>250</b>A and <b>252</b>A is the lead consist and it is desired to transmit an outbound message to the locomotive consist comprising the locomotives <b>250</b>B and <b>252</b>B, then the antenna/radio <b>260</b>A/<b>262</b>A is selected as the operative antenna. This feature can be especially beneficial when each locomotive comprises a pantograph <b>280</b> for supplying current to the locomotives from an overhead current source (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). According to this embodiment, an antenna (and corresponding radio) is selected such that the desired signal direction is away from the pantograph. As a further example, if the remote locomotive consist comprising the locomotives <b>250</b>B and <b>252</b>B is to send a signal to the locomotive consist comprising the locomotives <b>250</b>A and <b>252</b>A, then the antenna/radio <b>266</b>B/<b>260</b>B is selected as the operative antenna/radio.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the method for implementing the signal selection function according to one embodiment of the present inventive subject matter. In one embodiment, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> method is implemented in a microprocessor and associated memory elements within the locomotives of the railroad train, for example, within the locomotives <b>260</b>A/<b>260</b>B/<b>260</b>C/<b>262</b>A/<b>262</b>B/<b>262</b>C. In such an embodiment the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> steps represent a program stored in the memory element and operable in the microprocessor. When implemented in a microprocessor, program code configures the microprocessor to create logical and arithmetic operations to process the flow chart steps.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> flow chart begins at a step <b>300</b> where the communications system is activated, thus the forward radios (<b>260</b>A/<b>260</b>B/<b>260</b>C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) and the rearward radios (<b>262</b>A/<b>262</b>B/<b>262</b>C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) in each locomotive consist are activated. As indicated at a step <b>302</b>, both radios in each consist receive messages transmitted by other units in the train <b>270</b>. As indicated at a step <b>304</b>, both the forward radios and the rearward radios determine a signal quality metric (such as the signal strength, bit error rate, or the reception of valid data) for each received message.
