<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate to the enhancement of vehicle guidance systems. More particularly, the invention relates to correcting global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data using the measured or simulated attitude of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A global navigation satellite system (GNSS), such as the global positioning system (GPS), is an electronic satellite navigation system which permits users to determine their position with respect to the Earth. Global positioning may be determined with a GNSS receiver which detects and decodes signals from a number of satellites orbiting the Earth. The signals from each of these satellites indicate the position of the satellite and the time at which the signals were sent. GNSS receivers may calculate latitude, longitude, and altitude based on satellite signals. This information is often used in vehicle guidance systems to guide a vehicle and direct it to perform certain tasks at a particular position. For example, an agricultural vehicle may be guided to a precise position by a GNSS receiver and commanded to drop a seed at that particular position.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Discrepancies may arise between the position information provided to the guidance system by the GNSS receiver and the actual ground position of the vehicle. Particularly, when the vehicle is on an incline, the calculated latitude and longitude position of the GNSS receiver may not be the same as the actual latitude and longitude ground position of the vehicle. These discrepancies can cause a vehicle guidance system utilizing GNSS information to inaccurately guide and instruct the vehicle, because the guidance system assumes that the GNSS receiver latitude and longitude position is the same as the vehicle ground position.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly there is a need for a method of correcting position information provided to the vehicle guidance system by GNSS that does not suffer from the problems and limitations of the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention provide an enhanced vehicle guidance system that uses information from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, such as latitude, longitude, and altitude, to infer or simulate attitude information without the use of an inertial sensor. Additionally, the enhanced guidance system may provide inertial correction factors to correct discrepancies in GNSS receiver position values caused by uneven terrain. The invention may also take advantage of the fact that topology (i.e. the rolling and pitching profile) of a field typically does not appreciably change from year to year. The guidance system therefore may use pre-recorded associated position and attitude information to increase the robustness of high-end position systems and remove the extra inertial sensor in lower cost positioning systems while still compensating for terrain undulation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An exemplary embodiment of the enhanced vehicle guidance system may comprise a position-determining component such as a GNSS receiver and a data processor with data storage and data processing capabilities. A method of enhancing a vehicle's guidance system without using an inertial sensor may comprise measuring the altitude, latitude, and longitude of the position-determining component for each of a plurality of positions; calculating the incline angle between adjacent points; and using the calculated incline angles to infer the attitude of the vehicle at any of the plurality of positions to compensate for GNSS position inaccuracies induced as a result of the vehicle rolling and pitching on uneven terrain.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, the altitude, latitude, and longitude of the plurality of positions may be plotted to create a topology map or terrain profile. By recording the altitude, latitude, longitude, and attitude information for each of the plurality of positions, the data processor may access this data upon subsequent visits to these positions such that the system may look-up the stored attitude for a given position without recalculating the attitude and without using an inertial sensor. The data processor may also calculate attitude information of an intermediate position point between the plurality of positions by curve fitting the recorded data or using algorithms to interpolate the intermediate point. The curve-fitted or interpolated intermediate point is then used with the neighboring points' data to determine or approximate the attitude information.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">At any given position at time (T) the attitude information may be read from an inertial sensor or simulated from the GNSS data and applied substantially in real-time to calculate the actual ground position at time (T). To solve for the corrected position, an inertial correction factor at time (T) is calculated from the attitude information and is added to the GNSS-calculated position at time (T). Additionally, the inertial correction factors for a plurality of positions may be recorded and later accessed by the data processor upon subsequent visits to these positions such that the system may look-up the stored inertial correction factor for a given GNSS-calculated position without recalculating this correction factor. Alternatively, the calculated ground position for a given GNSS-calculated position may be recorded and later accessed by the data processor upon subsequent visits to that position.</p>

For example, the vehicle guidance system implemented in a harvesting vehicle may adjust its blade altitude just before an upcoming undulation in a field, instead of making this adjustment after the undulation is sensed.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The drawing figures do not limit the present invention to the specific embodiments disclosed and described herein. The drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon clearly illustrating the principles of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The following detailed description of the invention references the accompanying drawing figures that illustrate specific embodiments in which the present invention can be practiced. The embodiments are intended to describe aspects of the invention in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments can be utilized and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, provide an enhanced vehicle guidance system <b>10</b> preferably incorporated as part of a land-based vehicle <b>12</b> such as an agricultural vehicle, automobile, all-terrain vehicle, or any other type of land-based vehicle known in the art. The vehicle guidance system <b>10</b> can be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. An exemplary embodiment of the vehicle guidance system <b>10</b> may include a position-determining component <b>14</b> and a computing device <b>16</b>. The enhanced guidance system <b>10</b> is operable to compensate for discrepancies, caused by uneven terrain, between the latitude and longitude of the position-determining component <b>14</b> and the actual ground position latitude and longitude of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The vehicle guidance system <b>10</b> may also include a display <b>18</b>, memory <b>20</b>, a user interface <b>22</b>, a power source <b>24</b>, and one or more I/O ports <b>26</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The position-determining component <b>14</b>, which may be mounted to an elevated portion of the vehicle <b>12</b>, determines positions of the vehicle guidance system <b>10</b> as it is moved from place to place and generates and sends corresponding position data to the computing device <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, the position-determining component <b>14</b> may be a satellite navigation receiver that works with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) such as the global positioning system (GPS) primarily used in the United States, the GLONASS system primarily used in the Soviet Union, or the Galileo system primarily used in Europe.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a representative view of a GNSS denoted generally by reference numeral <b>28</b>. A plurality of satellites <b>30</b> are in orbit about the Earth <b>32</b>. The orbit of each satellite is not necessarily synchronous with the orbits of other satellites and, in fact is likely asynchronous. The position-determining component <b>14</b> is shown as a GNSS receiver, receiving spread spectrum GNSS satellite signals from the various satellites <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The spread spectrum signals continuously transmitted from each satellite <b>30</b> utilize a highly accurate frequency standard accomplished with an extremely accurate atomic clock. Each satellite <b>30</b>, as part of its data signal transmission, transmits a data stream indicative of that particular satellite. In various embodiments, as a GNSS receiver, the position-determining component <b>14</b> must acquire spread spectrum GNSS satellite signals from at least three satellites for the position-determining component <b>14</b> to calculate its two-dimensional position by triangulation. Acquisition of an additional signal, resulting in signals from a total of four satellites, permits the position-determining component <b>14</b> to calculate its three-dimensional position. The position-determining component <b>14</b> may include an antenna to assist in receiving the satellite signals. The antenna may be any type of antenna that can be used with navigational devices.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The position-determining component <b>14</b> is operable to receive navigational signals from the GNSS satellites <b>30</b> and to calculate positions of the position-determining component <b>14</b> as a function of the signals. The position determining component <b>14</b> may send these calculated positions to the computing device <b>16</b> to determine track logs or any other series of geographic coordinates corresponding to points along a path traveled by the vehicle <b>12</b>. The computing device <b>16</b> is also operable to calculate routes to desired positions, provide instructions to navigate to the desired positions, display maps and other information on the display screen <b>18</b>, and execute other functions described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although one embodiment of the vehicle guidance system <b>10</b> describes the position-determining component <b>14</b> as a GNSS receiver, it is noted that equivalents may be employed and substitutions made without departing from the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. For example, in other embodiments of the invention, the position determining component <b>14</b> need not directly determine its current geographic position. For instance, the position determining component <b>14</b> may determine the current geographic position by receiving position information directly from the user, through a communications network, or from another electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The position determining component <b>14</b> may include one or more processors, controllers, or other computing devices and memory so that it may calculate position and other geographic information without the computing device <b>16</b> or it may utilize the components of the computing device <b>16</b>. Further, the position determining component <b>14</b> may be integral with the computing device <b>16</b> such that the position determining component may be operable to specifically perform the various functions described herein. Thus, the computing device <b>16</b> and position determining component <b>14</b> can be combined or be separate or otherwise discrete elements.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The display <b>18</b> is coupled with the computing device <b>16</b> and is operable to display various information corresponding to the vehicle <b>12</b> and its guidance system <b>10</b>, such as maps, positions, and directions as described below. The display <b>18</b> may comprise conventional black and white, monochrome, or color display elements including CRT, TFT, LCD, and/or plasma display devices. Preferably, the display <b>18</b> is of sufficient size to enable the user to easily view it while driving the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The display <b>18</b> may be integrated with the user interface <b>22</b>, such as in embodiments where the display <b>18</b> is a touch-screen display to enable the user to interact with it by touching or pointing at display areas to provide information to the guidance system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The computing device <b>16</b> may include any number of processors, controllers, integrated circuits, programmable logic devices, or other computing devices and resident or external memory for storing data and other information accessed and/or generated by the vehicle guidance system <b>10</b>. The computing device <b>16</b> is preferably coupled with the position-determining component <b>14</b>, the display <b>18</b>, the memory <b>20</b>, the user interface <b>22</b>, and other components through wired or wireless connections, such as a data bus <b>34</b>, to enable information to be exchanged between the various components.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The computing device <b>16</b> may implement a computer program and/or code segments to perform the functions described herein. The computer program preferably comprises an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions in the computing device. The computer program can be embodied in any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, and execute the instructions. In the context of this application, a &#x201c;computer-readable medium&#x201d; can be any means that can contain, store, communicate, propagate or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer-readable medium can be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electro-magnetic, infrared, or semi-conductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific, although not inclusive, examples of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable, programmable, read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, and a portable compact disk read-only memory (CDROM).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The memory <b>20</b> may be integral with the position determining component <b>14</b>, integral with the computing device <b>16</b>, stand-alone memory, or a combination of both. The memory may include, for example, removable and non-removable memory elements such as RAM, ROM, flash, magnetic, optical, USB memory devices, and/or other conventional memory elements.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The memory <b>20</b> may store various data associated with operation of the guidance system <b>10</b>, such as the computer program and code segments mentioned above, or other data for instructing the computing device <b>16</b> and system elements to perform the steps described herein. Further, the memory <b>20</b> may store various cartographic data corresponding to geographic positions including map data, and map elements, such as thoroughfares, terrain, alert positions, points of interest, geographic entities, radio stations, and other navigation data to facilitate the various navigation functions provided by the vehicle guidance system <b>10</b>. Additionally, the memory <b>20</b> may store destination addresses and previously calculated or otherwise acquired routes to various destination addresses for later retrieval by the computing device <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The various data stored within the memory <b>20</b> may be associated within one or more databases to facilitate retrieval of the information. For example, the databases may be configured to enable the computing device <b>16</b> to automatically access attitude information based upon a current geographic position of the position-determining component <b>14</b> as discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The user interface <b>22</b> permits a user to operate the vehicle guidance system <b>10</b> and enables users, third parties, or other devices to share information with the guidance system <b>10</b>. The user interface <b>22</b> may comprise one or more functionable inputs such as buttons, switches, scroll wheels, a touch screen associated with the display <b>18</b>, voice recognition elements such as a microphone, pointing devices such as mice, touchpads, trackballs, styluses, a camera such as a digital or film still or video camera, combinations thereof, etc. Further, the user interface <b>22</b> may comprise wired or wireless data transfer elements such as removable memory including the memory <b>20</b>, data transceivers, etc, to enable the user and other devices or parties to remotely interface with the guidance system <b>10</b>. The device may also include a speaker for providing audible instructions and feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The user interface <b>22</b> may be operable to provide various information to the user utilizing the display <b>18</b> or other visual or audio elements such as a speaker.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, the user interface <b>22</b> enables the user and guidance system <b>10</b> to exchange information relating to the guidance system <b>10</b>, including geographic entities, configuration information, security information, preferences, route information, points of interests, alerts and alert notification, navigation information, waypoints, a destination address, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The power source <b>24</b> provides electrical power to various guidance system <b>10</b> elements. For example, the power source <b>24</b> may be directly or indirectly coupled with the position-determining component <b>14</b>, the display <b>18</b>, the computing device <b>16</b>, the memory <b>20</b>, and the user interface <b>22</b>. The power source <b>24</b> may comprise conventional power supply elements, such as batteries, battery packs, etc. The power source <b>24</b> may also comprise power conduits, connectors, and receptacles operable to receive batteries, battery connectors, or power cables.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The I/O ports <b>26</b> permit data and other information to be transferred to and from the computing device <b>16</b> and the position determining component <b>14</b>. The I/O ports <b>26</b> may include a TransFlash card slot for receiving removable TransFlash cards and a USB port for coupling with a USB cable connected to another computing device such as a personal computer. Navigational software, cartographic maps, and other data and information may be loaded in the guidance system <b>10</b> via the I/O ports.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and described herein need not be physically connected to one another since wireless communication among the various depicted components is permissible and intended to fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In operation, the position-determining component <b>14</b> may provide, in a conventional manner, geographic position information based on signals received from two or more members of an array of orbiting satellites. The position-determining component <b>14</b> may obtain data related to the latitude, longitude, and altitude of the elevated portion of the vehicle <b>12</b> and then send that data to the computing device <b>16</b>. Then the computing device <b>16</b> may use measured or simulated vehicle attitude information to compensate for discrepancies, due to uneven terrain, between the latitude and longitude of the position-determining component <b>14</b> and the actual ground position latitude and longitude of the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the vehicle <b>12</b>, with the position-determining component <b>14</b>, positioned on level terrain. When the terrain is level, the latitude and longitude coordinates of a ground position <b>36</b> of the vehicle are the same as the latitude and longitude coordinates of a calculated position <b>38</b> of the position-determining component <b>14</b>. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the ground over which the vehicle travels is tilted, sloped, or uneven, the calculated latitude and longitude position <b>38</b> of the position-determining component <b>14</b> may differ from the actual latitude and longitude ground position <b>36</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, notice the difference between the actual ground position <b>16</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b> and the calculated latitude and longitude position <b>18</b> of the position-determining component <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">These discrepancies can cause the vehicle guidance system <b>10</b> to inaccurately guide and instruct the vehicle <b>12</b>. For example, the guidance system of the agricultural vehicle <b>12</b> on uneven terrain as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may read that the latitude and longitude are currently at latitude and longitude position <b>38</b> and therefore incorrectly drop seeds at ground position <b>36</b>, because the system assumes that the position-determining component's latitude and longitude position <b>38</b> is the same as the vehicle ground position <b>36</b>. Therefore, to compensate for these discrepancies, in various embodiments of the invention, the computing device <b>16</b> calculates an inertial correction factor for each calculated position-determining component position <b>38</b> in order to calculate the ground position <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to one embodiment of the invention, a method for enhancing a vehicle guidance system may comprise the steps of: calculating a first position of the elevated portion of the vehicle <b>12</b>; calculating a second position of the elevated portion of the vehicle <b>12</b> after the vehicle <b>12</b> has moved; calculating an incline angle based on the first position and the second position without the use of an angle-measuring device; using the incline angle to infer the attitude of the vehicle <b>12</b>; and calculating a ground position <b>36</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b> based on the attitude of the vehicle <b>12</b>. However, alternatively, attitude information (such as roll angle and pitch angle) may be obtained by traditional means known in the art such as an inertial sensor, gyroscope, inclinometer, or a combination thereof. Therefore the ground position <b>36</b> may be determined using either measured or inferred attitude information, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The step of calculating the first position of the elevated portion of the vehicle <b>12</b> may comprise the position-determining component <b>14</b> calculating altitude, latitude, and longitude information associated with the present position of the elevated portion of the vehicle <b>12</b> then providing this information to the computing device <b>16</b>. The computing device <b>16</b> may be programmed to retrieve current altitude, latitude, and longitude of the elevated portion of the vehicle <b>12</b> from the position-determining component <b>14</b> at predetermined time or distance intervals. Alternatively, a user may use the user interface <b>22</b> to indicate to the computing device <b>16</b> when new position data should be retrieved from the position-determining component <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Then, to obtain the second position of the elevated portion of the vehicle <b>12</b> after the vehicle <b>12</b> has moved, the position-determining device <b>14</b> may again calculate altitude, latitude, and longitude information associated with the present position of the elevated portion of the vehicle <b>12</b>, then provide this information to the computing device <b>16</b>. Both the first position and the second position may be stored in the memory <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The computing device <b>16</b> may then calculate the incline angle based on the altitudes, latitudes, and longitudes for the first position and the second position using algebraic and geometric mathematical expressions as known in the art. This calculated angle may be used to infer the attitude of the vehicle <b>12</b> when the vehicle is located at or between the first position and the second position. This method of inferring the attitude of the vehicle <b>10</b> may be repeated for a plurality of positions, such that each angle or slope between adjacent positions is calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a first recorded position <b>40</b>, a second recorded position <b>42</b>, a third recorded position <b>44</b>, and a fourth recorded position <b>46</b>. Each of these recorded positions <b>40</b>-<b>46</b> may be stored in the memory <b>20</b>. Using the difference in altitude and distance between the first recorded position <b>40</b> and the second recorded position <b>42</b>, a first pitch angle <b>48</b> may be calculated. Additionally, the difference in altitude and distance between the second recorded position <b>42</b> and the third recorded position <b>44</b> may be used to calculate a second pitch angle <b>50</b>, and the difference in altitude and distance between the third recorded position <b>44</b> and the fourth recorded position <b>46</b> may be used to calculate a third pitch angle <b>52</b>. A similar method may be used to determine roll angles of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The above-described method of inferring attitude information provides the ability to remove inertial sensors from low-cost vehicle guidance systems. Alternatively, an area of land may be &#x201c;surveyed&#x201d; one time for a nominal fee with equipment having inertial sensors. Then the customer may use a lower-cost system without an inertial sensor, but utilize the recorded position/attitude data from the survey to correct the lower-cost system's GNSS-calculated position information.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In various embodiments of the invention, attitude information may be used by the computing device <b>16</b> to calculate the ground position <b>36</b> of the vehicle by calculating an inertial correction factor, thereby compensating for discrepancies as a result of the vehicle rolling and pitching. So, at any given position at time (T), the attitude information at time (T) may be used to calculate the inertial correction factor at time (T), and the inertial correction factor at time (T) may be added to the calculated position <b>38</b> at time (T) to determine the actual ground position <b>36</b> at time (T). For example:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Position<sub>ground</sub>(<i>T</i>)=Position<sub>GNSS</sub>(<i>T</i>)+Inertial<sub>correction</sub>(<i>T</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Where:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0056">Position<sub>ground</sub>(T) is the actual ground position <b>36</b> at time (T),</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0057">Position<sub>GNSS</sub>(T) is the calculated position <b>38</b> of the position-determining component at time (T), and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0058">Inertial<sub>correction</sub>(T) is the inertial correction factor at time (T).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0059">The inertial correction factor is therefore the difference between the GNSS-calculated position <b>38</b> at time (T) and the actual ground position <b>36</b> at time (T). Therefore the attitude information (such as roll angle and pitch angle) may be used in algebraic or geographic equations to determine the difference between the latitude and longitude of the calculated position <b>38</b> and the latitude and longitude of the ground position <b>36</b>. Furthermore, this distance may be broken into its x, y, and z components (latitude, longitude, and altitude components) using mathematical equations known in the art, and the latitude and longitude components may be added to the corresponding latitude and longitude of the calculated position <b>38</b> to determine the actual ground position <b>36</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0060">Any of the attitude information, position information, inertial correction factor, and calculated ground position <b>36</b> may be stored in the data storage component. Furthermore, upon subsequent visits to a recorded position, the computing device <b>16</b> may retrieve any of the data associated with the recorded position from the memory <b>20</b> and may output the ground position <b>36</b>, the inertial correction factor, and/or the attitude information associated with the position of the position-determining component.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0061">Additionally, data stored in the memory <b>20</b> may be compiled to form a terrain profile of rolling and pitching, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which may be graphically displayed on the display <b>18</b>. Additionally a gradient overlay may be extracted from the position data as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. However, position data does not need to be collected for every square inch of an area, as algorithms can be used to interpolate the intermediate point (latitude, longitude, and altitude) data between the recorded data. This position data may then be used along with the neighboring positions' data to determine the attitude information.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0062">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a first data point <b>54</b>, a second data point <b>56</b>, a third data point <b>58</b>, and a fourth data point <b>60</b> may form a surface normal <b>62</b> which may be extrapolated using the latitude, longitude, and altitude information for each of these data points <b>54</b>-<b>60</b>. Calculating this surface normal <b>62</b> allows the computing device <b>16</b> to determine the effective roll <b>64</b> and effective pitch <b>66</b> of an intermediate point <b>68</b>. Alternatively, intermediate position data may be interpolated by curve fitting the actual recorded data, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0063">In various embodiments of the invention, comparing output from inertial sensor with previously recorded data could improve the system robustness. Additionally, prerecorded position and/or attitude data may be used to &#x201c;look ahead&#x201d; and preempt any variations in undulation so that performance is maximized, rather than reacting when the undulations are just becoming apparent to the vehicle. For example, the vehicle guidance system implemented in a harvesting vehicle may adjust its blade height just before an upcoming undulation in a field, instead of making this adjustment after the undulation is sensed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0064">Although the invention has been described with reference to the embodiments illustrated in the attached drawings, it is noted that equivalents may be employed and substitutions made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as recited in the claims.</p>
