<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of treating cancer in a subject comprising the step of administering to the subject in need thereof an effective amount of a combination of a compound that binds a nuclear export signal (NES inhibitor) on topoisomerase II&#x3b1; and a topoisomerase inhibitor. Twenty small molecule inhibitors (SMI) that bind to the two nuclear export sequences (NES) topo II&#x3b1; have been identified from the NCI database using computer-generated molecular modeling. These SMI will improve the effectiveness of topo II directed therapeutics, particularly in the treatment of diseases such as multiple myeloma (MM). In vitro apoptosis assays indicate that these drugs may be effective as single agents or in combination with currently used cancer drugs that target topo II.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the field of cancer therapy. More specifically, this invention relates to small molecules that inhibit the nuclear export of topoisomerase II&#x3b1;. At least one of the disclosed molecules may be used as a chemotherapeutic agent or in a cocktail of drugs to treat cancer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Drug resistance, including resistance to topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibitors, is a major obstacle in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Topo II poisons that are used in the treatment of multiple myeloma include doxorubicin and etoposide (VP-16). Several mechanisms of resistance to topo II&#x3b1; inhibitors have been described [Rasheed Z A, et al., <i>Oncogene </i>2003; 22:7296-304; Oloumi A, et al., <i>Cancer Res </i>2000; 60:5747-53]. Cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance and stromal cell adherence are important parameters in the local bone marrow environment in patients with multiple myeloma and appear to be major determinants of drug resistance [Hazlehurst L A, et al., <i>Blood </i>2001; 98:1897-903; Hazlehurst L A, et al., <i>Cancer Res </i>2006; 66:2338-45].</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Human multiple myeloma cell density is a determinant of sensitivity to topo II inhibitors [Valkov N I, et al., <i>Br J Haematol </i>2000; 108:331-45; Turner J G, et al., <i>J Cell Sci </i>2004; 117:3061-71]. At increased cell densities, a considerable fraction of nuclear topo II&#x3b1; is exported to the cytoplasm (&#x3e;90%), resulting in reduced sensitivity to VP-16 and doxorubicin. This appears to occur both in human myeloma cell lines and in CD138<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from patients with multiple myeloma. Nuclear export of topo II&#x3b1; may contribute to drug resistance, and that resistance may not be due to differences in drug uptake, cell cycle, or cellular topo II&#x3b1; protein levels [Valkov N I, et al., <i>Br J Haematol </i>2000; 108:331-45; Turner J G, et al., <i>J Cell Sci </i>2004; 117:3061-71]. The nuclear export signals for topo II&#x3b1; are found at amino acids 1,017 to 1,028 and 1,054 to 1,066 [Turner J G, et al., <i>J Cell Sci </i>2004; 117:3061-71]. Export can be blocked by treatment of the cells with leptomycin B, indicating that a CRM1-dependent pathway mediates export [Turner J G, et al., <i>J Cell Sci </i>2004; 117:3061-71]. In the present study, we show that inhibition of CRM1-mediated export of topo II&#x3b1; may render myeloma cells both in vitro and ex vivo more sensitive to topo II-targeted chemotherapy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Use of CRM1 inhibition in cancer therapy has met with limited success. The first CRM1 inhibitor, leptomycin B, was found to efficiently inhibit nuclear export. However, leptomycin was found to have acute relative toxicities both in a human phase I trial [Newlands E S, et al., <i>Br J Cancer </i>1996; 74:648-9] and in vitro. Leptomycin B in vitro studies found acute toxicity at concentrations&#x3c;5 nmol/L for 1 hour. Therefore, in this study, we used the CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C [Turner, J et al., <i>Cancer Research </i>(2009)69(17):6899-905; Falini B, et al., <i>Blood </i>(2006)107:4514-23]. Ratjadone C has been found to inhibit nuclear export without producing apoptosis or necrosis at concentrations up to 300 nmol/L for 48 h in an in vitro assay. However, ratjadone C prevents nuclear export of topo II&#x3b1;; in this study, we show that ratjadone C also acutely sensitizes myeloma cells to the topo II inhibitors doxorubicin and VP-16. Additional low-toxicity CRM1 inhibitors are also being investigated by other laboratories and may become available for preclinical studies.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For a fuller understanding of the invention, reference should be made to the following detailed description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows intracellular trafficking of topo II&#x3b1; in log- and plateau-density myeloma cells. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, H929, U266, and 8226 human myeloma cells grown at plateau (Plat) phase (high density) export topo II&#x3b1;, whereas cells grown at log (Log) phase (low density) maintain topo II&#x3b1; in the nucleus. Cells were grown for 16 hr at log or plateau densities and treated with 2 &#x3bc;mol/L doxorubicin for 4 h (n=2). Apoptosis was determined by caspase-3 staining with the use of flow cytometry (10,000 cells). Cells that maintained nuclear topo II&#x3b1; were more sensitive to topo II&#x3b1;-targeted chemotherapy. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, cells grown at log- or plateau-phase conditions or cells treated with ratjadone C (RDC; 100 cells per experiment) were stained for topo II&#x3b1; by fluorescence microscopy (n=2). Myeloma cells grown at log-phase conditions had the majority (&#x2267;90%) of the topo II&#x3b1; in the nucleus, whereas plateau-phase cells exported topo II&#x3b1; into the cytoplasm. The CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C (5 nmol/L) was found to block export of topo II&#x3b1; in cells grown in plateau-phase conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows H929 topo II&#x3b1; immunofluorescence. H929 human myeloma cells were grown at log and plateau densities, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100, and stained for cytoskeletal protein (phalloidin; green when viewed in color), topo II&#x3b1; (TOP2A; red when viewed in color), and DNA (DAPI; blue when viewed in color). Results indicate that topo II&#x3b1; is present in the nucleus of log-density cells and is exported from the nucleus in plateau-density cells. However, nuclear export is blocked in plateau cells by the CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C (RDC) and by transfection with CRM1-specific siRNA. Under the conditions of this experiment, CRM1 siRNA knockdown was 69%.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a series of graphs that show CRM1 inhibitor sensitizes myeloma cells to doxorubicin. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, human myeloma cell lines 8226, H929, and U266 (2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL) were incubated with the CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C (RDC; 5 nmol/L) for 16 h. Cells were then treated with doxorubicin (Dox; 2 &#x3bc;mol/L) for 4 h and assayed for caspase-3 staining by flow cytometry. Cell lines were assayed in triplicate, and data from each drug combination were pooled. Ratjadone C versus control samples are statistically different (P=0.006) in A (control=1.50% and ratjadone C=3.84%). Ratjadone C was found to significantly (P=0.00005) sensitize cells to doxorubicin. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, CRM1 inhibitor sensitizes ex vivo patient myeloma cells to doxorubicin. Bone marrow aspirates (n=7) obtained from multiple myeloma patients were treated with ratjadone C (5 nmol/L) for 16 h followed by doxorubicin (2 &#x3bc;mol/L) for 4 h and assayed for cleaved caspase-3 to determine apoptosis. Cells (4&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>/mL) treated with ratjadone C only were significantly different (P=0.03) from untreated cells (control=4.97% and ratjadone C=14.31%). Cells (4&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>/mL) treated with both ratjadone C and doxorubicin were significantly (P=0.0003) more sensitive to doxorubicin (3-fold) than doxorubicin alone. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, mechanism of CRM1 and topo II&#x3b1; inhibitor synergy. Human myeloma cell lines (n=9) were incubated at high density (2&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>/mL) for 16 h with the CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C (5 nmol/L). Cell cultures were then exposed to the topo II-targeted agents VP-16 (10 &#x3bc;mol/L) for 8 h or doxorubicin (2 &#x3bc;mol/L) for 4 h and assayed for apoptosis with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay (BD Pharmingen). CRM1 inhibition by ratjadone C increased the effectiveness of DNA-damaging agents to induce apoptosis. This effect was significant for doxorubicin/ratjadone C (P=0.00019) and VP-16/ratjadone C (P=0.0185). When topo II&#x3b1; protein was reduced by topo II&#x3b1; siRNA knockdown, apoptosis was substantially decreased, suggesting that apoptosis is topo II&#x3b1; dependent.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the results of band depletion and comet assay. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, band depletion assay of the combination of ratjadone C (RDC) and VP-16 produced more DNA-topo II&#x3b1; complexes, depleting the topo II&#x3b1; band in the Western blot analysis. These data indicate that blocking nuclear export of topo II&#x3b1; will increase the effectiveness of VP-16 and induce apoptosis. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, comet assay of plateau-density H929 cells treated with ratjadone C (5 nmol/L) for 16 h and then with VP-16 (10 &#x3bc;mol/L) for 60 min. The comet moment of cells (50 per experiment) was assayed in two separate experiments for each drug combination and control samples. Comet assay is a measure of DNA cleavage. The CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C increased DNA cleavage compared to the topo II inhibitor VP-16 alone (P=0.0006).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph showing the additional drug combinations in H929 and 8226 human myeloma cell lines. H929 and 8226 human myeloma cell lines were placed at high density (4&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>) with and without 5 nmol/L ratjadone C (RDC) and incubated for 16 h (n=4 for each cell line). Cells were then incubated for 4 h with one of the following: 2 &#x3bc;mol/L doxorubicin, 10 &#x3bc;mol/L VP-16, 10 &#x3bc;mol/L melphalan, or 10 &#x3bc;mol/L Velcade. CRM1 inhibition by ratjadone C sensitized myeloma cells to the topo II&#x3b1; inhibitors doxorubicin (P=0.00005) and VP-16 (P=0.02) but not myeloma cells treated with melphalan (P=0.35) or Velcade (P=0.30).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the two nuclear export sequences, labeled sites 1 &#x26; 2 and appearing as white spheres, in the context of the native topoisomerase II&#x3b1; homodimer. A first site is found at amino acids 1017-1028 comprising the sequence <u style="single">D</u>ILRDFFELRLK (SEQ ID NO: 1) and second site is found at amino acids 1054-1066 comprising the sequence FILEKIDGKIII (SEQ ID NO: 2). The structure of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>topo II was used to create a homology model of human topo II&#x3b1; using the program PhyreA. A chemical ligand database containing approximately 140,000 small molecules (MW&#x3c;500) was then molecularly docked onto the two nuclear export sites of human DNA topo II&#x3b1; using DOCKv5.1.0. The procedure for molecular docking involved: 1) selection of structural pockets in DNA topo II&#x3b1; suitable for interactions with drug-like small molecules, and 2) molecular docking simulations where each one of approximately 140,000 small molecules is positioned in the selected structural pocket. Ten small molecule inhibitors were predicted for each NES site.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a graph showing that nuclear export signal (&#x201c;NES&#x201d;) inhibitors synergize with doxorubicin to induce apoptosis.

These small molecule NES inhibitors dock at site 1. Cells were then exposed to 0.1% DMSO or 2 &#x3bc;M doxorubicin for 4 hours. Cells were assayed by flow cytometry for activated caspase 3 (n=4).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an illustration showing an atomic homology model of human topoisomerase II&#x3b1; generated by the program Phyre. The molecular surface is colored based on sequence identity with yeast topo II calculated with clustalx and the Docker program (developed at UF). Red (dark gray in the gray-scale reproduction) represents 100% sequence identity, and colors are graded from red/orange (dark gray in the gray-scale reproduction&#x2014;very little and indistinguishable from red)/yellow (white in the gray-scale reproduction)/green (light gray in the gray-scale reproduction) and blue (medium gray in the gray-scale reproduction) which would represent no sequence identity. Nuclear export sites 1 (A) and 2 (B) were selected for high-throughput molecular docking to identify human topo II&#x3b1;-specific small molecules for functional assays.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Topoisomerase II&#x3b1; (topo II&#x3b1;) is exported from the nucleus of human myeloma cells by a CRM1-dependent mechanism at cellular densities similar to those found in patient bone marrow. When topo II&#x3b1; is trafficked to the cytoplasm, it is not in contact with the DNA. Thus, topo II&#x3b1; inhibitors are unable to induce DNA-cleavable complexes and cell death. Using a CRM1 inhibitor or a CRM1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), nuclear export of topo II&#x3b1; can be blocked as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. Human myeloma cell lines and patient myeloma cells isolated from bone marrow were treated with a CRM1 inhibitor or CRM1-specific siRNA and exposed to doxorubicin or etoposide at high cell densities. CRM1-treated cell lines or myeloma patient cells were 4-fold more sensitive to topo II poisons as determined by an activated caspase assay. Normal cells were not significantly affected by CRM1-topo II inhibitor combination treatment. Cell death was correlated with increased DNA double-strand breaks as shown by the comet assay. Band depletion assays of CRM1 inhibitor-exposed myeloma cells showed increased topo II&#x3b1; covalently bound to DNA. Topo II&#x3b1; knockdown by a topo II&#x3b1;-specific siRNA abrogated the CRM1-topo II therapy synergistic effect. These results suggest that blocking topo II&#x3b1; nuclear export sensitizes myeloma cells to topo II inhibitors. This method of sensitizing myeloma cells provides a new therapeutic approach to multiple myeloma.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The term &#x201c;refractory&#x201d; as used herein is used to define a cancer for which treatment (e.g. chemotherapy drugs, biological agents, and/or radiation therapy) has proven to be ineffective. A refractory cancer tumor may shrink, but not to the point where the treatment is determined to be effective. Typically however, the tumor stays the same size as it was before treatment (stable disease), or it grows (progressive disease).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Dosage</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A person of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine an appropriate dose of one of the instant compositions to administer to a subject without undue experimentation. Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy. The dosages disclosed herein are exemplary of the average case. There can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The anti-cancer agent or treatment will typically be administered to the patient in a dose regimen that provides for the most effective treatment of the cancer (from both efficacy and safety perspectives) for which the patient is being treated, as known in the art. In conducting the treatment method of the present invention, the anti-cancer agent or treatment can be administered in any effective manner known in the art, such as by oral, topical, intravenous, intra-peritoneal, intramuscular, intra-articular, subcutaneous, intranasal, intra-ocular, vaginal, rectal, or intradermal routes, depending upon the type of cancer being treated, the type of anti-cancer agent or treatment being used, and the medical judgment of the prescribing physician as based, e.g., on the results of published clinical studies. When the anti-cancer agent or treatment is radiation or a radiochemical, the agent or treatment can be administered in any effective manner known in the art, as described briefly herein, above.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The anti-cancer agent or treatment can be administered with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays, creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Administration of such dosage forms can be carried out in single or multiple doses. Carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc. Oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The anti-cancer agent or treatment can be combined together with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of sprays, creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, and the like. Administration of such dosage forms can be carried out in single or multiple doses. Carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media, and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising anti-cancer agents or treatments are known in the art. Methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions are also known in the art. In view of the teaching of the present invention, methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising both a anti-cancer agent or treatment and an NES inhibitor that sensitizes tumor cells to the pro-apoptotic effects of the anti-cancer agent or treatment will be apparent from the art, from other known standard references, such as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 18<sup>th </sup>edition (1990).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For oral administration of the anti-cancer agent or treatment or the NES inhibitor that sensitizes cells to the pro-apoptotic effects of the anti-cancer agent or treatment, tablets containing one or both of the active agents are combined with any of various excipients such as, for example, micro-crystalline cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and glycine, along with various disintegrants such as starch (and preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with granulation binders like polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, active agents may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For parenteral administration of either or both of the active agents, solutions in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed, as well as sterile aqueous solutions comprising the active agent or a corresponding water-soluble salt thereof. Such sterile aqueous solutions are preferably suitably buffered, and are also preferably rendered isotonic, e.g., with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection purposes. The oily solutions are suitable for intra-articular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Topoisomerase Inhibitors</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Topoisomerase inhibitors are agents designed to interfere with the action of topoisomerase enzymes (topoisomerase I and II), which are enzymes that control the changes in DNA structure by catalyzing the breaking and rejoining of the phosphodiester backbone of DNA strands during the normal cell cycle. Topoisomerases have become popular targets for cancer chemotherapy treatments. It is thought that topoisomerase inhibitors block the ligation step of the cell cycle, generating single and double stranded breaks that harm the integrity of the genome. Introduction of these breaks subsequently lead to apoptosis and cell death. Topoisomerase inhibitors are often divided according to which type of enzyme it inhibits. Topoisomerase I is targeted by topotecan, irinotecan, lurtotecan and exatecan, each of which is commercially available from. Topotecan is available from GlaxoSmithKline under the trade name Hycamtim&#xae;. Irinotecan is available from Pfizer under the trade name Camptosar&#xae;. Lurtotecan may be obtained as a liposomal formulation from Gilead Sciences Inc. Topoisomerase inhibitors may be administered at an effective dose. In some embodiments an effective dose for treatment of a human will be in the range of about 0.01 to about 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day. The treatment may be repeated on a daily, bi-weekly, semi-weekly, weekly, or monthly basis. In some embodiments, a treatment period may be followed by a rest period of from one day to several days, or from one to several weeks. In combination with an NES inhibitor, the NES inhibitor and the topoisomerase inhibitor may be dosed on the same day or may be dosed on separate days.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Compounds that target type II topoisomerase are split into two main classes: topoisomerase poisons, which target the topoisomerase-DNA complex, and topoisomerase inhibitors, which disrupt catalytic turnover. Topo II poisons include but are not limited to eukaryotic type II topoisomerase inhibitors (topo II): amscrine, etoposide, etoposide phosphate, teniposide and doxorubicin. These drugs are anti-cancer therapies. Examples of topoisomerase inhibitors include ICRF-193. These inhibitors target the N-terminal ATPase domain of topo II and prevent topo II from turning over. The structure of this compound bound to the ATPase domain has been solved by Classen (Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 2004) showing that the drug binds in a non-competitive manner and locks down the dimerization of the ATPase domain.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Clinical Efficacy</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Clinical efficacy may be measured by any method known in the art. In some embodiments, clinical efficacy of the combination of topoisomerase inhibitor and NES inhibitor may be determined by measuring the clinical benefit rate (CBR). The clinical benefit rate is measured by determining the sum of the percentage of patients who are in complete remission (CR), the number of patients who are in partial remission (PR) and the number of patients having stable disease (SD) at a time point at least 6 months out from the end of therapy. The shorthand for this formula is CBR=CR+PR+SD&#x2267;6 months. The CBR for combination therapy with a topoisomerase inhibitor and a NES inhibitor may be compared to that of therapy with topoisomerase inhibitor alone (CBR<sub>T</sub>). In some embodiments, CBR<sub>T-B </sub>is at least about 40%, at least about 50% or at least about 60%.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments disclosed herein, the methods include predetermining that a cancer is treatable by NES inhibitor. Some such methods comprise identifying a level of topo II&#x3b1; in a tumor sample of a patient, determining whether the level of topo II&#x3b1; expression in the sample is greater than a predetermined value, evaluating the distribution of topo II&#x3b1; within the cells of the sample (i.e. nuclear vs. cytoplasmic), and treating the patient with a combination of a topoisomerase inhibitor (such as topotecan or irinotecan) and an NES inhibitor. In evaluating the distribution of topo II &#x3b1;, comparisons can be made between the levels of cytoplasmic and/or nuclear topo II &#x3b1; with one or more standards for these levels.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the effective dose of topoisomerase inhibitor used with a NES inhibitor may be about 10 to about 90%, about 10 to about 80%, about 10 to about 60%, about 10 to about 50%, less than about 90%, less than about 80%, less than about 60%, less than about 50% or less than about 40% of an effective dose of the topoisomerase inhibitor used alone.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The intracellular location of a protein may be at least as important as its expression. Diseases as dissimilar as cystic fibrosis, schizophrenia [Karpa K D, et al., <i>Mol Pharmacol </i>(2000)58:677-83], nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and many types of cancers, as reviewed previously [Davis J R, et al., <i>Pharm Res </i>(2007)24:17-27], may be caused by intracellular mislocalization of individual proteins. Specific examples of proteins that must be in the nucleus to prevent cancer initiation, progression, or chemotherapeutic response include p53 [Fabbro M, et al., <i>Exp Cell Res </i>(2003)282:59-69], galectin-3 [Takenaka Y, et al., <i>Mol Cell Biol </i>(2004)24:4395-406], FOXO [Nakamura N, et al., <i>Mol Cell Biol </i>(2000)20:8969-82], INI1/hSNPF5 [Craig E, et al., <i>EMBO J </i>(2002)21:31-42], p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>[Min Y H, et al., <i>Cancer Res </i>(2004)64:5225-31], p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, and topo II&#x3b1; [Valkov N I, et al., <i>Br J Haematol </i>(2000)108:331-45; Turner J G, et al., <i>J Cell Sci </i>(2004)117:3061-71]. Mislocalization of a protein can render it ineffective as a tumor suppressor or as a target for chemotherapy. However, it is possible that blocking nuclear export of any or all of these proteins may induce tumor suppression or apoptosis or, in the case of topo II&#x3b1;, may reverse drug resistance to topo II&#x3b1; inhibitors. Multiple myeloma is one such example, where the cells possess a CRM1-mediated mechanism in which topo II&#x3b1; is exported from the nucleus and away from the DNA, rendering topo II inhibitors ineffective to produce cleavable complexes and DNA strand breaks.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Myeloma cells, under high-density conditions, will export topo II&#x3b1; into the cytoplasm both in vivo and in vitro [Valkov N I, et al., <i>Br J Haematol </i>(2000)108:331-45; Turner J G, et al., <i>J Cell Sci </i>(2004)117:3061-71]. Nuclear export of topo II&#x3b1; contributes to drug resistance and that the resistance was not due to differences in drug uptake, cell cycle, or total cellular topo II&#x3b1; protein levels. In addition, topo II&#x3b1; nuclear export has been shown to be CRM1 mediated, and topo II&#x3b1; protein has been found to contain two functional nuclear export signals at amino acids 1,017 to 1,028 and 1,054 to 1,066 [Turner J G, et al., <i>J Cell Sci </i>(2004)117:3061-71]. Export by both signals was blocked by treatment of the cells with leptomycin B, indicating that a CRM1-dependent pathway mediates export. Leptomycin B has been shown to be too toxic for clinical use [Newlands E S, et al., <i>Br J Cancer </i>(1996)74:648-9]; however, less toxic CRM1 inhibitors may alleviate these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It is shown herein that myeloma cells grown at high density are highly resistant to topo II-directed chemotherapeutic drugs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) and that drug resistance correlated with nuclear export of topo II&#x3b1; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>). Based on these data, we proposed that blocking CRM1-mediated export of topo II&#x3b1; may make myeloma cells more sensitive to topo II-active agents. To evaluate whether blocking topo II&#x3b1; export would sensitize cells, we knocked down CRM1 mRNA and protein expression in cells by transfection with CRM1-specific siRNAs and by using the CRM1-inhibiting drug ratjadone C. Ratjadone C is a potent inhibitor of CRM1, has been shown to have anticancer properties, and has reduced toxicity in vitro compared to leptomycin B when used at low concentrations [Falini B, et al., <i>Blood </i>(2006)107:4514-23]. CRM1 inhibition by siRNA and ratjadone C in human myeloma cells was found to prevent nuclear export of topo II&#x3b1; in plateau-density cell cultures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2</figref>). Depletion or inhibition of CRM1 by siRNA or ratjadone C caused high-density myeloma cells to become 4-fold more sensitive to the topo II inhibitors doxorubicin and VP-16 as measured by apoptosis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-C</figref>). Depletion of topo II&#x3b1; protein by specific topo II&#x3b1; siRNA knockdown reversed this synergistic effect, indicating that topo II&#x3b1; was the targeted molecule for CRM1 synergistic activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). In addition, it was found that blocking CRM1-mediated export sensitized patient myeloma cells obtained from bone marrow aspirates to the topo II poison doxorubicin. Normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were not sensitized by CRM1 inhibition. One explanation is that these cells were not sensitized because they are not replicating at a high rate, unlike the myeloma cells, which double approximately every 24 h. In addition, normal cells do not export topo II&#x3b1;. Therefore, ratjadone C treatment would not affect intracellular localization.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When additional drugs were used in combination with ratjadone C, it was found that myeloma cells were sensitized to the topo II inhibitors doxorubicin and VP-16 but not to the alkylating agent melphalan or to the proteosome inhibitor Velcade (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus, maintaining topo II&#x3b1; in the nucleus by inhibition of CRM1 greatly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of the topo II inhibitors doxorubicin and VP-16 in high-density myeloma cells. Band depletion assays indicated that more DNA-topo II&#x3b1; complexes were stabilized in cells when CRM1 was inhibited (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), and these increased cleavable complexes resulted in increased strand breaks as measured by the comet assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) and subsequent apoptosis. These findings show the therapeutic value in the treatment of multiple myeloma.</p>

U266B1 (U266) human myeloma cell lines were provided by Dr. Lori Hazlehurst (H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center). All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 &#x3bc;g/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) at 37&#xb0; C. and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Cell density and drug treatment: The model used to assay density-dependent protein trafficking involved incubating cells at high- and low-density culture conditions.

Human myeloma cell lines (8226, H929, and 0266) grown at 2&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/mL were defined as low density (log phase), and cells grown at 2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL were defined as high density (plateau phase). Cell lines were placed at log- and plateau-density conditions and incubated with and without the highly specific CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C [Falini B, et al., <i>Blood </i>(2006)107:4514-23] or were transfected with CRM1 200 nmol/L small interfering RNA (siRNA; Dharmacon). Ratjadones are naturally occurring antibiotics isolated from myxobacteria. Ratjadone C is a potent inhibitor of CRM1 and prevents nuclear export by alkylating the active site Cys<sup>528 </sup>amino acid residue of CRM1. Ratjadone C has been shown to have anticancer properties and has reduced toxicity in vitro compared to leptomycin B. To determine the concentration of ratjadone C to use, ratjadone C was titrated to find the lowest concentration that would inhibit nuclear export of topo II in myeloma cell lines H929 and 8226. The concentration arrived at was &#x2dc;5 nmol/L; all ratjadone C experiments used this concentration. Cells were treated with ratjadone C for 16 h followed by doxorubicin (2 &#x3bc;mol/L; Sigma) for 4 h or VP-16 (10 &#x3bc;mol/L; Sigma) for 8 h and assayed for apoptosis by either anti-caspase-3 or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining (BD Pharmingen).</p>

After three washes with PBS, slides were incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) in addition to a cytoskeletal protein stain, phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Invitrogen). Each was diluted 1:1,000 in 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Igepal CA-630 in PBS and incubated for 40 min at room temperature. Slides were washed four times in PBS and once in distilled water, and the nuclei were stained with 4&#x2032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories).

To assay this potential effect, several band depletion assays were done (n=3). Band depletion assays can assess the amount of topo II&#x3b1;-DNA covalent complexes formed in intact cells. Large covalent complexes will have decreased migration into a SDS-PAGE gel; therefore, the amount of topo II&#x3b1;, as measured by Western blot, will be depleted. VP-16 alone did not produce significant band depletion; however, when used together with ratjadone C, a large depletion at both 25 and 50 &#x3bc;mol/L VP-16 concentrations was observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>).

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Topo II&#x3b1; is exported from the nucleus of human multiple myeloma (MM) cells by a CRM1-dependent mechanism [Engel et al, <i>Exp. Cell Res</i>. (2004)295(2):421-31]. Moreover, topo II&#x3b1; has nuclear export signals (NES) at amino acids 1017-28 and 1054-66 [Turner et al, <i>J. Cell Sci</i>. (2004)117:3061-71]. Drug resistance to topo II poisons occurs when topo II is trafficked to the cytoplasm where it is not in contact with the DNA, and thus unable to induce cell death. In addition, the inventors have shown above that blocking nuclear export with a CRM1 inhibitor or by siRNA sensitizes MM cells to topo II poisons.</p>

In vitro data indicates that these drugs can be utilized as single agents or in combination with cancer drugs that target topoisomerase II alpha (topo II&#x3b1;). Using computer-generated molecular modeling, the inventors have predicted 20 small molecules from the NCI database that bind to each of the two nuclear export signals of topo II&#x3b1; and thereby improve the effectiveness of topo II-directed therapeutics.</p>

The 10/SMI/NES were tested by an in vitro assay for induction of apoptosis (caspase 3) and viability assays to determine the anti-proliferative activity using the CellTiter-Blue cell viability assay (Promega). Cell types used included human MM RPMI 8226 and NCI-H929 cells. SMI were tested both as single agents and in combination experiments with the topo II inhibitors doxorubicin and VP-16. In addition, immunofluorescence microscopy for the intracellular location of topo II in SMI treated MM cells was also performed.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Identified compounds: The top 10 scoring SMI for each of the two NES (20 total) were obtained from NCI and tested for cytotoxicity against human MM cells. Data from apoptosis assays indicate that several of the SMI sensitize MM cells when co-treated with doxorubicin. Robotic cell viability assays determined that several of the SMI had anti-proliferative activity. The IC50 values obtained from single drug cell viability assays revealed two SMI compounds with IC50 values of 4.7 and 11.1 &#x3bc;M. Drug combination assays demonstrated a synergistic effect with the topo II&#x3b1; inhibitor doxorubicin. Immunofluoresence microscopy revealed an increase in topo II in the cell nucleus of cells treated for 24 hours with the lead SMI.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The structure of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>topo II, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, was used to create a homology model of human topo II&#x3b1; using the program PhyreA. A chemical ligand database containing approximately 140,000 small molecules (molecular weight&#x3c;500) was then molecularly docked onto the two nuclear export sites of human DNA topo II&#x3b1; using DOCKv5.1.0 with a previously described approach. The procedure for molecular docking involved: 1) selection of structural pockets in DNA topo II&#x3b1; suitable for interactions with drug-like small molecules, and 2) molecular docking simulations where each one of approximately 140,000 small molecules (mw&#x3c;500) is positioned in the selected structural pocket and scored based on predicted polar (e.g., H bond) and non-polar (e.g. van der Waals) interactions. The top 10 scoring compounds for nuclear export sites 1 and 2 were obtained from NCI and tested for cytotoxicity against human myeloma cancer cells. Preliminary data from apoptosis assays (below) indicate that several of the SMI may sensitize myeloma cells when co-treated with doxorubicin.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Optimization of the most active SMI will be initially done using the RACHEL ligand refinement software package, which combinatorially derivatizes a lead compound to improve ligand-receptor binding affinity within the nuclear export sequence target site in topo II&#x3b1;. This strategy further provides the basis for future syntheses of highly selective inhibitors with a high affinity for nuclear export sequences in topo II.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Thus, using computer-generated molecular modeling, the inventors have identified 20 SMI (Table 1) from the NCI database that would bind to the two NES of topo II&#x3b1; and thereby improve the effectiveness of topo II directed therapeutics, particularly in the treatment of MM. In vitro apoptosis assays indicate that these drugs may be effective as single agents or in combination with currently used cancer drugs that target topo II. These data have important clinical implications in the treatment of multiple myeloma.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Topoisomerase II&#x3b1; is exported from the nucleus of human multiple myeloma (MM) cells by a CRM1-dependent mechanism (Engel et al, Exp. Cell Res. 295(2):421-31, 2004). Nuclear export signals (NES) for topo II&#x3b1; have been identified at amino acids 1017-28 (site 1) and 1054-66 (site 2) using mutated full-length FLAG-tagged topo II&#x3b1; protein and immunofluorescence microscopy, (Turner et al, J. Cell Sci. 117:3061-71, 2004). Drug resistance to topo II poisons occurs when topo II is trafficked to the cytoplasm where it is not in contact with the DNA, and thus unable to induce cell death. In addition, blocking nuclear export with a CRM1 inhibitor or by siRNA sensitizes MM cells to topo II poisons, (Turner and Sullivan, Cancer Res. 69(17): 6899-6905, Sep. 1, 2009).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The structure of <i>S. cerevisiae </i>topo II was used to create a model of human topo II&#x3b1; using the program PhyreA. The procedure for molecular docking involved selection of structural pockets at the NES in topo II&#x3b1; suitable for interactions with drug-like small molecule inhibitors (SMI). Molecular docking simulations screened 140,000 small molecules (mw&#x3c;500) from the NCI database. The top scoring SMI for each of the two NES (20 total) were obtained from NCI and tested for induction of apoptosis (caspase 3), and anti-proliferative activity using the CellTiter-Blue (Promega). Cell types used included human MM RPMI 8226 and NCI-H929 cells. SMI were tested both as single agents and in combination experiments with the topo II inhibitor doxorubicin. In addition, immunofluorescence microscopy for the intracellular location of topo II&#x3b1; in SMI treated MM cells was also performed.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Low-density myeloma cells: Robotic cell viability assays determined that several of the SMI had anti-proliferative activity. However, only SMI that docked to NES site 1 showed any inhibition of viability. The IC50 values obtained from single drug cell viability assays in low density cells revealed two SMI compounds with IC50 values of 4.7 and 11.1 &#x3bc;M. None of the SMI affected the viability of high-density cells (IC50&#x3e;100 &#x3bc;M).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">High-density drug-resistant myeloma cells: Data from apoptosis assays indicate that four of the SMI that dock to NES site 1 do significantly (p&#x3c;0.05) sensitize high density MM cells to doxorubicin. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed an increase in topo II&#x3b1; in the cell nucleus of cells treated for 20 hours with the four lead SMI.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Intracellular trafficking of topoisomerase II&#x3b1; in log- and plateau-density myeloma cells resulted in differences in the ability of topo II&#x3b1; inhibitors to induce apoptosis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). NCI-H929 (H929), RPMI 8226 (8226) and U226B1 (U226) human myeloma cells grown at plateau phase (high density) export topo II&#x3b1;, whereas cells grown at log phase (low density) maintain topo II&#x3b1; in the nucleus. Cells were grown for 16 hours at log or plateau densities and treated with 2 &#x3bc;M doxorubicin for 4 hours (n=2). Apoptosis was determined by caspase 3 staining with the use of flow cytometry (10,000 cells). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, cells that maintained nuclear topo II&#x3b1; were more sensitive to topo II&#x3b1;-targeted chemotherapy.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Topo II&#x3b1; is present in the nucleus of log density cells and is exported from the nucleus in plateau density cells, nuclear export is blocked by a CRM1 inhibitor (ratC) and CRM1 specific siRNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). H929 human myeloma cells were grown at log and plateau densities, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabalized with 0.25% Triton X-100, and stained for cytoskeletal protein (phalloidin-green when presented in color/light gray to white in the referenced gray-scale photo reproduction), topo II&#x3b1; antibody (red when presented in color/gray in the referenced gray-scale photo reproduction), and the nucleus (DAPI-blue when presented in color/gray in the referenced gray-scale photo reproduction). Results indicate that CRM1 siRNA knockdown was 70% at 72 hours (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">CRM1 siRNA knockdown makes myeloma cells more sensitive to chemotherapy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Cells were transfected with siRNA, incubated at log-phase for 24 hours, and concentrated at plateau-phase conditions. At 48 hours cells were treated with the topo II inhibitor doxorubicin (1 &#x3bc;M) and assayed for apoptosis by Anexin V staining using flow cytometry. Treatment of cells with CRM1 siRNA in combination with doxorubicin resulted in significantly greater apoptosis over treatment with CRM1 siRNA alone of Scram in combination with doxorubicin. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> presents results of a Western blot for siRNA transfection, showing that CRM1 knockdown makes plateau density cells more sensitive to topoisomerase inhibitors.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Thus, using computer-generated molecular modeling, four lead compounds from the NCI database have been identified that bind to the site 1 NES of topo II&#x3b1;. These lead compounds are SMI that synergize with the topo II inhibitor doxorubicin. In vitro apoptosis assays indicate that these drugs would be effective as single agents or in combination with cancer drugs that target topo H. These data have important clinical implications in the treatment of multiple myeloma.</p>
