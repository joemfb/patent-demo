<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an overall configuration diagram of a control device <b>300</b> including a power supply unit <b>100</b> equipped with a sub power supply <b>101</b>, and a control unit <b>200</b> that supplies power from power supply unit <b>100</b> to an inverter <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A sub power supply line LS connected to sub power supply <b>101</b> incorporated in power supply unit <b>100</b> is connected to control unit <b>200</b>, and a main power supply line LM connected to power supply unit <b>100</b> and a main power supply <b>400</b> separate from sub power supply <b>101</b> is also connected to control unit <b>200</b>. Control unit <b>200</b> selectively supplies power from sub power supply <b>101</b> or main power supply <b>400</b> to inverter <b>201</b> as a load.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Main power supply <b>400</b> is a battery and is provided with a power generator <b>401</b> that charges main power supply <b>400</b>. On the other hand, sub power supply <b>101</b> is constituted by a capacitor. However, sub power supply <b>101</b> can also be a battery including a power generator.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Inverter <b>201</b> is a motor inverter that drives an electric motor <b>301</b> such as a three-phase motor, and inverter <b>201</b> is controlled by a driver <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Electric motor <b>301</b> is, for example, an electric motor that generates a braking force by pressing a brake pad to a disk in an electric braking system of a vehicle (refer to Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2008-238987), an electric motor that drives an oil pump for supplying hydraulic oil pressure to a variable speed mechanism connected to an engine in a vehicle (refer to Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2009-293649), or an electric motor that drives a spool in a shift-by-wire system mounted on an automatic transmission (refer to Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2010-156451).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">However, the combination of inverter <b>201</b> and electric motor <b>301</b> is not limited to the one equipped in the electric braking system of the vehicle or the variable speed mechanism. Moreover the load that performs power supply is not limited to the combination of inverter <b>201</b> and electric motor <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The load that supplies power may be, for example, a load used for a ship, a robot, a machine tool, or a video camera. Furthermore, the load may be one that consumes electric power energy, and can be a heater or a light source other than an electric actuator such as a motor.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, control unit <b>200</b> can be integrally fitted to a casing that houses electric motor <b>301</b>. Furthermore, inverter <b>201</b> can be arranged outside of control unit <b>200</b>, or inverter <b>201</b> and driver <b>212</b> can be arranged outside of control unit <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A first MOSFET <b>102</b> is serially connected to sub power supply line LS in power supply unit <b>100</b> by connecting a source thereof to sub power supply <b>101</b>, and a second MOSFET <b>103</b> is serially connected to sub power supply line LS in power supply unit <b>100</b> by connecting a drain thereof to a drain of first MOSFET <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">That is to say, the source of first MOSFET <b>102</b>, the drain of first MOSFET <b>102</b>, the drain of second MOSFET <b>103</b>, and a source of second MOSFET <b>103</b> are connected in this order from sub power supply <b>101</b> toward inverter <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">First MOSFET <b>102</b> and second MOSFET <b>103</b> serving as semiconductor switches are P-channel MOSFETs, which are turned on when a negative voltage is applied to a gate, so that electric current flows between the source and the drain, and include parasitic diodes <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>103</b><i>a</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Parasitic diode <b>102</b><i>a </i>of first MOSFET <b>102</b> serving as the first semiconductor switch applies an electric current flowing from inverter <b>201</b> toward sub power supply <b>101</b>, and parasitic diode <b>103</b><i>a </i>of second MOSFET <b>103</b> serving as the second semiconductor switch applies an electric current flowing from sub power supply <b>101</b> toward inverter <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Power supply unit <b>100</b> includes a microcomputer <b>104</b> including a CPU, a ROM, and a RAM serving as the sub control unit, and microcomputer <b>104</b> controls the gate voltage of first MOSFET <b>102</b> and second MOSFET <b>103</b>, thereby controlling on/off of first MOSFET <b>102</b> and second MOSFET <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore microcomputer <b>104</b> analog-digital converts and reads the voltage in sub power supply line LS between first MOSFET <b>102</b> and second MOSFET <b>103</b>, in other words, the drain voltage of first MOSFET <b>102</b> and second MOSFET <b>103</b>.</p>
