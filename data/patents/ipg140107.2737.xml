<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Inventive Concept(s)</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The presently disclosed and claimed inventive concept(s) relates generally to peptide compositions, and in particular, but not by way of limitation, to Surfactant-A-protein peptide compositions and derivatives thereof, and methods of producing and using same.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The pathogen-pattern recognition receptors (PPRRs) are important components of innate immunity that sense the pathogenic stimuli and regulate host immune responses (Pastva et al., 2007; Wright, 1997). Surfactant protein-A (SP-A) and Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) have been identified as important PPRRs (Barton, 2007; Brinker et al., 2003; Hoebe et al., 2006; Kawai and Akira, 2007; Kuroki et al., 2007; Miyake, 2007). TLR4 is expressed as a transmembrane receptor and is known as a &#x201c;Signalling-PPRR&#x201d; (Kawai and Akira, 2007). On the other hand, SP-A is synthesized by type II lung epithelial cells and secreted in the alveoli as a component of surfactant. SP-A is known as a &#x201c;Secretory-PPRR&#x201d; (Pastva et al., 2007). It has been demonstrated by the inventor and others that SP-A constitutes the majority of surfactant proteins (SPs) (Johansson and Curstedt, 1997) and plays a critical role in the clearance of pathogens and downregulation of the inflammatory response (see also, Awasthi, 2010). On the other hand, TLR4 recognizes pathogen or pathogen-derived ligands and endogenous stress proteins, and induces inflammatory and adaptive immune responses. In a number of diseases, including but not limited to lung inflammatory conditions, an exaggerated activation of TLR4 has been found associated with NF-&#x3ba;B and pro-inflammatory cytokine response (Guillot et al., 2004; He et al., 2009; Lv et al., 2009; Maes et al., 2006; Villar et al., 2010).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Published reports suggest that the bronchioalveolar lavage pools (extracellular pools) of SP-A are significantly reduced in lungs of infected patients and animal models (Alcorn et al., 2005; Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001; Awasthi et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2006; Kajikawa et al., 2005). In contrast, TLR4 expression is increased (Awasthi et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2006; Gagro et al., 2004; Kajikawa et al., 2005). The reduction in the amounts of SP-A, and simultaneous increase in TLR4 expression corroborates well with the clinical condition of patients having fulminant infection and inflammation, respectively. In these clinical scenarios, the introduction of SP-A should facilitate clearance of pathogens and attenuate inflammation. However, currently-available clinical surfactants (used for improving lung function and maturity in pre-term infants) do not contain SP-A or SP-D because it is difficult to mix large hydrophilic SP-A proteins with lipids. As with any large protein, rapid clearance of large proteins, degradation and a non-specific immune response have also hampered the development of clinical surfactant having SP-A.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) causes chronic inflammation in the intestine and accounts for a huge economic cost associated with multiple clinic visits and hospitalizations. Therapeutic efficacy with currently recommended drugs has been limited because of toxic effects, nonspecific downregulation of overall immunity and increased risk of infection. Contemporary understanding suggests that activation of Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and TLR4-nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B signaling in the gut causes an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and trafficking of leukocytes, thus leading to uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Moreover, persistent inflammation can lead to carcinogenesis. Thus, new therapies targeting TLR4 may be of clinical utility in these conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Interestingly, recently published reports suggested that SP-A directly binds to TLR4 (Guillot et al., 2002; Yamada et al., 2006). However, the in vivo evidence of such an interaction has been lacking, and its functional relevance has not been fully elucidated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, there is a need in the art for an understanding of the functional relationship of TLR4 and SP-A, as well as compositions that interact in and/or inhibit said interaction and thereby block TLR4 signaling. It is to said compositions, as well as methods of producing and using same, that the presently disclosed and claimed inventive concept(s) is directed.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount of a biologically active molecule or conjugate or derivative thereof sufficient to exhibit a detectable therapeutic effect without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio when used in the manner of the inventive concept(s). The therapeutic effect may include, for example but not by way of limitation, inhibiting the growth of undesired tissue or malignant cells. The effective amount for a subject will depend upon the type of subject, the subject's size and health, the nature and severity of the condition to be treated, the method of administration, the duration of treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any), the specific formulations employed, and the like. Thus, it is not possible to specify an exact effective amount in advance. However, the effective amount for a given situation can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation based on the information provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As used herein, the term &#x201c;concurrent therapy&#x201d; is used interchangeably with the terms &#x201c;combination therapy&#x201d; and &#x201c;adjunct therapy&#x201d;, and will be understood to mean that the patient in need of treatment is treated or given another drug for the disease in conjunction with the pharmaceutical compositions of the presently disclosed and claimed inventive concept(s). This concurrent therapy can be sequential therapy, where the patient is treated first with one drug and then the other, or the two drugs are given simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The terms &#x201c;administration&#x201d; and &#x201c;administering&#x201d;, as used herein will be understood to include all routes of administration known in the art, including but not limited to, oral, topical, transdermal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intranasal, mucosal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravitreal and intravenous routes, including both local and systemic applications. In addition, the compositions of the presently disclosed and claimed inventive concept(s) (and/or the methods of administration of same) may be designed to provide delayed, controlled or sustained release using formulation techniques which are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The presently disclosed and claimed inventive concept(s) also includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the compositions described herein in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, a &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; is a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, suspending agent or vehicle for delivering the compositions of the presently disclosed and claimed inventive concept(s) to the human or animal.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Examples are provided hereinbelow. However, the present invention is to be understood to not be limited in its application to the specific experimentation, results and laboratory procedures. Rather, the Examples are simply provided as one of various embodiments and are meant to be exemplary, not exhaustive.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Surfactant Protein-A and Toll-Like Receptor 4 Modulate Immune Functions of Lung Dendritic Precursor Cells Harvested from Preterm Baboons</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Preterm infants are highly susceptible to infections; this increased susceptibility to infections is associated with perturbed development and extreme immaturity of the immune system. Antigen-presenting cells have an important role in pathogen-uptake and processing as well as in regulating inflammatory and adaptive host immune responses. Among various types of antigen-presenting cells, dendritic cells (DCs) have been recognized as the most potent (Fajardo-Moser et al., 2008; T. Ohteki, 2007; Sabatte et al., 2007; van Vliet et al., 2007). In the past, several studies have confirmed an immunomodulatory role of lung DCs against a variety of antigens in adult humans and animal models (Banks et al. 1999; Fach et al., 2007; Holt et al., 1995; Lammatzsch et al., 2007; Masten et al., 2006; Webb et al., 2005) with a mature immune system; however, until recently, the phenotypes and functions of lung DCs remained poorly known in preterm babies. The inventor was the first to isolate a unique low-density lung cell population from preterm baby baboons (Awasthi et al., 2009). The results of this study showed that the cells have a density similar to adult baboon lung DCs, are lineage-negative and defective in responding to infectious stimuli. Overall these results suggest that despite having similar isolation characteristics, this unique cell-population harvested from fetal lung does not belong to conventional immature or mature DC categories (Awasthi et al., 2009). Based on these unique properties, they were identified as DC-precursor cells (Awasthi et al., 2009). Recent results from the inventor further demonstrate that the fetal DC-precursor cells express low level of DC-markers, and incubation with DC-promoting cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-4 and TNF-&#x3b1;) induces differentiation of these fetal cells into typical DCs (unpublished results).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The DCs are well known to coordinate innate and adaptive immunity via pathogen-pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR), mannose receptors, scavenger receptors and collections (such as but not limited to, surfactant protein-A (SP-A)) (J. Wright, 2004). Deficiencies or functional defects of pathogen-pattern recognition receptors can negatively affect the DC functions, compromise the host defense and lead to serious consequences in early life-periods of preterm babies. The inventor's previous studies have mainly focused on SP-A, a major part of lung surfactant that lines the alveoli, and TLR4, a potent membrane-receptor that senses both pathogen-associated and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP and DAMPs) (Piccinini et al., 2010; and Brown et al., 2010).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The inventor's previous studies observed that the expression of SP-A and TLR4 is undetectable or negligible in lung tissues of fetuses (at 67%-75% of complete gestation term) under steady-state conditions, and increases to the levels equivalent to adult counterparts as the gestation period reaches closer to term (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001; Awasthi et al., 2008). However, preterm birth, mechanical injury (ventilation-associated) and infection significantly influence lung-homeostasis and decrease the alveolar SP-A pools to significantly low levels (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001). In contrast, the expression of TLR4 is increased in preterm babies with lung infections (Awasthi et al., 2008).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">To this end, recent understanding in the field suggests that SP-A and TLR4 both enhance phagocytosis. The lack of SP-A in alveoli may compromise the uptake of pathogens. However, an exaggerated activation of TLR4 can lead to chronic inflammatory response or &#x201c;cytokine storm&#x201d; (Kramer et al., 2009; Kramer et al.-2, 2009; Sano et al., 2005; J. Blander, 2008; J. Blander, 2007). This pattern correlates well with fulminating infection (low SP-A=low phagocytic uptake) and inflammatory response (increased TLR4=increased amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines) in preterm babies having lung infection. These results led the inventor to hypothesize that the introduction of SP-A-based clinical surfactants and TLR4-antagonists may compensate for the loss of SP-A and downregulate an exaggerated TLR4-mediated inflammatory response, respectively. It has also been learned recently that SP-A interacts with TLR4 in vitro (Yamada et al., 2006; and Ohya et al., 2006) and in lung (Awasthi et al., 2010). Thus, introduction of SP-A may have an effect on TLR4-mediated immune responses. In this Example, the immunomodulatory effects of native SP-A and recombinant TLR4-MD2 proteins were investigated on selected immune functions (phagocytosis and cytokine response) of fetal baboon lung DC-precursor cells and compared with those of adult baboon lung DCs. The results presented in this Example demonstrate that in both adult and fetal systems, pulsing of cells with SP-A and TLR4-MD2 proteins increases the phagocytic uptake of <i>Escherichia coli </i>bioparticles. When added together, no additive effect was demonstrated on phagocytic function of DCs. Co-incubation of cells with SP-A and TLR4-MD2 proteins, however, significantly inhibits the TLR4-MD2-induced release of TNF-&#x3b1; against <i>E. coli. </i></p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Overall, the results presented in this Example support a significant role of SP-A in improving innate phagocytic function and in suppressing the TLR4-mediated deleterious inflammatory response against infectious stimuli.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Materials and Methods for Example 1:</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Baboon lung tissues: The animal studies were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees, Environmental Health and Safety or Institutional Biosafety Committee of the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center, Oklahoma City, Okla. (OUHSC). Baboon (<i>P. anubis</i>) colonies were maintained at Baboon Resources, OUHSC, Oklahoma City, Okla. At the time of necropsy, whole fresh lung or a lobe of lung from fetal (delivered at 125 days of gestation (125 dGA); complete term is 185 dGA) and adult baboons (age range 10-22 years) was collected in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM N-2-Hydroxyethylpiperazine-N&#x2032;-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 10 &#x3bc;g/ml gentamicin, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x3bc;g/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (low endotoxin &#x3c;10EU/ml, FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). None of the animals recruited in this study showed any clinical sign of infection or lung pathology. Gross and microscopic examinations of all major viscera and the placenta revealed no signs of inflammation or infection.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Purification of baboon lung SP-A: SP-A was purified from bronchioalveolar lavage fluid of a normal healthy adult baboon by a slight modification of the procedure described previously (Yang et al., 2005). The bronchioalveolar lavage fluid was collected from an adult baboon lung by instilling endotoxin-free, sterile normal saline (endotoxin-free 0.9% NaCl, 1.9-2 L with approximately 90% recovery). The lavage fluid was centrifuged, and the supernatant was concentrated using a tangential flow filtration technique (10 kDa hollow fiber filter; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp, NJ). The surfactant lipids were removed using isobutyl alcohol (1:5 ratio lavage:isobutyl alcohol). The dilapidated protein was centrifuged at 5,000&#xd7;g for 15 minutes at room temperature, dried under nitrogen gas, and subsequently completely dried in a lyophilizer (Labconco, MO). The dried lavage residue was rehydrated in extraction buffer (25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.15 M NaCl, and 20 mM octyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucoside) overnight at 4&#xb0; C. Rehydrated surfactant was extracted six times with extraction buffer by vortex mixing and centrifugation at 20,000&#xd7;g for 30 minutes at 4&#xb0; C. Insoluble SP-A was then suspended in solubilization buffer (5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.02% sodium azide) and dialyzed for 72 hours against four changes of the solubilization buffer. Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 50,000&#xd7;g for 30 minutes at 4&#xb0; C., and supernatant was adjusted to 20 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1 M NaCl to re-precipitate SP-A. Precipitated SP-A was pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000&#xd7;g for 30 minutes at 4&#xb0; C., and washed two times in 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1 M NaCl. The SP-A was suspended in 5 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) and dialyzed for 72 hours against four changes of the solubilization buffer to remove EDTA. The purified SP-A was dialyzed against four changes of the endotoxin-free, highly-purified water (Invitrogen, CA) for 72 hours to remove any remaining EDTA or salts (CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and NaCl). Finally, purified SP-A was lyophilized completely and resuspended in endotoxin-free Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline. The purified protein was filter-sterilized using a 0.2 &#x3bc;m low-protein binding, HT Tuffryn membrane filter (Pall Life Sciences, NY) and stored frozen at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. The protein concentration of purified SP-A was measured by microBCA method (Pierce, Ill.).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">All the purification steps were performed under aseptic conditions using endotoxin-free solutions and reagents. The endotoxin concentration was measured using the End-point chromogenic <i>Limulus Amebocyte </i>Lysate (LAL) assay (Charles River Laboratories, MA). The purity of the SP-A protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the procedures described earlier (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001). The isolated protein was further characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Phenomenex C-18 reverse phase column using solvents acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (60:40:1) at 1 ml/min, with the UV detector set at 280 nm. The retention time of SP-A was determined to be 1.3 minutes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Culture of KG-1-derived DCs and isolation of primary lung DCs: KG-1 cells (Bone marrow myeloblast cells derived from a leukemia patient; ATCC, VA) were cultured in the presence of recombinant human-GM-CSF (100 ng/ml), IL-4 (100 ng/ml) and TNF-&#x3b1; (40 ng/ml) (all the cytokines were purchased from PeproTech, NJ) for a period of 5 days (Ackerman et al., 2003; Bharadwaj et al., 2005; Hulette et al., 2001). The phenotype and morphology of the KG-1-derived DCs were confirmed by flow cytometry and light microscopy, respectively (Awasthi and Cooper, 2006). The KG-1-derived DCs were included as model system to optimize the amounts of effector molecules (purified baboon lung SP-A and recombinant TLR4-MD2 proteins).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Isolation of Adult Baboon Lung DC or Fetal Baboon Lung DC-Precursor Population:</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Freshly collected lobe of the lung or whole lung samples of adult and fetal baboons were transported on ice in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM HEPES, 10 &#x3bc;g/ml gentamicin, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x3bc;g/ml streptomycin and 10% FBS. After a mild mechanical disruption, the single cell suspension was seeded in a tissue culture flask (Nalge-Nunc International Corp, NY) at a density of 30-50&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>leukocytes/175 cm<sup>2 </sup>flask in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM HEPES, 10 &#x3bc;g/ml gentamicin, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x3bc;g/ml streptomycin and 10% FBS. The light-density DC-populations were harvested using OptiPrep cell-separation solution (density 1.32 g/ml, Accurate Chemicals, NY) (Awasthi and Cooper, 2006; Awasthi et al., 2009). The immunophenotype and basic characteristics of the lung DC-population isolated from fetal and adult baboons have been described earlier (Awasthi et al., 2009). Here, first the immunophenotype of KG-1-derived DCs and fetal baboon lung DC-precursors or adult baboon lung DCs were compared by flow cytometry. Briefly, cells were suspended in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) containing 1% FBS and 0.09% sodium azide and incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to HLA-DP, DQ, DR, CD11c, CD40, CD80, CD86 (typical DC-markers) as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Expression of endogenous TLR4 by flow-cytometry and western blotting: The harvested cells were suspended in 100 &#x3bc;l DPBS containing 1% FBS and 0.09% sodium azide. Previously titrated phycoerythrinin (PE)-conjugated anti-human TLR4 antibody (BD Biosciences, CA), was added at the ratio of 1 &#x3bc;g antibody per 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells. Cells and antibody were incubated for 30 minutes on ice in the dark. The cells were washed three times with PBS containing 1% FBS and 0.09% sodium azide and fixed in freshly prepared 0.5% paraformaldehyde. The cells were run through an automated dual laser excited FACS Calibur at the Flow and Imaging Core Facility (OUHSC, Oklahoma City). The histogram and dot-plot charts were obtained and analyzed using Summit V4.3 software (Dako Colorado Inc, CO). The isotype control antibody-stained cells served as controls for background staining.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">For western immunoblotting, whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 1% Igepal, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 &#x3bc;g/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin. After protein estimation, about 15 &#x3bc;g of total proteins were fractionated by Novex 4-20% Tris-glycine gradient SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen, CA). Separated proteins were electro-transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using an iBlot gel transfer device (Invitrogen, CA). The non-specific sites were blocked by incubating the membrane with 7% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.4% Tween-20 (TBST). The blocked membrane was incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. with monoclonal antibody against TLR4 (clone HTA125; ebioscience, CA) diluted 1:1000 in TBST. The membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated-anti-rabbit-IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) diluted 1:1000 in TBST. The immunoreactive bands were detected by SuperSignal West Femto detection reagent (Thermo Fischer Scientific, IL).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Cellular distribution of exogenously added TLR4-MD2 protein: Since KG-1-derived-DCs, adult baboon lung-DCs and fetal baboon lung DC-precursor cells expressed negligible amounts of TLR4 protein; the cells were pulsed with recombinant human TLR4-MD2 proteins (RnD Systems, MN). The cellular distribution of exogenously-added recombinant TLR4-MD2 protein was investigated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Labeling of recombinant TLR4-MD2 protein with Alexa-fluor 594 fluorescent dye. Recombinant TLR4-MD2 protein was labeled with Alexa-fluor 594 fluorescent dye using a microscale protein labeling kit (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, CA) optimized for labeling proteins with molecular weights between 12 and 150 kDa, as per the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, 40 &#x3bc;g of recombinant TLR4-MD2 protein (at the concentration of 1 mg/ml in DPBS) was labeled with Alexa-Fluor 594 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (Excitation/Emission wavelengths: 590/617 nm). The pH of the protein was adjusted to 8.3 using 1/10 volume of 1M sodium bicarbonate, and Alexa-Fluor 594 reactive dye stock solution (12.2 nmol/&#x3bc;l) was added to the protein. The protein:dye mixture was incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Fluorochrome-conjugated protein was then separated from unconjugated dye using a spin filter conditioned with gel resin. The spin filter loaded with reaction mixture was centrifuged at 16,000&#xd7;g for 1 minute. The absorbance of the Alexa-Fluor 594 dye-conjugated TLR4-MD2 protein was read at 280 nm and 590 nm using UV/Vis NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, DE) and degree of labeling (DOL) was determined using following formula:</p>

The KG-1-derived DCs were seeded at a density of 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells per well in an S-well chamber slide (Nalge Nunc international, NY) in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen, CA). The cells were then incubated with 10 &#x3bc;g of Alexa fluor 594-conjugated recombinant TLR4-MD2 protein (DOL &#x2dc;4.0) for 1 hour and 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C. in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere.

Finally, the cells were washed twice in Opti-MEM medium, fixed using Vectashield-antifade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, CA) and observed under Leica TCS SP2 AOBS (Acousto Optical Beam Splitter) multi-photon laser confocal microscope at the Flow and Image Cytometry laboratory (OUHSC, Oklahoma City). Images were acquired with 63&#xd7; lense objective (at excitation/emission wavelengths: 405/410-550 nm for Hoechst 33342 dye, 488/500-550 nm for DiO dye, and 594/610-660 nm for Alexa-fluor 594 dye) and were analyzed using the Leica TCS software (Leica Microsystems CMS, Mannheim, Germany). Finally, the images acquired were merged and composite pictures were obtained.</p>

After 1 hour and 4 hours of incubation, cells were washed three times in fresh Opti-MEM medium, re-suspended in 500 &#x3bc;l of 37&#xb0; C. pre-warmed DPBS, and run on Influx Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences, CA) at the Flow and Image Cytometry laboratory (OUHSC, Oklahoma City). The cells were gated to remove debris and histogram charts were obtained at 624-40 nm emission wavelengths. Cell-staining with Alexa-fluor 594-conjugated TLR4-MD2 protein was analyzed using Summit V4.3 software (Dako Colorado Inc, CO).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Phagocytosis assay: In this Example, pHrodo-conjugated, heat-killed <i>E. coli </i>K12 (encapsulated) bioparticles (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, CA) were employed. The pHrodo-fluorescent label offers an advantage over other conventional methods, in that it fluoresces only in acidic conditions (i.e., after the bioparticles are taken inside the intracellular lysosomes) (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, CA). To ensure that the fluorescence relates to phagocytosed pHrodo-conjugated <i>E. coli </i>bioparticles only, the phagocytosis reaction mix was imaged by confocal microscopy. Briefly, the KG-1-derived DCs were seeded at a density of 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well in an 8-well chamber slide and incubated with pHrodo-conjugated <i>E. coli </i>K12 bioparticles (one cell-to-&#x2dc;300 bacterial bioparticles) for 3 hours. The Hoechst 33342 dye was added to the cells (0.3 &#x3bc;g/ml final concentration, Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, CA). The cells were washed once, re-suspended in Opti-MEM medium, fixed with Vectashield-antifade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, CA), and observed under Leica TCS SP2 AOBS (Acousto Optical Beam Splitter) multi-photon laser confocal microscope (at excitation/emission wavelengths: 550/600 nm for pHrodo-labeled bioparticles, 405/410-550 nm for Hoechst 33342 dye) and under brightfield. Images taken at different wavelengths were merged, and composite pictures were obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">After confirming that the fluorescence is of phagocytosed bioparticles, comprehensive experiments were performed in presence and absence of effector molecules (SP-A and TLR4-MD2 proteins). The cells were pulsed with purified, native baboon lung SP-A and recombinant human TLR4-MD2 or MD2 proteins (RnD Systems, MN) for an hour prior to phagocytosis assay with pHrodo-conjugated, heat-killed <i>E. coli </i>K12 bioparticles (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, CA). MD2 protein was also included, because SP-A is known to interact with MD2, and it was questioned if MD2 can influence the immune functions of DC-population. The assay was performed in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen, CA), as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, CA). The assay mixtures were incubated for another 3 hours at 37&#xb0; C. in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. The fluorescence readings were taken at 550 nm excitation and 600 nm emission wavelengths using SpectraMax M2 spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, CA).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The phagocytosis index was calculated by subtracting the average fluorescence intensity of the reaction with bioparticles alone from the control (basal without any effector molecules) and experimental wells. Finally, the percent effect was calculated using the following formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>% effect=(Net experimental phagocytosis/Net basal phagocytosis)&#xd7;100%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The percent phagocytosis of <i>E. coli </i>bioparticles was also confirmed by fluorescence microscopy in representative reaction wells. The cell-free supernatants were collected after taking the fluoremetric readings and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for further analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Cytokine (TNF-&#x3b1;) measurement: The TNF-&#x3b1; levels were measured in cell-free supernatants by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercially available kit (eBioscience, CA), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the microwells of a 96 well plate were coated with diluted purified anti-human TNF-&#x3b1; antibody. The wells were washed, and nonspecific sites were blocked. Diluted recombinant human TNF-&#x3b1; (7.8-500 pg/ml standard) and cell-free-supernatant (1:10) were added to the antibody-coated wells, and the plate was incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. The next day, the plate was washed and incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-human TNF-&#x3b1; antibody followed by avidin-horseradish peroxidase and substrate solution. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and read at 450 nm (Molecular Devices, CA).</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Prior to conducting experiments with adult baboon lung DCs or fetal baboon lung DC-precursor cells, the KG-1-DCs (harvested on 6th day of culture) were used in the initial experiments to optimize the concentration of effector molecules. Morphologically, KG-1-derived DCs harvested on day 5 of culture were round and did not show any tentacles or dendrites (typical of immature DCs). However, after 13 days, the DCs developed dendrites and an irregular shape, characteristic features of mature DCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref> and B). Flow cytometry analysis of cell-surface-antibody-stained cells showed that KG-1 cells transform into DCs after 13 days and express HLA-DP,DQ,DR, CD11c, CD40, CD80 and CD86 cell-surface markers, characteristics of typical DCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). On comparison, it was found that the KG-1-derived DCs express DC-markers to levels similar to those in adult baboon lung DCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2D</figref>). The fetal baboon lung DC-precursor cells showed negligible levels of DC-markers except CD80 and CD86 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>). Later, primary lung DCs isolated from healthy adult baboons and DC-precursor cells isolated from fetal baboons were used to study the immunomodulatory effects of SP-A and TLR4-MD2 proteins against infectious stimuli.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Characterization of purified native baboon lung SP-A. To elucidate the effects of SP-A, first native SP-A protein was first purified from bronchioalveolar lavage fluid specimens of a normal, healthy adult baboon (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001). The purity and identity of the native baboon lung SP-A was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, western blotting and HPLC. Under partially-reducing conditions (heating and no DTT), SP-A separated as an oligomer, &#x2dc;100 kDa trimer, and a 66 kDa dimer on the SDS-PAGE gel. Under reducing condition (heating+DTT), SP-A ran as a 32-34 kDa monomer and 66 kDa partially reduced dimer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The purified baboon lung SP-A protein was also immunoblotted with SP-A antibody which identified the SP-A-specific protein bands (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The HPLC chromatogram further confirmed the purity of SP-A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). Since the TLR4-MD2 proteins are less abundant in the biological system and it is difficult to obtain native TLR4-MD2 protein in sufficient quantity, the recombinant human-TLR4-MD2 protein (RnD Systems, MN) was used. As an adaptor molecule to TLR4, recombinant MD2 protein was also included in the phagocytosis assays.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Since TLR4 is a potent receptor for endotoxin, the presence of endotoxin can significantly influence the results. All of the solutions and reagents were prepared in endotoxin-free water, and all assays were performed in an aseptic environment. Endotoxin concentration was measured in the purified baboon SP-A, and in the reconstituted TLR4-MD2 and MD2 proteins by the chromogenic LAL method (Charles River Lab, MA). The endotoxin concentration was negligible in purified baboon SP-A (0.0003 ng/&#x3bc;g protein) and in recombinant TLR4-MD2 and MD2 protein suspensions (&#x3c;0.006 ng/&#x3bc;g protein).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">KG-1-derived DCs and primary DCs express negligible TLR4 protein under normal conditions; exogenously added TLR4-MD2 protein localizes mainly on the cell surface. The basal cell-surface expression of TLR4 on primary adult baboon lung DCs and KG-1 derived DCs was negligible (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The expression of TLR4 was also undetectable in fetal lung DC-precursor cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Thus, DCs were pulsed with recombinant TLR4-MD2 protein prior to the phagocytosis assay. The localization of Alexa-fluor 594-conjugated TLR4-MD2 protein in the KG-1-derived DCs was tracked and studied by confocal microscopy. Confocal images showed that the TLR4-MD2 protein localized mainly on the cell membrane (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>). Flow-cytometric analysis of DCs pulsed with Alexa-fluor 594-labeled TLR4-MD2 protein showed that there is an increase in MFI values and percent number of cells staining positive for Alexa-fluor 594 stain. These findings further confirmed that the TLR4-MD2 protein localizes on the cell-surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Exogenous addition of native SP-A and recombinant TLR4-MD2 proteins increases the phagocytic uptake of <i>E. coli </i>bioparticles. In this Example, pHrodo-labeled, heat-killed encapsulated <i>E. coli </i>K12 bioparticles were utilized for investigating the phagocytic ability of DCs. First, the fluorescence of phagocytosed bioparticles in KG-1-derived DCs was confirmed by confocal microscopy. The images showed that only the phagocytosed bioparticles fluoresce (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a fluorescent cell is focused that has taken up the bioparticles. In contrast, the extracellular bioparticles in the same field, settled at the bottom of the well (z-stack slice #69.8 &#x3bc;m) or floating towards the top (z-stack slice #1.94 &#x3bc;m) do not emit any fluorescence at all (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In comprehensive phagocytosis experiments, the fluorescence signal reflecting the red fluorescence emitted by phagocytosed pHrodo-labeled <i>E. coli </i>bioparticles, was measured by spectrofluorometry using identical wavelengths setting. Briefly, the KG-1-derived DCs were incubated with purified baboon lung SP-A protein&#xb1;TLR4-MD2 protein. The % net effect on phagocytosis was calculated in the presence of effector molecules (TLR4-MD2, MD2 and SP-A) after normalizing with the basal phagocytosis in the absence of the effector molecules. The percent phagocytosis calculated by fluorescence microscopy (number of fluorescing cells/total number of cells in a composite of 5 different fields) correlated with the phagocytosis indices calculated by the spectrofluorometry methods. These data demonstrate that both SP-A and TLR4-MD2 proteins increase the phagocytic uptake of <i>E. coli </i>bioparticles by 1.5-2 fold in concentration-dependent manner (p&#x3c;0.05, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref>). The MD2 protein alone did not affect the phagocytosis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>). Next, the phagocytosis assay was performed with primary lung DC or DC-precursor population in presence of purified SP-A (2 &#x3bc;M) and TLR4-MD2 (0.3 &#x3bc;M) proteins at concentrations that provided maximum phagocytic uptake in KG1-derived DCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5F and 6</figref>). The results demonstrate that, similar to KG-1-derived DCs, the phagocytic uptake of <i>E. coli </i>is increased in the presence of exogenous SP-A (p&#x3c;0.05) and TLR4-MD2 protein in primary baboon lung DCs. When SP-A and TLR4-MD2 proteins were added together, the phagocytic uptake of <i>E. coli </i>remained increased as compared to basal level; however, no additive effect was observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">SP-A reduces the TLR4-MD2 protein-induced TNF-&#x3b1; release against <i>E. coli</i>. TNF-&#x3b1; levels were measured in cell-free supernatants of primary adult baboon lung DCs and fetal baboon lung DC-precursor cells treated with SP-A&#xb1;TLR4-MD2 proteins after 3 hours of phagocytosis reaction. Addition of purified lung SP-A did not induce the secretion of TNF-&#x3b1; by DCs in response to <i>E. coli</i>, but pulsing with TLR4-MD2 protein increased the TNF-&#x3b1; secretion significantly (p&#x3c;0.05). However, when the SP-A and TLR4-MD2 proteins were added together to the cells and incubated further for another 3 hours with <i>E. coli</i>, the TNF-&#x3b1; levels were equivalent to those incubated without any exogenous protein or with SP-A only (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). There was no major difference in responses elicited by DC-populations harvested from adult or fetal baboon lung (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>), except that the amounts of TNF-&#x3b1; were lower in fetal cells.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Discussion for Example 1</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The inventor's results on fetal baboon bone marrow-derived DCs (Awasthi and Cooper, 2006) as well as the reports of others with monocytes (Kramer, 2003) provided evidence that DC functions (i.e., phagocytosis and cytokine secretion) are impaired during prenatal and neonatal periods (Awasthi and Cooper, 2006). However, recent understanding indicates that the tissue-resident DCs are different than the circulating or bone marrow-derived DCs (Diao et al., 2006). Results obtained by the inventor also demonstrate that fetal baboon lung cells are at precursor stage, express negligible levels of DC-markers, and are functionally defective in responding to infectious stimuli (Awasthi et al., 2009; Awasthi and Cooper, 2006). Although the developmental stage of the fetal lung DC-population remains to be completely elucidated in fetal baboons, they have been identified by the inventor as DC-precursor cells because they convert into typical DCs after incubation with DC-promoting cytokines (unpublished data).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">One possibility is that since these cells are not fully equipped with TLR or other pathogen-pattern recognition receptors because of developmental immaturity, the DC-precursor cells are not capable of capturing the microorganisms. SP-A also serves as a pathogen-pattern recognition receptor and is known to stimulate DC-maturation and phagocytic uptake of infectious organisms (Kingma and Whitsett, 2006). However, at 125 days of gestation, SP-A is not detectable. NICU care and proper clinical management induce expression of both SP-A and TLR4 which reaches to optimal levels under normal conditions (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001). However, despite an advanced and sophisticated clinical care, preterm babies are more prone to infection, and infection and ventilator-associated lung injury remarkably perturb the expression of SP-A and TLR4. Specifically, lavage pools of SP-A are decreased, and tissue expression of TLR4 is increased. These published results suggest that introduction of SP-A may help maintain the tissue homeostasis and exert anti-infective and anti-inflammatory effects (Lee et al., 2010; Goldmann et al., 2009; Madan et al., 2010; K. Hartshorn, 2010). The present Example was designed to determine if the introduction of SP-A will impact the functions of DCs in the lungs of preterm babies.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The present example was focused on studying selected immune functions: phagocytosis and cytokine secretion against infectious stimuli. Primary cells were pulsed with purified or recombinant protein preparations for two reasons: first, the genetic-transfection of primary DCs will require longer time for efficient protein expression, and longer incubation may induce phenotypic changes in DCs (Brinker et al., 2003); and second, the protein-pulsing mimics the physiological scenario, because both SP-A and TLR4 proteins are known to exist in soluble extracellular, cell surface as well as in intracellular forms under steady-state conditions (Iwami et al., 2000; Ochs et al., 2002). MD2 was also included in conjunction with TLR4, because it serves as an important adaptor molecule to TLR4 and binds to SP-A (Yamada et al., 2006). However, MD2 does not carry an intracellular signaling TIR domain and does not affect the phagocytic function of DCs on its own (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). A few investigations have shown that SP-A and TLR4 proteins interact in vitro (Yamada et al., 2006; Ohya et al., 2006). Although the functional relevance of this interaction in fetal or neonatal lungs remains largely unexplored, the results of the present Example demonstrate that SP-A reduces TLR4-MD2-induced cytokine release against infectious stimuli.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The present Example demonstrates that an exogenous addition of SP-A and TLR4-MD2 proteins in the DC population increases phagocytic uptake of encapsulated <i>E. coli </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). These findings are of clinical importance because encapsulated bacteria resist phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells and mount an aggressive inflammatory response (Metkar, 2007). It is possible that purified SP-A can also directly kill some of the Gram-negative bacteria by increasing the membrane permeability as reported earlier (Kuzmenko et al., 2005). The SP-A-induced phagocytosis of <i>E. coli </i>bioparticles by DC-precursor cells point towards the importance of SP-A in improving immune functions in preterm babies. Interestingly, SP-A suppresses the TLR4-mediated cytokine release significantly in response to infectious stimuli (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Similar results have been obtained in <i>Ureaplasma </i>infection models in an established macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and in mice (Okogbule-Wonodi et al., 2010; Famuyide et al., 2009). The present Example further supports the role of SP-A in improving the innate immune functions in preterm babies.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The results of this Example are of clinical importance because surfactant preparations currently-used in NICUs do not contain SP-A. Ultimately, this Example supports the idea of reformulating the currently-available clinical surfactant preparations to contain SP-A and their clinical usage in NICU.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">A Novel TLR4-Interacting Surfactant Protein-A-Derived Peptide Suppresses LPS-Induced TLR4 Expression and TNF-&#x3b1; Release</heading>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Published reports suggest that the bronchioalveolar lavage pools (extracellular pools) of SP-A are significantly reduced in lungs of infected patients and animal models (Alcorn et al., 2005; Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001; Awasthi et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2006; Kajikawa et al., 2005). In contrast, the TLR4 expression is increased (Awasthi et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2006; Gagro et al., 2004; Kajikawa et al., 2005). The reduction in the amounts of SP-A, and simultaneous increase in TLR4 expression corroborates well with the clinical condition of patients having fulminant infection and inflammation, respectively. In these clinical scenarios, the introduction of SP-A should facilitate clearance of pathogens and attenuate inflammation. However, currently-available clinical surfactants do not contain SP-A or SP-D. Thus, a great need has been felt for designing a shorter fragment of SP-A as well as reformulating the surfactant.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Interestingly, recently published reports suggested that SP-A directly binds to TLR4 (Guillot et al., 2002; Yamada et al., 2006). The in vivo evidence of such an interaction has been lacking, and its functional relevance has not been fully elucidated. In this Example, the binding of SP-A to TLR4-MD2 in non-infected, normal baboon lung tissues was determined by co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting, and in vitro by a microwell-based method. Next, a bioinformatics approach was used to examine the interaction between SP-A and TLR4-MD2 proteins. In conjunction, potential binding regions were identified in an in silico model of the SP-A-TLR4-MD2 complex. Based on the information obtained from the bioinformatics analysis, an SP-A-derived peptide library was synthesized. Studies were further extended to investigate the functional relevance of SP-A-TLR4 interaction in a dendritic cell system. The present Example demonstrates that similar to native SP-A, an SP-A-derived peptide (SPA4; SEQ ID NO:3) binds to TLR4-MD2 protein, inhibits expression of TLR4 and reduces the release of TNF-&#x3b1; in response to the most potent TLR4-ligand: Gram-negative bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Materials and Methods of Example 2:</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Animals: The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use and Institutional Biosafety Committees at the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center (OUHSC), Oklahoma City, Okla. Baboons (<i>Papio anubis</i>) were maintained at the Baboon Research Resource, OUHSC, Oklahoma City, Okla. At the time of necropsy, lung tissue or bronchioalveolar lavage fluid specimens were obtained from normal healthy adult baboons. Gross and microscopic examinations of major viscera as well as the lung tissue specimens from these baboons showed no signs of inflammation or infection.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Preparation of baboon lung tissue homogenate: The frozen lung tissue samples were homogenized in a buffer containing 1% Igepal CA630, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and protease inhibitors (1 &#x3bc;M leupeptin, 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, 0.7 mg/L pepstatin and 0.2 mM phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride; Sigma-Aldrich, MO) at a concentration of 100 mg tissue/ml buffer (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001). The tissue homogenates were centrifuged to remove cell debris, and total protein concentration was measured in supernatants using the MicroBCA protein estimation kit (Pierce, IL).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Western blotting: The inventor has recognized the cross-reactivity of anti-human-SP-A- and anti-human-TLR4-antibodies with respective antigens in baboons, and studied the expression of SP-A and TLR4 in lung tissue homogenates of fetal and adult baboons, and neonate baboons having Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2008). Here, using western blotting, the immunoreactivity of these antibodies with respective antigens was first confirmed in baboon lung tissue homogenates to ensure the integrity of the antigens. Lysates of HEK-293 cells stably-transfected with human-TLR4-cDNA (provided by Invivogen, CA), and purified human- and baboon-lung SP-A proteins served as positive controls.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The protein samples were prepared in SDS-PAGE sample buffer without dithiothreitol (DTT)+no heating (non-reducing), without DTT+heating at 100&#xb0; C. for 5 minutes (partially-reducing) or with DTT+heating at 100&#xb0; C. for 5 minutes (reducing). The samples were loaded and separated on a SDS-PAGE gel (8% running and 5% stacking gel or Novex 4-20% Tris-glycine gel, Invitrogen, CA). Separated proteins were then electro-transferred overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The nonspecific sites were blocked by incubating the membrane in 7% skim milk diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.4% Tween 20 (TBST). The membranes were then incubated with anti-human-SP-A polyclonal antibody (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001) or TLR4 antibody (eBioscience, CA) (Awasthi et al., 2008), diluted 1:1000 in TBST, for 1 hour at room temperature. The membrane was washed and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated-anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000 diluted in TBST; Sigma-Aldrich, MO). The immunoreactive bands were detected by Supersignal West Pico or Femto chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, IL).</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Immunoprecipitation of lung-SP-A or TLR4 and cross-immunoblotting: After confirming the reactivity of the antibodies and the integrity of TLR4 and SP-A proteins in baboon lung tissue homogenates, the physical binding between the two proteins was examined by immunoprecipitation/cross-immunoblotting. The SP-A and TLR4 proteins were immunoprecipitated from baboon lung tissue homogenates and cross-immunoblotted with anti-human-TLR4 and SP-A antibodies, respectively. The SP-A (IP-SP-A) and TLR4 (IP-TLR4) were immunoprecipitated using Primary Seize Immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce, IL) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 200 &#x3bc;g of anti-human-TLR4 or SP-A antibody (Awasthi et al., 2001; Awasthi et al., 2008) was conjugated to the AminoLink plus coupling gel column at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. Five hundred &#x3bc;g to 1 mg of total lung tissue homogenate protein was loaded into the columns and the immunoprecipitation reaction was performed overnight at 4&#xb0; C. The IP-SP-A and IP-TLR4 were eluted from the antibody-bound column using ImmunoPure elution buffer. No Calcium was added to the immunoprecipitation reaction at any step. Also, none of the buffers in the kit contained calcium.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Various amounts of IP-TLR4 and IP-SP-A were run on SDS-PAGE gels. The separated proteins were then transferred on nitrocellulose membrane using the i-Blot system (Invitrogen, CA). For cross-immunoblotting, IP-SP-A and IP-TLR4 were immunoblotted with anti-TLR4 and anti-SP-A antibodies, respectively, as described above. Positive controls included lung tissue homogenate protein, purified human SP-A and lysate-protein of HEK-293 cells-transfected with full-length, human-TLR4-cDNA. Negative controls included IP-SP-A and IP-TLR4 immunoblotted with a non-specific antibody, and immunoprecipitates from columns where the lung tissue homogenate or the primary antibody had been omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Purification and characterization of native Baboon SP-A: SP-A was purified from bronchioalveolar lavage fluid of an adult baboon by a modification of the procedure described previously (Yang et al., 2005). The bronchioalveolar lavage fluid was collected from an adult baboon lung by instilling endotoxin-free, sterile normal saline (endotoxin-free 0.9% NaCl, 1.9-2 L with approximately 90% recovery). The lavage fluid was centrifuged, and the supernatant was concentrated using a tangential flow filtration technique (10 kDa hollow fiber filter; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp, NJ). The surfactant lipids were removed using isobutyl alcohol (1:5 ratio lavage:isobutyl alcohol). The dilapidated protein was centrifuged at 5000&#xd7;g for 15 minutes at room temperature, dried under nitrogen gas, and subsequently completely dried in a lyophilizer (Labconco, MO). The dried lavage residue was rehydrated in extraction buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, and 20 mM octyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucoside) overnight at 4&#xb0; C. Rehydrated surfactant was extracted six times with extraction buffer by vortex mixing and centrifugation at 20,000&#xd7;g for 30 minutes at 4&#xb0; C. Insoluble SP-A was then suspended in solubilization buffer (5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.02% sodium azide) and dialyzed for 72 h against four changes of the solubilization buffer. Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 50,000&#xd7;g for 30 minutes at 4&#xb0; C., and supernatant was adjusted to 20 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1 M NaCl to re-precipitate SP-A. Precipitated SP-A was pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000&#xd7;g for 30 minutes at 4&#xb0; C., and washed two times in 5 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 20 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1 M NaCl. The SP-A was suspended in 5 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 and dialyzed for 72 h against four changes of the solubilization buffer to remove EDTA. The purified SP-A was dialyzed against four changes of endotoxin-free, highly-purified water (Invitrogen, CA) for 72 h to remove any remaining EDTA or salts (CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and NaCl). Finally, purified SP-A was lyophilized completely and resuspended in endotoxin-free Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline. The purified protein was filter-sterilized using a 0.2 &#x3bc;m low-protein binding, HT Tuffryn membrane filter (Pall Life Sciences, NY) and stored frozen at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. The protein concentration of purified SP-A was measured by microBCA method (Pierce, IL).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">All the purification steps were performed under aseptic conditions using endotoxin-free solutions and reagents. The endotoxin concentration was measured using the End-point chromogenic <i>Limulus Amebocyte </i>Lysate (LAL) assay (Charles River Laboratories, MA). The purity of the SP-A protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the procedures described above.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Interaction between purified baboon lung SP-A, SP-A-peptides and TLR4-MD2 proteins using a microwell-based method: The binding between the purified baboon lung SP-A, SP-A-peptides and recombinant TLR4-MD2 and MD2 proteins was studied in vitro using a microwell-based method (Awasthi et al., 2004). The soluble, recombinant TLR4-MD2 protein (R&#x26;D Systems, MN) consisted of a mixture of recombinant human-TLR4 and MD2 proteins. The recombinant extracellular domain of human TLR4 protein (Glu 24-Lys 631 amino acids), was joined with a DNA sequence encoding the signal peptide from human CD33 and a 10&#xd7; histidine tag at the C-terminus (Accession # O00206). For MD2 protein, a DNA sequence encoding the signal peptide from human CD33 was joined with the mature region of human MD-2 (mature region, Glu 17-Asn 160 amino acids) and a 10&#xd7; histidine tag at the C-terminus (Accession # Q9Y6Y9). The chimeric proteins were expressed in a mouse myeloma cell line, NS0 (R&#x26;D Systems, MN). The proteins were obtained from the manufacturer in carrier-free condition and reconstituted in PBS containing 0.1% low-endotoxin BSA (MP Biomedicals, OH). MD2, an adaptor molecule for TLR4, is expressed by immune cells, and is known to bind TLR4 in a non-covalent manner (Jain et al., 2008). Thus, the binding of SP-A to the recombinant MD2 protein (R&#x26;D Systems, MN) was also studied.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">For the binding assay, microwell ultra-high-protein binding Immunolon 4HBX strips (Thermo Scientific, MA) were coated with soluble recombinant-TLR4-MD2 protein or MD2 protein (R&#x26;D Systems, 250 ng per well, diluted in 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 9.6) overnight at room temperature. The plates were washed three times, and non-specific sites were blocked for 2 h at room temperature using phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1% triton-X 100 and 3% nonfat milk (Buffer A). The wells were washed and incubated for 3 h at 37&#xb0; C. with purified baboon lung SP-A (0.125-10 &#x3bc;g), SPA4 peptide (2-20 &#x3bc;g; SEQ ID NO:3) or adult baboon lung tissue homogenate protein (10-100 &#x3bc;g) diluted in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4) buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>or equal amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein. The wells were washed with Buffer A and incubated with anti-human SP-A antibody (1:1000 diluted in Buffer A) for 2 h at room temperature followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The immune-complex was detected using 3,3&#x2032;,5,5&#x2032;-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate system (Sigma-Aldrich, MO).

Thus, it was questioned if the SP-A-derived peptides from the TLR4-interacting regions will demonstrate a similar effect. The JAWS II dendritic cells (1 million) were treated with SP-A peptides (1 or 10 &#x3bc;M) with or without <i>E. coli </i>derived LPS (75 ng/ml, highly purified, low protein, Calbiochem, CA). In order to observe the anti-inflammatory properties of the SP-A peptides, the cells were treated with peptides for 1 hour prior to addition of LPS (pre-LPS treatment) or after 4 hours incubation with LPS (Post-LPS treatment). The incubation was continued for a total period of 5 hours. Control cells were treated with vehicle, LPS (75 ng/ml), and/or SP-A peptides (1 and 10 &#x3bc;M) for a period of 5 hours. The cell-free supernatants were collected and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for further analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">TLR4 expression by immunocytochemistry: The JAWS II-DCs were seeded at a density of 25,000 cells per well of an 8-well chamber slide (Nalge Nunc international, New York, USA). Post-LPS (100 ng/ml) treatment with SPA4 peptide (1 and 10 &#x3bc;M; SEQ ID NO:3) followed, and the cells were fixed for 20 minutes with 3.5% paraformaldehyde prepared in PBS on ice. Permeablization was carried out for 20 minutes on ice with Alpha-MEM medium containing 10% FBS and 0.05% saponin and 10 mM HEPES (Inaba et al., 1998). The cells were washed with PBS supplemented with 1% FBS and 0.05% saponin (wash buffer). Non-specific binding sites were blocked using PBS containing 10% normal mouse serum (Sigma, St Louis, Mo.) for 1 hour at room temperature in a humidified chamber. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to mouse TLR4 (Abcam, Cambridge, Mass.) was added to the cells at a dilution of 1:50 and incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. in a humidified chamber. The cells were washed three times for 5 minutes each, followed by incubation with 10 &#x3bc;g/ml Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, Calif.) for 1 hour at room temperature in humidified chamber protected from light. The cells were incubated with 100 nM rhodamine-phalloidin (Cytoskeleton Inc, Denver Colo.) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Finally, 1 &#x3bc;g/ml Hoechst 3342 (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, Calif.) dye was added to the cells. Confocal microscopic images were acquired at Imaging and core facility of Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation using the Zeiss LSM-510META laser scanning confocal microscope. Images were acquired with lens objective of 63&#xd7; with the x/y stack sizes being 146.2 &#x3bc;m using band pass filter specifications at 435-485, 560-615 and 505-530.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Cytokine (TNF-&#x3b1;) measurement: The TNF-&#x3b1; levels were measured in cell-free supernatants of JAWS II dendritic cells treated with LPS with or without SP-A peptides by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described earlier (Awasthi and Cox, 2003).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Statistical analysis: The results were analyzed by the Student t-test or ANOVA for statistical significance using Prism software (Graphpad, San Diego, Calif.). At p&#x3c;0.05, the null hypothesis was rejected.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Results of Example 2</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">TLR4 and SP-A co-immunoprecipitated from baboon lung tissue homogenates. The inventor has previously shown that human-SP-A and TLR4-specific antibodies react with baboon-SP-A and TLR4 proteins, respectively (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001; Awasthi et al., 2008). Using the same antibody clones, the integrity of SP-A and TLR4 was confirmed in baboon lung tissue homogenates. The immunoprecipitation of specific proteins was identified by immunoblotting the IP-SP-A and IP-TLR4 eluates from adult baboon lung tissue homogenates using SP-A- and TLR4-specific antibodies, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). The SDS-PAGE gel run of concentrated IP-SP-A showed additional protein bands besides SP-A, suggesting a number of SP-A-binding proteins (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). The lung tissue homogenate protein, lysate protein of HEK293 cells stably-transfected with full-length TLR4, and purified SP-A protein were run simultaneously as positive controls to confirm the identity of the IP-SP-A and IP-TLR4. The sizes of the TLR4 and SP-A protein bands corresponded to the respective proteins in baboon lung tissue homogenates, as published earlier (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001; Awasthi et al., 2008). Neither SP-A nor TLR4 was immunoprecipitated when a nonspecific antibody was used in the column (data not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Next, it was hypothesized that if the SP-A and TLR4 proteins interact with each other, the two proteins may exist together in the lung and may be co-immunoprecipitated from lung tissue homogenates. The cross-immunoblotting results indicate that SP-A and TLR4 are co-immunoprecipitated from baboon lung specimens (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>). A major protein band of &#x3e;100 kDa was identified in both IP-TLR4 and IP-SP-A when the IP-eluates were separated on a partially-reducing SDS-PAGE gel and cross-immunoblotted. Protein bands of 34 kDa (similar to SP-A monomer) and 66 kDa (SP-A dimer) were identified when IP-TLR4 was separated on a reducing SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with anti-SP-A antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>). A protein band of 55 kDa (TLR4) was recognized when IP-SP-A was separated on reducing SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with anti-TLR4 antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>). The specificity of the immunoprecipitation reaction was validated using appropriate negative controls (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>). These results demonstrated that the IP-TLR4- and IP-SP-A-eluates did not contain any noon-specific protein or antibody fractions.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Characterization of purified native baboon lung SP-A: To further elucidate the interaction between SP-A and TLR4, native SP-A protein was first purified from bronchioalveolar lavage fluid specimens of a normal, healthy adult baboon (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001). The purity and identity of the native baboon lung SP-A was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Under partially-reducing conditions (heating and no DTT), SP-A separated as an oligomer, a 90 kDa-100 kDa trimer, and a 66 kDa dimer on the SDS-PAGE gel. Under reducing conditions (heating+DTT), SP-A ran as a 32-34 kDa monomer and a 66 kDa partially reduced dimer. The purified baboon lung SP-A protein was also immunoblotted with SP-A antibody which identified the SP-A-specific protein bands. The solubility of purified baboon lung SP-A was 51% (Stenvall et al., 2005). Since the TLR4-MD2 proteins are less abundant in biological systems and distributed throughout, it is difficult to obtain native TLR4-MD2 protein in sufficient quantity. Thus, recombinant human-TLR4-MD2 protein (RnD Systems, MN) was included.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Since TLR4 is a potent receptor for endotoxin, the presence of endotoxin can significantly influence the results. Thus, all solutions and reagents were prepared in endotoxin-free water, and all assays were performed in an aseptic environment. Endotoxin concentration was measured in the purified baboon SP-A preparation and in the reconstituted TLR4-MD2 and MD2 proteins by the chromogenic LAL method. The endotoxin concentration was negligible in purified baboon SP-A (0.0003 ng/&#x3bc;g protein) and in recombinant TLR4-MD2 and MD2 protein suspensions (&#x2266;0.006 ng/&#x3bc;g protein).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Lung SP-A and recombinant TLR4-MD2 proteins interact in vitro. The surface-bound TLR4-MD2 and MD2 proteins showed binding with purified baboon lung SP-A and SP-A protein present in native form in lung tissue homogenate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>). Purified baboon lung SP-A was also found to bind to surface-bound MD2 protein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>). In comparison, BSA (negative control) showed negligible binding to the TLR4-MD or MD2 protein.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Protein-protein docking and prediction of interacting amino acids at the interface of SP-A-TLR4-MD2 protein complex. In previous sections, the interaction between SP-A and TLR4-MD2 proteins was experimentally characterized. In this section, the bioinformatics approaches used to examine the interaction are described. First it is described how data was obtained for bioinformatic analyses; then, the in silico docking of SP-A with TLR4-MD2 is described, followed by a description of the rendering of the docking interface.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">SP-A structure: Under physiological conditions, SP-A exists as an octadecamer comprising 6&#xd7; trimer units (Palaniyar et al., 2000), and TLR4-MD2 exists as a dimer (Park et al., 2009). The trimeric crystal structure of neither the human SP-A nor the baboon SP-A is available in the protein data bank (PDB, www.rcsb.org/pdb) (Berman et al., 2000). Head et al., (2003) solved the crystal structure of the trimeric carbohydrate recognition domain/neck domain of SP-A. However, the PDB file and X-ray structure in the protein data bank were available for the monomeric subunit of rat SP-A (PDB ID:1R13) (Head et al., 2003). Using bioinformatics approaches, it is possible to obtain the structure of trimer by docking three monomers to form a single complex. SymmDock (Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005a; b), an automated server that deduces the structure of homomultimer with cyclic symmetry when the structure of a monomeric subunit is available, was used for the above task. SymmDock server returned 100 possible trimer complexes that differed in the arrangement of monomers, accompanied by a priority score. Of all the configurations returned by the server, only the top scoring complex was identical to the structure of the trimer shown in the prior art (Head et al., 2003; Palaniyar et al., 2000), and the rest had different arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">TLR4-MD2 structure: For TLR4-MD2 proteins, the amino acid sequences and dimer crystal structure of human TLR4-MD2 complex are available in PDB bank (PDB ID: 3FXI). Although the TLR4 and SP-A proteins are considered highly conserved proteins, SP-A, TLR4 and MD2 sequence homology was checked between the respective animal species using CLUSTALW multiple alignment program (Protein Information Resource, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington D.C.). Only partial sequences were available for baboon SP-A and TLR4, and there was no information available on baboon MD2. The alignment results demonstrate that the SP-A, TLR4 and MD2 proteins are highly conserved among different species (including mouse, rat, macaca, baboon and human) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Protein-protein docking: Next, the protein-protein docking was carried out using Global Range Molecular Matching (GRAMM-X) methodology (Tovchigrechko and Vakser, 2006) on a public web server by submitting the PDB files (trimer assembly of SP-A and dimer receptor-adaptor molecule complex of TLR4 and MD2). GRAMM-X represents a new implementation of original GRAMM methodology that uses a smoothed Lennard-Jones potential on a fine grid during the global search Fast Fourier Transformation stage, followed by refinement optimization in continuous coordinates and rescoring with several knowledge-based potential terms (Tovchigrechko and Vakser, 2006). The top 100 docked configurations were visually examined to select the most plausible configurations. Results from published studies (Yamada et al., 2006) and the inventor's data were considered to set the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of the most plausible model of SP-A-TLR4-MD2 complex. First, 90 configurations that did not show the MD2 adaptor molecule interacting with SPA in the SP-A-TLR4-MD2 complex were discarded, because the microwell-based assay results indicated binding between SP-A and MD2 adaptor molecule (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). In the remaining 10 configurations, some were same configurations with the SP-A docked to a different monomer of the TLR4-MD2 dimer. Finally, only three distinct configurations remained. Of these three configurations, the configuration that had the highest area of contact between the molecules was chosen, which also happened to be the configuration ranked &#x2018;one&#x2019;. It is a model in which the C-terminal portion of SP-A binds to the extracellular domain of TLR4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Identification of amino acids at the interface of in silico model of SP-A-TLR4-MD2 protein complex: To examine the binding interface of the complex and identify the amino acids at the SP-A-TLR4 and SP-A-MD2 interfaces, the structures were input into another server called Knowledge-based FADE and Contacts (KFC; comprised of Fast Atomic Density Evaluator (K-Fade): shape specificity features and K-Con: biochemical contacts such as intermolecular hydrogen bonds and atomic contacts) (Darnell et al., 2007). The server predicts the binding hotspots and the associated prediction confidence based on the shape specificity features and biochemical contact features of the residues at the interface. The predicted docking configuration of the SP-A-TLR4-MD2 complex with high confidence (K-Fade&#x3e;0.9 or K-Con&#x3e;0.9) have been highlighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> using Van der Waals representation. The rendering was carried out using Visual Molecular Dynamics program (Humphrey et al., 1996). The amino acids (SP-A: Asn162-Asn163-Tyr164; MD2: Ser141-Pro142-Glu143) in the selected docked configuration were highlighted using a Van der Waals representation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). In the illustration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), the other parts of the complex (two chains of SP-A and TLR4) are rendered transparent to focus on the SP-A-MD2 interaction site. According to the prediction from the KFC server, the SP-A and TLR4 proteins interact at four different places (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). The amino acids involved at the interface of TLR4 and SP-A (K-Fade&#x3e;0.9 or K-Con&#x3e;0.9) are listed in Table 2.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Functional Screening of SP-A library revealed a peptide (SPA4; SEQ ID NO:3) that reduces LPS-induced TNF-&#x3b1; secretion. Based on the in silico observations and homology to respective SP-A regions between rat and humans, the SP-A peptides derived from C-terminal CRD of human SP-A were synthesized. SP-A peptides were tested for purity by mass spectrometry (Genscript, CA) and for endotoxin contamination by LAL test.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Since an exaggerated activation of TLR4 is directly linked to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-&#x3b1;) and SP-A in downregulating TLR4-induced TNF-&#x3b1; in lung dendritic cells (Example 1), SP-A peptides were screened for any changes in LPS-induced TNF-&#x3b1; cytokine secretion in JAWS II dendritic cells. Pre-LPS and post-LPS inflammation models were included in this study to investigate if the peptides affect the LPS-mediated responses, prophylactically or therapeutically. It was found that most of the peptides had no effect on LPS-induced TNF-&#x3b1; secretion in the pre-LPS model, except SPA2 (SEQ ID NO:248), SPA3 (SEQ ID NO:249) and SPA7 (SEQ ID NO:251), which stimulated a slight increase in TNF-&#x3b1; secretion. In the post-LPS model, two peptides (SPA4 and SPA5 peptides; SEQ ID NOS:3 and 5, respectively) were found that inhibited the secretion of TNF-&#x3b1; in post-LPS treated cells at both 1 and 10 &#x3bc;M concentrations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). However, the SPA4 peptide had more effect on LPS-induced TNF-&#x3b1; than SPA5 peptide (mean values 6448 versus 8284 pg/ml at 1 &#x3bc;M concentration, and 6101 versus 6319 pg/ml at 10 &#x3bc;M concentration). Coincidentally, the SPA4 peptide contains most of the amino acids recognized at the interface of SP-A and TLR4 in the in silico model of the SP-A-TLR4-MD2 complex, and SPA5 peptide contains the first 10 amino acids of the SPA4 peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">SPA4 peptide binds to TLR4 and blocks the LPS-induced TLR4 expression. Next, the binding of the SPA4 peptide with recombinant TLR4-MD2 protein was confirmed by an in vitro microwell-based binding assay. The binding results showed that similar to purified native SP-A, the SPA4 peptide binds to TLR4-MD2 protein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). Binding of the SPA4 peptide to TLR4-MD2 protein was observed as less efficient than the whole native SP-A protein, which exists as an octadecamer (composed of six trimers). The SPA4 peptide, however, represents a small portion of the TLR4-interacting region of SP-A derived from a monomer. Since a polyclonal antibody was utilized to detect the binding of SP-A and SPA4 peptide with TLR4-MD2 proteins, the epitope detection may differ depending on whether it is a fragment (SPA4 peptide) or a full-length protein (purified baboon lung SP-A).</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">SPA4 peptide-induced changes in the expression of TLR4 were also investigated in dendritic cells. It was found that SPA4 peptide treatment reduced the basal TLR4 expression in JAWS II cells. These results further demonstrate that the LPS-induced TLR4 expression was also suppressed significantly after treatment with SPA4 peptide (*p&#x3c;0.05, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Discussion of Example 2</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In lung, SP-A is synthesized by type II lung epithelial cells, and is secreted in alveoli as a component of surfactant (King and Clements, 1972). SP-A plays a critical role in pathogen-opsonization, clearance, downregulation of inflammation, and maintenance of lung function. Earlier the inventor observed that the amounts of SP-A secreted in alveoli are significantly reduced in preterm baby baboon having bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in mouse models of lung infection (Awasthi et al., 1999; Awasthi et al., 2001). Thus, it is reasonable to imagine that administration of SP-A should enhance clearance of pathogens and inhibit inflammation. Unfortunately, currently available surfactants do not contain SP-A, because it is a large and hydrophilic protein and cannot be mixed efficiently with surfactant lipids. Therefore, it is important to search for smaller fragments of SP-A. Unavailability of such an SP-A-derived fragment has been associated with the lack of an appropriate model to mimic such a complex scenario.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Since the discovery of TLR4 as a pathogen-recognition receptor that is mainly expressed by the antigen-presenting cells (Armstrong et al., 2004; Awasthi and Cropper, 2006; Basu and Fenton, 2004), it is now established that an exaggerated expression and activity of TLR4 leads to a deleterious inflammatory response. However, basal activity is important for antigen-presentation and adaptive immunity. Subsequent to finding the reduced levels of SP-A, it was observed that the expression of TLR4 is significantly increased in lungs of baby baboons having bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Awasthi et al., 2008). Similar results (i.e., reduction in SP-A and increase in TLR4 expression) have also been reported in other models by other investigators (Alcorn et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2006; Gagro et al., 2004; Kajikawa et al., 2005). The reduction in SP-A amounts and concomitant increase in TLR4 expression corroborates with the clinical condition of patients with lung infection where reduced pathogen-clearance is observed with robust inflammation.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">A number of SP-A-binding proteins and receptors have been recognized; however their functions and expression by cell type remain unexplored (Gil et al., 2009; Stevens et al., 1995; Strayer et al., 1993; Wissel et al., 1996). The binding of SP-A to the TLR4 protein has also been recently shown to occur under in vitro conditions (Yamada et al., 2006); however, the in vivo evidence had been lacking, and functional relevance remained largely unexplored. Example 1 demonstrates that simultaneous pulsing of dendritic cells with SP-A and TLR4-MD2 proteins maintains the increased phagocytic uptake, but downregulates the TLR4-MD2-induced inflammatory response against infectious stimuli. It is believed that downregulation of the inflammatory response may be via interaction between SP-A and TLR4. Thus, a smaller fragment of SP-A containing the TLR4-interacting region should inhibit the TLR4-mediated inflammatory response while maintaining the basic functions of antigen-presenting cells.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In this Example, it was demonstrated that SP-A and TLR4 proteins are co-immunoprecipitated from baboon lung tissue homogenates. This is the first report where such an interaction between SP-A and TLR4 has been shown to exist in the lung by immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting and microwell-based methods using lung tissue homogenates and purified lung SP-A. Earlier, interaction between SP-A and TLR4 was studied with purified or recombinant forms of proteins by ligand-blot, microwell-based binding assay and BIAcore methods (Chroneos et al., 2010; Yamada et al., 2006). Bioinformatics simulation studies further support the interaction between SP-A and TLR4-MD2 protein. Although several aspects of TLR4 and SP-A binding are not clearly understood, it is clear that the lung microenvironment may significantly influence their interaction. It should be noted that in the antibody-based methods employed here, the kinetics and characteristics of binding between the two proteins depend on the antigen-antibody affinity. The specific binding sites of both the SP-A and TLR4 proteins and the kinetic parameters of the native-SP-A-TLR4 interaction needed further investigation. It is important to note that the native SP-A molecule (ligand) is quite large (octadecamer) because of the oligomerization of trimers (Pastva et al., 2007), and TLR4 protein is a homomer and associates with other adaptor (MD2) and signaling receptors for its activity (Re and Strominger, 2002). Moreover, it was also found that SP-A can bind to the TLR4 adaptor molecule MD2 as well. Thus, computer modeling of the SP-A-TLR4-MD2 complex was considered; an in silico model of SPA-TLR4-MD2 complex was obtained where the binding features fitted best with the results from immunobiochemical assays (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>). The selected in silico model was analyzed further to identify potential binding sites and amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">As identified earlier, the functional significance of such an interaction is very difficult to assess in vivo. The functional relevance of such an interaction can be better examined under in vitro conditions in a controlled environment using cell culture systems and the appropriate dosage of effector molecules. Thus, the JAWS II dendritic cell system, established in the inventor's lab (Awasthi et al., 2005; Awasthi and Cox, 2003), was used to investigate the effects of SP-A peptides derived from the TLR4-interacting region on cytokine response against a well-known inflammatory stimuli: LPS. It was found that SPA4 peptide (1) encodes most of the amino acids belonging to TLR4-interacting region in in silico model, (2) binds to TLR4-MD2 protein and (3) reduces LPS-induced TLR4 expression and cytokine response.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">These results demonstrate that SP-A blocks the TLR4-MD2-mediated intracellular signaling and cytokine release against infectious stimuli. Recently in human monocytes culture system, Henning et al. found that SP-A did not affect TLR4 expression, but it downregulated the TLR4-mediated signaling against LPS (Henning et al., 2008). However, based on the information on the interacting amino acids at the SP-A-TLR4 interface in the computer-simulated SP-A-TLR4-MD2 complex model, and screening of the peptides, one peptide was identified (SPA4) that not only inhibits the LPS-stimulated TLR4 expression, but also suppresses LPS-induced TNF-&#x3b1; release.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Use of SPA4 to Modulate TLR4 Signaling for Treatment of Intestinal Inflammation</heading>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">About a million people are currently suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in the US alone, and new cases are being diagnosed at the rate of 10 cases per 100,000 people (American College of Gastroenterology). IBD causes chronic inflammation in the intestine with alternating periods of active and latent disease, and accounts for a huge economic cost associated with multiple clinic visits and hospitalizations. Chronic inflammation can lead to debilitating complications including colon cancer. Lifelong pharmacotherapy remains the mainstay of IBD management, whereas surgery is indicated for the treatment of refractory disease or specific complications.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Conventional IBD therapies include the use of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporin A). These traditional treatment modalities provide symptomatic relief to some extent depending on the severity of the disease, but exert numerous side effects. The side effects can range from perturbed physiological functioning of important organ systems to potentially fatal opportunistic infections. However, recently a better understanding of the mucosal immune system and genetics involved in the pathogenesis of IBD led to development of biologic medications (Guidi et al., 2010; Bosani, et al., 2009; Melmed and Targan 2010; S. Hanauer, 2010). These medications include infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol, which are antibodies to block TNF-&#x3b1;, an inflammatory cytokine that is present in increased amounts in patients with IBD. Adverse reactions with these anti-TNF-&#x3b1; products include infusion or injection site reactions, upper respiratory infections and malignancies. Other new biologics that have recently entered into clinical trials include adhesion molecule inhibitor (Natalizumab), anti-IL-12, IFN-&#x3b3; antibodies and growth factors (Gordon et al., 2002; Guan, et al., 2009). As the safety and toxic effects remain to be completely evaluated for these new biologics, Natalizumab has already been temporarily discontinued due to JC virus brain infections. At a molecular level, these inhibitors and antibodies target the pre-formed or secreted inflammatory cytokines or cell-surface molecules that can provide neither cure nor a durable effect after discontinuation. Well thought-out strategies are needed to design novel treatment modalities that can provide more sustained therapeutic effect without any significant toxicity or side effects.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) was first discovered in 1996 as an innate immune recognition receptor for Gram negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Besides LPS, TLR4 is now known to recognize endogenous inflammatory signals, such as heat-shock proteins, fibronectin etc. Over a period of the last 15 years, since the discovery of TLR4, a great deal about its critical role in inflammatory responses in infectious and non-infectious diseases has been determined. Since inflammation is a hallmark of IBD, TLR4 is thought to be important. It has been recently hypothesized that TLR4-signaling probably serves a dual role in the gut as a mediator of both inflammation and mucosal repair. A hypothetical model was provided suggesting that basal TLR4-signaling is required for normal functioning and intestinal homeostasis. It is the exaggerated TLR4-signaling in response to physiological stressors (e.g., hypoxia) and infectious stimuli (e.g., LPS), that leads to intestinal inflammation. Thus, the novel therapeutic agents that can block this exaggerated TLR4/TLR4-signaling may eventually suppress the inflammatory response and help alleviate the symptoms of IBD.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Results of Example 3</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">SPA4 peptide (SEQ ID NO:3) inhibits the LPS-induced TLR4 expression in dendritic cells and SW480 intestinal (colonic) epithelial cells. After the shorter SP-A fragment (SPA4) was designed that showed binding to TLR4-MD2 protein (Example 2), its immunomodulatory effects were studied using well-established dendritic (JAWS II; ATCC, VA) (Vilekar et al., 2010) and intestinal epithelial cells (SW480; ATCC, VA). Both of these cells constitutively express the TLR4 gene; the protein expression is low in dendritic cells under basal conditions. LPS treatment induced TLR4 expression in both cell types. First, it was determined if the SPA4 peptide inhibits LPS-induced expression of TLR4 in these cells. The cells were treated with 75 ng/ml or 1 &#x3bc;g/ml <i>E. coli</i>-derived LPS (Calbiochem, CA; highly purified, low protein, does not activate TLR2 signaling) for 4 hours prior to addition of SPA4 peptide. After a total of 5 hours, TLR4 expression was studied by confocal microscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The results demonstrated that the SPA4 peptide reduced LPS-induced TLR4 expression to a basal level (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) and inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 25</figref>). These effects were not related to any cell toxicity, since the SPA4 peptide does not affect the viability of cells within this time period.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">SPA4 peptide reduced serum TNF-&#x3b1; and inflammation in Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-colitis model in mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). SPA4 peptide was also evaluated in the mouse model of DSS-colitis. DSS (3% in drinking water) was given to the mice for a period of 7 days. In the treatment group, mice were simultaneously injected with SPA4 peptide (100 &#x3bc;g daily via intraperitoneal route). After 2 days of recovery period, the mice were weighed, colons were macroscopically examined, and blood samples were harvested. The TNF-&#x3b1; levels were measured by ELISA.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> demonstrates that SPA4 peptide reduces inflammation in the DSS-colitis model. Mice with colitis lost about 25% body weight; in addition, their colons were distended and shortened. Also, increased levels of circulating TNF-&#x3b1; were detected in the serum. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, simultaneous treatment with SPA4 peptide reduced the amounts of distension and shortening of the colon, thus demonstrating that the SPA4 peptide reduced the colitis symptoms. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18B and 18C</figref> demonstrate that simultaneous treatment with the SPA4 peptide recovered body weight (<b>18</b>B) and colon length (<b>18</b>C) when compared to the DSS-colitis mice. Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref> demonstrates that SPA4 peptide treatment completely inhibited the DSS-induced serum levels of circulating TNF-&#x3b1;.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Therefore, this Example has demonstrated that the SPA4 peptide suppresses TLR4-signaling in intestinal epithelial and immune cells under inflammatory stress conditions. This suppression of TLR4 at the cellular level results in reducing intestinal inflammation in animals.</p>

<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. As per a recent annual report, 141,210 new cases of colorectal cancer and 49,380-associated-deaths were reported in the US only (National Cancer Institute at the National Institute of Health, Washington D.C.). An exaggerated inflammatory response has been reported to increase the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's colitis. This inflammation-induced progression of cancer can potentially be suppressed by anti-inflammatory agents. Common anti-inflammatory medications include the use of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporin A). While it remains to be established whether conventional anti-inflammatory agents can have chemopreventive effects against cancer, an understanding of mucosal immune system and genetics has led to the recent advancements in development of biologic medications against IBD and cancer, specifically anti-TNF-&#x3b1; products (Bosani et al., 2009). A number of anti-TNF-&#x3b1; products (antibodies and receptor antagonists) have been approved by the FDA for reducing inflammation in patients with colitis. Traditional medications and biologics provide only transient relief and have significant side effects that include increased risk of infections and perturbed physiological functioning of important organ systems. These treatment strategies provide short-lived symptomatic relief, mainly because these products act against already secreted TNF-&#x3b1; cytokine or other chemical mediators.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Key molecules involved in inflammatory pathways include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nuclear factor (NF)-kB, cytokines, growth factors, kinases, cyclooxygenases and nitric oxide synthases. TLRs are unique because they not only sense the &#x201c;danger signals&#x201d; in the form of infectious agents or stress-ligands, but by the virtue of their intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, the TLRs are associated with a complex intracellular signaling network, including NF-&#x3ba;B-inflammatory pathway. Thus, new therapies targeting TLR may be of benefit in suppressing inflammation in more sustained fashion. Among a number of TLRs, Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) was first discovered in 1996 as an innate immune recognition receptor for Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TLR4 is now well-recognized as pattern-recognition receptor against a diverse array of ligands including endogenous stress ligands such as but not limited to, heat-shock proteins, fibronectin, etc. A number of recent studies have reported the involvement of TLR4 in colitis and cancer progression. Constitutive activation of TLR4 augments inflammatory response in colitis-induced tumorigenesis. Colon cancer cell lines SW480 and SW620 constitutively express TLR4. In SW480 cells, LPS treatment induces cytokine synthesis/secretion, cell-migration and adhesion. Increased cell migration and adhesion are hallmarks of tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, the inventor postulated that suppression of LPS-stimulated TLR4-signaling will help control inflammation and inflammation-induced metastatic property of SW480 cells. Presumably, a therapeutic that inhibits intracellular inflammatory signaling is expected to exert sustained anti-inflammatory effects and help prevent inflammation-induced cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The previous Examples describe the identification of the TLR4-interacting SPA4 peptide, as well as its ability to reduce secretion of TNF-&#x3b1; by a dendritic cell line in response to LPS stimuli. In this Example, the ability of SP-A4 peptide to inhibit the LPS-induced TLR4-NF-&#x3ba;B signaling and resulting inflammatory response in SW480 colon cancer cell line was studied. Simultaneously, the effects of SPA4 peptide on migration, viability and cell cycle progression of SW480 cells were also investigated.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Materials and Methods for Example 4</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Cell culture: Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells: SW480, derived from the colon of a cancer patient (original stock from ATCC, VA), were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Shrikant Anant (University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kans.). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (D-MEM, Invitrogen, CA), supplemented with high glucose (4.5 g/l D-glucose), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), L-glutamine (4 mM), fetal bovine serum (10%) and antibiomyco (1%, Invitrogen, CA). Cells were maintained at 37&#xb0; C. in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">SPA4 peptide: The 20-mer SPA4 peptide (amino acid sequence: GDFRYSDGT PVNYTNWYRGE; SEQ ID NO:3) derived from the C-terminal region of SP-A, was synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, N.J.). The mass spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography were performed on all the batch-preparations of the SPA4 peptide to confirm its purity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). The peptide was suspended in endotoxin-free HyClone Cell culture grade water, and endotoxin content was measured by <i>Limulus </i>Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay (Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Wilmington, Mass.).</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Measurement of n-octanol/water partition coefficient (K<sub>o/w</sub>) of SPA4 peptide: The n-octanol/water partition coefficient (K<sub>o/w</sub>) is a measure of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. It is calculated as the ratio of the concentration of a chemical in n-octanol to that in water in a two-phase system at equilibrium. An equal volume of MiliQ water and n-Octanol was mixed in a microcentrifuge tube, and shaken for 4 hours at 25&#xb0; C. Weighed amount of the SPA4 peptide was then added to this n-Octanol-water mixture and shaken overnight at 25&#xb0; C. The SPA4 peptide-n-Octanol-water mixture was allowed to settle for 2 hours. The aqueous phase was separated by centrifugation at 16,000&#xd7;g for 10 minutes. The concentration of SPA4 peptide in aqueous phase was measured by spectrophotometric absorbance readings at 280 nm. The concentration of the SPA4 peptide in n-Octanol phase was obtained after subtracting the amount of peptide in water phase from that of the total SPA4 peptide added. Finally, K<sub>o/w </sub>of SPA4 peptide was determined using following formula:</p>

Briefly, NF-&#x3ba;B-Luciferase reporter and MYD88-dominant negative plasmids (1.0 &#x3bc;g each) were mixed with 6 &#x3bc;l of Fugene HD reagent (Roche, Ind.) in 92 &#x3bc;l of serum-free low-glucose DMEM medium (Invitrogen, CA), and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. The transfection-mix was then added to the SW480 cells. The SW480 cells transfected with a plasmid DNA construct expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (pHYG-EGFP; Clontech, CA) were observed under Leica DM4000B fluorescent microscope. The transfection efficiency was calculated as percent of cells expressing EGFP over total number of cells in the brightfield channel. An empty vector plasmid DNA (pcDNA 3.0; obtained from Dr. Brian Ceresa, Department of Cell Biology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Okla.) was used as negative control. The cells were incubated for 18-20 h at 37&#xb0; C. in humidified 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>chamber. After the completion of incubation period, fresh complete medium was added to the cells. Cells were then challenged with LPS (1.0 &#x3bc;g/ml) for 4 hours following the treatment with SPA4 peptide (1, 10, 50 &#x3bc;M) for 1 hour (total period of 5 hours; short-term treatment model) and 5 hours (total period of 9 hours; long-term treatment model). The LPS remained in the medium throughout the incubation period.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">After completion of the incubation period, the medium supernatants were removed and cells were washed with room-temperature DPBS. The cell extracts were prepared using the reporter assay cell-lysis buffer (Promega, Fitchburg, Wis.) and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for further analysis. The firefly-luciferase activity (measurement of NF-&#x3ba;B activity) was measured using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Fitchburg, Wis.). Briefly, 50 &#x3bc;l of luciferase assay reagent was added to the 20 &#x3bc;l cell lysate by automated dispenser of Synergy HT multi-mode microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski, Vt.), and luminescence was read within 10 seconds. Total protein content in cell lysates was estimated using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). The luciferase activity units were finally normalized with the total protein content of cell lysates.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Expression of NF-&#x3ba;B pathway molecules by immunoblotting: The expression of NF-&#x3ba;B pathway molecules (inhibitor kappa-B&#x3b1;: IKB&#x3b1;, phosphorylated IKB&#x3b1;, p65, phosphorylated p65, RelB and COX-2) in SW480 cell-lysates treated with LPS&#xb1;SPA4 peptide was studied by immunoblotting. For the immunoblotting, 10 &#x3bc;g of total cell-lysate proteins were fractionated on Novex 4-20% Tris-glycine gradient SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) by electrophoresis. Separated proteins were electro-transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using iBlot gel transfer device (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The non-specific sites were blocked by incubating the membrane with 7% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.4% TWEEN&#xae;-20 (TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature. The blocked membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. with 1:1000 diluted anti-human antibodies against NF-&#x3ba;B canonical pathway molecules: phosphorylated inhibitor kappa-B&#x3b1; (IKB&#x3b1;), total-IKB&#x3b1;, p65, RelB (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, Mass.), phosphorylated p65 (Santacruz Biotech, Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif.) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2; Santacruz Biotech, Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif.). The membranes were washed with TBST and incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes with 1:3500 diluted horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated-secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.). The immunoreactive bands were detected by Super Signal West Femto detection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Barrington, Ill.). In order to ensure equal protein loading in the wells, the membranes were stripped of probing antibodies at 60&#xb0; C. for 45 minutes using a stripping solution containing 10% SDS, 0.5 M Tris and 3-mercaptoethanol (35 &#x3bc;l/ml), and re-probed with anti-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, MO; 1:1000 in TBST). The immunoblots were imaged using the Ultraquant image acquisition program (UltraLum Inc., Claremont, Calif.). The densitometric readings were obtained for immunoreactive bands with Image J 1.42 q program (NIH, USA). Finally, arbitrary densitometric values for proteins of interest were normalized with those of &#x3b2;-actin.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Expression of IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-6: Two treatment models (post- and pre-LPS treatment) were utilized for assessing the effects of SPA4 peptide on LPS-induced cytokines: IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-6. Post-LPS treatment models (short-term and long-term) are described above. In pre-LPS treatment model, the SW480 cells were pretreated with SPA4 peptide (10 &#x3bc;M) for 2 hours, followed by LPS-challenge (1.0 &#x3bc;g/ml) for another 4 hours. The cell-lysates were prepared either in commercially available cell-culture lysis reagent (Promega, WI) or directly into SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mM dithiothreitol (Cell Signalling Technology, MA). Ten &#x3bc;g of cell-lysate proteins were separated on 4-20% Novex Tris-glycine gradient SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen, CA) or 10% separating-5% stacking acrylamide gel. The expression levels of cytokines were measured by immunoblotting as described above using 1:1000 diluted antibodies against IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-6. Both antibodies were purchased from Santacruz Biotech, CA.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Cell migration: SW480 cells were plated in 30 mm tissue-culture-treated dishes at a density of 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells per plate. At 80-90% confluence, a &#x201c;reference line&#x201d; was drawn at the bottom of the plate. The cells were scratched off from one side of the reference line using a rubber policeman. A picture was taken at 0 t that helped in marking the &#x201c;start line&#x201d;. Cells were then washed with complete medium and incubated with LPS (1.0 &#x3bc;g/ml) and/or SPA4 peptide (1, 10 and 50 &#x3bc;M). Photomicrographs of cells migrated across the &#x201c;start line&#x201d; were taken in different fields after each treatment at 24, 48, and 72 hours (&#xb1;2 hours) following traceable inscriptions made under the plate at three different points, with a Canon digital camera. On 24, 48 and 72 hour images, a second line was drawn along the edge of cells to represent the migration of cells. Cell migration was calculated by measuring the distance cells migrated from the &#x201c;start line&#x201d;. Only the continuous migration of cells was considered for measurement. The islets of cells were disregarded. The cell migration was calculated using the following formula: (distance between &#x201c;start line&#x201d; at 0 h&#x2014;&#x201c;reference line&#x201d;)-(distance between &#x201c;72 hours line&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;reference line&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Cell cycle analysis: The effect of SPA4 peptide on cell cycle progression was studied by flow-cytometry. About 500,000 cells were seeded per well into 6 well plate. The cells were challenged with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 hours. After the completion of 4 hours LPS-challenge period, SPA4 peptide (10, 50 and 100 &#x3bc;M) was added to the cells. Cells were further incubated for 20 and 40 hours. Vehicle-treated cells were also included. After 20 and 40 hours of total incubation period, both adherent and non-adherent cells were collected and centrifuged at 260&#xd7;g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and cell pellet was washed with DPBS (Invitrogen-Gibco, NY). The cells were fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol on ice for 1 hour and stained with a buffer containing 200 &#x3bc;g/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma, St Louis, Mo.), 0.1% v/v Triton-X 100 and 20 &#x3bc;g/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, Calif.). The cells were incubated at 4&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes in the dark, before measuring cell fluorescence using Becton Dickson FACS Calibur flow cytometer. The single cells were selected by gating out the aggregates and the percent number of cell populations in different cell cycle phases were calculated by de-convoluting the results ModFIT software (Verity software house, Topsham, Me.).</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Cell viability: The TLR4-NF-&#x3ba;B signaling can have multifaceted implications, including the effects on proliferation and viability of SW480 cells. Thus, the effect of SPA4 peptide on viability of SW480 cells was studied. The cells (250,000 and 500,000 per well) were seeded into 24 well plates and treated with SPA4 peptide (10, 50 and 100 &#x3bc;M) after LPS-challenge (100 ng/ml) for 4 hours. The LPS remained in the medium throughout the incubation period thereafter. The cells were collected after 3-5 days of treatment and stained with propidium iodide (1 &#x3bc;g/ml) for 20 minutes on ice. The stained cells were run on a flow-cytometer (Accuri flow cytometer, MI), and propidium iodide staining was assessed on FL2 channel. The histograms were obtained for each treatment using C Flow Plus software and compared between the groups. The % number of cells exhibiting positive (dead cells) and negative (live cells) propidium iodide staining were noted. Untreated cells and LPS-treated cells served as controls.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Statistics: The results were analyzed by one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using a statistical analysis program (Graphpad Prism, CA). A p-value of &#x3c;0.05 was noted, otherwise indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Results of Example 4</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Characteristics of SPA4 peptide: The SPA4 peptide batch preparations were always tested for purity by HPLC chromatography and Mass spectrometry (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) or any contamination with endotoxin by LAL assay. The endotoxin level was undetectable (below the lower limit of 0.001 ng/ml) in reconstituted SPA4 peptide suspensions of all the batches.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">As per the computer simulation Solvent AccesiBiLitiEs (SABLE) program (Division of Biomedical Informatics, Children Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, Ohio), the SPA4 peptide is predicted to have coiled and beta strand structures. Relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of 11 amino acid residues is above 25% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>), suggesting that the SPA4 peptide is easily soluble in water. Furthermore, the Ko/w partition coefficient of the SPA4 peptide was measured. The Ko/w partition coefficient of SPA4 peptide was 0.56. These results further confirm that the SPA4 peptide is hydrophilic in nature.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">SPA4 peptide does not bind to LPS. Example 2 illustrated that the SPA4 peptide binds to recombinant TLR4-MD2 protein. In order to further validate that the anti-inflammatory effects of SPA4 peptide are not through the binding of SPA4 peptide to TLR4-ligand LPS, the binding of SPA4 peptide to LPS was studied in vitro. The results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> show that the SPA4 peptide does not bind to LPS.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Additional evidence was provided by superimposing the predicted SPA4 peptide-binding site on a computer model exhibiting LPS-binding site within the TLR4-MD2 complex (Carpenter et al., 2009). Herein it was observed that the binding site of the SPA4 peptide to TLR4 remains farther away from the LPS-binding site (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">SPA4 peptide reduces the expression of TLR4. Next, the effects of SPA4 peptide on the expression of TLR4 were investigated by confocal microscopy. The results show that SW480 cells constitutively express TLR4. As expected, the TLR4 expression is further increased in response to Gram-negative bacterial LPS. However, the SPA4 peptide treatment reduced the LPS-stimulated TLR4 expression to basal level (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>), which was more pronounced with 100 &#x3bc;M SPA4 peptide, the maximum concentration tested.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">SPA4 peptide inhibits the LPS-induced MYD88-dependent NF-&#x3ba;B activity: Myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88; MYD88) is a known adaptor molecule of TLR4 and serves as an important molecule downstream of LPS-TLR4-MD2 binding, but upstream of activation of transcription factors (AP-1 and NF-&#x3ba;B) and transcription of cytokine and chemokine genes. The MYD88 engages IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) molecule through its death domain and transduces the signal. In this Example, SW480 cells were transfected with MYD88 dominant negative construct (MYD88DN) lacking the death domain. The transfection efficiency was observed as 63-68%. The NF-&#x3ba;B activity was measured using a reporter plasmid (pGL4.32, Promega, WI) that contained five copies of NF-&#x3ba;B-response element driving the expression of luciferase reporter gene. The results show that the SPA4 peptide (at 10 and 50 &#x3bc;M concentrations) reduces the LPS induced-NF-&#x3ba;B activity after 5 hours. At 9 hours of treatment, the LPS induced NF-&#x3ba;B activity was, however, not significantly inhibited by 1, 10 or 50 &#x3bc;M concentrations of SPA4 peptide. The MYD88DN-transfected cells exhibited reduced NF-&#x3ba;B activity against LPS stimuli as compared to that in pcDNA3.0 vector plasmid DNA-transfected cells. The SPA4 peptide-treatment did not further reduce the NF-&#x3ba;B activity in cells transfected with dominant negative construct of MYD88, illustrating that the SPA4 peptide treatment affects only the MYD88-dependent NF-&#x3ba;B activity and does not affect the MYD88-independent NF-&#x3ba; B activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Expression of NF-&#x3ba;B signaling molecules is affected by SPA4 peptide: The effects of SPA4 peptide on LPS-induced TLR4-NF-&#x3ba;B signaling were studied in cells treated with SPA4 peptide (1, 10 and 50 &#x3bc;M) for a short-term and a long-term basis. The expression of NF-&#x3ba;B-signaling molecules was measured in cell lysates by immunoblotting. It was found that the SPA4 peptide alone did not affect the expression of any of the NF-&#x3ba;B signaling molecules studied, except for COX-2.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">As expected, an oscillating expression pattern was observed for the total IKB&#x3b1;, total p65 and COX-2 molecules in short- and long-term LPS-challenged SW480 cells. The SPA4 peptide treatment on short-term basis stimulated an increase in expression of total IKB&#x3b1;, but decrease in phosphorylated p65 and COX-2 expression. The long-term treatment with SPA4 peptide, on the other hand, decreased the total IKB&#x3b1;expression. The expression of phosphorylated p65 and COX-2 remained low. No effect was observed on the expression of phosphorylated IKB&#x3b1; or RelB molecules (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">SPA4 peptide inhibits the intracellular expression of IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-6. Immunoblotting with anti-human IL-1&#x3b2; antibody recognized three major precursor forms (identified as numerals 1, 2 and 3 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>) and an active IL-1&#x3b2; (identified as numeral 4 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>) in SW480 cell lysates. On comparison of densitometric units, the expression of IL-1&#x3b2; precursor form 1 was found to be increased or unchanged after treatment with SPA4 peptide from that in LPS-treated cells. However, the expression of low molecular weight precursors and active IL-1&#x3b2; was significantly decreased by treatment with SPA4 peptide in a dose-dependent manner at both 5 hours and 9 hours post-LPS treatment models. Similarly, in pre-LPS treatment model, a significant decrease in expression of IL-1&#x3b2; precursor and active forms was observed.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Next, the expression of IL-6 in cell-lysates of SW480 cells treated with LPS&#xb1;SPA4 peptide was studied. Three major precursor forms of IL-6 (identified as numeral 1 for two reactive bands together and numeral 2 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>) and an active form of IL-6 (identified as numeral 3 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>) were recognized in immunoblots. The expression of IL-6 precursors or active form of IL-6 was not significantly affected in short-term treatment model. However, when treatment with SPA4 peptide was prolonged for 6 hours or 9 hours in pre- and post-LPS-treatment models, respectively, the IL-6 expression was significantly inhibited.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">SPA4 peptide treatment inhibits the LPS-induced migration of SW480 cells. Increased cell migration is a known characteristic of tumor metastasis. As expected, LPS was found to induce the metastatic property (i.e., cell migration) of SW480 cells. Treatment with the SPA4 peptide inhibited the LPS-induced migration of SW480 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). The experiments were designed in a manner that the SPA4 peptide was added to the cells after 4 hours of LPS-treatment, the LPS and SPA4 peptide remained in the medium for the total duration of experiment. Since the inhibitory effect of SPA4 peptide was apparent as early as within 24 hours of treatment (data not shown) and remained consistent till 72 hours of treatment, it appears that the inhibition of migration of SW480 cells is initiated early and is maintained on long term basis.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">SPA4 peptide treatment does not affect the cell cycle progression, but inhibits cell viability. It was found that LPS-treatment did not affect cell cycle progression or viability. Treatment with SPA4 peptide (10, 50 and 100 &#x3bc;M concentrations) did not affect the cell cycle progression of SW480 cells over a period of 40 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>). However, the viability of SW480 cells was reduced by SPA4 peptide as compared to untreated or LPS-stimulated cells (about 70% cells viable after SPA4 peptide treatment versus 90% cells viable after LPS- or no-stimulation; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>). The changes in cell-viability were observed as early as within three days of SPA4 peptide treatment. The inhibition of cell-viability was dependent on the concentration and duration of the treatment with the SPA4 peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Discussion of Example 4</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been well-recognized for its critical role in sensing of pathogens or pathogen-derived signals and immune regulation. Although its involvement in cancer has not been fully-established, an increased expression of TLR4 is associated with inflammation induced cancer. Correspondingly, reduced TLR4 activity was found to inhibit inflammatory cytokine secretion, cancer cell proliferation and cancer-associated pain. On the basis of these initial findings, it is proposed herein that TLR4-blocking novel therapeutics will help reduce the inflammation and inflammation-induced cancer-progression. SW480 colorectal cells were utilized as the model system for inflammation-induced cancer progression; the SW480 cells constitutively express TLR4. This Example was focused on studying the effects of a TLR4-interacting SPA4 peptide on TLR4-signaling, inflammatory response, cell migration, cell cycle and viability of SW480 cells.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The SPA4 peptide is derived from an endogenous host-defense protein: surfactant protein-A (SP-A). SP-A is mainly expressed as a component of lung surfactant; its expression has been noted at other mucosal surfaces, such as intestine, skin, eye and urinogenitary systems. In lung, SP-A maintains normal lung function and exerts anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory effects against pathogens and stress-ligands. Since during infection and inflammation, the amounts of SP-A are reduced significantly, an SP-A based surfactant or therapeutic may be of clinical value. It has not been possible to formulate an SP-A-based therapeutic because of its large size and its amenability to degradation. Using computer-modeling and functional screening of a small peptide library, a shorter region of SP-A was identified from the TLR4-interacting region and referred to herein as the SPA4 peptide. Example 2 illustrates that the SPA4 peptide inhibits the LPS-induced inflammatory response in JAWS II dendritic cell line.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">TLR4-signaling is induced in response to a number of endogenous and exogenous ligands, including bacterial LPS. LPS binds to TLR4-MD2 complex and induces inflammatory response via activation of a complex intracellular signaling network. The SW480 cells constitutively express TLR4, and LPS is known to induce inflammatory response, adhesion and migration. Thus, this system was utilized to investigate the effects of SPA4 peptide on LPS-induced TLR4-NF-&#x3ba;B signaling, inflammation and cancer cell properties. In order to understand the mechanism of action of SPA4 peptide, first it was confirmed that the SPA4 peptide does not directly bind to stress-ligand LPS, and the binding site of LPS onto the TLR4-MD2 complex is farther away from the binding site of SPA4 peptide. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). These results indicate that the SPA4 peptide neither binds to LPS nor interferes with the binding of LPS to TLR4-MD2 complex. Furthermore, since SPA4 peptide is hydrophilic (Ko/w=0.56), the SPA4 peptide most likely does not enter into the cytoplasm of the cell by crossing the hydrophobic cell membrane, and does not directly affect the intracellular inflammatory signaling. Overall, these results support the notion that the anti-inflammatory effects of SPA4 peptide are exhibited through its interaction with TLR4.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">LPS is known to induce inflammation via activation of TLR4-NF-&#x3ba;B signaling in MYD88-dependent as well as MYD88-independent manner. Full-length SP-A has been identified to inhibit NF-&#x3ba;B activity, but upstream molecular events occurring after SP-A-TLR4 interaction remain unknown. As such, the LPS-TLR4-MD2-signaling is quite complex. Nothing is known in particular for SPA4 peptide. This Example shows that the SPA4 peptide inhibits NF-&#x3ba;B-activity in a MYD88-dependent manner. Furthermore, SPA4 peptide induces the expression of IKB&#x3b1;, an inhibitor of NF-&#x3ba;B, but does not affect the Ser 32-phosphorylated IKB&#x3b1;. The increase in the expression of IKB&#x3b1; is in accordance with the published data on full-length SP-A (Wu et al., 2004). Since NF-&#x3ba;B is composed of five different subunits, c-Rel, RelB, p65, p50 and p52, it was investigated if the stimulation of IKB&#x3b1;translates into the inhibition of these downstream factors. Inhibition of phosphorylation of p65 by SPA4 peptide translates into the inhibition of NF-&#x3ba;B activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>). These results illustrate that SPA4 peptide inhibits the TLR4-NF-&#x3ba;B signaling in response to inflammatory stimuli.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">An oscillating pattern of expression of signaling molecules were observed in 5 hour and 9 hour treatment-models; it is possible that different mechanisms in conjunction with NF-&#x3ba;B are affected downstream of the binding of SPA4 peptide to TLR4. In conjunction with the inhibition of NF-&#x3ba;B signaling by SPA4 peptide, a significant decrease in the amounts of LPS-induced IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-6 cytokines were observed. This reduction in inflammatory signaling and cytokine response correlated with inhibition of LPS-induced cell migration. Although a change in cell cycle progression was not observed, significant reduction in cell viability was observed upon treatment with SPA4 peptide. The percent cell-death increased as per the increase in duration and treatment dose of SPA4 peptide. These results will facilitate development of a novel chemopreventive immunotherapeutic to control inflammation-induced cancer progression in patients with colitis.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">In Example 5, the efficacy of SPA4 peptide in inhibiting LPS-induced acute inflammation was investigated in a mouse model of LPS-inflammation. Balb/c Mice were challenged with <i>E. coli </i>0111:B4 highly purified, low protein-derived LPS (0.1 or 1 or 15 &#x3bc;g/g body wt) via an intraperitoneal route, one hour prior to treatment with SPA4 peptide (2.5 &#x3bc;g/g body weight) or full-length purified SP-A (0.5 &#x3bc;g/g body weight) via an intraperitoneal route. The mice were monitored for endotoxic-shock like clinical symptoms (including, but not limited to, ruffled fur, eye exudates, diarrhea, prostration, and lack of reactivity), and these symptoms were scored on the basis of severity from 0 to 3, and average clinical symptom indices were calculated for each animal based on the symptom grades (Metkar et al., 2007). Endotoxic-shock like clinical symptoms were noted (at 5 or 7 hours), and mice were sacrificed at different time-intervals after LPS challenge. Major organs and blood specimens were collected. Secreted amounts of TNF-&#x3b1; cytokine were measured in serum and lung tissue homogenates by ELISA method.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">At the molecular level, the effects of SPA4 peptide on LPS-induced NF-&#x3ba;B activity were studied in dendritic cells (JAWS II cells) co-transfected with NF&#x3ba;B luciferase reporter plasmid construct and dominant negative construct of MYD88 (an adaptor protein downstream of TLR4; MYD88DN). Briefly, JAWS II dendritic cells (0.5&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>) were transfected with NF-&#x3ba;B luciferase reporter and/or MYD88DN using TransIT-TKO transfection reagent as described earlier (Awasthi S et al., 2003). After 20-24 hours of incubation, the transfected cells were challenged with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 hours and treated with SPA4 peptide (10 &#x3bc;M) for 1 hour. After the completion of 5 hours incubation, the cell lysates were prepared in cell lysis buffer and NF-&#x3ba;B-luciferase reporter activity was measured as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, WI).</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">SPA4 peptide inhibits LPS-induced NF-&#x3ba;B activity upstream of MYD88 in dendritic cells. The MYD88 is an intracellular adaptor protein which transduces the LPS-TLR4-signal to NF-&#x3ba;B. Although LPS-TLR4 binding is known to induce NF-&#x3ba;B in MYD88-independent manner also, the inhibition of the NF-&#x3ba;B activity in MYD88&#x2212;/&#x2212;-transfected cells by SPA4 peptide was equivalent to that in untreated MYD88&#x2212;/&#x2212;-transfected cells against LPS challenge (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>). These results illustrate that SPA4 peptide does not affect MYD88-independent NF-&#x3ba;B activity. These results are in accordance with the results presented in SW480 cells in Example 4.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">The endotoxic shock-like symptoms induced after LPS challenge were measured (Metkar et al., Infect Immun 2007). Results presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> show that SPA4 peptide and full-length SP-A inhibit the LPS (0.1 &#x3bc;g/g body weight)-induced clinical symptoms.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">LPS is known to induce the secretion of TNF-&#x3b1;, and a significant amount is detected in the blood. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, it was found that LPS (0.1 &#x3bc;g/g body weight)-induced circulatory TNF-&#x3b1; amounts are reduced after treatment with SPA4 peptide and full-length SP-A. The results are in accordance with published data in the literature on anti-inflammatory effects of full-length SP-A (Borron P et al., Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol, 2000. 278: L840-847). Similar to SP-A, SPA4 peptide also inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha in vivo through its interaction with TLR4 and suppression of NF-&#x3ba;B activity. Also, these results corroborate with findings presented in Examples 2 and 3.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">SPA4 peptide treatment also reduced LPS-induced TNF-&#x3b1; levels in lung tissue homogenates. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref> illustrate that the amounts of LPS-induced TNF-alpha are low in lung tissues of mice challenged with LPS (1 &#x3bc;g/g body weight or 15 &#x3bc;g/g body weight) and treated with full-length SP-A and SPA4 peptide. Similar observations are expected for SPA4 peptide inhibition of the inflammatory response in other organs.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In summary, the results show that the treatment with SPA4 peptide inhibited NF-&#x3ba;B luciferase activity in dendritic cells, inflammatory symptoms, and TNF&#x3b1; levels in serum and lung tissue homogenates of mice against LPS stimuli. Moreover, the inhibition of LPS-induced NF-&#x3ba;B activity by SPA4 peptide was indistinguishable from those challenged with LPS alone, in absence of functional MYD88. Taken together, the results indicate that the SPA4 peptide exerts its inhibitory effect on the TLR-NF-&#x3ba;B pathway upstream of MYD88 adaptor protein and thereby regulates the TNF&#x3b1; response.</p>
