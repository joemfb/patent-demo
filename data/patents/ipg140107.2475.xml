<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention generally relates to methods of measuring cleaved von Willebrand factor (VWF) fragments. More specifically, the invention relates to methods of measuring the ability of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) to cleave VWF in vivo. The invention also relates to methods of using various animal models which demonstrate ADAMTS13 activity similar to that of a human. The invention further relates to methods of measuring the cleavage products of rVWF in mammals, particularly in humans and in human plasma.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention generally relates to methods of measuring cleaved von Willebrand factor (VWF) fragments. More specifically, the invention relates to methods of measuring the ability of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) to cleave VWF in vivo. The invention also relates to the use of various animal models which demonstrate ADAMTS13 activity similar to that of a human.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Circulating von Willebrand factor (VWF) in healthy humans is composed of a series of high molecular weight multimers ranging from about 450,000 to about 20 million Dalton (Da) or even higher molecular weight upon release from storage pools. VWF mediates primary hemostasis supporting the adhesion of platelets to damaged blood vessels. In addition to being necessary for platelet aggregation, VWF is required for the stabilization of circulating Factor VIII (FVIII). In von Willebrand disease (VWD), at least one of these functions of VWF is reduced, resulting in clinical symptoms of varying severity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The degree of VWF multimerization plays an important role in primary hemostatic function and correlates with the ability to promote platelet aggregation. The lack of high multimer forms of VWF results in decreased platelet aggregation, as seen in subjects with Type II VWD. On the other hand, the accumulation of ultra-large VWF multimers can cause thrombosis in the microvasculature. In healthy individuals the multimeric size of VWF is regulated by the presence of ADAMTS13. Due to ADAMTS13 cleavage of the VWF monomers between Tyr<sup>1605 </sup>and Met<sup>1606</sup>, the multimer pattern of VWF shows a characteristic &#x201c;triplet&#x201d; structure. Individuals lacking ADAMTS13 have an increased portion of ultra-large VWF multimers with a reduced triplet structure. These individuals often develop a syndrome called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) that is characterized by the formation of thrombi in the microvasculature with platelet consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">ADAMTS13 can only cleave VWF when its conformation changes from a globular to an extended form, a change which normally occurs only under shear stress. ADAMTS13 activity is usually measured in vitro under denaturing conditions to induce the conformational change, or by using a peptide substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, no method is available to test the in vivo activity of ADAMTS13 in the presence of endogenous VWF. Thus, there exists a need in the art to develop new methods of measuring the cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13. There also remains a need in the art to determine the efficacy of new recombinant VWF and ADAMTS13 products during preclinical and clinical studies. In addition, there is a need in the art for new methods to test the effectiveness of new therapies in the treatment of ADAMTS13 deficiencies in vivo.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention addresses one or more needs in the art relating to methods of measuring the in vivo activity of ADAMTS13 and methods of evaluating new types of recombinant von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and recombinant ADAMTS13 in vivo for their subsequent administration to a subject in need thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some aspects, a change in VWF cleavage fragment level is detected by measuring the level of one or more VWF fragments. In certain aspects, the VWF fragment that is measured is a 140 kDa VWF fragment or a 176 kDa VWF fragment. In particular aspects, the VWF fragment that is measured is a 176 kDa VWF fragment.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention includes methods for measuring ADAMTS13 activity in a subject comprising the steps of: adding VWF to a blood sample from the subject; measuring VWF cleavage fragments in the blood sample after exposure of the sample in the presence and absence of shear stress; comparing the VWF cleavage fragments to a reference curve of completely degraded VWF or to a reference curve from diluted human or animal plasma; and quantifying the VWF cleavage fragments based on the reference curve, wherein an amount of VWF cleavage fragments correlates with an amount of ADAMTS13 activity in the sample.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The methods of the invention included the use of various assays to measure ADAMTS13 activity. In some aspects, cleavage of rVWF by ADAMTS13 is carried out as described by Gerritsen et al. (<i>Thromb. Haemost. </i>82: 1386-1389, 1999) with minor modifications. Recombinant VWF is digested with Ba<sup>2+</sup>-activated ADAMTS13 under denaturing conditions. Plasma samples are diluted 1:20 in 5 mM Tris, 1.5 M urea, pH 8.0 (50 mU/mL ADAMTS13 activity), mixed with 9.3 mM BaCl<sub>2 </sub>to activate ADAMTS13 and 1 IU/mL of human rVWF (final concentration) and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 24 h. The reactions are stopped by adding Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>(8.25 mM). The solution is centrifuged and the resulting supernatant used for further analysis. As a positive control, 1 IU/mL of rVWF is incubated with human rADAMTS13 (50 mU/mL) under conditions that are otherwise identical to those used for the test item.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In other aspects of the invention, VWF antigen is determined in plasma samples. VWF:Ag was determined with an ELISA using commercially available polyclonal rabbit anti-VWF antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) as described by Tan et al. (<i>Thromb. Res. </i>121: 519-526, 2008).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another aspect of the invention, ADAMTS13 activity is measured using a fluorescent-labeled synthetic VWF peptide composed of 73 amino acids (FRETS-VWF73, Peptides Institute, Osaka, Japan) according to manufacturer's instructions. Plasma samples are measured against a reference curve of diluted normal human plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In even further aspects of the invention, determination of collagen-binding activity (VWF:CBA) is carried out. Binding of rVWF to collagen in some aspects is determined according to a published ELISA-based method (Turecek et al., <i>Semin. Thromb. Hemost. </i>28: 149-160, 2002). In some aspects, the collagen source is human collagen type III from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, Ala.). Bound rVWF is detected with polyclonal anti-VWF antibody conjugated with HRP (Dako).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In yet another aspect of the invention, VWF multimer analysis is carried out. In some aspects, the multimeric structure of rVWF is analyzed by high-density horizontal SDS agarose gel electrophoresis as described by Turecek et al. (<i>Blood </i>90: 3555-3567, 1997). Samples are diluted to 1.0 IU/mL VWF:Ag, and incubated with Tris-EDTA-SDS buffer. The multimers contained in the solution are separated under non-reducing conditions on a 2.5% high-resolution agarose gel. VWF multimers are visualized in the gel by immunostaining with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human VWF antibody (Dako), followed by alkaline-phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG using the ALP color development kit from Bio-Rad (Richmond, Calif., USA).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The invention also includes the analysis of specific ADAMTS13 cleavage products. ADAMTS13-mediated cleavage in some aspects is detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using either a polyclonal anti-human VWF antibody (Dako) or in some aspects one of the following mouse monoclonal antibodies: VW33-5, directed against the V8 protease fragment I of VWF (TaKaRa Bio Europe, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France); VW92-3, directed against the V8 protease fragment III of VWF under non-reducing conditions (TaKaRa Bio Europe); EsvWF10, which recognizes the A1 domain of VWF under reducing conditions (American Diagnostica, Stamford, Calif.), and N10, which detects the epitope generated upon ADAMTS13 cleavage in the N-terminal fragment (Kato et al., Transfusion 46: 1444-1452, 2006). In some aspects, antibodies are used with ALP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies and the ALP detection kit (Bio-Rad). In other aspects, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated polyclonal anti-VWF antibody from rabbit (Dako) is used with the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) to circumvent secondary antibodies reacting with endogenous immunoglobulins in mouse and rabbit plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The invention also includes methods of carrying out in vivo cleavage of rVWF in different animal species. In some aspects, in vivo susceptibility of human rVWF to ADAMTS13 cleavage is determined by injecting rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys with rVWF at doses of 1200, 600, 300, and 100 VWF:RCo IU/kg body weight (BW) and VWF- or ADAMTS13-deficient mice with rVWF at a dose of 2000 VWF:RCo IU/kg BW. Blood samples are taken at various time points. Mouse samples are immuno-depleted with protein G sepharose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) prior to analysis in some experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The methods of the invention include the diagnosis and testing effectiveness of a treatment for a disease or disorder associated with aberrant ADAMTS13 activity. Such diseases or disorders include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP or Moschcowitz disease). TTP is a rare disorder of the blood-coagulation system, causing extensive microscopic blood clots to form in the small blood vessels throughout the body. Most cases of TTP arise from deficiency or inhibition of the enzyme ADAMTS13, which is responsible for cleaving large multimers of VWF. Red blood cells passing the microscopic clots are subjected to shear stress which leads to hemolysis. Reduced blood flow and cellular injury results in end organ damage. Current therapy is based on support and plasmapheresis to reduce circulating antibodies against ADAMTS13 and replenish blood levels of the enzyme.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It has been found that subjects with congenital TTP or acquired TTP are severely deficient in ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13 is a metalloproteinase responsible for the breakdown of VWF, a protein that links platelets, blood clots, and the blood vessel wall in the process of blood coagulation. Very large VWF molecules are more prone to lead to coagulation. Hence, without proper cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13, coagulation occurs at a higher rate, especially in the part of the blood vessel system where VWF is most active due to high shear stress: in the microvasculature. Congenital ADAMTS13 deficiency is caused by mutations of the ADAMTS13 gene. Subjects with the familial form have severe protease deficiency. ADAMTS13 gene mutation in familial TTP causes inactivity or decreased activity of ADAMTS13. Acquired deficiency occurs with the production of autoantibodies inhibiting ADAMTS13 activity. Acquired TTP is idiopathic and secondary to complications such as autoimmune disease, malignancy, stem cell transplantation, pregnancy (especially the third trimester), certain drugs (including ticlopidine, mitomycin, clopidogrel, and cyclosporine) or infection. The invention provides methods of measuring ADAMTS13 activity in blood and for testing effectiveness of treatment for diseases associated with abnormal ADAMTS13 levels or activity in the blood.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Deficiency of ADAMTS13 was originally discovered in Upshaw-Shulman syndrome, the recurring familial form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). By that time it was already suspected that TTP occurred in the autoimmune form as well, owing to its response to plasmapheresis and characterization of IgG inhibitors. Since the discovery of ADAMTS13, specific epitopes on its surface have been shown to be the target of inhibitory antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">More than 70 mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene have been reported in people with the familial form of TTP. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in the ADAMTS13 enzyme. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of ADAMTS13 that cannot function properly. Mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene severely reduce the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme. As a result, VWF is not processed normally in the bloodstream. If VWF is not processed normally by ADAMTS13, it promotes the formation of abnormal clots throughout the body by inducing platelets to stick together and adhere to the walls of blood vessels, even in the absence of injury. Additional factors such as pregnancy, diarrhea, surgery, and infection likely play a role in triggering abnormal clotting. Blood clots can block blood flow through small vessels, causing damage to the brain, kidneys, heart, and other organs. Abnormal clotting also causes other complications associated with TTP.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The TTP syndrome is characterized by microangiopathic hemolysis and platelet aggregation/hyaline thrombi whose formation is unrelated to coagulation system activity. Platelet microthrombi predominate; they form in the microcirculation (i.e., arterioles, capillaries) throughout the body causing partial occlusion of vessels. Organ ischemia, thrombocytopenia, and erythrocyte fragmentation (i.e., schistocytes) occur. The thrombi partially occlude the vascular lumina with overlying proliferative endothelial cells. The endothelia of the kidneys, brain, heart, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are particularly vulnerable to TTP. The liver, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, skeletal muscles, retina, pituitary gland, ovaries, uterus, and testes are also affected to a lesser extent. No inflammatory changes occur.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In 1982, Moake and his colleagues observed ultra-large VWF (ULVWF) multimers in the plasma of four subjects with relapsing TTP (Moake J L, <i>Semin. Hematol. </i>34:83-89, 1997; Moake J L, <i>Semin. Hematol. </i>41:4-14, 2004). These multimers were the same size as those noted in the endothelial cells. The plasma of normal individuals has much smaller VWF. Moake suggested that there was a deficiency in an enzyme that reduces the large VWF to its normal size in plasma in subjects with TTP. Also noted was that this large VWF has a greater ability to adhere with platelets mediating a thrombus formation.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The present section provides a description of the relationship between the biological function of ADAMTS13 and the existence of ULVWF multimers and the occurrence of TTP or TTP-like clinical symptoms to the extent that such a description will facilitate a better understanding of the methods of the invention. There is a relationship between the biological function of ADAMTS13 and the existence of ULVWF multimers and the occurrence of TTP or TTP-like clinical symptoms. The pathogenesis of TTP is due to the platelet clumping in the microvasculature. There is an increased adherence of the ULVWF multimers leading to the formation of platelet thrombi due to the lack of a functioning proteolytic enzyme (ADAMTS13) to cleave these multimers.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">TTP also may be related to cancer, chemotherapy, HIV infection, hormone replacement therapy and estrogens, and a number of commonly used medications (including ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and cyclosporine A). Systemic connective tissue diseases are other conditions besides TTP that are associated in some instances with low but detectable levels of ADAMTS13. Recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13) is one of many therapies being tested in the treatment of TTP. The invention includes methods of testing the effectiveness of rADAMTS13 and all therapies associated with ADAMTS13-associated diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A low level of ADAMTS13 causes clotting substances (platelets) in the blood to clump. As the platelets clump together, there are fewer platelets available in the bloodstream. This clumping, or aggregation, can lead to bleeding under the skin and purple-colored spots called purpura. It also can cause red blood cells to break apart (undergo hemolysis) as they are subjected to shear stress as they pass the microscopic platelet clots. Red blood cells are thus destroyed prematurely. Reduced blood flow and cellular injury results in end organ damage.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Levels of human ADAMTS13 antigen may be determined by ELISA (Rieger et al., <i>Thromb. Haemost. </i>95:212-220, 2006). ADAMTS13 activity may be measured based on decreased collagen binding affinity of degraded VWF (Gerritsen et al., <i>Thromb. Haemost. </i>82:1386-1389, 1999), which is a functional assay based on the preferential binding of high-molecular-weight forms of VWF to collagen. In this assay, the diluted plasma sample to be tested is added to normal plasma in which protease activity had been abolished. The VWF present in the protease-depleted plasma is digested by the VWF-cleaving protease in the test plasma. The proteolytic degradation leads to low-molecular-weight forms of VWF, which show impaired binding to microtiter plates coated with human collagen type III. The collagen-bound VWF is quantified using a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antibody against human VWF. The values of VWF-cleaving protease activity in tested plasma samples are read from a calibration curve achieved by incubating the VWF-substrate with dilutions of a normal human plasma pool (NHP).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Current purpura or TTP therapy is based on support and plasmapheresis to reduce circulating antibodies against ADAMTS13 and replenish blood levels of ADAMTS13. Plasma exchange has been the first-line therapy for TTP since 1991. Congenital deficiency can replace the deficiency and mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene by plasma infusion. Acquired deficiency can remove the inhibitor of ADAMTS13 by plasmapheresis. However, plasma exchange is more effective treatment than plasma infusion. This life-threatening condition may have a positive outcome if recognized early and medical intervention is initiated early.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, an increase in circulating levels of VWF and a decrease in ADAMTS13 activity in humans are considered risk factors for ischemic stroke (Zhao et al., American Society of Hematology, Abstract 259, Dec. 6-9, 2008, San Francisco, Calif.). Thus, the methods of measuring ADAMTS13 activity in vivo herein also have application in stroke diagnosis and therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The invention also includes methods for diagnosing abnormal processing of VWF or deficiencies in ADAMTS13 concentration or activity, and testing therapies to increase ADAMTS13 concentration or activity used in the development of new therapies in the treatment of TTP and other ADAMTS13-related pathologies or disorders. In various aspects, other ADAMTS13-related pathologies or disorders include diseases which are characterized by abnormal levels of VWF or abnormal processing of VWF.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The present section provides a description of VWF syndrome to the extent that such a description will facilitate a better understanding of the methods of the invention. VWF syndrome manifests clinically when there is either an underproduction or an overproduction of VWF. Overproduction of VWF causes increased thrombosis (formation of a clot or thrombus inside a blood vessel, obstructing the flow of blood) while reduced levels of, or lack of, high-molecular weight forms of VWF causes increased bleeding and an increased bleeding time due to inhibition of platelet aggregation and wound closure. The methods of the invention can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of various types of VWF syndrome.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A VWF deficiency may also cause a phenotypic Hemophilia A since VWF is an essential component of functional FVIII. In these instances, the half-life of Factor VIII is reduced to such an extent that its function in the blood coagulation cascade is impaired. Subjects suffering from VWD or VWF syndrome frequently exhibit an FVIII deficiency. In these subjects, reduced FVIII activity is not the consequence of a defect of the X chromosomal gene, but an indirect consequence of quantitative and qualitative change(s) of VWF in plasma. The differentiation between Hemophilia A and VWD may normally be effected by measuring the VWF antigen or by determining the ristocetin-cofactor activity. Ristocetin cofactor activity is measured by adding ristocetin and a platelet substrate to the subject's plasma. Ristocetin enhances binding of VWF to the platelet glycoprotein Ib receptor, resulting in agglutination. The subject's VWF will support the platelet agglutination induced by the ristocetin as measured by a change in light transmission. Therefore, this assay is an in vitro measurement of the functional activity of the subject's VWF. Both the VWF antigen content and the ristocetin cofactor activity are lowered in most VWD subjects, whereas they are normal in Hemophilia A subjects.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">VWD is an inherited bleeding disorder that is caused by deficiency or dysfunction of VWF. Therefore, defects in VWF can cause bleeding by impairing platelet adhesion or by reducing the concentration of FVIII. VWD is diagnosed after a clinical and physical review, with personal and familial evidence of (primarily mucocutaneous) bleeding, and confirmed by laboratory testing. Laboratory testing typically entails initial plasma testing of factor VIII coagulant (FVIII:C), von Willebrand factor (VWF) protein (antigen; VWF:Ag), and VWF function or activity, which is assessed using the ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo) assay or the collagen binding assay (VWF:CBA). The VWF:CBA is based on measurement of the quantity of VWF bound to collagen, similar to the procedure for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additional laboratory testing can comprise a battery of confirmatory and VWD subtype assisting assays, including assessment of VWF:multimers.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">More specifically, the VWF:Ag assay is a quantitative assay and provides a measure of the overall level of VWF present in a patient's plasma; it is not a functional assay and yields no information concerning the quality of the VWF present. The VWF:CBA assay is a functional assay which provides information on the quality of VWF present. The VWF:Ag and VWF:CBA are complementary assays and, in various aspects, are used in combination. The VWF:RCo assay is both a quantitative and qualitative assay that provides information about the presence of VWF that lies between that provided individually by the VWF:Ag and VWF:CBA assays. The VWF:multimer assay is a qualitative procedure, and is semi-quantitative. The VWF:multimer assay provides a snap-shot of the VWF present. The above-described assays are well known in the art for testing VWF in vitro.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Methods provided also include, in various aspects, use of VWF. All forms of VWF and recombinant VWF are contemplated for use in the methods of the invention.

Recombinant human ADAMTS13 has been described (Plaimauer et al., <i>Blood </i>100:3626-3632, 2002). Recombinant human ADAMTS13 is not yet available commercially for human administration, but the invention includes the use of such rADAMTS13 in clinical trials and when it is commercially available. In subjects with an inherited ADAMTS13 deficiency, normal human plasma is used as a source of ADAMTS13 and contains IU/mL of ADAMTS13.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As set out herein above, VWF multimeric size and consequently VWF activity is regulated by ADAMTS13 activity in the blood. The aim of the study was to determine the susceptibility of human rVWF to cleavage by ADAMTS13 present in the plasma of different animal species. The ability of ADAMTS13 of different species to cleave human rVWF was tested in vitro as well as in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Determination of ADAMTS13 Activity:</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Diluted plasma samples from various animals were treated with barium chloride to activate ADAMTS13. Human rVWF (1 U/mL) (obtained from CHO cells by fermentation and purification (Turecek et al., <i>Blood </i>108: Abstract 1017, 2006; American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting Abstracts) was added and the mixture was incubated for 24 h under denaturing conditions (1.5 M urea). ADAMTS13 activity was then determined by a number of assays as described herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Collagen Binding Activity (VWF:CBA) Assay:</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Samples were incubated in wells coated with collagen. Bound rVWF was detected using a polyclonal anti-human VWF antibody (DAKO, Denmark). The ADAMTS13 activity of plasma samples was expressed as a percent of residual VWF:CB activity compared to non-cleaved rVWF and data were illustrated in dose-response curves (1:20 to 1:3000 dilutions) or as a percent of collagen binding activity (CBA) decrease compared to normal human plasma (NHP) (1:20 dilution, equivalent to 50 mU/mL human ADAMTS13 activity). As described herein above, the VWF:CBA is a functional assay which provides quantitative as well as qualitative information on the quality of VWF present.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Activity Assay:</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The proteolytic activity of ADAMTS13 was measured using a fluorescent-labeled synthetic VWF peptide composed of 73 amino acids (FRETS-VWF73, Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasma samples (ADAMTS13 activity) were measured against a reference curve prepared from diluted normal human plasma (NHP) and expressed as a percent of NHP.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Immunoblotting:</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing and non-reducing conditions using gradient (3%-8%) Tris-acetate gels followed by electro-blotting proteins onto PVDF membranes and incubating with monoclonal (MoAb. VW33-5: TaKaRa Bio Inc., Japan; MoAb N10: Abcam, USA, Kato et al. (2006) Transfusion, 46, 1444) and polyclonal rabbit anti-human VWF (DAKO, Denmark) antibodies. As a control, rVWF was treated with recombinant ADAMTS13 (Plaimauer et al., <i>Blood </i>100: 3626, 2002). Secondary antibodies were labeled either with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The proteins were visualized using an ALP or enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit. Multimer analysis was performed using high resolution horizontal SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by immunostaining with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human VWF antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Animals:</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Animal plasma samples used in this study were taken from monkey (Rhesus and Cynomolgus), rabbit (New Zealand White), pig (Yorkshire), dog (Beagle), guinea pig (Dunkin Hartley), rat (Sprague Dawley), and mice (VWF-deficient (def) and ADAMTS13-deficient (both with C57BL backgrounds).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In Vivo Studies:</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">New Zealand White rabbits were treated with 1200 IU VWF:Ristocetin Cofactor activity (VWF:RCo)/kg body weight (BW) via intravenous injection. As described herein above, the VWF:RCo assay is one method of measuring VWF concentration/activity. Consequently, the concentration of VWF is often reported in VWF:RCo units. Blood samples before injection with rVWF and at various time points after injection were withdrawn from rabbits from the central auricular artery. Citrated plasma was prepared and stored frozen. Mice were either treated with 2000 IU VWF:RCo/kg BW alone or co-treated with rADAMTS13 at 19.4 &#x3bc;g/kg BW via intravenous injection. Blood samples from mice were withdrawn by cardiac puncture and citrated plasma was prepared and stored frozen. Mouse plasma samples from the in vivo studies were immuno-depleted with protein G sepharose beads before loading gels to avoid reactivity of MoAbs with endogenous IgGs.</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The changes in multimeric structure of rVWF after cleavage by human ADAMTS13 are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. VWF multimers in normal human plasma (NHP) show satellite bands, as a result of ADAMTS13 cleavage (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Recombinant VWF contains high MW multimers without any satellite structure (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). Incubation of rVWF with ADAMTS13 under denaturing conditions leads to the reduction of multimer numbers with appearance of lower multimers and satellite bands.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The specific cleavage of rVWF monomers by ADAMTS13 is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. ADAMTS13-specific cleavage of the rVWF monomers results in a 140 kDa N-terminal and a 176-kDa C-terminal fragment, which can be detected by immunoblotting. Results of immunoblotting using reducing SDS-PAGE with monoclonal antibodies for VWF are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Monoclonal antibody N10 detects the N-terminal 140-kDa fragment of VWF only when cleaved between Tyr<sup>1605 </sup>and Met<sup>1606 </sup>by ADAMTS13 (no reaction with the intact VWF). Monoclonal antibody VW33-5 detects the 176-kDa C-terminal fragment and the intact VWF. Results of immunoblotting using non-reducing SDS-PAGE with a polyclonal antibody for VWF are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The polyclonal rabbit anti-VWF Ab detects both cleavage fragments and the intact VWF multimers.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">ADAMTS13-dependent cleavage of rVWF was detected by residual VWF collagen-binding (VWF:CBA) activity (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). ADAMTS13 activity, as measured by FRETS and VWF:CBA, is also set out in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. ADAMTS13 activity is expressed as a percentage of NHP. The enzymatic activity of ADAMTS13 in rabbit plasma was as high as that of human plasma (as measured by CBA and FRETS). Less ADAMTS13 activity was observed in samples from Cynomolgus and Rhesus monkeys, pig, and dog. However, FRETS showed higher ADAMTS13 activity than CBA. Little or no ADAMTS13 activity was detected in plasma samples derived from VWF-deficient mouse, ADAMTS13 deficient mouse, rat, and guinea pig.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Visualization of VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 using high resolution multimer analysis (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) showed that rabbit plasma induced degradation of rVWF and the formation of satellite bands similar to normal human plasma (NHP). Cynomolgus monkey, Rhesus monkey, pig, and dog also showed specific cleavage of rVWF, however, to a lesser extent. No relevant changes were observed with guinea pig, rat, and mouse plasma compared with rVWF incubated with buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The use of immunoblotting to visualize ADAMTS13 cleavage of rVWF (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) demonstrated that the intensity of the bands (cleaved VWF) generally correlated well with the results of the VWF:CBA assay. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the results of SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions followed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-human VWF antibody linked with HRP. This polyclonal anti-human VWF antibody detects both VWF cleavage fragments (140 and 176 kDa) and the intact multimers, and is more sensitive but less specific than the monoclonal antibodies. The results of immunoblotting with the polyclonal antibody (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) indicated cleavage of human rVWF after incubation with plasma from human, rabbit, monkey, pig, or dog, but not with guinea pig, rat, or mouse.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">A comparable result was obtained with the monoclonal antibody VW33-5 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the results of SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by immunoblotting with monoclonal VWF antibodies. As discussed herein above, monoclonal antibody VW33-5 detects the C-terminal 176 kDa fragment and the intact VWF, whereas monoclonal antibody N10 detects the N-terminal 140 kDa fragment of VWF, only when cleaved between Tyr<sup>1605 </sup>and Met<sup>1606 </sup>by ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13 cleavage of VWF was also detected by the N10 antibody (see 140 kDa bands in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The asterisk in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> denotes reactions of the goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (secondary) with endogenous mouse plasma IgGs. These reactions precluded visualization of the 140 kDa monomer with the N10 antibody in the mouse samples. The intensity of the bands generally correlated well with results from CBA assays.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In plasma of human, rabbit, Cynomolgus and Rhesus monkeys, ADAMTS13-specific cleavage of the rVWF monomers was demonstrated by immunoblotting. In pig and dog, low levels of the 176 kDa fragment were detectable. No rVWF fragments were visible when incubated with plasma of C57BL mouse strains, rat, and guinea pig.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Specific in vivo cleavage of rVWF (1200 IU VWF:RCo/kg) by ADAMTS13 (140 kDa and 176 kDa fragments) in rabbits was detected with monoclonal antibodies by immunoblotting after reducing SDS-PAGE (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</figref> and B). As controls, uncleaved rVWF and rVWF cleaved with rADAMTS13 in vitro are shown. Characteristic changes in multimer pattern shortly after rVWF administration are also seen (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows specific in vivo cleavage of rVWF (2000 IU VWF:RCo/kg) by ADAMTS13 in VWF-deficient and ADAMTS13-deficient mice. The 176 kDa VWF cleavage fragment was not visible in either mouse strain using the monoclonal antibody specific to the C-terminal fragment (VW33-5) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>) after non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The asterisk denotes reactions of the goat anti-mouse IgG antibody with mouse plasma IgGs. These reactions precluded visualization of the 140 kDa monomer with the N10 antibody. No detectable changes in rVWF multimer pattern were observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). 140 kDa and 176 kDa homodimers were only detectable in VWF-deficient, but not in ADAMTS13-deficient mice using the more sensitive (but less specific) polyclonal antibody under non-reducing conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A direct comparison of the efficiency of ADAMTS13 cleavage in the animal models was carried out under non-reducing SDS-PAGE with equal amounts of VWF:Ag being loaded (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). In rabbit plasma samples, a stronger band corresponding to the 176 kDa VWF cleavage product was detectable compared to the VWF-deficient mouse sample. No cleavage was detectable in ADAMTS13-deficient mouse plasma. Co-injection of rVWF with human rADAMTS13 induced cleavage of rVWF. Control lanes 1-3 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> represent rVWF uncleaved (1), rVWF premixed with rADAMTS13 (2), and rVWF cleaved in vitro by rADAMTS13 (3).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">VWF cleavage fragments were detected in Cynomolgus plasma after a single dose injection of rVWF (100 &#x3bc;l/kg) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Completely and partially ADAMTS13-degraded rVWF fragments (1 Ag U/mL) were measured in Cynomolgus plasma after a single dose injection of rVWF with Western blotting under non-reducing conditions after 15 seconds of exposure with the rabbit anti-human VWF antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>). A baseline degradation band (176 kDa dimer) was seen in Cynomolgus plasma before rVWF injection. An increase in the amount of the 176 kDa VWF dimer was seen after the injection of rVWF. The 176 kDa VWF dimer was greater than baseline (pre-injection) even 24 h after VWF injection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>), when no elevated VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) was measured (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">These results show that substantial differences in the in vitro cleavage susceptibility of human rVWF by ADAMTS13 were found among the plasma of different animal species. Rabbit plasma was as effective in proteolysis of human rVWF as homologous human plasma. Plasma samples from Cynomolgus monkey, Rhesus monkey, pig, and dog showed medium ADAMTS13 proteolytic activity toward human rVWF. Plasma samples from VWF-deficient mouse, rat, and guinea pig showed virtually no ADAMTS13 activity towards human rVWF.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The in vivo studies with injection of high doses of rVWF in rabbits and mice confirmed the in vitro results. The residual cleavage observed in the VWF-deficient mouse was confirmed by the absence of cleavage in the ADAMTS13-deficient mouse. In rabbit plasma, rVWF was efficiently cleaved as demonstrated by ADAMTS13-specific cleavage fragments of VWF and satellite band formation of multimers. In VWF-deficient and ADAMTS13-deficient mouse plasma, hardly any rVWF cleavage was noted. Human rADAMTS13 was able to substitute for the mouse ADAMTS13 enzyme and cleave VWF when co-injected with rVWF in mice.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">These data demonstrate poor species compatibility between human rVWF and endogenous ADAMTS13 present in plasma of mice, rats, and guinea pigs. ADAMTS13 present in the plasma of the Cynomolgus monkey, Rhesus monkey, pig, and dog showed better proteolytic activity toward human rVWF; however ADAMTS13 proteolytic activity was still lower than that of human ADAMTS13 activity toward human rVWF. Rabbit ADAMTS13 activity appeared to be as effective in proteolysis of human rVWF as homologous human plasma. These species differences in the proteolytic activity/specificity of ADAMTS13 should be taken into consideration when evaluating the efficacy, (patho)physiology, and metabolism of human rVWF in different animals. This study also suggests that the rabbit, and rabbit plasma in general, may be useful as a model for evaluating and testing human rVWF.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The method is also suitable for detecting the effect of endogenous ADAMTS13 on injected rVWF in various animal models. The methods of the invention allow for the investigation of the suitability of various animal models in determining the effect of ADAMTS13 on rVWF in different species.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Normal human plasma, severe VWF-deficient human plasma, ADAMTS13-deficient human plasma, and Cynomolgus plasma samples, obtained before and after (1, 3, 9, 15, and 24 hours) rVWF injection (100 IU VWF:RCo/kg), were used. Completely and partially degraded rVWF treated with rADAMTS13 under denaturing conditions were used as controls.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Plasma samples were applied to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions followed by Western blotting. The blots were stained with an HRP-labeled rabbit anti-human VWF polyclonal antibody (Dako), and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) plus technique.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Completely and partially ADAMTS13-degraded rVWF (1 Ag U/mL) were measured in buffer and VWF-deficient plasma with Western blotting under non-reducing conditions after 15 seconds of exposure with the polyclonal rabbit anti-human VWF antibody (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). Reducing conditions were not sensitive enough to visualize results. No differences between dilutions in buffer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>) and VWF-deficient plasma (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>) were detected with Western blot analysis. The VWF-derived C-terminal fragment (176 kDa dimer) was detected using ECL. Completely degraded rVWF (1 Ag U/mL) could be detected at &#x3e;62.5 fold dilution (16 nL/1 &#x3bc;L plasma). No cross reaction was seen with other human plasma proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">VWF cleavage fragments were detected in plasma by increasing the sensitivity of the assay through increasing the exposure time (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). Completely and partially ADAMTS13-degraded rVWF (1 Ag U/mL) were measured in buffer and VWF-deficient plasma with Western blotting under non-reducing conditions after 15 seconds (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>) and 60 seconds (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>) of exposure with the rabbit anti-human VWF antibody. A 176 kDa cleavage fragment can be seen in normal human plasma, but not in VWF-deficient plasma (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A</figref> and B). Traces of a 176 kDa cleavage fragment are detected in ADAMTS13-deficient plasma (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A</figref> and B), but in a much lesser amount compared to the total VWF present. Completely degraded rVWF (1 Ag U/mL) was well detected at up to 320 times dilution (2.5 nL/0.8 &#x3bc;L plasma/lane) with 60 sec exposure time (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The detection limit or level of sensitivity of the Western blot assay was further determined by diluting plasma samples and increasing exposure time to two minutes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Normal human plasma was diluted 20-fold (from 5 nL to 100 nL) and a 176 kDa cleavage product was well detected after two minutes when 20-40 nL normal human plasma was applied (in 0.8 &#x3bc;L VWF-deficient plasma) (0.025-0.05 Ag U/mL VWF) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>). No ADAMTS13-specific band (VWF cleavage product) could be seen in VWF-deficient plasma (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>). Fully degraded rVWF (1 Ag U/mL) was diluted 40-fold (0.5 nL to 20 nL) and could be detected, as measured by the 176 kDa VWF dimer, at about 0.0006 U/mL concentration (0.5 nL/0.8 &#x3bc;L plasma) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 was further measured in plasma by quantifying VWF degradation bands (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>).

Approximately 1-2% of C-terminal dimers (the 176 kDa ADAMTS13 specific cleavage product) were found in human normal plasma when calculated from a reference curve constructed from the band intensity of the different amounts of completely degraded rVWF (1 Ag U/mL) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Therefore, a highly sensitive method for the specific detection of ADAMTS13-mediated VWF cleavage bands in plasma was developed. Based on a quantitative comparison with a completely degraded rVWF, approximately 1-2% of total VWF:Ag appeared as a 176 kDa degradation band in normal human plasma. C-terminal dimers (176 kDa dimers) in normal plasma can be detected at a lower limit of 0.025-0.05 U/mL VWF:Ag concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">This study showed that the VWF cleavage product correlates with ADAMTS13 activity indicating that this method is suitable for detecting the effect of endogenous ADAMTS13 on injected rVWF in vivo. The method can also be used as a marker of in vivo ADAMTS13 activity. This example therefore illustrates the development of a highly sensitive method for measuring ADAMTS13 activity in vivo by the examination of VWF cleavage products in plasma samples.</p>

The experimental design was based on a publication by Shim et al.

As a positive control, rVWF was incubated with rADAMTS13 under denaturing conditions (1.5 M urea) for 24 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The samples were applied to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions on 3-8% Tris-Acetate gels (500 nL per lane) followed by Western blotting using an HRP-labeled rabbit anti-human VWF polyclonal antibody (Dako) in combination with an ECL plus technique. Results of this experiment are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The degradation control marks the position of the 176 kDa dimer, which is specifically generated upon ADAMTS13 cleavage of VWF. Bands of the same mobility were discernible for the samples subjected to shear stress. By contrast, rVWF starting material and the otherwise identical samples kept under static conditions did not show the specific cleavage fragment.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The specificity of the observed VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 was also analyzed by multimer analysis. rVWF (3 IU/mL final concentration) was mixed with rADAMTS13 (5 U/mL final concentration) in a reaction buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 &#x3bc;M ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH=7.4. The reaction was started by subjecting the sample to a shear rate of 6000 s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes and was stopped by the addition of EDTA (5 mM final concentration). As a negative control, an identical sample was similarly incubated in the absence of shear stress.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Low and high resolution multimer analysis (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>) showed that rADAMTS13 induced degradation of rVWF and the formation of satellite bands, resulting in a pattern similar to that of normal human plasma (NHP, George King). No relevant changes in the multimer pattern were observed for the sample kept under static, yet otherwise identical, conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The combined data demonstrate that ADAMTS13-dependent VWF cleavage, subject to in vitro conditions that more closely resemble the physiological one in blood circulation, is achieved and can be measured by the newly developed assay.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">This assay is therefore also suitable for measuring ADAMTS13 activity in human plasma samples by the addition of rVWF as a substrate. Applicable are plasma samples with a wide range of ADAMTS13 activity levels.</p>

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Detection of the Effect of Recombinant ADAMTS130N Endogenous VWF in Plasma</heading>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The aim of this study is to further develop the method of detecting ADAMTS13 cleavage products in plasma in order to detect the effect of injected recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13) on endogenous VWF in human and different animal samples. This will result in a method to choose the best suitable model for preclinical studies of rADAMTS13. Methods as set out herein above are used to test the effect of rADAMTS13 on the cleavage of rVWF and endogenous VWF in the plasma of various animal species, including human plasma.</p>
