<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an LED light source, and more particularly, to an LED light source having a bulb-like exterior, wherein a control module circuit can be disposed inside the LED light source.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the development of semi-conductor light emitting devices, a light-emitting diode (LED), which has several advantages such as power save, seismic resistance, quick reaction, and so on, becomes a new light source. In order to raise the intensity of light, high-power LED has been used as the light source in many illumination products. Although high-power LED can provide stronger light, it may also cause other problems related to heat dissipation. For example, if the heat generated by the LED cannot be dissipated in time, the LED will suffer from &#x201c;heat shock&#x201d; which may affect the luminous efficiency and reduce the work life of the LED.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The heat-dissipating component of traditional LED light source usually dissipates the heat with a plurality of fins, wherein the fins have to be attached to a carrier which carries the LED to achieve higher heat-dissipating efficiency. However, the size of the fins used for high-power LED is usually large, and the utility of space of the LED light source applied high-power LED will be limited if the fins are required to be attached to the carrier directly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, when a control circuit is disposed inside the LED light source, it is difficult to form the exterior of the LED light source with a shape of light bulb while considering the heat-dissipating issue. Thus, the size of the LED light source may not fit the socket or the holder of traditional light bulb, and the traditional light bulb may therefore not easy to be replaced with the LED light source.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it is necessary to provide an LED light source which could make full use of space inside the device by disposing the fins properly, that is, the LED light source can dissipate heat by the fins which are not limited to contact the carrier directly for solving the above-mentioned problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

Besides, the first cooling part is engaged with the second cooling part by at least a screw or a hook for fixing the contact part inside the space.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment of the invention, the shell further comprises a bottom surface, and the cooling component comprises at least a locking hole, collocating with the screw, for locking the cooling component on the bottom surface. Furthermore, the cooling component is engaged with the bottom surface by a hook. Besides, the extension part is covered by an insulation sleeve to reduce the heat radiating from the heat pipe inside the shell. Moreover, the dome is a light homogenizer for homogenizing the light generated by the energy conversion component.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment of the invention, the shell further comprises a connector, electrically connected to the control module circuit, for providing the power required by the control module circuit and the energy conversion component.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a plane view of the energy conversion component and the carrier of the LED light source. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates a cross section of the energy conversion component, the carrier, and a part of the heat-pipe along line Z-Z in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. According to the first preferred embodiment, the energy conversion component <b>10</b> includes light-emitting semiconductor structures <b>102</b>, a substrate <b>104</b> and a substrate holder <b>106</b>. The light-emitting semiconductor structures <b>102</b>, known as the first LEDs and the second LEDs above, are disposed on the substrate <b>104</b>. The substrate holder <b>106</b> includes a first sunken portion <b>106</b><i>a </i>and a second sunken portion <b>106</b><i>b </i>connected to the first sunken portion <b>106</b><i>a</i>. The substrate <b>104</b> contacts with the flat part <b>140</b> and is connected to the second sunken portion <b>106</b><i>b</i>, and the light-emitting semiconductor structures <b>102</b> are exposed out of the first sunken portion <b>106</b><i>a</i>. The carrier <b>22</b> has a through hole <b>222</b> for containing wires, wherein the wires can provide the power to the energy conversion component <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The light-emitting semiconductor structure <b>102</b> is an independent sunken portion chip and it is fixed (die bonded) on the substrate <b>104</b>. The light-emitting semiconductor structure <b>102</b> is wired to inner electrodes of the substrate holder <b>106</b> with metal wires <b>24</b> and then the light-emitting semiconductor structure <b>102</b> is electrically connected to the control circuit through wires welded to outer electrodes <b>106</b><i>c </i>which is connected to the inner electrodes on the substrate holder <b>106</b> (please also refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The light-emitting semiconductor structure <b>102</b> and metal wires <b>24</b> are fixed or sealed on the substrate <b>104</b> by a packing material <b>108</b>. The substrate holder <b>106</b> is fixed on the carrier <b>22</b> by screwing screws through holes <b>106</b><i>d </i>to the carrier <b>22</b>. The packing material <b>108</b> is also able to adjust light.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the first preferred embodiment, the energy conversion component <b>10</b> includes a lens <b>26</b> disposed on the substrate holder <b>106</b>. The lens <b>26</b> is able to converge light, but not limited to it. With a proper design on the curvatures of two sides of the lens <b>26</b>, the lens <b>26</b> is able to converge or scatter light for satisfying different optical adjustment requirements. In practical application, the optical adjustment effect of the LED light source also needs to consider optical characters of a lens structure of the optical modulator. What is remarkable is that the lens structure of the optical modulator is not limited to a convex lens. For example, there can further comprise a recess at the middle of the lens structure and thus light is converged to become a ring shape roughly by the lens structure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Additionally, the substrate holder <b>106</b> could be formed by imbedding a lead frame of metal into a mold and then injecting liquid crystal plastic into the mold. Therein, the inner electrodes defined on the lead frame are exposed out of the first sunken portion <b>106</b><i>a</i>, and the outer electrodes <b>106</b><i>c </i>are exposed out of the substrate holder <b>106</b>. Additionally, the light-emitting semiconductors <b>102</b> could be connected in serial by wiring as shown by the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Meantime, the light-emitting semiconductor structure <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> only retains one metal wire <b>24</b> to be connected to the substrate holder <b>106</b>. If there is a circuit on the substrate <b>104</b>, for example a semiconductor substrate with a circuit formed in process or a circuit board coated with a metal circuit, the light-emitting semiconductor structure <b>102</b> could be wired to the substrate <b>104</b> and then electrically connected to the substrate holder <b>106</b> through the substrate <b>104</b>. If the substrate <b>104</b> is designed not to be a medium for electrical connection, the substrate <b>104</b> could be made of a metal material or other materials with high thermal conductivity for raising the thermal conduction efficiency of conducting the heat generated by the light-emitting semiconductor structure <b>102</b> to the flat part <b>140</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Similarly, the flat part <b>140</b> could slightly protrude out of the carrier <b>22</b> and the bottom surface <b>106</b><i>e </i>of the substrate holder <b>106</b> and the bottom surface <b>104</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>104</b> are coplanar. The above purpose for ensuring sticking tightly could also be achieved. In the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, if there is a gap between the substrate holder <b>106</b> and the flat part <b>140</b>, a thermal conductive glue could be coated on the bottom surface of the substrate holder <b>106</b> or the flat part <b>140</b> to be filled with the gap. Of course, in the structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the thermal conductive glue could be coated on the bottom surface <b>106</b><i>e </i>of the substrate holder <b>106</b> or the flat part <b>140</b> to be filled with the gap formed due to surface roughness of the bottom surface <b>106</b><i>e </i>or the flat part <b>140</b>.</p>

Therefore, the light-emitting semiconductor <b>102</b> could be integrated to form on the substrate <b>104</b> easily in a semiconductor process. Additionally, the electrodes of the light-emitting semiconductor structure <b>102</b> formed on the semi-substrate <b>104</b> could be integrated on the substrate <b>104</b> in advance, so that only two times of wiring are required to the light-emitting semiconductor structure <b>102</b>.
