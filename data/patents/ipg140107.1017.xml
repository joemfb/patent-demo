<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/127,236 filed on May 27, 2008 which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-165406 filed on Jun. 22, 2007, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a component transferring apparatus and an IC handler.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a testing apparatus (an IC handler) that inspects electronic components such as semiconductor chips includes a plurality of transferring robots to transfer the components. The transferring robots transfer an electronic component before inspection into an inspection socket to measure quality of the component, and then, retrieve the inspected component from the socket.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Specifically, for example, a supplying robot sucks and holds an electronic component before inspection and then releases the component to mount in a supply pocket of a shuttle. Next, the shuttle moves the electronic component to a position where a measuring robot is located to suck and hold the component. The measuring robot transfers the electronic component before inspection from the shuttle to the inspection socket. After inspection is finished, the measuring robot again sucks and holds the component inspected to transfer it from the inspection socket into a retrieval pocket of the shuttle. Then, the shuttle moves the inspected component to a position of a retrieving robot, where the retrieving robot releases the component into a retrieval tray in accordance with an inspection result.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the robots sequentially transfer the electronic component to the inspection socket and the pockets, the component is needed to be mounted in a predetermined position in each of the inspection socket and the pockets. Particularly, in order to mount the electronic component in the inspection socket, it is necessary to suitably contact measuring terminals of the inspection socket with terminals of the electronic component. Thus, it is desirable to minimize a relative positional deviation between the electronic component and the inspection socket. Additionally, when the component is mounted in each pocket, reducing a relative positional deviation between the pocket and the component is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to reduce the relative positional deviation between the electronic component and the inspection socket or the like, there is known a method. In this method, first, a camera photographs the electronic component, the inspection socket or the like to obtain image data. Next, an image processing of the data is performed to calculate the relative deviation amount, and then, based on a calculation result, positional correction is performed by only the relative deviation amount.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, there is disclosed a method for correcting a relative positional deviation between an electronic component and a socket or the like (e.g. WO 2003/023430). In an IC handler employed in the method, when an electronic component before inspection is transferred from a shuttle to a test device, a camera located between the shuttle and a test socket (the test device) photographs the component sucked and hold by a transfer head of a transferring apparatus. Additionally, a camera equipped with the transfer head photographs the test device. A controlling device of the IC handler performs the image processing of each image data obtained by the above photographing operations to calculate a relative deviation between the electronic component and the test device. Then, based on a calculation result, the controlling device operates an adjustment mechanism of the transferring apparatus to adjust a position of the transfer head so as to correct the relative deviation between the component and the test device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additionally, when transferring the inspected electronic component from the shuttle to a tray, a pick and place (P&#x26;P) robot sucks and holds the component to transfer from the shuttle to the tray. The IC handler moves the P&#x26;P robot to above a camera located within a movable range of the robot to allow the camera to photograph the component sucked by the robot. The controlling device of the IC handler performs the image processing of image data obtained from the photographing operation to calculate a relative deviation between the component and the tray. Then, based on a calculation result, the controlling device operates an adjustment mechanism of the robot to correct the relative deviation between the electronic component and the tray.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the above method, however, in order to calculate a relative deviation between the transfer head and the test socket, the camera of the transfer head is needed to be located with a high precision. Furthermore, when a relative positional relationship between the transfer head and the camera is changed due to thermal expansion and contraction, vibration, or the like, it is impossible to detect the change to reflect a detection result in the calculation of the relative deviation.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, there is disclosed a method for directly photographing an electronic component and a test device (e.g. Patent No. JP 3063899). The method provides an IC handler including a camera mounted on a supporting member with a mirror. The mirror is located between the electronic component and the test device to reflect both of the component and the test device thereon. When the component before inspection is hold by a transferring apparatus and located above the test device in a manner facing the test device, the camera simultaneously photographs both images of them reflected on the mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, in the above method, it is complicated to locate and adjust the mirror such that both the component and the test device can be reflected on the mirror. It is also difficult to locate and adjust the camera in order to photograph their mirror images. Moreover, when the electronic component and the test device are photographed, the mirror is located therebetween. Accordingly, locating and withdrawing the mirror is a time-consuming task.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention has been accomplished to solve the above problems. An advantage of the invention is to provide a component transferring apparatus that suitably mounts an electronic component in a socket in such a manner that changes such as mechanical distortion and thermal expansion and contraction can be reflected as needed. Another advantage of the invention is to provide an IC handler including the component transferring apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A component transferring apparatus according to a first aspect of the invention includes a shuttle, an inspection socket, a retaining device that moves between the shuttle and the inspection socket, a pressing device that is included in the retaining device to hold and transfer an electronic component, a position adjusting device that moves the pressing device to correct a position of the electronic component based on an image processing of image data obtained by photographing of the electronic component, a socket mark provided near the inspection socket, a hand mark provided on the retaining device such that the hand mark is positioned near the socket mark when the retaining device is moved to a mounting position where the electronic component hold by the pressing device is mounted in the inspection socket, a first camera provided on the shuttle to photograph a single image including the electronic component hold by the pressing device and the hand mark provided on the retaining device, a second camera that photograph a single image including the socket mark and the inspection socket and a single image including the socket mark and the hand mark of the retaining device moved to the mounting position, a first relative-position calculating unit that performs an image processing of data obtained by photographing of the single image including the socket mark and the inspection socket to obtain a first relative position between the socket mark and the inspection socket, a second relative-position calculating unit that performs an image processing of data obtained by photographing of the single image including the socket mark and the hand mark located at the mounting position to obtain a second relative position between the socket mark and the hand mark, and a third relative-position calculating unit that performs an image processing of data obtained by photographing of the single image including the electronic component and the hand mark to obtain a third relative position between the hand mark and the electronic component, wherein based on the first, the second, and the third relative positions, the position adjusting device corrects the position of the electronic component to mount the electronic component in the inspection socket.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the component transferring apparatus of the above aspect, the socket mark is provided near the inspection socket. Thus, the inspection socket and the socket mark are photographed as the single image by the second camera, and the image processing of the image data obtained by the photographing operation is performed by the first relative-position calculating unit. In this manner, the first relative position between the inspection socket and the socket mark can be obtained. Additionally, the hand mark of the retaining device is located near the socket mark when the retaining device is located at the mounting position. Thus, the hand mark and the socket mark are photographed as the single image by the second camera, and then, the image processing of the image data obtained is performed by the second relative-position calculating unit. In this manner, the second relative position between the hand mark of the retaining device and the socket mark, namely, a relative position of the socket mark with respect to the retaining device can be obtained. Furthermore, the electronic component and the hand mark are photographed as the single image by the first camera, and then, the image processing of the data of the image is performed by the third relative-position calculating unit. In this manner, the third relative position between the electronic component and the hand mark, namely, the relative position of the electronic component with respect to the retaining device can be obtained. As a result, based on the first to the third relative positions, the position adjusting device can move the electronic component to a position suitable for the inspection socket.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Specifically, installation-induced distortion and thermal expansion and contraction occurring between the inspection socket and the socket mark are reflected in the first relative position. Additionally, the distortion and the temperature-induced change as above occurring between the socket mark and the hand mark (the retaining device) are reflected in the second relative position. Furthermore, a sucking position deviation of the electronic component with respect to the hand mark (the retaining device) is reflected in the third relative position. As a result, the electronic component can be suitably mounted in the inspection socket in such a manner that the installation-induced distortion and thermal expansion and contraction in the component transferring apparatus are reflected as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Additionally, since the above-mentioned physical changes occurring in the component transferring apparatus can be reflected as needed, no calibration as an initial setting is again needed to correct those changes as above. This can reduce time and work required for the calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the component transferring apparatus includes a first mirror that is provided on the retaining device so as to reflect the socket mark and the hand mark located at the mounting position in a direction of the second camera and a second mirror that reflects the socket mark and the inspection socket in the direction of the second camera at a reflecting position above the inspection socket, in which the second camera is located at a position where the single image including the socket mark and the inspection socket cannot be directly photographed and also located at a position where the single image including the socket mark and the hand mark located at the mounting position cannot be directly photographed, as well as the second camera photographs the single image including the socket mark and the hand mark via the first mirror located at the mounting position and also photographs the single image including the socket mark and the inspection socket via the second mirror located at the reflecting position.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the above apparatus, even when the second camera is located at the position where it is impossible for the camera to directly photograph the image including the socket mark and the inspection socket and the image including the socket mark and the hand mark, the second camera can photograph those images as in the case of direct photographing. Accordingly, the second camera can be located with greater freedom on a periphery of the retaining device and the inspection socket where the location position for the second camera is very limited. This can facilitate photographing of the socket mark and the inspection socket together and photographing of the socket mark and the hand mark together.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally, the first and the second mirrors are provided, whereby the single second camera can be used to photograph both the single image including the socket mark and the inspection socket and the single image including the socket mark and the hand mark. This can help to simplify the structure of the component transferring apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the component transferring apparatus of the first aspect, preferably, the shuttle includes the first camera, and the retaining device and the shuttle move to a first photographing position where the first camera photographs the single image including the electronic component and the hand mark, so as to allow the first camera to photograph the single image including the electronic component and the hand mark at the first photographing position.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the above component transferring apparatus, the first camera is provided in the shuttle. Thus, it is unnecessary to provide a place for the first camera on the periphery of the retaining device and the inspection socket in which there are many limitations in the camera's location. Accordingly, the structure of the component transferring apparatus can be simplified and also the location of the first camera can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the component transferring apparatus of the first aspect, preferably, the socket mark has a circular shape and the hand mark has an annular shape larger than the socket mark, so as locate the socket mark in the annular hand mark at the mounting position.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the above apparatus, since the circular socket mark is located in the annular hand mark, a comparison between a center position of the socket mark and a center position of the hand mark can be easily made in the image processing for calculating the relative position therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the component transferring apparatus of the first aspect, preferably, the socket mark includes at least two socket marks, and the hand mark is provided so as to correspond to each of the socket marks.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the above apparatus, for example, using two socket marks and two hand marks enables detection of an inclination of a line connecting the two hand marks with respect to a line connecting the two socket marks. Thus, the inclination between the two lines, namely, an angular deviation between the lines can be calculated. Additionally, based on an inclination between the line connecting the socket marks and a first side of the socket, an angular deviation between the line connecting the socket marks and the first side of the socket can be calculated. Furthermore, based on an inclination between the line connecting the hand marks and a first side of the electronic component, an angular deviation between the line connecting the hand marks and the first side of the electronic component can be calculated. As a result, there can be obtained an angle of inclination of the first side of the electronic component and an angle of inclination of the first side of the inspection socket, whereby there can be calculated an angular deviation amount between the first side of the electronic component and the first side of the inspection socket. Consequently, the electronic component can be suitably mounted in the inspection socket by allowing the angular deviation amount therebetween to be &#x201c;zero&#x201d; so as to make the position of the electronic component coincident with the position of the inspection socket.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the component transferring apparatus of the first aspect, preferably, the socket mark has a rectangular shape and the hand mark has a rectangular frame-like shape larger than the socket mark, so as to locate the socket mark in the frame-like hand mark at the mounting position.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the above apparatus, even if the hand mark and the socket mark, respectively, include a single mark, center positions of the rectangular shapes of the marks can be compared with each other to calculate a relative position between the marks, as well as directions of the rectangular shapes of the marks can be compared with each other to calculate an angular deviation therebetween. Thus, it is possible to reduce the numbers of the hand mark and the socket mark.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the component transferring apparatus of the first aspect, preferably, the first relative-position calculating unit obtains the first relative position from an average of first relative position values already obtained by a predetermined number of times of calculations, and the second relative-position calculating unit obtains the second relative position from an average of second relative position values already obtained by a predetermined number of times of calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the above apparatus, in order to obtain the first relative position between the socket mark and the inspection socket and the second relative position between the socket mark and the hand mark in which values are not abruptly fluctuated, using data obtained by the plurality of times of the calculations can stabilize values of the relative positions to be newly calculated</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the component transferring apparatus of the first aspect, preferably, when the second camera photographs the single image including the socket mark and the hand mark, the retaining device allows a distance between the hand mark and the second camera to be equal to a distance between the socket mark and the second camera.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the above apparatus, the second camera can photograph the single image including the socket mark and the hand mark that are located in a situation which the distance of the socket mark from the second camera is equal to that of the hand mark from the second camera. If the distances are different from each other, an error is likely to occur in the image processing of the image data. However, in the above apparatus, the distances of the marks from the second camera are equalized so as to reduce such an error. Accordingly, the relative distance between the socket mark and the hand mark can be more suitably calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the component transferring apparatus of the first aspect, preferably, the hand mark is shorter than the socket mark, and the retaining device moves to the mounting position before moving to a position where the distance between the hand mark and the second camera is equal to the distance between the socket mark and the second camera.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the above apparatus, when the second camera photographs the marks, the hand mark can be separated from the mounting position. This can prevent thermal transmission to the hand mark from the inspection socket or the like and thermal expansion and contraction in the hand mark, so that the relative position between the socket mark and the hand mark can be more suitably calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the component transferring apparatus of the first aspect, preferably, the third relative-position calculating unit obtains the third relative position every time the electronic component is mounted in the inspection socket; the first relative-position calculating unit obtains the first relative position every predetermined number of times of calculations for the third relative position; and the second relative-position calculating unit obtains the second relative position every predetermined number of times of calculations for the third relative position.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The above apparatus reduces calculation frequencies of the first relative position between the socket mark and the inspection socket and the second relative position between the socket mark and the hand mark in which values are less fluctuated. This can reduce time required for the component transferring apparatus to mount the electronic component in the inspection socket.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the component transferring apparatus of the first aspect, preferably, the third relative-position calculating unit obtains the third relative position every time the electronic component is mounted in the inspection socket; the second relative-position calculating unit obtains the second relative position every time the electronic component is mounted in the inspection socket; and the first relative-position calculating unit obtains the first relative position every predetermined number of times of calculations for the third relative position.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The above apparatus reduces the calculation frequency of the first relative position between the socket mark and the inspection socket in which the fluctuation of values is the least. This can reduce the time required for the component transferring apparatus to mount the electronic component in the inspection socket.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the component transferring apparatus of the first aspect, preferably, the third relative-position calculating unit obtains the third relative position every time the electronic component is mounted in the inspection socket; the first relative-position calculating unit obtains the first relative position every predetermined number of times of calculations for the third relative position; and the second relative-position calculating unit obtains the second relative position when the electronic component has been transferred to the mounting position.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the above apparatus, the second relative position between the socket mark and the hand mark is obtained when the electronic component has been mounted in the inspection socket. This can omit an additional operation for obtaining the second relative position.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An IC handler according to a second aspect of the invention includes the component transferring apparatus according to the first aspect.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the IC hander of the second aspect, the socket mark is provided near the inspection socket. Thus, the second camera photographs the single image including the inspection socket and the socket mark, and the first relative-position calculating unit performs the image processing of data of the image. Thereby, the first relative position between the inspection socket and the socket mark can be obtained. In addition, the hand mark provided on the retaining device is located near the socket mark when the retaining device is located at the mounting position. Accordingly, the second camera photographs the single image including the hand mark and the socket mark, and then, the second relative-position calculating unit performs the image processing of data of the image. Thereby the second relative position between the hand mark of the retaining device and the socket mark, namely, the relative position of the socket mark with respect to the retaining device can be obtained. Furthermore, the first camera photographs the single image including the electronic component and the hand mark, and then, the third relative-position calculating unit performs the image processing of data of the image. Thereby, the third relative position between the electronic component and the hand mark, namely, the relative position of the electronic component with respect to the retaining device can be obtained. As a result, based on the first to the third relative positions, the position adjusting device can move the electronic component to the position suitable for the inspection socket.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Specifically, installation-induced distortion and thermal expansion and contraction occurring between the inspection socket and the socket mark are reflected in the first relative position. Additionally, the distortion and the temperature-induced physical change as above occurring between the socket mark and the hand mark (the retaining device) are reflected in the second relative position. Furthermore, the sucking position deviation of the electronic component with respect to the hand mark (the retaining device) is reflected in the third relative position. As a result, the electronic component can be suitably mounted in the inspection socket in such a manner that installation-induced distortion and thermal expansion and contraction occurring in the IC handler are reflected as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, since the above-mentioned physical changes occurring in the IC handler can be reflected as needed, it is unnecessary to perform a calibration (an initial setting) again to correct the physical changes such as the distortion and the expansion and contraction. This can reduce time and work required for the calibration.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 17</figref> will be referred to describe a first embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view showing an IC handler <b>10</b> including a component transferring apparatus according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The IC handler <b>10</b> includes a base <b>11</b>, a safety cover <b>12</b>, a high temperature chamber <b>13</b>, a supplying robot <b>14</b>, a retrieving robot <b>15</b>, a first shuttle <b>16</b>, a second shuttle <b>17</b>, and a plurality of conveyors C<b>1</b> to C<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The base <b>11</b> includes the above elements provided on a top surface thereof.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The conveyors C<b>1</b> to C<b>6</b> are provided on the base <b>11</b> such that first ends of the conveyors are located on an outside of the safety cover <b>12</b> and second ends thereof are located on an inside of the cover. Each of the conveyors C<b>1</b> to C<b>6</b> transfers a tray <b>18</b> that contains a plurality of IC chips T such as semiconductor chips as electronic components or threshold-setting components, from the outside to the inside of the safety cover <b>12</b> or from the inside to the outside of the cover.</p>

The retrieving robot <b>15</b> includes the X-axis frame FX, a second Y-axis frame YF<b>2</b>, and a retrieving robot hand unit <b>21</b>. The X-axis frame FX is arranged in an X direction.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Between the supplying robot <b>14</b> and the retrieving robot <b>15</b> on the top surface of the base <b>11</b>, a first rail <b>30</b>A and a second rail <b>30</b>B, respectively, are arranged in parallel to the X-axis direction.

In this case, center positions of the socket pins <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B are distant from each other by a length LSy in the Y direction (front and back directions).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The inspection socket <b>24</b> is used to perform an electrical inspection of the IC chip T mounted in the socket. The inspection socket <b>24</b> includes a plurality of contact terminals <b>24</b>T used for chip inspection.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Specifically, the measuring robot <b>22</b> acquires the IC chip T supplied from each of the shuttles <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> to arrange the IC chip T at a position immediately above the inspection socket <b>24</b>. Then, the measuring robot <b>22</b> lowers the IC chip T to allow the connection terminals B of the IC chip T to be abutted with the contact terminals <b>24</b>T of the inspection socket <b>24</b> from above and pushes a spring pin downward, so as to mount the IC chip T in the inspection socket <b>24</b>. After finishing an electrical inspection of the IC chip T mounted in the inspection socket <b>24</b>, the measuring robot <b>22</b> extracts the IC chip T mounted therein to locate the chip at a position immediately above the retrieval change kit <b>34</b>.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the measuring robot <b>22</b> includes a supporting portion <b>22</b>A, a connecting portion <b>22</b>B, and a pressing and retaining portion <b>22</b>C of a retaining device. An upper portion of the supporting portion <b>22</b>A is supported so as to be reciprocally movable in the front and back directions (the Y direction) with respect to the not-shown rail. At a lower portion of the supporting portion <b>22</b>A, the connecting portion <b>22</b>B is connected and supported in a reciprocally movable manner in upper and lower directions (a Z direction) with respect to the portion <b>22</b>A. The connecting portion <b>22</b>B is reciprocally moved in the upper and lower directions by a Z-axis motor MZ (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) of the supporting portion <b>22</b>A. A lower end of the connecting portion <b>22</b>B is fixed to the pressing and retaining portion <b>22</b>C that is reciprocally moved in the upper and lower directions along with the connecting portion <b>22</b>B. In short, the pressing and retaining portion <b>22</b>C of the measuring robot <b>22</b> is structured so as to be movable in the front and back directions (the Y direction) and the upper and lower directions (the Z direction) with respect to the rail.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The pressing and retaining portion <b>22</b>C is located so as to be positioned immediately above the inspection socket <b>24</b> when the measuring robot <b>22</b> is moved in the front and read direction (the Y direction) to be located in a middle position between the first and the second shuttles <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>.</p>

Additionally, after the suction nozzle <b>27</b> is facingly opposed to each pocket <b>32</b> of the retrieval change kit <b>34</b> and the inspection socket <b>24</b>, the top portion of the nozzle that sucks and holds the IC chip T is moved to the mounting position of the socket to press the IC chip T.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">At the top portion of the suction nozzle <b>27</b> is provided a not-shown suction hole. The suction hole communicates through an inside of the suction nozzle <b>27</b> to be connected to a sucking device <b>52</b> via a suction valve V<b>1</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Specifically, when the suction nozzle <b>27</b> is connected to the sucking device <b>52</b> by switching of the suction valve V<b>1</b>, the suction hole of the suction nozzle <b>27</b> has a negative pressure, by which the suction hole of the nozzle sucks the IC chip T. Conversely, when connection of the suction valve V<b>1</b> is switched from the sucking device <b>52</b> to an atmosphere to connect the suction nozzle <b>27</b> to the atmosphere, the suction hole of the suction nozzle <b>27</b> has an atmospheric pressure, whereby the sucked IC chip T is released from the suction hole of the nozzle.</p>

In other words, the position adjusting device <b>25</b> moves the IC chip T sucked and hold by the suction nozzle <b>27</b> in the right and left directions (the X direction) and the front and back directions (the Y direction), as well as rotates the center axis of the suction nozzle <b>27</b> as the rotational center to correct a position of the IC chip T.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The measuring robot <b>22</b> allows the position adjusting device <b>25</b> to move the center position of the suction nozzle <b>27</b> to a predetermined initial position coincident with a predetermined center position of a bottom surface of the pressing and retaining portion <b>22</b>C, as well as to rotate the center axis of the suction nozzle <b>27</b> to a predetermined initial angle where a rotational angle of the center axis of the nozzle is &#x201c;zero&#x201d;, before sucking and holding the IC chip T by the suction nozzle <b>27</b>.

After calculating the correction amounts, the controlling device <b>50</b> allows the measuring robot <b>22</b> to transfer the IC chip T to above the inspection socket <b>24</b> (Step S<b>7</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">After transferring the IC chip T to above the socket, the controlling device <b>50</b> moves the position adjusting device <b>25</b> based on the calculated correction amounts to make the center position DC of the IC chip T coincident with the center position SC of the socket and also performs a positional correction to make an inclination of the first side of the IC chip T coincident with an inclination of the first side of the socket (Step S<b>8</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">After correcting the positional the IC chip T, the controlling device <b>50</b> mounts the IC chip T in the inspection socket <b>24</b> (Step S<b>9</b>) to perform an electrical inspection of the IC chip T. Upon the completion of the electrical inspection of the chip, the controlling device <b>50</b> allows the suction nozzle <b>27</b> to be located at the predetermined initial position and at the predetermined initial angle with respect to the measuring robot <b>22</b>, and allows the measuring robot <b>22</b> to extract the IC chip T from the inspection socket <b>24</b> to retrieve the chip and place in each pocket <b>32</b> of the retrieval change kit <b>34</b> of the first shuttle <b>16</b> (Step S<b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">After placing the IC chip T in the retrieval change kit <b>34</b>, the controlling device <b>50</b> moves the first shuttle <b>16</b> to allow the retrieving robot <b>15</b> to retrieve the chip. After the IC chip T is retrieved by the retrieving robot <b>15</b>, the controlling device <b>50</b> determines whether there is any next chip to be inspected (Step S<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">If there is no next chip to be inspected (if NO at Step S<b>12</b>), the controlling device <b>50</b> finishes the inspection of the IC chip T. Conversely, if there is a next chip to be inspected (if YES at Step S<b>12</b>), the controlling device <b>50</b> adds 1 to the inspected-product counter (Step S<b>13</b>) and then determines whether a predetermined number of chips were inspected (Step S<b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">When the predetermined number of chips have not been inspected (if NO at Step S<b>14</b>), the controlling device <b>50</b> returns to Step S<b>4</b> to repeat the transfer and inspection of the IC chip T. In this case, the device recognition processing is performed to recalculate the relative coordinates (x3, y3) and the angular deviation &#x3b8;<b>3</b>, whereas the socket recognition processing and the mark-position recognition processing are not performed. Thus, correction values are calculated using the relative coordinates (x2, y2) and (x1, y1) and the angular deviations &#x3b8;<b>1</b> and &#x3b8;<b>2</b> previously calculated and stored in the RAM <b>63</b>. Meanwhile, when the predetermined number of chips have been inspected (if YES at Step S<b>14</b>), the controlling device <b>50</b> returns to Step S<b>1</b> to perform the socket recognition processing, the mark-position recognition processing, and the device recognition processing, whereby correction values are calculated to repeat the inspection of the IC chip T.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In addition, the IC handler <b>10</b> is also used to suck and hold the IC chip T from the second shuttle <b>17</b> to mount the chip in the inspection socket <b>24</b>. A series of steps performed are the same as those in the first shuttle <b>16</b>. Thus, a description of the steps using the second shuttle <b>17</b> will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">As described hereinabove, the component transferring apparatus and the IC handler according to the embodiment of the invention provide advantages as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">1. In the present embodiment, there are provided the first and the second socket marks <b>260</b> and <b>261</b>. The socket marks <b>260</b>, <b>261</b> and the inspection socket <b>240</b> are photographed to perform the image recognition processing of the image data GD<b>3</b> obtained by the photographing operation. The image recognition processing provides the relative coordinates (x1, y1) of the inspection socket <b>24</b> with respect to the first socket mark <b>260</b> and the angular deviation <b>81</b> of the socket with respect to the socket pin arrangement line AY<b>1</b>. As a result, even if installation-induced distortion and thermal expansion and contraction occur in the IC handler <b>10</b>, the relative positional relationship between the inspection socket <b>24</b> and the first socket mark <b>260</b> can be obtained in such a manner as to reflect physical changes such as the distortion and the expansion and contraction as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">2. In the embodiment, the first and the second top surface hand marks <b>282</b>, <b>283</b>, respectively, are provided to be inserted in the first and the second socket marks <b>260</b>, <b>261</b>, respectively. Thus, the socket mars <b>260</b>, <b>261</b> and the corresponding hand marks <b>282</b>, <b>283</b> are photographed to perform the image recognition processing of the image data GD<b>2</b> obtained by the photographing operation. The image recognition processing provides the relative coordinates (x2, y2) of the first top surface hand mark <b>282</b> with respect to the first socket mark <b>260</b> and the angular deviation &#x3b8;<b>2</b> of the hand mark arrangement line AY<b>2</b> with respect to the socket pin arrangement line AY<b>1</b>. As a result, even if installation-induced distortion and thermal expansion and contraction occur in the IC handler <b>10</b>, there can be obtained an appropriate relative positional relationship between the first top surface hand mark <b>282</b> and the first socket mark <b>260</b>, namely, an appropriate relative positional relationship between the inspection section <b>23</b> and the measuring robot <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In the embodiment, the relative coordinates (x1, y1) and the angular deviation <b>81</b> are obtained from the image data GD<b>3</b> for the socket recognition processing; the relative coordinates (x2, y2) and the angular deviation &#x3b8;<b>2</b> are obtained from the image data GD<b>2</b> for the mark-position recognition processing; and the relative coordinates (x3, y3) and the angular deviation &#x3b8;<b>3</b> are obtained from the image data GD<b>1</b> for the device recognition processing. Based on the relative coordinates (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) and the angular deviation &#x3b8;<b>2</b>, there is calculated the positional deviation amounts (&#x394;x, &#x394;y) between the center position SC of the inspection socket <b>24</b> and the center position DC of the IC chip T. Additionally, based on the angular deviations &#x3b8;<b>1</b>, &#x3b8;<b>2</b>, and &#x3b8;<b>3</b>, there is calculated the angular deviation amount &#x394;&#x3b8; between the first side of the inspection socket <b>24</b> and the first side of the IC chip T. As a result, the relative positions of the inspection socket <b>24</b> and the IC chip T can be made coincident with each other, whereby the position of the IC chip T can be adjusted such that the angular deviation amount is made &#x201c;zero&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">4. In the embodiment, the first and the second top surface hand marks <b>282</b>, <b>283</b>, respectively, are provided to be inserted in the first and the second socket marks <b>260</b>, <b>261</b>, respectively, where the hand marks and the socket marks have the same height. Thus, the chamber camera <b>44</b> can photograph all of the marks at one time. Additionally, in the image recognition processing in which the margin of error becomes larger if there is any difference in a height direction, the relative positional relationship between the socket marks <b>260</b>, <b>261</b> and the corresponding top surface hand marks <b>282</b>, <b>283</b> can be recognized with a high precision so as to calculate the relative positions and the angular deviation.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">5. In the embodiment, the chamber camera <b>44</b> photographs the image data GD<b>2</b> for the &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d; and the image data GD<b>3</b> for the &#x201c;socket recognition processing&#x201d;. In this manner, the single camera is used to photograph both of the two image data, and thus, the number of cameras can be reduced. Additionally, since the chamber camera <b>44</b> photographs those images via the first and second mirror <b>29</b>A and <b>49</b>A, respectively, the camera can be easily located on a periphery of the measuring robot <b>22</b> and the inspection section <b>23</b> in which the location position for the camera is very limited.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">6. In the embodiment, the &#x201c;device recognition processing&#x201d; is performed for each IC chip T, whereas the &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d; and the &#x201c;socket recognition processing&#x201d; are performed every time a predetermined number of the IC chips T are inspected. This can reduce the number of times of the image recognition processings during the steps for inspecting the IC chip T, which can shorten inspection time. Moreover, even if installation-induced distortion and thermal expansion and contraction occur in the IC handler, those changes can be reflected in calculation results of correction values obtained in every inspection of a predetermined number of the chips.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Modifications</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">For example, modifications of the above embodiment can be implemented as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In the above embodiment, the chamber camera <b>44</b> photographs the image for the &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d; and the image for the &#x201c;socket recognition processing&#x201d;, respectively, via the first mirror <b>29</b>A and the second mirror <b>49</b>A, respectively. However, the images for those recognition processings may be directly photographed by the camera.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In the above embodiment, the chamber camera <b>44</b> photographs the image for the &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d; and the image for the &#x201c;socket recognition processing&#x201d; at the second photographing position CP<b>2</b>. However, those images may be photographed at mutually different positions.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In the above embodiment, the chamber camera <b>44</b> is used to photograph both of the image for the &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d; and the image for the &#x201c;socket recognition processing&#x201d;. However, an exclusive camera for each of the images may be used to photograph each image.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In the above embodiment, there are provided the two socket marks <b>260</b>, <b>261</b> and the two cylindrical members <b>28</b>C. However, the numbers of the socket marks and the cylindrical members (hand marks) are not restricted to two.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In the above embodiment, the socket marks <b>260</b>, <b>261</b> and the hand marks <b>280</b> to <b>283</b> are circular in shape. However, those marks may be oval, polygonal, or cross-shaped. When such oval, polygonal, or cross-shaped marks are used, an angular deviation can be obtained from a single mark.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In the above embodiment, the socket pins <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B, respectively, are inserted in the cylindrical members <b>28</b>C. However, as long as the socket pins and the cylindrical members are arranged within the same viewing range of the camera, the arrangement manner of the pins and the members is not specifically restricted. For example, the socket pins <b>25</b>A, <b>25</b>B and the cylindrical members <b>28</b>C may be adjacently or separately arranged. Additionally, the heights of the socket pins and the cylindrical members are not restricted to the height LSz.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In the above embodiment, the socket pins <b>25</b>A, <b>25</b>B and the cylindrical members <b>28</b>C are each made of metal. However, the hand marks <b>280</b> to <b>283</b> may be provided on glass, since it is only necessary that the hand marks can be seen from upper and lower sides. In this case, even when the socket marks are superimposed on the hand marks provided on glass, both marks can be photographed together by a camera. Additionally, a hand mark appropriate for an image recognition processing can be easily drawn.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In the above embodiment, the first socket mark <b>260</b> is used as a reference point for the relative coordinates. However, the reference point may be provided at any position.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In the above embodiment, the positional deviation amounts (&#x394;x, &#x394;y) and the angular deviation amount AO are calculated. However, there may be calculated only a necessary deviation amount among the positional deviation amount in the X direction, the positional deviation amount in the Y direction, and the angular deviation amount.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In the above embodiment, the relative coordinates (x1, y1) and the angular deviation &#x3b8;<b>1</b> are directly calculated by the &#x201c;socket recognition processing&#x201d;, and the relative coordinates (x2, y2) and the angular deviation &#x3b8;<b>2</b> are directly calculated by the &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d;. Then, based on the calculation results, the positional deviation amounts (&#x394;x, &#x394;y) and the angular deviation amount &#x394;&#x3b8; are calculated. Instead of that, a predetermined processing may be performed using the coordinates calculated by the &#x201c;socket recognition processing&#x201d;. For example, values calculated by a plurality of times of processings may be stored to obtain an average value in a predetermined number of times of the processings so as to calculate as the relative coordinates (x1, y1). Additionally, a predetermined processing may be performed using the angle calculated by the &#x201c;socket recognition processing&#x201d;. For example, values calculated by a plurality of times of processings may be stored to obtain an average value in a predetermined number of times of the processings so as to calculate as the angular deviation <b>81</b>. Furthermore, a predetermined processing as above may also be performed to calculate the relative coordinates (x2, Y2), the angular deviation &#x3b8;<b>2</b>, the positional deviation amounts (&#x394;x, &#x394;y), or the angular deviation amount &#x394;&#x3b8;.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In the above embodiment, the measuring robot <b>22</b> transfers the single IC chip T into the single inspection socket <b>24</b>. However, the measuring robot <b>22</b> may transfer a plurality of IC chips T to mount in a plurality of inspection sockets <b>24</b>. In this case, the numbers of the shuttle cameras <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, the photographing device <b>40</b>, and the reflecting device <b>45</b> may be singular or plural.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In the above embodiment, in the image recognition processing, the single image including the bottom surface hand marks <b>280</b>, <b>281</b> and the IC chip T is processed as the image data. However, a plurality of image data may be processed at one time. Similarly, the single image including the top surface hand marks <b>282</b>, <b>283</b> and the corresponding socket marks <b>260</b>, <b>261</b>, as well as the single image including the socket marks <b>260</b>, <b>261</b> and the inspection socket <b>24</b> may also be processed as above in the image recognition processing.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In the above embodiment, when the top surface hand marks <b>282</b> and <b>283</b> are in contact with the inspection section <b>23</b>, the top surface positions of the hand marks <b>282</b> and <b>283</b> are made coincident with those of the socket marks <b>260</b> and <b>261</b>. However, instead of that, the top surface positions of the hand marks and the socket marks may be made coincident with each other in a position separated from the inspection section <b>23</b>. In this manner, the cylindrical members <b>28</b>C can be less influenced by a temperature rise in the inspection section <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In that case, for example, the measuring robot <b>22</b> may be once lowered to the position where the top surface hand marks <b>282</b> and <b>283</b> contact with the inspection section <b>23</b>, namely, to the mounting position, and then, may be raised by a predetermined distance. Thereby, while eliminating an influence due to a change in the relative distance between the measuring robot <b>22</b> and the inspection section <b>23</b>, the hand marks <b>282</b> and <b>283</b> can be located at a position separated from the inspection section <b>23</b> by the predetermined distance.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In the above embodiment, every time the IC chip T is transferred to the inspection socket <b>24</b>, the &#x201c;device recognition processing&#x201d; is performed, whereas the &#x201c;socket recognition processing&#x201d; and the &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d; are simultaneously performed every predetermined number of times of the chip transfer. However, an interval for performing the &#x201c;socket recognition processing&#x201d; and the &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d; is not specifically restricted, and those processings may not be simultaneously performed.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d; may be performed every after the &#x201c;device recognition processing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Additionally, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, when the IC chip T is mounted in the inspection socket <b>24</b>, the image for the &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d; may be acquired to perform the &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d;. Next, when mounting the IC chip T in the inspection socket <b>24</b>, the positional deviation amounts (&#x394;x, &#x394;y) and the angular deviation amount &#x394;&#x3b8; may be calculated based on relative coordinates calculated by the previous &#x201c;mark-position recognition processing&#x201d;.</p>
