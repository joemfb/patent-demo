<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to data processing in general and, more particularly, to organization of data.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Research in many industries, for example, the healthcare industry, may be done at a cohort level. A cohort is simply a set or group of things or people sharing similar characteristics. The &#x201c;characteristics&#x201d; of the cohort can be chosen by the administrator/owner of the study such that the characteristics lend themselves to the research study in a meaningful way. For example, if a researcher were studying the effectiveness of a drug on breast cancer patients, the list of characteristics may include female, between the ages of 35 and 50 and stage 3 breast cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Research studies can last for long periods of time, especially in the healthcare industry where diseases and conditions may progress very slowly and drugs used thereon may only have an effect over time. Keeping track of the all the information, for example, lab/test results, MRIs, x-rays, symptoms before and after administering a drug, side effects and the like, throughout the study may be difficult and time consuming. Furthermore, even if the information is recorded effectively, finding and/or searching the information in the future may also be difficult.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some embodiments of the present invention provide methods, systems and computer program products for storing, organizing and/or manipulating cohort based information associated with a research study. Project information associated with a first project is received at an interface of a computer database environment. The project information associated with the first project includes cohort information associated with one or more cohorts of the first project and patient information associated with members of the one or more cohorts of the first project. A first virtual project drawer is generated associated with the first project to be stored in the computer database environment. The first virtual project drawer includes the project information associated with the first project, at least one cohort file and/or two or more cohort member files.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In further embodiments of the present invention, project information associated with a second project may be received at the interface of the computer database environment. The project information associated with the second project may include cohort information associated with at least one cohort of the second project and patient information associated with members of the at least one cohort of the second project. A second virtual project drawer associated with the second project to be stored in the computer database environment may be generated. The second project drawer may include the project information associated with the second project, one or more cohort files and/or two or more cohort member files.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In still further embodiments of the present invention, a query may be generated so as to locate project information, cohort information and/or patient information associated with the first and/or second projects. The first and/or second project drawers may be searched according to the generated query so as to locate results therein that may be relevant to the research study. A report may be generated including the located results.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments of the present invention, a query may be generated so as to locate at least one member and/or possible member of a statistically balanced control cohort. The query may be generated using the following equations:</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another element. Thus, a first element discussed below could be termed a second element without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the invention may be embodied as a method, data processing system, or computer program product. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects all generally referred to herein as a &#x201c;circuit&#x201d; or &#x201c;module.&#x201d; Furthermore, the present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable storage medium having computer-usable program code embodied in the medium. Any suitable computer readable medium may be utilized including hard disks, CD-ROMs, optical storage devices, a transmission media such as those supporting the Internet or an intranet, or magnetic storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in an object oriented programming language such as Java&#xae;, Smalltalk or C++. However, the computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may also be written in conventional procedural programming languages, such as the &#x201c;C&#x201d; programming language or in a visually oriented programming environment, such as VisualBasic.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The invention is described in part below with reference to a flowchart illustration and/or block diagrams of methods, systems and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the illustrations, and combinations of blocks, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function/act specified in the block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions/acts specified in the block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Research in many fields, for example, healthcare, may be conducted using cohort data. As used herein, &#x201c;cohort&#x201d; refers to a set or group of things or people sharing similar characteristics. Characteristics may include, for example, physical characteristics, presence or absence of a condition or conditions, age, geographic location and the like. The cohort may be defined by the person conducting the research study and a research study may include one or more cohorts. For example, a researcher may be researching the effect of a particular drug on breast cancer patients. Thus, the cohort may be defined by characteristics including female, breast cancer, from 25-35 years of age and with BRCA1 or BRCA2 cancer-predisposing mutations.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It will be understood that although research studies are discussed herein with respect to the healthcare field, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to this field. For example, embodiments of the present invention may be used for studies in any field that lend themselves to the use of cohorts without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Currently, there is no easy and convenient way of maintaining complete records of the global differences between treatment and control cohorts of research studies involving multiple cohorts. Typically, at the end of a research study (project), the owner (administrator) of the study will publish the study (or report associated therewith). The information published can be very detailed and without a method or system for maintaining the information, it could be very difficult to consolidate the information and present it in a useful way. Furthermore, since there is no easy way to maintain information associated with the study, not everything may be recorded. For example, each time a potential patient for the study is considered and denied, the information associated with this candidate and why he or she was rejected may not be recorded. Thus, the study owner may be accused of &#x201c;cherry picking&#x201d; the members of the study and have nothing documented to prove otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Many times when a research study is performed, two cohorts may be used in the study. The two cohorts may be a initial cohort and a cohort that is statistically balanced to the initial cohort. In other words, the initial study may include a 100 member cohort and a statistically balanced cohort having 100 members, each of which has demographic, genetic, and life style factors as close as possible to a corresponding member of the initial cohort. Without any method or system of recording the data with respect to the initial cohort and its 100 members, choosing the members of the statistically balanced cohort may be relatively difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, according to some embodiments of the present invention methods, systems and computer program products for storing, organizing and/or manipulating cohort based information associated with a research study are provided. According to some embodiments of the present invention, a study owner (administrator) may create a virtual file drawer that includes information on one or more cohorts for the study and the members of these cohorts. Furthermore, the owner may store any information associated with the study in the virtual file drawer associated with the study. The information in the virtual file drawer may be saved in such a way that it can be searched, manipulated and the like. Methods, systems and computer program products according to some embodiments of the present invention may also allow research queries, for example, queries that were used to generate the cohort, to be stored and the stored research queries to be run over time. The methods, systems and computer program products according to some embodiments of the present invention may be configured to recall details of the previously run queries, for example, which members were excluded due to death. This may be useful in a research study extending over multiple years. Details of some embodiments of the present invention will be further discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Embodiments of the present invention will now be discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary data processing system <b>100</b> or computer database environment that may be included in devices operating in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated, the data processing system <b>100</b> includes a processor <b>138</b>, a memory <b>136</b> and input/output circuits <b>146</b>. The data processing system <b>100</b> may be incorporated in, for example, a personal computer, server, router or the like. The processor <b>138</b> communicates with the memory <b>136</b> via an address/data bus <b>148</b> and communicates with the input/output circuits <b>146</b> via an address/data bus <b>149</b>. The input/output circuits <b>146</b> can be used to transfer information between the memory <b>136</b> and another computer system or a network using, for example, an Internet protocol (IP) connection. These components may be conventional components such as those used in many conventional data processing systems, which may be configured to operate as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In particular, the processor <b>138</b> can be any commercially available or custom microprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor or the like. The memory <b>136</b> may include any memory devices containing the software and data used to implement the functionality circuits or modules used in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The memory <b>136</b> can include, but is not limited to, the following types of devices: cache, ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory, SRAM, DRAM and magnetic disk. In some embodiments of the present invention, the memory <b>136</b> may be a content addressable memory (CAM).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the memory <b>136</b> may include several categories of software and data used in the data processing system <b>100</b>: an operating system <b>152</b>; application programs <b>154</b>; input/output device drivers <b>158</b>; and data <b>156</b>. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the operating system <b>152</b> may be any operating system suitable for use with a data processing system, such as OS/2, AIX or zOS from International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, N.Y., Windows95, Windows98, Windows2000 or WindowsXP from Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash., Unix or Linux. The input/output device drivers <b>158</b> typically include software routines accessed through the operating system <b>152</b> by the application programs <b>154</b> to communicate with devices such as the input/output circuits <b>146</b> and certain memory <b>136</b> components. The application programs <b>154</b> are illustrative of the programs that implement the various features of the circuits and modules according to some embodiments of the present invention. Finally, the data <b>156</b> represents the static and dynamic data used by the application programs <b>154</b>, the operating system <b>152</b>, the input/output device drivers <b>158</b>, and other software programs that may reside in the memory <b>136</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the data <b>156</b> may include cohort files <b>130</b>, <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>, cohort member files <b>133</b> and <b>134</b> and reports <b>135</b> for use by the circuits and modules of the application programs <b>154</b> according to some embodiments of the present invention as discussed further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although three cohort files <b>130</b>, <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>, two cohort member files <b>133</b> and <b>134</b> and a single reports file <b>135</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to this configuration. For example, more or less than three cohort files, more or less than two cohort member files and more than one reports file may be present without departing from the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, as further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cohort files <b>130</b>, <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> may be present in one or more virtual file drawers. In other words, the same cohort files may be used in two different studies associated with two different file drawers. In particular, cohort file <b>1</b> is present in a first virtual file drawer <b>137</b> and cohort file <b>3</b> is present in a second virtual file drawer <b>138</b>. Furthermore, cohort file <b>2</b> <b>131</b> is present in the first and second virtual file drawers <b>137</b> and <b>138</b>. Similarly, cohort member files may be present in one or more file drawers without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, according to some embodiments of the present invention the application programs <b>154</b> include a project creation module <b>121</b>, a query generation module <b>122</b>, a search module <b>123</b>, a report generation module <b>124</b>, a cohort creation module <b>125</b>, a storage module <b>126</b>, a scheduling/delivery module <b>127</b> and a detail module <b>128</b>. While the present invention is illustrated with reference to the project creation module <b>121</b>, the query generation module <b>122</b>, the search module <b>123</b>, the report generation module <b>124</b>, the cohort creation module <b>125</b>, the storage module <b>126</b>, the scheduling/delivery module <b>127</b> and the detail module <b>128</b> being application programs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, other configurations fall within the scope of the present invention. For example, rather than being application programs <b>154</b>, these circuits and modules may also be incorporated into the operating system <b>152</b> or other such logical division of the data processing system <b>100</b>. Furthermore, while the project creation module <b>121</b>, the query generation module <b>122</b>, the search module <b>123</b>, the report generation module <b>124</b>, the cohort creation module <b>125</b>, the storage module <b>126</b>, the scheduling/delivery module <b>127</b> and the detail module <b>128</b> are illustrated in a single data processing system, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, such functionality may be distributed across one or more data processing systems. Thus, the present invention should not be construed as limited to the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but may be provided by other arrangements and/or divisions of functions between data processing systems. For example, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated as having various circuits and modules, one or more of these circuits or modules may be combined without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary environment <b>205</b> for operations and devices according to some embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the environment <b>205</b> may include a communications device <b>210</b>, a network <b>220</b>, a first server <b>240</b> and a second server <b>245</b>. It will be understood that the communications device <b>210</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may include the data processing system <b>100</b> or database environment discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The communications device <b>210</b> may be, for example, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a personal data assistant (PDA), a web capable mobile terminal or any device capable of communicating with the network <b>220</b>. The communications device <b>210</b> may include a user interface <b>244</b> and a web browser <b>215</b> that may be accessed through the user interface <b>244</b>. The first and second servers <b>240</b> and <b>245</b> may include first and second database environments <b>230</b> and <b>235</b>, respectively, which may include patient records and information for use in some embodiments of the present invention. The communications device <b>210</b> may communicate over the network <b>220</b>, for example, the internet, through a telephone line, a digital subscriber link (DSL), a broadband cable link, a wireless link or the like. The first and second servers <b>240</b> and <b>245</b> may also communicate over the network <b>220</b>. Thus, the network <b>220</b> may convey data between the communications device <b>210</b> and the first and second servers <b>240</b> and <b>245</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Exemplary operations of methods, systems and computer program products according to some embodiments of the present invention will now be discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. When an owner (or administrator) of a research study begins a new study he or she may create a new virtual file drawer for the research study according to some embodiments of the present invention. The user interface <b>244</b> for the computer database environment <b>100</b> may be used to enter/provide project information associated with the research study or project. Before this information can be entered, in some embodiments of the present invention, a user may have to provide authorization information. In some embodiments of the present invention, the user may enter both user identification and a role code as discussed in, for example, copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/349,408, filed Feb. 7, 2006, entitled METHODS, SYSTEMS AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCTS FOR PROVIDING A LEVEL OF ANONYMITY TO PATIENT RECORDS/INFORMATION, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Once authorized, the user may enter cohort information, for example, demographic, genetic, clinical, and/or life style characteristics for the members of the cohort. As discussed above, as used herein, a &#x201c;cohort&#x201d; refers to a group or set of things or people sharing or potentially sharing one or more characteristics. For example, &#x201c;characteristics&#x201d; according to some embodiments of the present invention may include physical characteristics, presence or absence of a condition or conditions, age, geographic location and the like. The cohort may be defined by the person conducting the research study and a research study may include one or more cohorts. For example, a researcher may be researching the effect of a particular drug on breast cancer patients. Thus, the cohort may be defined by characteristics including female, breast cancer, from 25-35 years of age with either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 cancer-predisposing mutations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments of the present invention, the entered cohort information may be associated with an existing cohort. For example, existing cohorts may be split, merged and/or copied to provide the entered cohort information. Cohorts may be inherited from external systems and used as, for example reference cohorts.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the user may also enter patient information, through the user interface <b>244</b>, associated with members or possible members of the cohort associated with the research study. The patient information may include, for example, name, address, phone number, age, condition and details thereof and the like. The patient information may also include clinical data, such as test results, MRIs, xrays and the like associated with the patient. It will be understood that this information may be stored directly in the computer database environment or a link may be stored in the computer database environment <b>100</b> which allows access to information stored on external databases, for example, the patient information database <b>230</b> on the first server <b>240</b> and the information database <b>235</b> on the second server <b>240</b>. Similar to cohorts, the entered patient information may be associated with an existing patient. For example, existing patient information may be split, merged, copied and/or inherited from external systems without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be understood that a project or research study may have from zero to N cohorts. A cohort may have from zero to M members (subjects, patients, and the like). A single cohort may belong to one or more research studies. Cohorts have roles or purposes, for example, a control cohort in research studies (projects) that may change over time. Cohort members also have roles or purposes, for example, control, rejected, drug, treatment, dropped and the like, in cohorts that may change over time.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Once the cohort/patient information is entered through the user interface <b>244</b>, the project creation module <b>121</b> may be configured to generate a virtual project drawer associated with the research study or project to be stored in the computer database environment <b>100</b>. The cohort information and/or patient information entered by the user may be placed in cohort files and the cohort files may include cohort member files including the patient information entered by the user. These files may all be stored in the virtual file drawer created for the project or research study. Once these files are created and stored they may be modified, searched, reorganized, deactivated and the like without departing from the scope of the present invention. Any manipulation of the data stored in the virtual file drawer, for example, addition, deletion, relocation, reorganization and the like, may be tracked, recorded and can be recreated at any point in the study according to some embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The project creation module <b>121</b> may be configured to use a series of medical record numbers (MRNs), of patients entered by the user. A business intelligence tool may be used to create a query to return patients for a cohort. The project creation module <b>121</b> may be configured to prompt a user to upload a properly formatted document with patient MRNs or agreed upon unique identifier. In certain embodiments, the project creation module <b>121</b> may be configured to use an algorithm to create a statistically equivalent cohort based on selected criteria. Furthermore, the project creation module <b>121</b> may be configured merge existing cohorts or split existing cohorts to create a new cohort.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, according to some embodiments of the present invention, preparing a report of the research study may be relatively less difficult as all of the information is stored and accessible electronically. For example, even information associated with rejected cohort members may be stored in the virtual file drawer with a role-rejected and the reasons therefore. Thus, the possibility of being accused of &#x201c;cherry picking&#x201d; cohort members may be reduced. Furthermore, building a statistically balanced cohort as discussed above may be relatively less difficult according to some embodiments of the present invention, which will be discussed further below.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In particular, a statistically balanced cohort can be generated using equations according to some embodiments of the present invention. To minimize the sum of the weights for the set of the study/control pairing, the following equation is used:</p>

The values of the selections vector can only take on the integer values of one or zero. Using equations to locate members of the statistically balanced cohort may allow these cohorts to be created relatively easier than if done without a computer database environment according to some embodiments of the present invention.
</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although virtual file drawers discussed herein include cohort files and cohort member files, embodiments of the present invention are not limited by these examples. The virtual file folders may include any information associated with the project or research study. For example, a research grant application that preceded the beginning of the study may also be stored in the virtual file drawer without departing from the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, the project information may further include owner information, authorized user information, a title of the project and/or start and/or end dates associated with the project.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It will be understood that although the creation of a single virtual file drawer is discussed herein, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to this configuration. For example, two or more virtual file drawers <b>137</b> and <b>138</b> may be present in the computer database environment <b>100</b> without departing from the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, cohort files and/or cohort member files may be included in one or more virtual file drawers without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Once the cohort files and member files are created, a query generation module <b>122</b> may be configured to generate a query so as to locate project information, cohort information and/or patient information associated with the one or more of the projects (research studies) having associated virtual file drawers <b>137</b> and <b>138</b> in the computer database environment <b>100</b>. The query generation module <b>122</b> may allow the user to generate a query by selecting data elements (columns) for report. For example, the user may select age, gender, stage total/positive nodes and the like. Also included may be predefined aggregation and data functions, for example, average age. The query generation module <b>122</b> may also be configured to allow the user to select pre-existing query filter elements (criteria). For example, the user may select a diagnosis data range, cancer type, grade, stage, patient demographics, provider and the like. The query generation module <b>122</b> may also be configured to allow a user to create any custom query filter elements. For example, a user may drag and drop elements needed for custom filter onto the query. Each of these data elements may be individually and collectively filtered. For example, &#x201c;(provider in (Dr. A, Dr. B, Dr. C) or (age &#x3e;65)) and (Gender=M).&#x201d; The query generation module <b>122</b> may also be configured to allow the user to enter any Free Text/Semantic OmniFind criteria. For example, the user enters a Free Text or a Semantic Search.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In particular, the free text and semantic search tool OnmiFind can be called to return results based on a users entered criteria when necessary. The free text and semantic criteria may be provided to OmniFind, which will execute the query. The results of the query may be provided to the computer database environment where they may be manipulated into a single report filter. The computer database environment may then insert that report filter into the user's report. At this point, control of the querying process may be returned to the query generation module <b>122</b> where the remaining elements of the querying may be handled. In some embodiments of the present invention, the query generation module <b>122</b> may be configured to build and manipulate the query, the data and input process in a business intelligence tool.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Once the query is generated, the search module <b>123</b> may be configured to search the virtual project drawers <b>137</b> and <b>138</b> according to the generated query so as to locate results therein that may be relevant to the research study. In some embodiments of the present invention, the search module <b>123</b> may be configured to use OmniFind. The report generation module <b>124</b> may be configured to generate a report including the located results.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In particular, once the search is complete, the report generation module <b>124</b> may be configured to generate the report responsive to a user selecting a &#x201c;report&#x201d; button on the user interface <b>244</b>. In some embodiments of the present invention, the user may apply style/formatting template to the query result and may add any desired custom aggregations by inserting cells and defining aggregation, for example, average (LOS). The user may select sort criteria for the report by, for example, clicking on one or more columns of the report.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In other words, the query generation module <b>122</b> is further configured to modify the generated query. The search module <b>123</b> may be further configured to search the project drawers according to the modified query so as to locate modified results therein that may be relevant to the research study. The report generation module <b>124</b> may be further configured to generate a modified report including the modified results. As discussed above, the report generation module <b>124</b> is further configured to modify and/or customize the generated report based on user input.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Finalized reports may be stored, for example, in the reports <b>135</b> section of the memory <b>136</b>. To access these reports, the user may be presented with a list of existing reports. A user may, for example, click on a desired report on a graphical user interface provided on the communications device <b>210</b>. The graphical user interface according to some embodiments of the present invention may be customized to look like a researchers notebook, windows file system, and the like. In other words, the user can customize the interface so that it is familiar to them.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The report may be executed, modified or customized. The authorization level of the user accessing the report may define how a user is allowed to use the report. Depending on the roles/permissions, the user can execute, modify existing or customize existing reports. Customizing may allow for new reports to be built on existing ones without affecting the original.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to some embodiments of the present invention, a finalized report stored in the memory <b>136</b> can be, for example, used to build a cohort, saved, scheduled, delivered and/or drilled down into. In particular, the cohort creation module <b>125</b> may be configured to build a cohort file based on the generated report. The cohort creation module <b>125</b> may be configured to communicate with the BI Tool to create a cohort from the generated report. The process may be instantiated when a user decides to create a cohort based of the results of an ad-hoc or structured report from the BI Tool. The cohort creation module <b>125</b> may be configured to save the BI Tool object and link to it from a cohort database record. The cohort, when modified at a later point, may use the BI Tool for modification. In some embodiments of the present invention, a user can run a query to view joiners i.e. patients that currently meet the query criteria used to define the cohort, but did not meet these criteria when the query was run last. This is accomplished by re-generating the report, but may only display those patients who joined since the previous run.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments of the present invention, the storage module <b>126</b> may be configured to store the generated report. When the report is saved access levels may be set that define who can access the report, for example, what users with what roles. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the scheduling/delivery module <b>127</b> may be configured to schedule the generated report for a run. The run may be executed (the report may be executed) at the present moment or be delayed for later time. Furthermore, the delivery module <b>128</b> may be configured to determine a delivery method for the generated report.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Finally, in some embodiments of the present invention, the detail module <b>128</b> may be configured to drill down into the generated report to reveal underlying detail thereof. For example, if a column of the report indicates patient count, a user can, for example, click on the number of patients to reveal more detailed information about each of the patients, such as name, gender, age and test results.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Operations for storing, organizing and/or manipulating cohort based information associated with a research study according to some embodiments of the present invention will now be discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, operations begin at block <b>310</b> by receiving project information associated with a first project at an interface of a computer database environment. The project information associated with the first project includes cohort information associated with one or more cohorts of the first project and patient information associated with members of the one or more cohorts of the first project. A first virtual project drawer associated with the first project may be generated to be stored in the computer database environment (block <b>320</b>). The first virtual project drawer includes project information associated with the first project, one or more cohort files and/or two or more cohort member files.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments of the present invention, cohorts can belong to more than one project. Cohorts can be generated by, for example, splitting, copying and/or merging existing cohort files and/or member files. Project information, according to some embodiments of the present invention, may include cohort data, patient information, owner information, authorized user information, a title of the project and/or start and/or end dates associated with the project. Cohort members of the project share one or more characteristics that define the cohort associated with the project and each of the cohort members of the project have at least one role associated therewith. The role may include, for example, initial data capture, control, rejected, drug, treatment and/or dropped.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring now to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, operations according to further embodiments of the present invention will be discussed. Operations begin at block <b>400</b> by authenticating a user before allowing the user access to the computer database environment. Project information associated with a project is received at an interface of a computer database environment (block <b>410</b>). The project information associated with the project includes cohort information associated with one or more cohorts of the project and patient information associated with members of the one or more cohorts of the project. A virtual project drawer associated with the project may be generated to be stored in the computer database environment (block <b>420</b>). The virtual project drawer includes project information associated with the project, one or more cohort files and/or two or more cohort member files.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A query may be generated so as to locate project information, cohort information and/or patient information associated with the first and/or second projects (block <b>430</b>). One or more project drawers may be searched according to the generated query so as to locate results therein that may be relevant to the research study (block <b>440</b>). A report may be generated including the located results (block <b>450</b>). It may be determined if the user is satisfied with the located results in the report (block <b>460</b>). If it is determined that the user is not satisfied (block <b>460</b>), the user may modify/customize the query (block <b>470</b>) and blocks <b>440</b> through <b>470</b> may be repeated until the user is satisfied with the results (block <b>460</b>). If, on the other hand, the user is satisfied with the results (block <b>460</b>), operations with respect to query modification may be complete.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring now to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, operations according to further embodiments of the present invention will be discussed. Blocks represented by dotted lines are optional. A report based on the located results may be generated (block <b>550</b>). In some embodiments of the present invention, the generated report may be modified or customized (block <b>580</b>). The generated report (or modified/customized report) may be processed (block <b>590</b>). For example, the a cohort file may be built based on the generated report, the generated report may be saved, the generated report may be scheduled for a run, a delivery method for the generated report may be determined and/or the generated report may be drilled into to reveal underlying detail associated with the located results as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Many alterations and modifications may be made by those having ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of present disclosure, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, it must be understood that the illustrated embodiments have been set forth only for the purposes of example, and that it should not be taken as limiting the invention as defined by the following claims.
