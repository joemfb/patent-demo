<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An integrated fin-based field effect transistor (FinFET) and method of fabricating such devices on a bulk wafer with EPI-defined fin heights over shallow trench isolation (STI) regions. The FinFET channels overlie the STI regions within the semiconductor bulk, while the fins extend beyond the STI regions into the source and drain regions which are implanted within the semiconductor bulk. With bulk source and drain regions, reduced external FinFET resistance is provided, and with the fins extending into the bulk source and drain regions, improved thermal properties is provided over conventional silicon on insulator (SOI) devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to multiple gate field effect transistors (FETs), such as metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), and in particular, to Fin-based field effect transistors, also known as FinFETs.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Perhaps the single most important device in modern electronic systems is the MOSFET. Such devices are used not only as transistors but also as passive devices, such as resistances and capacitances. The ability to scale such devices down to ever smaller dimensions has allowed electronic systems to become smaller to the point of enabling many hand-held and pocket-size systems. However, at the current pace of device scaling, it is predicted that planar transistors will soon reach their limits, in terms of minimize size. Further, as these devices get smaller, they increasingly suffer from undesirable short channel effects, such as off-state leakage current, which increases power consumption by the device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a result, multiple-gate MOSFETs have become of increased interest, based on their use of multiple gates on multiple surfaces, thereby more effectively suppressing off-state leakage currents. Further, these multiple gates allow enhanced current in the on-state, i.e., the drive current. Such advantages result in lower power consumption and enhanced device performance. Moreover, such non-planar devices are smaller than conventional planar transistors, thereby enabling even higher circuit densities and, therefore, smaller system sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One particular multiple-gate MOSFET that has been developed is a FinFET, in which the conducting channel is disposed around a thin silicon &#x201c;Fin&#x201d;, which serves as the body of the device. The dimensions of the Fin establish the effective channel length for the transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional FinFETs are fabricated using silicon over insulator (SOI) techniques. However, such devices often have poor thermal properties, e.g., poor heat dissipation, as well as relatively significant external resistances. Accordingly, an improved FinFET would be desirable.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The following detailed description is of example embodiments of the presently claimed invention with references to the accompanying drawings. Such description is intended to be illustrative and not limiting with respect to the scope of the present invention. Such embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the subject invention, and it will be understood that other embodiments may be practiced with some variations without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An integrated fin-based field effect transistor (FinFET) and method of fabricating such devices on a bulk wafer with EPI-defined fin heights over shallow trench isolation (STI) regions are provided. The FinFET channels overlie the STI regions within the semiconductor bulk, while the fins extend beyond the STI regions into the source and drain regions which are implanted within the semiconductor bulk. With bulk source and drain regions, reduced external FinFET resistance is provided, and with the fins extending into the bulk source and drain regions, improved thermal properties is provided over conventional silicon on insulator (SOI) devices.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Advantageously, such a device minimizes external resistances by allowing the source and drain regions to be located in the bulk and closer to the channel. Further advantageously, an undoped channel epitaxial (EPI) based Fin is disposed over shallow trench isolation (STI), such that the EPI layer allows for better control of the Fin heights, with less variability, and more consistent Fins, e.g., no undercutting. Further advantageously, such a device allows for performance enhancement from the introduction of additional strain in the STI layer, as well as from the bulk source and drain regions. Further advantageously, heat dissipation is increased with the Fins connected to the source and drain regions with the bulk substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the FinFET channel will be completely over STI while the Fins extend beyond the STI into the bulk source and drain regions. The source and drain regions can be formed using conventional source and drain implants and wells below. Extension of the Fins into the bulk source and drain regions allow for improved thermal properties similar to those using conventional bulk techniques, as opposed to SOI. With the FinFET channel over the STI, the Fin height in the channel region is determined by the deposited EPI layer over the STI. The bulk source and drain regions help reduce external resistances. The device architecture includes flexibility with respect to strain enhancement techniques in the STI layer below the channel and gate and also from the bulk source and drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>-<b>5</b>, a FinFET <b>1</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment includes a bulk source and drain and EPI merge area <b>3</b>, shallow trench isolation <b>4</b>, gate electrodes <b>5</b>, epitaxial Fins <b>6</b>, EPI merges <b>7</b>, P-type source and drain regions <b>8</b>, spacers <b>9</b>, local interconnects <b>10</b>, P-type bulk substrate <b>11</b>, P-well <b>12</b>, N-well <b>13</b>, high K film <b>14</b>, N-source and drain regions <b>15</b>, silicide <b>16</b>, gate hard mask <b>17</b> and TEOS regions <b>18</b>, substantially as shown. As discussed in more detail below, the shallow trench isolation (STI) regions are disposed within the bulk, with the source and drain regions disposed between neighboring STI regions. The Fins are disposed substantially normal to the STI regions, with parts of which disposed over STI regions and other parts of which disposed within the source and drain regions. Each of the gate electrodes is disposed over portions of each of the Fins and laterally away from the source and drain regions, i.e., not above the source and drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The processing steps as discussed below are conventional in nature and, therefore, well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The order in which the processing steps are discussed is not intended to necessarily be the only order in which such processing steps may be practiced, but rather are shown by way of example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, as seen along lines <b>2</b><i>c </i>and <b>2</b><i>d </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a photo resist <b>21</b> is deposited over the bulk <b>11</b> and etched away to produce the STI trenches <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>.</p>

Other types of semiconductor materials commonly used in the fabrication of circuits can also be used, including other silicon-based films laterally overgrown as depicted here, as well as gallium arsenide (GaAs), diamond-based or carbon nanotube films (e.g., using deposition).</p>

Additionally, the gates can be fabricated with a gate first or replacement gate flow as is well known in the art.</p>
