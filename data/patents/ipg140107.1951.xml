<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Oil and gas hydrocarbons are naturally occurring in some subterranean formations. A subterranean formation containing oil or gas is sometimes referred to as a reservoir. A reservoir may be located under land or off shore. Reservoirs are generally located in the range of a few hundred feet (shallow reservoirs) to a few tens of thousands of feet (ultra-deep reservoirs). In order to produce oil or gas, a well is drilled into a subterranean formation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As used herein, a &#x201c;well&#x201d; includes at least one wellbore drilled into a subterranean formation, which may be a reservoir or adjacent to a reservoir. A wellbore can have vertical and horizontal portions, and it can be straight, curved, or branched. As used herein, the term &#x201c;wellbore&#x201d; refers to a wellbore itself, including any uncased, open-hole portion of the wellbore. A near-wellbore region is the subterranean material and rock of the subterranean formation surrounding the wellbore. As used herein, a &#x201c;well&#x201d; also includes the near-wellbore region. The near-wellbore region is generally considered to be the region within about 100 feet of the wellbore. As used herein, &#x201c;into a well&#x201d; means and includes into any portion of the well, including into the wellbore or into the near-wellbore region via the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As used herein, a &#x201c;fluid&#x201d; is a substance having a continuous phase and that tends to flow and to conform to the outline of its container when the substance is tested at a temperature of 71&#xb0; F. and a pressure of one atmosphere. An example of a fluid is a liquid or gas. As used herein, a &#x201c;fluid&#x201d; can have more than one distinct phase. For example, a &#x201c;fluid&#x201d; can be or include a slurry, which is a suspension of solid particles in a continuous liquid phase; it can be or include an emulsion, which is a suspension of two or more immiscible liquids where droplets of at least one liquid phase are dispersed in a continuous liquid phase of another; or it can be or include a foam, which is a suspension or dispersion of gas bubbles in a continuous liquid phase.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to produce oil or gas, a wellbore is drilled into or near a subterranean formation. The wellbore may be an open hole or cased hole. In an open-hole wellbore, a tubing string is placed into the wellbore. The tubing string allows fluids to be introduced into or flowed from a remote portion of the wellbore. In a cased hole, a casing is placed into the wellbore that can contain a tubing string. In an open hole, the space between the wellbore and the outside of a tubing string is an annulus. In a cased hole, the space between the wellbore and the outside of the casing is an annulus. Also, in a cased hole, there may be an annulus between the tubing string and the inside of the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, a &#x201c;cement composition&#x201d; is a mixture of at least cement and water. The cement composition can also include additives. As used herein, the term &#x201c;cement&#x201d; means a dry powder substance that acts as a binder to bind other materials together. During well completion, it is common to introduce a cement composition into an annulus in the wellbore. For example, in a cased hole, the cement composition is placed into and allowed to set in the annulus between the wellbore and the casing in order to stabilize and secure the casing in the wellbore. The set cement composition has a low permeability, and as such, fluids are substantially inhibited from flowing into the annulus. Consequently, oil or gas can be produced in a controlled manner by directing the flow of oil or gas through the casing and into the wellhead. Cement compositions can also be used in well-plugging operations or gravel-packing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">During cementing operations, it is necessary for the cement composition to remain pumpable during introduction into the subterranean formation or the well and until the cement composition is situated in the portion of the subterranean formation or the well to be cemented. After the cement composition has reached the portion of the well to be cemented, the cement composition ultimately sets. A cement composition that thickens too quickly while being pumped can damage pumping equipment or block tubing or pipes, and a cement composition that sets too slowly can cost time and money while waiting for the cement composition to set.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, if any test (e.g., thickening time, compressive strength, or permeability) requires the step of &#x201c;mixing the cement composition,&#x201d; then the mixing step is performed according to ANSI/API Recommended Practice 10B-2 as follows. The water is added to a mixing container and the container is then placed on a mixer base. The motor of the base is then turned on and maintained at 4,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). The cement and any other ingredients are added to the container at a uniform rate in not more than 15 seconds (s). After all the cement and any other ingredients have been added to the water in the container, a cover is then placed on the container, and the cement composition is mixed at 12,000 rpm (+/&#x2212;500 rpm) for 35 s (+/&#x2212;1 s). It is to be understood that the cement composition is mixed at ambient temperature and pressure (about 71&#xb0; F. and about 1 atmosphere of pressure). It is also to be understood that if any test (e.g., thickening time or compressive strength) specifies the test be performed at a specified temperature and possibly a specified pressure, then the temperature and pressure of the cement composition is ramped up to the specified temperature and pressure after being mixed at ambient temperature and pressure. For example, the cement composition can be mixed at 71&#xb0; F. and then placed into the testing apparatus and the temperature of the cement composition can be ramped up to the specified temperature. As used herein, the rate of ramping up the temperature is in the range of about 3&#xb0; F./min to about 5&#xb0; F./min. After the cement composition is ramped up to the specified temperature and possibly pressure, the cement composition is maintained at that temperature and pressure for the duration of the testing.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, if any test (e.g., compressive strength or permeability) requires the step of &#x201c;curing the cement composition,&#x201d; then the curing step is performed according to ANSI/API Recommended Practice 10B-2 as follows. After the cement composition has been mixed, the cement composition is poured into a curing mould. The curing mould is placed into a pressurized curing chamber and the curing chamber is maintained at a temperature of 212&#xb0; F. and 3000 psi. The cement composition is allowed to cure for the length of time necessary for the composition to set. After the composition has set, the curing mould is placed into a water cooling bath until the cement composition sample is tested.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, the &#x201c;thickening time&#x201d; is how long it takes for a cement composition to become unpumpable at a specified temperature and pressure. The pumpability of a cement composition is related to the consistency of the composition. The consistency of a cement composition is measured in Bearden units of consistency (Bc), a dimensionless unit with no direct conversion factor to the more common units of viscosity. As used herein, a cement composition becomes &#x201c;unpumpable&#x201d; when the consistency of the composition reaches 70 Bc. As used herein, the consistency of a cement composition is measured according to ANSI/API Recommended Practice 10B-2 as follows. The cement composition is mixed. The cement composition is then placed in the test cell of a High-Temperature, High-Pressure (HTHP) consistometer, such as a Fann Model 275 or a Chandler Model 8240. The cement composition is tested in the HTHP consistometer at the specified temperature and pressure. Consistency measurements are taken continuously until the consistency of the cement composition exceeds 70 Bc.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A cement composition can develop compressive strength. Cement composition compressive strengths can vary from 0 psi to over 10,000 psi. Compressive strength is generally measured at a specified time after the cement composition has been mixed and at a specified temperature and pressure. For example, compressive strength can be measured at a time in the range of about 24 to about 48 hours at a temperature of 212&#xb0; F. According to ANSI/API Recommended Practice 10B-2, compressive strength can be measured by either a destructive method or non-destructive method.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The destructive method mechanically tests the strength of cement composition samples at various points in time by crushing the samples in a compression-testing machine. The destructive method is performed as follows. The cement composition is mixed. Then, the mixed composition is cured. The cured cement composition sample is placed in a compressive strength testing device, such as a Super L Universal testing machine model 602, available from Tinius Olsen, Horsham in Pennsylvania, USA. According to the destructive method, the compressive strength is calculated as the force required to break the sample divided by the smallest cross-sectional area in contact with the load-bearing plates of the compression device. The actual compressive strength is reported in units of pressure, such as pound-force per square inch (psi) or megapascals (MPa).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The non-destructive method continually measures a correlated compressive strength of a cement composition sample throughout the test period by utilizing a non-destructive sonic device such as an Ultrasonic Cement Analyzer (UCA) available from Fann Instruments in Houston, Tex. As used herein, the &#x201c;compressive strength&#x201d; of a cement composition is measured utilizing an Ultrasonic Cement Analyzer as follows. The cement composition is mixed. The cement composition is placed in an Ultrasonic Cement Analyzer, in which the cement composition is heated to the specified temperature and pressurized to the specified pressure. The UCA continually measures the transit time of the acoustic signal through the sample. The UCA device contains preset algorithms that correlate transit time to compressive strength. The UCA reports the compressive strength of the cement composition in units of pressure, such as psi or megapascals (MPa).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The compressive strength of a cement composition can be used to indicate whether the cement composition has set. A cement composition &#x201c;initially sets.&#x201d; As used herein, a cement composition is considered &#x201c;initially set&#x201d; when the cement composition has developed a compressive strength of 50 psi using the non-destructive compressive strength method. As used herein, the &#x201c;initial setting time&#x201d; is the difference in time between when the cement is added to the water and when the cement composition is initially set. If not otherwise stated, the setting and the initial setting time is determined at a temperature of 212&#xb0; F. and a pressure of 3,000 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the term &#x201c;set&#x201d; is intended to mean the process of becoming hard or solid by curing. It can take up to 72 hours or longer for some cement compositions to initially set. A cement composition sample that is at least initially set is suitable for destructive compressive strength testing and permeability testing. Some cement compositions can continue to develop a compressive strength greater than 50 psi over the course of several days. The compressive strength of some cement compositions can reach over 10,000 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">After the cement composition has set in the portion of the well to be cemented, the composition can have a low permeability. Permeability refers to how easily fluids can flow through a material. For example, if the permeability is high, then fluids will flow more easily and more quickly through the material. If the permeability is low, then fluids will flow less easily and more slowly through the material. As used herein, &#x201c;high permeability&#x201d; means the material has a permeability of at least 100 millidarcy (mD). As used herein, &#x201c;low permeability&#x201d; means the material has a permeability of less than 1 mD.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, the &#x201c;initial permeability&#x201d; of a cement composition is measured according to ANSI/API Recommended Practice 10B-2. The cement composition is mixed. The cement composition sample is then cured to be initially set. The initial permeability is measured by gas permeability. A core taken from the cured sample is then placed in a Hassler sleeve of in the pulse decay permeameter [Gas Permeameter Ultraperm-700, Temco Division of Core Lab., Tulsa, Okla., USA]. Nitrogen gas is then flowed through the core at a specified temperature condition by applying a specified pressure differential across the core. There is no flow rate measuring device in the system. The gas flows from an upstream test gas reservoir to the downstream gas reservoir through the high pressure core holder (Hassler Style loading). The upstream and the downstream reservoirs have known volumes. When fluid flows from the upstream reservoir the pressure decreases and when the fluid enters the downstream reservoir the pressure increases in the downstream reservoir. Flow rate can thus be calculated from the known volume of each reservoir, fluid compressibility, and rate of change of pressure. The PDP-200 operating software will then calculate the permeability.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, the &#x201c;final permeability&#x201d; of a cement composition in acid environment is measured as follows. After the initial permeability for the cement composition sample has been determined, the same cured sample is immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid having pH about 2. The sample is kept in the diluted HCl solution for 24 hours. The pH of diluted acid solution is kept much lower than the pH of a solution of either H<sub>2</sub>S or carbonic acid (which have pH around 4). The sample is then removed from the acid solution and is thoroughly washed with water and dried in oven for 24 hr at 80&#xb0; F. before subjecting the sample to the same gas permeability measurement described for the initial permeability testing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Cement compositions can contain additives. An example of an additive is a high-density additive. As used herein, a &#x201c;high-density&#x201d; additive is an additive that has a density greater than 3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Some metal oxides can be used as a high-density additive. As used herein, a &#x201c;metal oxide&#x201d; is a metal cation or transition metal cation with an oxide anion. Examples of metal oxides include, but are not limited to, iron oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and manganese oxide (Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). A commercially available example of an iron oxide high-density additive is Hi-Dense&#x2122; and an example of a commercially available manganese oxide is Micromax&#x2122;, both available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. in Duncan, Okla.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Some oil and gas wells can have a corrosive environment. As used herein, a &#x201c;corrosive environment&#x201d; is an environment containing corrosive materials. Examples of corrosive materials include, but are not limited to, liquids with a pH below 5, acid gas, or fluids containing dissolved acid gas. As used herein, the term &#x201c;acid gas&#x201d; means any gas that can mix with water to form an acidic solution having a pH below 5. The most common acid gases are hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). For example, CO<sub>2 </sub>reacts with water to form carbonic acid in an aqueous solution.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A cement composition that contains a metal oxide, high-density additive is prone to corrosion if introduced into a well having a corrosive environment. For example, after the cement composition has set in the portion of the well, the corrosive materials in the well can corrode a portion of the cement composition. Consequently, for example, oil or gas can flow more easily through the annulus and it can be more difficult to produce oil or gas in a controlled manner through the casing. Moreover, as the permeability of the set composition increases, the corrosive materials can flow through the set composition and come in contact with the casing. The corrosive materials can then corrode portions of the casing. Moreover, if the set cement composition comes into contact with corrosive materials, some of the metal oxide of the cement composition can dissolve out of the composition and then precipitate elsewhere to plug up other areas of the well. As a result, it can become more difficult to produce oil or gas.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It has been discovered that a high-density additive selected from silicon carbide, sintered bauxite, and a combination thereof can be used in a cement composition for introduction into an oil or gas well. The invention is particularly adapted for use in an oil or gas well that has a corrosive environment. The cement composition is not as susceptible to corrosion by the corrosive materials in the well compared to a cement composition that contains a metal oxide, such as Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Accordingly, it is preferable that the cement composition according to the invention include less than 4% bwc of a metal oxide.</p>
