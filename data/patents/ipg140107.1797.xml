<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to apparatus and a method for the application of topical negative pressure (TNP) therapy to wounds. In particular, but not exclusively, the present invention relates to features of apparatus and a method to prevent or minimise damage when subjected to conditions outside of normal operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is much prior art available relating to the provision of apparatus and methods of use thereof for the application of TNP therapy to wounds together with other therapeutic processes intended to enhance the effects of the TNP therapy. Examples of such prior art include those listed and briefly described below.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">TNP therapy assists in the closure and healing of wounds by reducing tissue oedema; encouraging blood flow and granulation of tissue; removing excess exudates and may reduce bacterial load and thus, infection to the wound. Furthermore, TNP therapy permits less outside disturbance of the wound and promotes more rapid healing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In our co-pending International patent application, WO 2004/037334, apparatus, a wound dressing and a method for aspirating, irrigating and cleansing wounds are described. In very general terms, this invention describes the treatment of a wound by the application of topical negative pressure (TNP) therapy for aspirating the wound together with the further provision of additional fluid for irrigating and/or cleansing the wound, which fluid, comprising both wound exudates and irrigation fluid, is then drawn off by the aspiration means and circulated through means for separating the beneficial materials therein from deleterious materials. The materials which are beneficial to wound healing are recirculated through the wound dressing and those materials deleterious to wound healing are discarded to a waste collection bag or vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In our co-pending International patent application, WO 2005/04670, apparatus, a wound dressing and a method for cleansing a wound using aspiration, irrigation and cleansing wounds are described. Again, in very general terms, the invention described in this document utilises similar apparatus to that in WO 2004/037334 with regard to the aspiration, irrigation and cleansing of the wound, however, it further includes the important additional step of providing heating means to control the temperature of that beneficial material being returned to the wound site/dressing so that it is at an optimum temperature, for example, to have the most efficacious therapeutic effect on the wound.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In our co-pending International patent application, WO 2005/105180, apparatus and a method for the aspiration, irrigation and/or cleansing of wounds are described. Again, in very general terms, this document describes similar apparatus to the two previously mentioned documents hereinabove but with the additional step of providing means for the supply and application of physiologically active agents to the wound site/dressing to promote wound healing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The content of the above references is included herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the above apparatus and methods are generally only applicable to a patient when hospitalised as the apparatus is complex, needing people having specialist knowledge in how to operate and maintain the apparatus, and also relatively heavy and bulky, not being adapted for easy mobility outside of a hospital environment by a patient, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some patients having relatively less severe wounds which do not require continuous hospitalisation, for example, but whom nevertheless would benefit from the prolonged application of TNP therapy, could be treated at home or at work subject to the availability of an easily portable and maintainable TNP therapy apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">GB-A-2 307 180 describes a portable TNP therapy unit which may be carried by a patient clipped to belt or harness. The unit embodies a device having mechanical and electrical/electronic functions and components and comprises an all enveloping casing in which the above components are housed and which casing also contains a waste canister. Should the unit be dropped, for example, or subjected to loads or impacts outside of normal operating conditions, all components thereof are subject thereto and serious damage may occur to the more expensive mechanical and/or electronic components. A further disadvantage of the apparatus described is the difficulty of removing and changing the waste canister, especially for less dextrous people. It is an aim of the present invention to at least partly mitigate the above-mentioned problems.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an aim of embodiments of the present invention to protect the more expensive parts of the apparatus from damage when used subjected to conditions outside of normal operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further aim of the present invention to provide apparatus where the waste canister is more easily accessible and more easily changed or replaced with a fresh canister.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided apparatus for the application of topical negative pressure therapy to a user of the apparatus, the apparatus comprising a device and a waste canister releasably connected thereto wherein the device and waste canister are connected together by clip means.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The clip means are intended to fail upon the application of stresses outside of normal operating conditions, as further explained in more detail hereinbelow, upon which failure permits separation of the device and waste canister.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention is comprised in part of an overall apparatus for the provision of TNP therapy to a patient in almost any environment. The apparatus is lightweight, may be mains or battery powered by a rechargeable battery pack contained within a device (henceforth, the term &#x201c;device&#x201d; is used to connote a unit which may contain all of the control, power supply, power supply recharging, electronic indicator means and means for initiating and sustaining aspiration functions to a wound and any further necessary functions of a similar nature). When outside the home, for example, the apparatus may provide for an extended period of operation on battery power and in the home, for example, the device may be connected to the mains by a charger unit whilst still being used and operated by the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The overall apparatus of which the present invention is a part comprises: a dressing covering the wound and sealing at least an open end of an aspiration conduit to a cavity formed over the wound by the dressing; an aspiration tube comprising at least one lumen therethrough leading from the wound dressing to a waste material canister for collecting and holding wound exudates/waste material prior to disposal; and, a power, control and aspiration initiating and sustaining device associated with the waste canister.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The dressing covering the wound may be any type of dressing normally employed with TNP therapy and, in very general terms, may comprise, for example, a semi-permeable, flexible, self-adhesive drape material, as is known in the dressings art, to cover the wound and seal with surrounding sound tissue to create a sealed cavity or void over the wound. There may aptly be a porous barrier and support member in the cavity between the wound bed and the covering material to enable an even vacuum distribution to be achieved over the area of the wound. The porous barrier and support member being, for example, a gauze, foam, inflatable bladder or known wound contact type material resistant to crushing under the levels of vacuum created and which permits transfer of wound exudates across the wound area to the aspiration conduit sealed to the flexible cover drape over the wound.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The aspiration conduit may be a plain flexible tube, for example, having a single lumen therethrough and made from a plastics material compatible with raw tissue, for example. However, the aspiration conduit may have a plurality of lumens therethrough to achieve specific objectives relating to the invention. A portion of the tube sited within the sealed cavity over the wound may have a structure to enable continued aspiration and evacuation of wound exudates without becoming constricted or blocked even at the higher levels of the negative pressure range envisaged.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is envisaged that the negative pressure range for the apparatus embodying the present invention may be between about &#x2212;50 mmHg and &#x2212;200 mmHg (note that these pressures are relative to normal ambient atmospheric pressure thus, &#x2212;200 mmHg would be about 560 mmHg in practical terms). Aptly, the pressure range may be between about &#x2212;75 mmHg and &#x2212;150 mmHg. Alternatively a pressure range of up to &#x2212;75 mmHg, up to &#x2212;80 mmHg or over &#x2212;80 mmHg can be used. Also aptly a pressure range of below &#x2212;75 mmHg could be used. Alternatively a pressure range of over &#x2212;100 mmHg could be used or over &#x2212;150 mmHg.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The aspiration conduit at its distal end remote from the dressing may be attached to the waste canister at an inlet port or connector. The device containing the means for initiating and sustaining aspiration of the wound/dressing may be situated between the dressing and waste canister, however, in a preferred embodiment of the apparatus embodying the present invention, the device may aspirate the wound/dressing via the canister thus, the waste canister may preferably be sited between the wound/dressing and device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The aspiration conduit at the waste material canister end may preferably be bonded to the waste canister to prevent inadvertent detachment when being caught on an obstruction, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The canister may be a plastics material moulding or a composite unit comprising a plurality of separate mouldings. The canister may aptly be translucent or transparent in order to visually determine the extent of filling with exudates. However, the canister and device may in some embodiments provide automatic warning of imminent canister full condition and may also provide means for cessation of aspiration when the canister reaches the full condition.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The canister may be provided with filters to prevent the exhaust of liquids and odours therefrom and also to prevent the expulsion of bacteria into the atmosphere. Such filters may comprise a plurality of filters in series. Examples of suitable filters may comprise hydrophobic filters of 0.2 &#x3bc;m pore size, for example, in respect of sealing the canister against bacteria expulsion and 1 &#x3bc;m against liquid expulsion.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Aptly, the filters may be sited at an upper portion of the waste canister in normal use, that is when the apparatus is being used or carried by a patient the filters are in an upper position and separated from the exudate liquid in the waste canister by gravity. Furthermore, such an orientation keeps the waste canister outlet or exhaust exit port remote from the exudate surface.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Aptly the waste canister may be filled with an absorbent gel such as ISOLYSEL (trade mark), for example, as an added safeguard against leakage of the canister when full and being changed and disposed of. Added advantages of a gel matrix within the exudate storing volume of the waste canister are that it prevents excessive movement, such as slopping, of the liquid, minimises bacterial growth and minimises odours.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The waste canister may also be provided with suitable means to prevent leakage thereof both when detached from the device unit and also when the aspiration conduit is detached from the wound site/dressing.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The canister may have suitable means to prevent emptying by a user (without tools or damage to the canister) such that a full or otherwise end-of-life canister may only be disposed of with waste fluid still contained.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The device and waste canister may have mutually complementary means for connecting a device unit to a waste canister whereby the aspiration means in the device unit automatically connects to an evacuation port on the waste canister such that there is a continuous aspiration path from the wound site/dressing to an exhaust port on the device.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Aptly, the exhaust port from the fluid path through the apparatus is provided with filter means to prevent offensive odours from being ejected into the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In general terms the device unit comprises an aspirant pump; means for monitoring pressure applied by the aspirant pump; a flowmeter to monitor fluid flow through the aspirant pump; a control system which controls the aspirant pump in response to signals from sensors such as the pressure monitoring means and the flowmeter, for example, and which control system also controls a power management system with regard to an on-board battery pack and the charging thereof and lastly a user interface system whereby various functions of the device such as pressure level set point, for example, may be adjusted (including stopping and starting of the apparatus) by a user. The device unit may contain all of the above features within a single unified casing.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In view of the fact that the device unit contains the majority of the intrinsic equipment cost therein ideally it will also be able to survive impact, tolerate cleaning in order to be reusable by other patients.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the present invention &#x201c;normal&#x201d; operating conditions would include use such as a patient or user sitting, walking or running with the apparatus on their person; sleeping and rolling onto the apparatus; accidentally letting the apparatus fall onto a soft surface such as a bed or carpeted floor, for example. The apparatus is intended to remain unaffected when, for example, it is hanging or fixed on a bedstead and able to withstand a pull force on the aspirant conduit or power lead not exceeding about 40N and preferably not exceeding about 20N.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the present invention, the conditions which are considered to be abnormal or outside of normal operating conditions may include dropping of the apparatus onto the ground, impact when being worn by a patient when, for example, walking into an obstruction or falling down, or when the aspirant conduit or power lead is subject to an accidental tug causing the device to fall from a table or bed. Essentially, the present invention permits the device and waste canister to separate by failure of the clip means when the apparatus is subjected to abnormal stresses or impacts. The term &#x201c;failure&#x201d; in respect of the clip means shall be taken to means that the engaging features, which features may be present on the clip means themselves, on the device and/or on the waste canister, which the clip means couple with under normal conditions of connecting the device and waste canister together become disengaged without breakage or the clip means themselves suffer breakage of a feature thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is important that the separation of the device and waste canister occurs by disengagement of the clips means in some manner from the device rather than the waste canister. Thus, no damage is caused to the device and, if clip member breakage occurs then the user is not faced with having to remove a broken clip member from the relatively more delicate device unit. On disengagement, any damage to the waste canister can be rectified simply by the user fitting a new waste canister.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When, for example, the apparatus is dropped onto a hard surface the clip means fail as defined hereinabove thus allowing the device unit and waste canister to separate thus saving the device unit from sustaining significant damage such that would impair its operation. The invention is this, in effect, a shock absorbing measure.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In general the clip means may be able to withstand forces up to about 100N before failure thereof thus, a force or load of greater than about 100N in a direction tending to separate the device and waste canister may result in failure of the clip means holding the device and waste canister together. It is pointed out that forces tending to separate the device and waste canister may not necessarily be in mutually opposed directions but may be in other direction such as, for example, a force applied transversely on the waste canister tending to knock it sideways relative to the device unit.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the clip means in the form of clips made of stiff but resilient material are primarily attached to the waste canister on which they may be rotated through an arc about an axis provided by a location shaft on the waste canister. The clips may be releasably attached to the waste canister and in effect be consumer replaceable items which may be easily replaced upon breakage thereof so that the waste canister may be quickly reattached to the device. Thus, not only is the device protected from damage but also the waste canister itself.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment of the present invention, the clips may be moulded from a POM (polyoxymethylene) acetal polymer, however, any suitable plastics material having adequate resilience may be employed. Although plastics materials are specifically mentioned since they are easily formed, suitable metal items would also fulfil the requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an end portion of the clip which attaches to the waste canister may comprise a deformable C-section recess so as to provide a snap-fit on a shaft portion on the waste canister. Intermediate the ends of the clip on an inwardly turned face there may be a resiliently deformable finger feature which engages with one or more co-operating features on the device unit to connect the device and waste canister together in functional engagement. Since the waste canister is a disposable item when full the clips may be disengaged from the device and the waste canister disposed of a fresh canister installed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The clip surface may also be provided with so-called grip strips to assist the user in engaging the device and waste canister together.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The clips may be universal in that one design fits both sides of the apparatus or may be handed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of protecting apparatus for the application of topical negative pressure to a user, the apparatus comprising a device and a waste canister releasably connected together, the method comprising the steps of providing clip means to connect the device and waste canister together and providing features on at least two of: said clip means; said device; and, said waste canister to permit separation of the device and waste canister in the event of failure of the clip means.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The features referred to may be points of intended failure by breakage on the clip means. Such features may comprise a reduced section portion or portions on the clip members or by moulded-in fracture lines, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In terms of pressure capability the aspiration means may be able to apply a maximum pressure drop of at least &#x2212;200 mmHg to a wound site/dressing. The apparatus is capable of maintaining a predetermined negative pressure even under conditions where there is a small leak of air into the system and a high exudate flow.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The pressure control system may prevent the minimum pressure achieved from exceeding for example &#x2212;200 mmHg so as not to cause undue patient discomfort. The pressure required may be set by the user at a number of discreet levels such as &#x2212;50, &#x2212;75, &#x2212;100, &#x2212;125, &#x2212;150, &#x2212;175 mmHg, for example, depending upon the needs of the wound in question and the advice of a clinician. Thus suitable pressure ranges in use may be from &#x2212;25 mmHg to &#x2212;80 mmHg, or &#x2212;50 to &#x2212;76 mmHg, or &#x2212;50 to &#x2212;75 mmHg as examples. The control system may also advantageously be able to maintain the set pressure within a tolerance band of +/&#x2212; 10 mmHg of the set point for 95% of the time the apparatus is operating given that leakage and exudation rates are within expected or normal levels.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Aptly, the control system may trigger alarm means such as a flashing light, buzzer or any other suitable means when various abnormal conditions apply such as, for example: pressure outside set value by a large amount due to a gross leak of air into system; duty on the aspiration pump too high due to a relatively smaller leakage of air into the system; pressure differential between wound site and pump is too high due, for example, to a blockage or waste canister full.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The apparatus of the present invention may be provided with a carry case and suitable support means such as a shoulder strap or harness, for example. The carry case may be adapted to conform to the shape of the apparatus comprised in the joined together device and waste canister. In particular, the carry case may be provided with a bottom opening flap to permit the waste canister to be changed without complete removal of the apparatus from the carry case.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The carry case may be provided with an aperture covered by a displaceable flap to enable user access to a keypad for varying the therapy applied by the apparatus.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> of the drawings and where the same or similar features are denoted by common reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a generalised schematic view of an apparatus <b>10</b> of a portable topical negative pressure (TNP) system. It will be understood that embodiments of the present invention are generally applicable to use in such a TNP system. Briefly, negative pressure wound therapy assists in the closure and healing of many forms of &#x201c;hard to heal&#x201d; wounds by reducing tissue oedema; encouraging blood flow and granular tissue formation; removing excess exudate and may reduce bacterial load (and, therefore, infection). In addition the therapy allows for less disturbance of a wound leading to more rapid healing. The TNP system is detailed further hereinafter but in summary includes a portable body including a canister and a device with the device capable of providing an extended period of continuous therapy within at least a one year life span. The system is connected to a patient via a length of tubing with an end of the tubing operably secured to a wound dressing on the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">More particularly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus comprises an aspiration conduit <b>12</b> operably and an outer surface thereof at one end sealingly attached to a dressing <b>14</b>. The dressing <b>14</b> will not be further described here other than to say that it is formed in a known manner from well known materials to those skilled in the dressings art to create a sealed cavity over and around a wound to be treated by TNP therapy with the apparatus of the present invention. The aspiration conduit has an in-line connector <b>16</b> comprising connector portions <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> intermediate its length between the dressing <b>14</b> and a waste canister <b>22</b>. The aspiration conduit between the connector portion <b>20</b> and the canister <b>22</b> is denoted by a different reference numeral <b>24</b> although the fluid path through conduit portions <b>12</b> and <b>24</b> to the waste canister is continuous. The connector portions <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> join conduit portions <b>12</b>, <b>24</b> in a leak-free but disconnectable manner. The waste canister <b>22</b> is provided with filters <b>26</b> which prevent the escape via an exit port <b>28</b> of liquid and bacteria from the waste canister. The filters may comprise a 1 &#x3bc;m hydrophobic liquid filter and a 0.2 &#x3bc;m bacteria filter such that all liquid and bacteria is confined to an interior waste collecting volume of the waste canister <b>22</b>. The exit port <b>28</b> of the waste canister <b>22</b> mates with an entry/suction port <b>30</b> of a device unit <b>32</b> by means of mutually sealing connector portions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> which engage and seal together automatically when the waste canister <b>22</b> is attached to the device unit <b>32</b>, the waste canister <b>22</b> and device unit <b>32</b> being held together by catch assemblies <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>. The device unit <b>32</b> comprises an aspirant pump <b>44</b>, an aspirant pressure monitor <b>46</b> and an aspirant flowmeter <b>48</b> operably connected together. The aspiration path takes the aspirated fluid which in the case of fluid on the exit side of exit port <b>28</b> is gaseous through a silencer system <b>50</b> and a final filter <b>52</b> having an activated charcoal matrix which ensures that no odours escape with the gas exhausted from the device <b>32</b> via an exhaust port <b>54</b>. The filter <b>52</b> material also serves as noise reducing material to enhance the effect of the silencer system <b>50</b>. The device <b>32</b> also contains a battery pack <b>56</b> to power the apparatus which battery pack also powers the a control system <b>60</b> which controls a user interface system <b>62</b> controlled via a keypad (not shown) and the aspiration pump <b>44</b> via signals from sensors <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. A power management system <b>66</b> is also provided which controls power from the battery pack <b>56</b>, the recharging thereof and the power requirements of the aspirant pump <b>44</b> and other electrically operated components. An electrical connector <b>68</b> is provided to receive a power input jack <b>70</b> from a SELV power supply <b>72</b> connected to a mains supply <b>74</b> when the user of the apparatus or the apparatus itself is adjacent a convenient mains power socket.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a similar schematic representation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> but shows the fluid paths in more detail. The wound exudate is aspirated from the wound site/dressing <b>14</b> via the conduit <b>12</b>, the two connector portions <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and the conduit <b>24</b> into the waste canister <b>22</b>. The waste canister <b>22</b> comprises a relatively large volume <b>80</b> in the region of 500 ml into which exudate from the wound is drawn by the aspiration system at an entry port <b>82</b>. The fluid <b>84</b> drawn into the canister volume <b>80</b> is a mixture of both air drawn into the dressing <b>14</b> via the semi-permeable adhesive sealing drape (not shown) and liquid <b>86</b> in the form of wound exudates. The volume <b>80</b> within the canister is also at a lowered pressure and the gaseous element <b>88</b> of the aspirated fluids is exhausted from the canister volume <b>80</b> via the filters <b>26</b> and the waste canister exhaust exit port <b>28</b> as bacteria-free gas. From the exit port <b>28</b> of the waste canister to the final exhaust port <b>54</b> the fluid is gaseous only.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic diagram showing only the device portion of the apparatus and the power paths in the device of the apparatus embodying the present invention. Power is provided mainly by the battery pack <b>56</b> when the user is outside their home or workplace, for example, however, power may also be provided by an external mains <b>74</b> supplied charging unit <b>72</b> which when connected to the device <b>32</b> by the socket <b>68</b> is capable of both operating the device and recharging the battery pack <b>56</b> simultaneously. The power management system <b>66</b> is included so as to be able to control power of the TNP system. The TNP system is a rechargeable, battery powered system but is capable of being run directly from mains electricity as will be described hereinafter more fully with respect to the further figures. If disconnected from the mains the battery has enough stored charge for approximately 8 hours of use in normal conditions. It will be appreciated that batteries having other associated life times between recharge can be utilised. For example batteries providing less than 8 hours or greater than 8 hours can be used. When connected to the mains the device will run off the mains power and will simultaneously recharge the battery if depleted from portable use. The exact rate of battery recharge will depend on the load on the TNP system. For example, if the wound is very large or there is a significant leak, battery recharge will take longer than if the wound is small and well sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the device <b>32</b> part of the apparatus embodying the present invention and the data paths employed in the control system for control of the aspirant pump and other features of the apparatus. A key purpose of the TNP system is to apply negative pressure wound therapy. This is accomplished via the pressure control system which includes the pump and a pump control system. The pump applies negative pressure; the pressure control system gives feedback on the pressure at the pump head to the control system; the pump control varies the pump speed based on the difference between the target pressure and the actual pressure at the pump head. In order to improve accuracy of pump speed and hence provide smoother and more accurate application of the negative pressure at a wound site, the pump is controlled by an auxiliary control system. The pump is from time to time allowed to &#x201c;free-wheel&#x201d; during its duty cycle by turning off the voltage applied to it. The spinning motor causes a &#x201c;back electro-motive force&#x201d; or BEMF to be generated. This BEMF can be monitored and can be used to provide an accurate measure of pump speed. The speed can thus be adjusted more accurately than can prior art pump systems.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to embodiments of the present invention, actual pressure at a wound site is not measured but the difference between a measured pressure (at the pump) and the wound pressure is minimised by the use of large filters and large bore tubes wherever practical. If the pressure control measures that the pressure at the pump head is greater than a target pressure (closer to atmospheric pressure) for a period of time, the device sends an alarm and displays a message alerting the user to a potential problem such as a leak.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition to pressure control a separate flow control system can be provided. A flow meter may be positioned after the pump and is used to detect when a canister is full or the tube has become blocked. If the flow falls below a certain threshold, the device sounds an alarm and displays a message alerting a user to the potential blockage or full canister.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 9</figref> which show various views and cross sections of a preferred embodiment of apparatus <b>200</b> embodying the present invention. The preferred embodiment is of generally oval shape in plan and comprises a device unit <b>202</b> and a waste canister <b>204</b> connected together by clip arrangements <b>206</b>. The device unit <b>202</b> has a liquid crystal display (LCD) <b>208</b>, which gives text based feedback on the wound therapy being applied, and a membrane keypad <b>210</b>, the LCD being visible through the membrane of the keypad to enable a user to adjust or set the therapy to be applied to the wound (not shown). The device has a lower, generally transverse face <b>212</b> in the centre of which is a spigot <b>214</b> which forms the suction/entry port <b>216</b> to which the aspiration means (to be described below) are connected within the device unit. The lower edge of the device unit is provided with a rebated peripheral male mating face <b>218</b> which engages with a co-operating peripheral female formation <b>220</b> on an upper edge of the waste canister <b>204</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>). On each side of the device <b>202</b>, clips <b>222</b> hinged to the canister <b>204</b> have an engaging finger (not shown) which co-operates with formations in recesses <b>226</b> in the body of the device unit. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> it may be seen that the casing <b>230</b> of the device unit is of largely &#x201c;clamshell&#x201d; construction comprising front and back mouldings <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, respectively and left-hand and right-hand side inserts <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>. Inside the casing <b>230</b> is a central chassis <b>240</b> which is fastened to an internal moulded structural member <b>242</b> and which chassis acts as a mounting for the electrical circuitry and components and also retains the battery pack (not shown) and aspiration pump unit <b>248</b>. Various tubing items <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> connect the pump unit <b>248</b> and suction/entry port <b>216</b> to a final gaseous exhaust via a filter <b>290</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a partially sectioned side elevation of the apparatus <b>200</b>, the partial section being around the junction between the device unit <b>202</b> and the waste canister <b>204</b>, a cross section of which is shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Theses views show the rebated edge <b>218</b> of the male formation on the device unit co-operating with the female portion <b>220</b> defined by an upstanding flange <b>260</b> around the top face <b>262</b> of the waste canister <b>204</b>. When the waste canister is joined to the device unit, the spigot <b>214</b> which has an &#x201c;O&#x201d; ring seal <b>264</b> therearound sealingly engages with a cylindrical tube portion <b>266</b> formed around an exhaust/exit port <b>268</b> in the waste canister. The spigot <b>214</b> of the device is not rigidly fixed to the device casing but is allowed to &#x201c;float&#x201d; or move in its location features in the casing to permit the spigot <b>214</b> and seal <b>264</b> to move to form the best seal with the bore of the cylindrical tube portion <b>266</b> on connection of the waste canister to the device unit. The waste canister <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is shown in an upright orientation much as it would be when worn by a user. Thus, any exudate <b>270</b> would be in the bottom of the internal volume of waste receptacle portion <b>272</b>. An aspiration conduit <b>274</b> is permanently affixed to an entry port spigot <b>278</b> defining an entry port <b>280</b> to receive fluid aspirated from a wound (not shown) via the conduit <b>274</b>. Filter members <b>282</b> comprising a 0.2 &#x3bc;m filter and <b>284</b> comprising a 1 &#x3bc;m filter are located by a filter retaining member <b>286</b> adjacent a top closure member or bulkhead <b>288</b> the filter members preventing any liquid or bacteria from being drawn out of the exhaust exit port <b>268</b> into the pump and aspiration path through to an exhaust and filter unit <b>290</b> which is connected to a casing outlet member <b>291</b> via an exhaust tube (not shown) in casing side piece <b>236</b>. The side pieces <b>236</b>, <b>238</b> are provided with recesses <b>292</b> having support pins <b>294</b> therein to locate a carrying strap (not shown) for use by the patient. The side pieces <b>230</b> and canister <b>204</b> are also provided with features which prevent the canister and device from exhibiting a mutual &#x201c;wobble&#x201d; when connected together. Ribs (not shown) extending between the canister top closure member or bulkhead <b>288</b> and the inner face <b>300</b> of the upstanding flange <b>260</b> locate in grooves <b>302</b> in the device sidewalls when canister and device are connected. The casing <b>230</b> also houses all of the electrical equipment and control and power management features, the functioning of which was described briefly with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> hereinabove. The side piece <b>238</b> is provided with a socket member <b>298</b> to receive a charging jack from an external mains powered battery charger (both not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 14</figref> wherein a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In all descriptions of apparatus, right and left are defined as when viewing the apparatus from towards the LCD screen with the device uppermost.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an exploded view of casing parts <b>230</b> of the device <b>202</b> and waste canister <b>204</b>: comprising the back moulding <b>234</b>, left and right-side mouldings <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, respectively of the device; and, the waste canister receptacle portion <b>272</b> and closure bulkhead <b>288</b>. The waste receptacle portion <b>272</b> and the closure bulkhead <b>288</b> of the waste canister are welded together to form a unitary canister unit. Connecting clip members <b>222</b> are provided to connect the waste canister <b>204</b> to the device <b>202</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> show left and right-hand clips <b>222</b> respectively and, although they are different insofar as they are handed, they both possess in principle essentially the same features of construction and function as each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an enlarged portion of a C-shaped feature <b>400</b> which connects the clip member <b>222</b> to the waste canister <b>204</b> by means of a snap-fit onto a shaft member <b>402</b> provided as an integral moulding on the waste canister bulkhead <b>288</b>. Attachment of the clip member <b>222</b> to the shaft <b>402</b> is by the C-shaped feature <b>400</b> resiliently deforming slightly on pressing onto the shaft <b>402</b> before regaining its original size and providing a secure grip on the shaft <b>402</b>. The clip members <b>222</b> also have a finger portion <b>404</b> having a downwardly directed lip portion <b>406</b>, the finger portion being resiliently deformable. The device side insert portions <b>236</b>, <b>238</b> are each provided with a recess <b>408</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>) to accommodate a finger of a user (not shown). When a waste canister is offered up to the device for attachment, the clip <b>222</b> is able to rotate through an arc about the shaft <b>402</b>. At a lower portion of the recess <b>408</b> there is a co-operating engaging feature <b>410</b> which engages the finger portion <b>404</b> and the lip portion <b>406</b>. The engaging feature <b>410</b> comprises an upstanding tooth portion <b>412</b> having a sloping lead-in portion <b>414</b> which engages with the lip portion <b>406</b> causing the finger portion <b>404</b> to resiliently deform before snapping into a locking position with a rear face <b>416</b> of the lip portion <b>406</b> in engagement with a rear face <b>418</b> of the tooth <b>412</b> so releasably connecting the device <b>202</b> and waste canister <b>204</b> together. The clip members <b>222</b> are also provided with a tactile surface coating <b>430</b> such as a soft plastics material on their outer surface which gives a user an intuitive feel when assembling a waste canister to a device.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When the waste canister is to be removed from the device in normal use such as when the canister is full, for example, the user grips a rear face <b>420</b> of the clip member <b>222</b> above the finger member <b>404</b> and pulls in an outwardly direction with their finger. The engaging rear faces <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> of the lip portion <b>406</b> and tooth portion <b>412</b> are both sloped such that an outwardly force causes the two surfaces <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> to slide relative to each other whilst resiliently deforming the finger portion <b>404</b> thus allowing disengagement of the clip member <b>222</b> from the device <b>202</b> and permitting removal of the waste canister.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Fitting of a new waste canister is simply achieved as explained above.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the event that the apparatus is subjected to abnormal operating conditions such as, for example, dropping it onto a hard surface from a significant height, perhaps a metre for example, then depending upon the direction of a shock load impinging on the apparatus several possibilities may occur. Firstly, the engaging portion <b>410</b> on the device and engaging finger <b>404</b> on the clip member may simply disengage due to resilient sliding of the sloped surfaces <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> allowing the device and waste canister to separate or by disengagement of the C-shaped portion <b>400</b> from the shaft portion <b>402</b>. Alternatively, the finger portion <b>404</b> may snap off adjacent its root, for example, on the clip member body.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the event of failure of a clip member by breakage, one or both clip members may simply be replaced by disengaging the C-shaped portion <b>400</b> of the broken clip from the shaft portion <b>402</b> and fitting a new clip member in its place and reassembling the waste canister to the device as explained above.</p>
