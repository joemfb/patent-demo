<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a network terminal capable of notifying an administrator terminal about information on network terminals, such as printers connected to a network, by email.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Printers can be connected to a network and shared by several people on a network. Some network printers are able to notify the network administrator about problems such as a sheet size error or when the printer runs out of toner by sending information about the problem to the administrator in an email message.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a schematic view representing an example of problem information to be sent to a network administrator by email. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, conventional problem information includes status information <b>24</b> and node information <b>25</b>. The status information <b>24</b> indicates a summary of the printer condition. The node information <b>25</b> indicates the name, type, and location of the printer. The email message that notified the network administrator of the problem information will be referred to as the &#x201c;notifying message&#x201d;, hereinafter. The notifying message is automatically sent to the email address of the network administrator when a problem is generated at the printer. When the network administrator receives the notifying message, then he or she goes over to the printer indicated in the notifying message and solves the problem while referring to the notifying message.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, if the network administrator must go to the printer in order to solve problems, then it is very difficult for the network administrator to solve printer problems rapidly when the network extends over a large area and the problem printer is not at a location near the network administrator.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some networks include a printer server provided with a printer management tool that is capable of monitoring and manipulating the printer. The network administrator inputs a commanded to the printer management tool from the printer server, or from a terminal that has accessed to the printer server, to manipulate the printer and overcome problems in the printer. However, the network administrator must remember all the appropriate commands for manipulating the printer using the printer management tool. This makes the printer management tool troublesome and complex to use.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some printers are provided with a management page of a web-page format that can be accessed by specifying the address of the management web page. In this case, the network administrator accesses the web server in the printer from a terminal connected to the network and solves problems with the printer through the management web page. However, if the network administrator does not know or forgets the address of the management web page, then it will take time for the network administrator to access the management web page, resulting in a delay in solving the printer problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to overcome the above-described problems and provide a terminal information notification system, a terminal information notification method, and a network terminal that facilitates confirmation of internal information or the cause of problems when problems occur or when internal information is to be confirmed or changed.</p>

The network control portion <b>221</b> controls transmissions exchanged between the network <b>1</b> and the printer <b>2</b>. The mail preparation portion <b>222</b> is responsible for preparing notification mail and appending the URL of a control page to the notification mail. The mail settings memory <b>223</b> stores settings such as the address of the transmission target of a notification mail and whether it is necessary to append a URL to the notification mail, or period at which the condition of the printer <b>2</b> is periodically notified to the network administrator.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The control portion <b>23</b> includes a control integration portion <b>231</b>, a printer settings memory <b>232</b>, a problem detection portion <b>233</b>, a web server <b>234</b>, and a URL settings portion <b>235</b>. The control integration portion <b>231</b> processes commands and data that was transmitted over the network <b>1</b> from the administrator terminal <b>3</b> and the user terminal <b>4</b> and integrates operations of the actuator portion <b>21</b> and other components in the control portion <b>23</b> based on the commands and data. The printer settings memory <b>232</b> stores settings set for the printer <b>2</b>. The problem detection portion <b>233</b> constantly monitors output from the sensor <b>211</b> of the actuator portion <b>21</b> to detect problem detection signals output from the sensor <b>211</b> when a problem occurs in the actuator portion <b>21</b>. The web server <b>234</b> provides a setting screen, a controller page, and other pages in accordance request from terminals on the network <b>1</b>. The setting screen is for setting various settings of the printer <b>2</b>. The web server <b>234</b> generates the controller page, which is for performing operations to control the printer <b>2</b>. The URL settings portion <b>235</b> is for setting URL of the controller page each time the web server <b>234</b> generates the controller page.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The control portion <b>23</b> and the LAN interface portion are formed by well-known circuitry such as a central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), an I/O, and a serial interface. The functional blocks within the control portion <b>23</b> and the LAN interface portion <b>22</b> are realized by execution of programs.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When a problem such as a sheet size error occurs in the printer <b>2</b>, the printer <b>2</b> transmits a notification mail to the email address registered in the mail settings memory <b>223</b>. The notification mail specifies the location and type of the problem.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The printer <b>2</b> transmits the notification mail to the email address at the notification timing, which is the period preregistered in the mail settings memory <b>223</b>, so that the user can know the condition in the printer <b>2</b>. The notification timing could be set for a period of timing such as every six hours. Alternatively, the notification timing could be set to every day, week, or month for example, wherein the time of day of the notification timing is also set. As a further alternative, the notification timing could be set for a single time on a specific day at a specific time.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart representing a main routine performed by the control portion <b>23</b> of the printer <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">During the main routine of the printer <b>2</b>, first whether or not a print command has come over the network <b>1</b> from the user terminal <b>4</b> is monitored in S<b>10</b>. When it is judged that a print command has arrived (S<b>10</b>: YES), then a print routine is performed in S<b>12</b>. During the print routine, the actuator portion <b>21</b> is controlled in the normal manner based on received data. On the other hand, if no print command is received (S<b>10</b>: NO), then whether or not a problem has been notified by the problem detection portion <b>233</b> is judged in S<b>13</b>.
