<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The variable resistance nonvolatile storage device reduces variations in a resistance value of a variable resistance element (<b>100</b>) in the low resistance state, performs stable operations, and includes an LR write circuit (<b>500</b>) (i) applying a voltage to a memory cell (<b>102</b>) so that a resistance state of the variable resistance element included in the memory cell is changed from high to low, and (ii) including a first driving circuit (<b>510</b>) and a second driving circuit (<b>520</b>) which apply voltages to the memory cell and which have connected output terminals. When applying a voltage to the memory cell, the first driving circuit supplies a first current, and the second driving circuit (i) supplies a second current when a voltage at the output terminal of the first driving circuit is higher than a reference voltage VREF, and (ii) is in a high impedance state when the voltage is lower than the VREF.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a variable resistance nonvolatile storage device including memory cells each including a selection element and a variable resistance element whose resistance value reversibly changes based on an electrical signal.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, the research and development on nonvolatile storage devices including memory cells using variable resistance elements has been conducted. The variable resistance element is an element having characteristics in which a resistance value reversibly changes based on an electrical signal, and capable of storing data corresponding to the resistance value with nonvolatility.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">What is generally known as a nonvolatile storage device using such variable resistance elements is a nonvolatile storage device including 1T1R memory cells arranged in a matrix. Each of the memory cells includes a MOS transistor and a variable resistance element that are connected in series, at an intersection point between (i) a bit line and (ii) a word line and a source line, where the lines cross at right angles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, in order to further develop integrated circuits, there has been an increase in the research on cross-point nonvolatile storage devices each including diode elements and variable resistance elements that are connected in series, at intersection points between bit lines and word lines that cross at right angles.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">PTL 1 discloses memory cells each including (i) a variable resistance element that stores and holds information according to an electric resistance state and (ii) a circuit element connected in series with the variable resistance element. With application of a voltage and a current to the memory cell, the variable resistance element can have a resistance value that reversibly changes between a low resistance state and a high resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a circuit diagram of a memory cell C used in a storage device disclosed in PTL 1. The memory cell C includes a variable resistance element A and a circuit element T which are electrically connected in series with each other. The variable resistance element A has a structure including a storage layer between two electrodes (for example, upper electrode and lower electrode), and the storage layer includes an amorphous thin film, such as a rare-earth metal oxide film. PTL 1 discloses that the rare-earth metal oxide film comprises metals that can be easily ionized, such as Cu, Ag, and Zn. Furthermore, the circuit element T includes a Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MIS) transistor. The MIS transistor serves as an active element that controls access to the variable resistance element A, with application of a predetermined voltage V<sub>GS </sub>to a gate terminal of the transistor. It also serves as a load device for the variable resistance element A. When the circuit element is in an ON state, the resistance value of the variable resistance element A can be changed with application of a predetermined voltage and a current to end terminals V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b> of the memory cell C.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates changes in voltage and current of the variable resistance element A disclosed in PTL 1. Assuming that the operation of changing resistance of the variable resistance element A from a high resistance state to a low resistance state is a writing operation and the operation of changing resistance of the variable resistance element A from the low resistance state to the high resistance state is an erasing operation, the variable resistance element A initially has a large resistance value and is in a state where current is hard to flow (ST<b>1</b>). Then, with application of a write threshold voltage or higher (+1.1&#xd7;[V]), the current flows and the resistance value is being decreased (ST<b>2</b>). Then, the variable resistance element A exhibits Ohmic characteristics (ST<b>3</b>), and the current flows in proportion to the voltage. Afterward, even when the voltage becomes 0 V, the variable resistance element A continues to hold the low resistance value. Next, when a negative voltage is being applied to the variable resistance element A and the application voltage is being increased, the current decreases with application of an erase threshold voltage (&#x2212;1.1&#xd7;[V]) (ST<b>4</b>). Then, the resistance of the variable resistance element A is changed to resistance as same as that in the erase state. Afterward, even when the voltage becomes 0 V, the variable resistance element A continues to hold the high resistance value (ST<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates changes in an operating point of the variable resistance element A disclosed in PTL 1. The vertical axis represents the current [A] that flows through an MIS transistor T corresponding to the circuit element T and the variable resistance element A, and the horizontal axis represents the voltage [V] that is applied to the MIS transistor T and the variable resistance element A. In the graph, dashed lines represent the voltage/current characteristics when the gate voltage of the MIS transistor T is changed to VG<b>1</b>, VG<b>2</b>, and VG<b>3</b> (VG<b>1</b>&#x3e;VG<b>2</b>&#x3e;VG<b>3</b>), while solid lines represent the voltage/current characteristics of the variable resistance element A in the low and high resistance states. The high resistance state is represented to overlap the horizontal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As indicated by the solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the resistance state of the variable resistance element A is changed from the high resistance state to the low resistance state, with application of the voltage Vth (approximately 0.52 V) between the electrodes of the variable resistance element A by applying the voltage V (1.0 V) between the end terminals V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b> of the memory cell C. Here, the graph indicates that the resistance value of the variable resistance element A is determined according to a value of the current that flows through the variable resistance element A through the MIS transistor T. For example, when the gate voltage is VG<b>1</b>, the current flows up to an operating point P<b>1</b> indicating the highest current. The resistance value calculated based on the relationship between the voltage and the current at the operating point P<b>1</b> is a resistance value of the variable resistance element A in the low resistance state. Similarly, when the gate voltage is VG<b>2</b>, the current flows up to an operating point P<b>2</b> where the resistance state is high. When the gate voltage is VG<b>3</b>, the current flows up to an operating point P<b>3</b> where the resistance state is much higher. Thus, the graph indicates that the resistance values calculated based on the relationship between the voltage and the current at the respective operating points P<b>2</b> and P<b>3</b> are resistance values of the variable resistance element A in the low resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In other words, controlling (i) the voltage to be applied to the end terminals of the memory cell C including the variable resistance element A and the MIS transistor T and (ii) the gate voltage of the MIS transistor T enables controlling of the resistance value of the variable resistance element A in the low resistance state. PTL 1 discloses the storage device capable of recording multi-valued data using this feature.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Next, PTL 2 discloses a storage device that achieves stable operations with application of a uniform voltage to each memory cell in a memory cell array. Between the voltage application circuit that applies a write voltage to the memory cells and the memory cells, long metal lines such as bit lines exist. When the memory cell closer to the voltage application circuit is accessed in the case of performing the writing operation for the low resistance state, the voltage drop caused by the line resistance is small. Thus, a large amount of current can flow, and the resistance state of the memory cell is changed to the low resistance state having a lower resistance value. On the other hand, when the memory cell distant from the voltage application circuit is accessed, the voltage drop caused by the line resistance is large. Thus, the amount of current that flows decreases, and the resistance state of the memory cell is changed to the low resistance state having a resistance value higher than that of the former case.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In other words, PTL 2 suggests the technique to solve the problems that a resistance value in the low resistance state to be written in the memory cell depends on a place where the memory cell is arranged and the uniform operation cannot be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates, as a solution disclosed in PTL 2, a structure including (i) drivers each of which applies a predetermined voltage to a bit line connected to a terminal of another bit line, and (ii) operational amplifiers each of which adjusts the voltage applied by the driver to the bit line by comparing, with a preset voltage, the voltage to be applied to a memory element positioned to the other end of the bit line.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">The inventors of the present application have considered implementation of stable resistance change operations performed by a variable resistance nonvolatile storage device including 1T1R memory cells each including a variable resistance layer comprising a oxygen-deficient transition metal oxide TaO<sub>x </sub>(0&#x3c;x&#x3c;2.5) comprising tantalum (Ta) that is one of transition metals. Here, the oxygen-deficient transition metal oxide is a transition metal oxide having an oxygen content (atom ratio, that is, proportion of the number of oxygen atoms to the total atoms) lower than that of a transition metal oxide having a stoichiometric composition. Generally, the transition metal oxide having the stoichiometric composition includes an insulator or has a very high resistance value. For example, when the transition metal oxide is Ta, the stoichiometric composition is denoted as Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and the ratio of the number of O atoms to the number of Ta atoms (O/Ta) is 2.5. Thus, in the oxygen-deficient transition metal oxide, the ratio of O atoms to Ta atoms is larger than 0 and smaller than 2.5.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">First, several features of a variable resistance element that were obtained from measurements will be described hereinafter. The variable resistance element includes a variable resistance layer comprising an oxygen-deficient Ta oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a basic structure of a 1T1R memory cell <b>102</b> in which a variable resistance element <b>100</b> is connected in series with a selection transistor <b>101</b> that is a first switch element. The variable resistance element <b>100</b> includes a lower electrode (first electrode) <b>103</b> comprising TaN, an upper electrode (second electrode) <b>105</b> comprising Pt, and a variable resistance layer <b>104</b> comprising TaO<sub>x </sub>that is the oxygen-deficient transition metal oxide. The lower electrode <b>103</b> of the variable resistance element <b>100</b> is connected to one of diffusion layer terminals (for example, drain terminal) of the selection transistor <b>101</b>, the other diffusion layer terminal (for example, source terminal) is led out as a PD terminal of the memory cell <b>102</b>, the upper electrode <b>105</b> is led out as a PU terminal of the memory cell <b>102</b>, and the gate terminal of the selection transistor <b>101</b> is led out as a PG terminal of the memory cell <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">The inventors have clarified in their research that under the structure, the variable resistance layer <b>104</b> can be set to a high resistance state with application of a positive voltage to the upper electrode <b>105</b> with respect to the lower electrode <b>103</b>, and the variable resistance layer <b>104</b> can be set to a low resistance state with application of a positive voltage to the lower electrode <b>103</b> with respect to the upper electrode <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">Thus, respective resistance values can be set as follows. A method of setting a predetermined resistance state to the memory cell <b>102</b> is applying a write voltage that enables turning on the selection transistor <b>101</b>, to the PG terminal of the memory cell <b>102</b>. A method of setting the high resistance state to the memory cell <b>102</b> is applying a high resistance voltage Vph to the PU terminal with respect to the PD terminal of the memory cell <b>102</b>. A method of setting the low resistance state to the memory cell <b>102</b> is applying a low resistance voltage Vpl to the PD terminal with respect to the PU terminal of the memory cell <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">A method of reading the resistance state of the memory cell <b>102</b> is applying a read voltage that enables turning on the selection transistor <b>101</b>, to the PG terminal of the memory cell <b>102</b>, then applying a low read voltage Vpr low enough to prevent data from being written, between the PD terminal and the PU terminal of the memory cell <b>102</b>, and measuring a memory cell current Ir that flows through the memory cell <b>102</b>. Thereby, the resistance value of the memory cell <b>102</b> can be calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of a result of evaluation on the memory cell read current Ir that has been read after changing the resistance state of the memory cell <b>102</b>. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a result of applying, to a representative memory cell of 1 bit, a pulse for the high resistance state and a pulse for the low resistance state alternately 200 times, and measuring the memory cell current Ir for each application of the pulse. The vertical axis represents the memory cell current Ir [&#x3bc;A] that flows through the memory cell <b>102</b>, and the horizontal axis represents the number of measurements. The pulses applied for changing the resistance state have a pulse width of 50 ns. The PG terminal is set to 2.4 V, and the voltages to be applied between the PD terminal and the PU terminal are alternately switched between 0 V and 2.4 V. Furthermore, the memory cell current Ir was measured under the same condition with application of 2.4 V to the PG terminal, 0 V to the PU terminal, and 0.4 V to the PD terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">Table 1 below is a summary of the result, indicating (i) each average of the memory cell currents Ir with application of the pulse for the high resistance state 200 times, or the pulse for the low resistance state 200 times, and (ii) each difference between the largest value and the smallest value as variations in the memory cell currents Ir.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0025">When the memory cell <b>102</b> was in the high resistance state, approximately 0.93 [&#x3bc;A] that is the average of the memory cell currents Ir flowed, which indicates that there was almost no current flow. When the memory cell <b>102</b> was in the low resistance state, approximately 44.0 [&#x3bc;A] that is the average of the memory cell currents Ir flowed. Thus, the high resistance state and the low resistance state are clearly distinguished from each other. Focusing on &#x394;Ir (largest value&#x2212;smallest value) of the memory cell current Ir, &#x394;Ir in the high resistance state was 2.0 [&#x3bc;A], while &#x394;Ir in the low resistance state was 9.2 [&#x3bc;A]. Thus, it was found that the difference irregularly varies with a predetermined width, regardless of repeated operations on the same memory cell <b>102</b> under the same condition.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">Since the memory cell current Ir had the measurement error as small as 0.2 [&#x3bc;A], variations in the memory cell current Ir (&#x394;Ir) are probably not caused by the precision of the measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">Furthermore, PTL 1 discloses that the resistance value of a variable resistance element is determined according to a current value of a current supplied by a transistor in the low resistance state. Assuming that the variations are caused by variations in the current supplied by the transistor, it indicates that the characteristics of the selection transistor <b>101</b> vary approximately 10% for each resistance change. However, since MOS transistors have been conventionally known as very stable elements, it seems unlikely that characteristics of the transistors vary for each switching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">Moreover, PTL 2 discloses that write states vary due to a voltage drop caused by a line resistance component depending on arrangement of memory cells. However, the aforementioned measurements obtained the variations in the same memory cell, and the line resistance was maintained constant. Thus, the variations were caused due to a factor different from that of PTL 2.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">As a result of the keen examination, the inventors estimated that the variations in the memory cell current Ir after the resistance change in the same memory cell were not caused by a conventionally known factor, but the variable resistance characteristics of the variable resistance element <b>100</b> itself varied within a certain range for each resistance change.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">In a memory device using the magnitude of a memory cell current as storage information, the smallest value of the memory cell current limits the reading speed, in particular, when the memory device is in the low resistance state. In addition, a difference between the smallest value of the memory cell current when the memory device is in the low resistance state and the largest value of the memory cell current when the memory device is in the high resistance state substantially affects the operating margin.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">Considering operations performed by a memory cell array that is a collection of memory cells, the inventors have found that the reading speed further slows down and the operating margin further decreases, due to variations that have been conventionally known, such as variations caused by a difference in arrangement of memory cells as disclosed by PTL 2 and various variations in the processes, such as a threshold Vt of a selection transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">The present invention has been conceived in view of such circumstances, and has an object of providing a variable resistance nonvolatile storage device that includes memory cells each including a variable resistance element and a selection element (switch element), in particular, a variable resistance nonvolatile storage device that reduces variations in resistance value of the variable resistance element in its low resistance state and that performs stable operations.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">In order to achieve the object, the variable resistance nonvolatile storage device according to an aspect of the present invention is a variable resistance nonvolatile storage device including: a memory cell array including memory cells arranged in a matrix, each of the memory cells including a variable resistance element and a first switch element connected in series with the variable resistance element, the variable resistance element including (i) a first electrode, (ii) a second electrode, and (iii) a nonvolatile variable resistance layer disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode, the nonvolatile variable resistance layer having a resistance state that reversibly changes between a high resistance state and a low resistance state according to a polarity of a voltage to be applied between the first electrode and the second electrode; a selection circuit that selects at least one of the memory cells from the memory cell array; a high-resistance-state write circuit that applies a voltage to the memory cell selected by the selection circuit so as to change a resistance state of the variable resistance element included in the selected memory cell, from the low resistance state to the high resistance state by applying a positive voltage to the second electrode of the variable resistance element with respect to the first electrode of the variable resistance element; and a low-resistance-state write circuit that applies a voltage to the memory cell selected by the selection circuit so as to change the resistance state of the variable resistance element from the high resistance state to the low resistance state by applying a positive voltage to the first electrode with respect to the second electrode, wherein the low-resistance-state write circuit includes a first driving circuit and a second driving circuit both of which apply the voltage to the memory cell, the first driving circuit having an output terminal connected to an output terminal of the second driving circuit, the first driving circuit supplies a first current when the low-resistance-state write circuit applies the voltage to the memory cell, and the second driving circuit (i) supplies a second current when a voltage at the output terminal of the first driving circuit is higher than a predetermined first reference voltage, and (ii) is in a high impedance state when the voltage at the output terminal of the first driving circuit is lower than the first reference voltage, in the case where the low-resistance-state write circuit applies the voltage to the memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">Alternatively, the variable resistance nonvolatile storage device according to another aspect of the present invention is a variable resistance nonvolatile storage device including: a memory cell array including memory cells arranged in a matrix, each of the memory cells including a variable resistance element and a first switch element connected in series with the variable resistance element, the variable resistance element including (i) a first electrode, (ii) a second electrode, and (iii) a nonvolatile variable resistance layer disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode, the nonvolatile variable resistance layer having a resistance state that reversibly changes between a high resistance state and a low resistance state according to a polarity of a voltage to be applied between the first electrode and the second electrode; a selection circuit that selects at least one of the memory cells from the memory cell array; a high-resistance-state write circuit that applies a voltage to the memory cell selected by the selection circuit so as to change a resistance state of the variable resistance element included in the selected memory cell, from the low resistance state to the high resistance state by applying a positive voltage to the second electrode of the variable resistance element with respect to the first electrode of the variable resistance element; and a low-resistance-state write circuit that applies a voltage to the memory cell selected by the selection circuit so as to change the resistance state of the variable resistance element from the high resistance state to the low resistance state by applying a positive voltage to the first electrode with respect to the second electrode, wherein the low-resistance-state write circuit has (i) except for a part of an area, load characteristics in which an output current monotonically decreases according to increase in an output voltage, and (ii) in the part of the area, load characteristics in which the output current increases according to increase in the output voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">Thereby, the output VI characteristics (load characteristics) of a low resistance state write circuit are represented by a curve such that the output current increases when an output voltage higher than the first reference voltage is supplied. Thereby, setting a voltage for changing the resistance state of a variable resistance element to the low resistance state as the first reference voltage reduces variations in the current that flows when the variable resistance element is changed to the low resistance state. As a result, variations in the resistance value of the variable resistance element that has been changed to the low resistance state can be suppressed.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">The nonvolatile storage device including memory cells each including a variable resistance element and a selection element (switch element) is provided with the technique enabling (i) suppression of variations in the resistance value of the variable resistance element when the memory cells are in the low resistance state and (ii) securing of a resistance change window (difference in resistance value between the high resistance state and the low resistance state of the variable resistance element) at a maximum. In other words, it is possible to implement the variable resistance nonvolatile storage device in which the resistance change state of the variable resistance element can be stabilized, and which can support increase in the reading speed of the memory cells and improve the yield.</p>

<p id="h-0011" num="0000">[Basic Data of the Variable Resistance Nonvolatile Storage Device According to the Present Invention]</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">As an introduction, the following will describe basic data from which a new phenomenon relating to a variable resistance element that is a basis of the present invention has been uncovered.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">First, when a resistance change operation for changing the resistance state of the variable resistance layer <b>104</b> from the high resistance state to the low resistance state was repeatedly performed using the 1T1R memory cell <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, variations in resistance change voltage were measured.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a flowchart of the measurements, and the procedure divided into Steps S<b>0</b> to S<b>5</b> will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">Step S<b>0</b> is an initial step of the measurements. N denotes a count parameter indicating a repeat count of resistance changes, and VLG denotes a gate voltage parameter of a voltage value VPG to be provided to the PG terminal that is a gate of the selection transistor <b>101</b>. Initially, N is set to 0, and VLG is set to a predetermined voltage value. Here, although the initial value of VLG is 2.4 V, the value may be any gate voltage as long as the selection transistor <b>101</b> is sufficiently in an ON state with application of a voltage that can sufficiently write, between the PU and PD terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">Next, writing for the high resistance state is performed at Step S<b>1</b>. More specifically, pulses with a pulse width of 50 ns are applied with an amplitude of VPG=2.4 V to the PG terminal that is the gate of the selection transistor <b>101</b>, with an amplitude of 1.8 V to the PU terminal, and with an amplitude of 0 V to the PD terminal. Here, the voltages of 1.8V and VPG=2.4V to be applied between the PU terminal and the PD terminal are examples of voltages that can sufficiently set the variable resistance element <b>100</b> to the high resistance state. Next, a current value IHR is measured as a memory cell current when the memory cell <b>120</b> is in the high resistance state, with application of 1.8 V to the PG terminal, 0.4 V to the PU terminal, and 0 V to the PD terminal, and the current value IHR is recorded. Here, the voltage 0.4 V to be applied between the PU and PD terminals is a voltage that does not cause any resistance change, regardless of the resistance state of the variable resistance element <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">Next, writing for the low resistance state is performed at Step S<b>2</b>. More specifically, pulses with a pulse width of 50 ns are applied with an amplitude of a voltage specified by the gate voltage parameter VLG to the PG terminal that is the gate of the selection transistor <b>101</b>, with an amplitude of 0 V to the PU terminal, and with an amplitude of 1.8 V to the PD terminal. In other words, the pulses reverse to the polarity for the high resistance state are applied between the PU terminal and the PD terminal. Subsequently, a current value ILR is measured as a memory cell current when the memory cell <b>120</b> is in the low resistance state, with application of 1.8 V to the PG terminal, 0.4 V to the PU terminal, and 0 V to the PD terminal, and the current value ILR is recorded. Here, the memory cell current is measured under the same condition as the measurement for the high resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">Next, the write state to the memory cell <b>102</b> is determined at Step S<b>3</b>. When a difference between the memory cell current value ILR after writing for the low resistance state and the memory cell current value IHR after writing for the high resistance state is not smaller than 5 &#x3bc;A, it is determined at Step S<b>2</b> that the resistance state is changed to the low resistance state, and otherwise, it is determined that the resistance state is not changed to the low resistance state. After the count parameter N is incremented by 1, Steps S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> are iterated 50 times from Step S<b>1</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">Next, the other determination to be iterated is performed at Step S<b>4</b>. After the 50 iterations of Step S<b>3</b> (N=50), a voltage value of the gate voltage parameter VLG of the voltage value to be provided to the PG terminal that is the gate of the selection transistor <b>101</b> is decreased by 0.01 V, and the count parameter N is initialized (N=0). Again, Steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>3</b> are similarly iterated. When the gate voltage parameter VLG reaches 1.1 V, the measurements end at Step S<b>5</b>. Here, VLG=1.1 V is a gate voltage such that the resistance of the selection transistor <b>101</b> increases, and is a voltage with which the variable resistance element <b>100</b> is not set to the low resistance state at all.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a result of measurements on a representative memory cell of 1 bit, according to the procedure indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A region closer to where resistance change occurred with application of VPG=1.6 V to 2.1 V was plotted. The horizontal axis represents the voltage VPG at the gate terminal PG of the selection transistor <b>101</b>, and the vertical axis represents the low resistance state determination rate obtained by dividing, by 50 that is the number of trials, the number of times it was determined that the resistance state has been changed to the low resistance state at Step S<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When the voltage VPG at the gate terminal PG was lower than 1.7 V, no behavior for the low resistance state occurred. However, the resistance state was gradually changed to the low resistance state with application of 1.7 V or a higher voltage. With application of 1.9 V or a higher voltage, the resistance state was completely changed to the low resistance state. In other words, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> indicates the probabilistic presence of one of states in the same memory cell with application of the predetermined voltage VPG within a voltage range of 1.7 V to 1.9 V to the gate terminal PG. One of the states is a resistance state which is either changed to the low resistance state or maintained at the high resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">The physical phenomena will be briefly discussed hereinafter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an equivalent circuit diagram of the memory cell <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The illustrated memory cell <b>112</b> includes the variable resistance element <b>110</b> and the selection transistor <b>111</b> that are connected in series with each other. The arrow illustrated on the symbol of the variable resistance element <b>110</b> indicates a direction of a voltage to be applied for changing the resistance state to the high resistance state. In other words, the resistance state of the variable resistance element <b>110</b> is changed to the high resistance state with application of a positive voltage to the terminal PU with respect to a node N<b>1</b> (conversely, the resistance state is changed to the low resistance state with application of a negative voltage).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">When the low resistance state is written at Step S<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, 1.8 V is applied to the PD terminal and 0 V is applied to the PU terminal, as pulses. The resistance state is changed to the low resistance state when voltages at both ends of the variable resistance element <b>110</b> reach a predetermined voltage (hereinafter denoted as a low resistance change voltage VR). The voltage to be applied to the variable resistance element <b>110</b> through the selection transistor <b>111</b> (voltage at the node N<b>1</b>) is controlled by a voltage at the PG terminal that is the gate of the selection transistor <b>111</b>. Assuming the threshold voltage of the selection transistor <b>111</b> as VT (approximately 1.0 V), 1.8 V is applied to the PD terminal. Since the potential of the node N<b>1</b> that is a source potential of the selection transistor <b>111</b> becomes higher than the substrate potential, up to the voltage (VPG&#x2212;VT) is applied to the node N<b>1</b> with the substrate bias effect.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">The phenomenon that the resistance state is changed to the low resistance state with application of the predetermined voltage VPG to the gate terminal PG that is the gate terminal of the selection transistor <b>101</b> can be approximated by the following equations.
<br/>

</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">In the measurement result in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the voltage VPG at the PG terminal with which the resistance state is changed to the low resistance state is distributed between 1.7 V and 1.9 V inclusive approximately with a 0.2 V difference. Since the characteristics of transistors have been conventionally well known as very stable, it seems unlikely that the same transistor has such large variations in the threshold voltage VT with the 0.2 V difference for each operation. Thus, it is probable that the low resistance change voltage VR of the variable resistance element <b>110</b> varies between 0.7 V and 0.9 V approximately with the 0.2 V difference. As described above, the inventors have found the phenomenon, which has not been conventionally uncovered, that the low resistance change voltage VR varies even in the same variable resistance element <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">Next, the problem that such variations in resistance change voltage affects the resistance change characteristics will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">Here, the operation for changing the resistance state to the low resistance state with application of a pulse voltage of 2.4 V to the PG terminal, a pulse voltage of 1.8 V to the PD terminal, and a pulse voltage of 0 V to the PU terminal will be discussed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an operating point analysis diagram for describing operating points of the variable resistance element <b>110</b> and the selection transistor <b>111</b> when the resistance state of the memory cell <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is changed from the high resistance state to the low resistance state. The horizontal axis represents the voltage at the node N<b>1</b> between the variable resistance element <b>110</b> and the selection transistor <b>111</b> of the memory cell <b>112</b>, and the vertical axis represents the memory cell write current that flows between the PD terminal and the PU terminal of the memory cell <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">The characteristics (1) of the selection transistor <b>111</b> are represented by a load curve. The load curve indicates the current that flows through the selection transistor <b>111</b>, that is, the current that flows between the PD terminal and the node N<b>1</b>, when 2.4 V is applied to the PG terminal, 1.8 V is applied to the PD terminal, and the voltage at the node N<b>1</b> is changed from 0 V to 1.8 V. The characteristics (2) when the variable resistance element <b>110</b> is in the high resistance state are also represented by a load line. The load line indicates the current that flows through the variable resistance element <b>110</b>, that is, the current that flows between the PU terminal and the node N<b>1</b>, when 0 V is applied to the PU terminal and the voltage at the node N<b>1</b> is changed from 0 V to 1.8 V. Since the selection transistor <b>111</b> is connected in series with the variable resistance element <b>110</b>, a point A at which the currents that flow through the selection transistor <b>111</b> and the variable resistance element <b>110</b> are equal is an operating point when the variable resistance element <b>110</b> is in the high resistance state. The characteristics (3) when the variable resistance element <b>110</b> is in the low resistance state are also represented by load lines. When voltages at both ends of the variable resistance element <b>110</b> reach the low resistance change voltage VR, the resistance value of the variable resistance element <b>110</b> is determined according to the current value of the current that flows through the selection transistor <b>111</b>. In other words, a point B in the operating point analysis diagram is a point at which the currents that flow through the selection transistor <b>111</b> and the variable resistance element <b>110</b> are balanced. The slope of the load line at the point B is the resistance value of the variable resistance element <b>110</b> in the low resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">Here, the case where the low resistance change voltage VR of the variable resistance element <b>110</b> varies will be discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">An operating point B&#x2032; corresponds to an operating point when the low resistance change voltage VR is the smallest, and an operating point B&#x2033; corresponds to an operating point when the low resistance change voltage VR is the largest. The slope of the load line at the operating point B&#x2032; is steeper than that at the operating point B (that is, in a lower resistance state), and the slope of the load line at the operating point B&#x2033; is more gradual than that at the operating point B (that is, in a higher resistance state).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">In other words, when the low resistance change voltage VR of the variable resistance element <b>110</b> varies, the operating points of the selection transistor <b>111</b> and the variable resistance element <b>110</b> have a point of intersection on a load line with a slope steeper than that in the case where the variable resistance element <b>110</b> is in the high resistance state. Thus, the resistance value in a low resistance state to occur significantly varies.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0080">For example, resistance values of 1.7 k&#x3a9; to 3.0 k&#x3a9; are calculated as the low resistance values to be generated under assumption that a pulse voltage of 2.4 V is applied to the PG terminal that is the gate, a pulse voltage of 1.8 V is applied to the PD terminal, and the low resistance change voltage VR of the variable resistance element <b>110</b> varies between 0.7 V (corresponding to the voltage at the operating point B&#x2032;) and 0.9 V (corresponding to the voltage at the operating point B&#x2033;) inclusive. Thus, the variations range approximately as large as 1.8 times under the assumption. This implies problems, such as reduction in the reading speed and significant obstruction to stable memory operations.</p>

The slope of the characteristics was large, and the amplitude of the memory cell write current was approximately 100 &#x3bc;A between the operating points B&#x2032; and B&#x2033;, which was larger than the variations in the low resistance change voltage VR. In contrast, since the variable resistance nonvolatile storage device <b>200</b> in the present invention limits the driving current supplied from the LR write circuit <b>500</b> rather than the driving current supplied from the selection transistor N<b>00</b> and others (that is, the impedance of the selection transistor N<b>00</b> in the ON state is lower than the output impedance of the LR write circuit <b>500</b>), the LR write circuit <b>500</b> determines the voltage and the current to be applied to the variable resistance element R<b>00</b> and others.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0135">More specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the load characteristics (1) of the first driving circuit <b>510</b> indicate that the driving current increases as the voltage at the node N<b>1</b> decreases, although the change in the slope representing the current becomes smaller around the low resistance change voltage VR than the change in the voltage.

Here, the first reference voltage VREF<b>1</b> generated by the first reference voltage generation circuit <b>230</b> is set so that the potential at the node N<b>1</b> has an inflection point around the low resistance change voltage VR=0.8 V. In other words, when a voltage at the node N<b>1</b> is 1.8 V, the current supplied from the second driving circuit <b>520</b> (that is, a second current) is 0 A. When a voltage at the node N<b>1</b> is smaller than 1.8 V, the second current gradually increases. When a voltage at the node N<b>1</b> is 1.8 V, the second driving circuit <b>520</b> supplies the current (the second current) of approximately 18 &#x3bc;A.

Thus, although the high resistance state of the variable resistance element R<b>00</b> is represented by a point C in the operating point analysis diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the operating point C when the resistance state is changed from the high resistance state to the low resistance state moves to a point D where the current flowing through the variable resistance element R<b>00</b> matches the current flowing through the LR write circuit <b>500</b>. The slope of the load line (RmL) of the variable resistance element R<b>00</b> at the point D is the resistance value in the low resistance state.

When the voltage at the output terminal WDL<b>1</b> is lower than the threshold voltage VTH, the second driving circuit <b>560</b> is in the high impedance state. One of two main terminals of the PMOS <b>660</b> (source terminal) is connected to a power source (for example, the power source for LR writing <b>220</b>), and the other main terminal (drain terminal) is connected to one of input terminals of the two-input NAND <b>661</b> (for example, a second input terminal) and is connected to an output terminal WDL<b>2</b> of the second driving circuit <b>560</b>.

<p id="p-0183" num="0183">Although the variable resistance nonvolatile storage device according to the present invention is described based on Embodiments 1 to 3, the present invention is not limited to Embodiments. Many modifications of the exemplary Embodiments conceivable by those skilled in the art, and other embodiments conceivable by arbitrarily combining the structural elements and/or steps of different embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention, without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0184">For example, the LR write circuit <b>500</b> includes the two driving circuits (first driving circuit <b>510</b> and second driving circuit <b>520</b>) according to Embodiment 1, and the LR write circuit <b>500</b><i>a </i>includes the three driving circuits (first driving circuit <b>510</b>, second driving circuit <b>540</b>, and third driving circuit <b>550</b>) according to Embodiment 2.

The combined load characteristics of a whole LR write circuit may be set by the combined use of any number of driving circuits having load characteristics with different inflection points so that variations in a current that flows through a memory cell is smaller than variations in the low resistance change voltage VR. Thereby, variations in a resistance value of a variable resistance element in the low resistance state can be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0185">Furthermore, the LR write circuit according to the present invention may be implemented as an LR write circuit (low-resistance-state write circuit) physically using one driving circuit, as the LR write circuit <b>500</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The LR write circuit <b>500</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is electrically equivalent to a circuit including the first driving circuit <b>510</b> and the second driving circuit <b>520</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In other words, as long as the LR write circuit according to the present invention is a driver, the LR write circuit is not affected by the physical number of driving circuits included the driver. Here, the driver has load characteristics in which the output current increases according to increase in the output voltage when the voltage to be applied to a variable resistance element whose resistance state is changed to the low resistance state falls within the variations in the low resistance change voltage VR.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0186">In other words, the nonvolatile storage device according to the present invention has only to include an LR write circuit having the combined load characteristics (output VI characteristics) indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, and is not limited to a nonvolatile storage device including a particular LR write circuit. Here, the horizontal axis and the vertical axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> respectively represent an output voltage and an output current from the LR write circuit according to the present invention. In other words, the horizontal axis (output voltage of the LR write circuit) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is different from the horizontal axis (voltage at the node N<b>1</b> between a variable resistance element and a selection transistor) in each of the operating point analysis diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>14</b>, and <b>16</b>.

<p id="p-0187" num="0187">Although the LR write circuit having such characteristics has (1) load characteristics (see &#x201c;(i)&#x201d; indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) in which the output current (vertical axis) monotonically decreases according to increase in the output voltage (horizontal axis) as a whole (except for a part of an area), it has (2) load characteristics (see (ii) indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) in which the output current monotonically increases (or monotonically decreases with a decreasing degree smaller than the whole monotonically decreasing degree) according to increase in the output voltage, in the part of an area, that is, within a voltage range when a voltage to be applied to a variable resistance element whose resistance state is changed to the low resistance state falls within variations in the low resistance change voltage VR. Here, desirably, the degree of a slope representing the monotonous increase substantially matches (or is closer to) the degree of a slope of the load characteristics (that is, the line sloping upward and passing the origin point of the output VI characteristics and the part of the area) of the variable resistance element in the low resistance state. The variable resistance element having such load characteristics satisfies &#x394;V/&#x394;I within a range of variations in the low resistance change voltage VR (&#x201c;Variations in VR&#x201d; as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>), that is, has substantially a fixed resistance value when the variable resistance element is in the low resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0188">A method of implementing the non-linear combined load characteristics is to combine (1) a current from a driver having the load characteristics A of monotonically decreasing and (2) an output current from a driver having the load characteristics B such that the current is supplied when a voltage to be applied to a variable resistance element falls within variations in the low resistance change voltage VR (or a part of the range) and that the current is not supplied when the voltage is smaller than the variations (alternatively, such that the driver is in the high impedance state).</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0189">Furthermore, although the write circuits <b>206</b>, <b>206</b><i>a</i>, and <b>206</b><i>b </i>drive the bit lines in the description of Embodiments according to the present invention, they may be placed so as to drive source lines.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0190">Furthermore, although the 1T1R memory cells are mainly described in Embodiments, the resistance change in the memory cells occurs in variable resistance elements included therein. Thus, a storage device which is composed of only a variable resistance element may be targeted for application to a fuse element and others, and may have the same characteristics as the 1T1R memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0191">Furthermore, although the 1T1R memory cells using the NMOS transistors as the selection elements (switch elements) are described, the selection elements may be PMOS transistors, or may be CMOS transistors using both the NMOS transistors and the PMOS transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0192">Obviously, the same methods and circuits described above are applicable to memory cells in each of which a variable resistance element is connected in series with a rectifier cell (bidirectional diode or the like).</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0193" num="0193">As described above, the variable resistance nonvolatile storage device according to the present invention can stabilize the low resistance state, using the methods and the circuits which allow maximizing of a resistance change window for changing the resistance state of memory cells using variable resistance elements that are included in the variable resistance nonvolatile storage device, between the low resistance state and the high resistance state. Thus, it is useful to support increase in the reading speed and stabilization of the memory cells, and further to improve the yield. Alternatively, the variable resistance nonvolatile storage device may be useful as a state storage circuit instead of a fuse element.</p>
