<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention pertains to food processing appliances and devices, and more particularly pertains to a heated mixer having heating and warming elements that are incorporated and integrated with the blades of the mixer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the primary factors and steps in the cooking and baking process for any food ingredient or food item is to make certain that the food ingredient or food item has been brought up to room temperature, and then after it has been brought to room temperature to mix it to obtain the appropriate consistency and texture. Because of their ease of use and ubiquity microwave ovens are the device most commonly used to warm frozen or cold food items to room temperature. However, microwave ovens are not the best or most efficient means to warm frozen or cold food items as they work by heating the food item from the inside out at extremely high temperatures (microwave ovens cause the water molecules in all food items to vibrate at almost 2500 million times a second thereby causing the food item to absorb energy and quickly heat). Because of the very high heat produced by microwave ovens, one must carefully monitor the warming and heating of the food item so that the food item isn't overheated and ruined. This concern also applies to warming up food ingredients such as mixes, butter, margarine, cream cheese, etc., food ingredients that may come in blocks, sticks, or pads and which require warming and partial softening for use. Thus, a more efficient way to warm up and soften food items and ingredients is desired that considerably shortens to time period of food item warm up and also does not ruin the food item or ingredient by destroying the natural consistency and texture of the food item or ingredient. Thus, the prior art discloses a range of devices that pertain to mixers, and not microwave ovens, for warming and softening food items and food ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, the Jensen Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 1,692,270) discloses an apparatus for treating liquids that includes an electrically energized heating element that is carried through a tubular metallic member.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The Willat et al. Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 1,845,692) discloses a liquid heating and circulating device for immersion in a liquid such as oil for heating and circulating the liquid that is stored in a vessel not readily adaptable for external heat application.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The Galajda, Jr. Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 3,109,913) discloses an electrically heated mixing service that combines a heating function with a mixing function that applies heat from the heating element to the shaft and consequently through the agitator blades of the mixer. The Cairclli Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 3,586,819) discloses a combination of food mixer and heater includes both beater elements and separate heating elements extending outwardly from the housing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The Cairelli Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 3,589,834) discloses a helical blade mixer that includes helical intenneshing blades on each shaft and a heating device that is used in conjunction with the helical blades of the mixer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The Duncan et al. Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 5,368,384) discloses a hand-held mixing device with a heating element in the form of a coil surrounding the blade of the mixer. Nonetheless, despite the ingenuity of the above devices, there remains a need for a mixer having heated mixing blades that warm and soften foods for enhanced food preparation and cooking.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention comprehends a heated mixer having electric heating elements wrapped about the mixing blades and protectively coated with a heat conductive material for warming and bringing to room temperature various types of food items and ingredients thereby enhancing the cooking, baking, and food preparation process.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, the present invention includes a mixer of any conventional type with the mixer having a body that includes a handle or hand gripping portion for holding the mixer adjacent a bowl, pot, saucepan, etc. At least two beaters are removably attachable to mounting receptacles located on the underside of the mixer, and each beater includes at least two mixing blades. Each beater includes an electrical heating adapter having a pair of electrical contacts projecting therefrom for engaging corresponding electrical contacts located within the mounting receptacle thereby completing a circuit so that heat can be conveyed to the entire beater. The mixing blades of the beaters interleave and overlap each other so that they continuously mIX food items and ingredients during their operation. Also located at the base of each beater is a protective disc against which the individual can place his or her hand when attaching the beaters to the mounting receptacles located on the underside of the mixer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Extending alongside the stem or arm and about the external surface of the mixing blades of each beater is a heating element such as an electrical lead or wiring. The heating element is electrically connected to the respective electrical contacts of the electric heating adapter at the base of each beater. The external surface of the beaters is covered or coated with a readily heat conductive material such as a ceramic coating thereby completely covering the heating element. To provide for a more specific warming and heating of any food item or ingredient, the mixer can include a three position-heating switch that includes a low heat position, a medium heat position, and a high heat position. An electrical converter within the mixer regulates the amperage/voltage to the electrical heating adapter and thence to the heating elements thereby preventing the mixer from overheating and also preventing a drain on power that would inhibit the proper operation of the beaters.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a mixer that allows heat in a controlled manner to conduct to the mixing blades of each beater for warming up cold foods.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is another object of the present invention to provide a mixer that includes heated mixing blades for warming cold food to room temperature in minutes instead of hours.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a mixer with heated beaters that significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to prepare the key ingredients of a dish or meal before baking.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is still yet another object of the present invention to provide a mixer that is ideal for warming up and softening such food items as butter, margarine, cream cheese, and solid chocolate.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a mixer that provides an alternative to microwave heating wherein the heated mixing blades of the beaters do not cook the food item from the inside out which alters the texture and consistency of the food item and oftentimes ruins the texture and taste of the food item.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a mixer with heated beaters that don't cook the food items and food ingredients but gradually warm and soften the food items and food ingredients thereby producing a smooth and creamy texture.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another object of the present invention is to provide a mixer with heated beaters for making the baking process easier and more convenient and ultimately saving the individual valuable time in today's hurried world.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a perusal of the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing figures and appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref> is a mixer <b>10</b> that includes heating and warming elements for warming all types of food items and ingredients that are cold and which need to be brought to room temperature in a relatively short time period (minutes in contrast to the hours it would take if the food items and ingredients are allowed to warmup on their own). Warming elements <b>38</b> of the present invention are incorporated with beaters <b>20</b> of mixer <b>10</b> for accelerating the food preparation and processing time, and do not adversely affect the quality (texture, taste, consistency) of the food items or ingredients as often occurs when warming and heating food items in the microwave.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thus, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> is standard mixer <b>10</b> that includes a body portion <b>12</b>, an electrical plug <b>52</b>, an on/off switch <b>48</b>, and a multi-position speed control switch <b>46</b> (shown in the schematic <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 4A</figref>). A power source such as a motor <b>14</b> is encased within body of mixer <b>10</b>, and mixer <b>10</b> includes an underside <b>16</b> having at least two protrusions <b>18</b>. A pair of beaters <b>20</b> is removably attachable to respective mounting receptacles <b>19</b> located on protrusions <b>18</b>. Each beater <b>20</b> includes a base <b>22</b>, a stem or arm <b>24</b> and at least one pair of mixing blades <b>26</b> that are disposed at an angle usually equal to or less than 90&#xb0; to each other. Each mixing blade <b>26</b> includes an inner end <b>28</b> and an opposite distal end <b>30</b>. When mixing and processing food items and products most of the surface area of blades <b>26</b> are submerged or immersed in the food item or product. Located at base <b>22</b> is a protective disc <b>32</b> that the individual can push against when mounting beaters <b>20</b> to mounting receptacles <b>19</b> of protrusions <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b>, each beater <b>20</b> includes an electric heating adapter <b>34</b> for regulating electric current, and protruding from electric heating adapter <b>34</b> is a pair of electrical contacts <b>36</b> (positive and negative). Electrical contacts <b>36</b> engage contacts located within mounting receptacles <b>19</b> of protrusions <b>18</b> of mixer <b>10</b> when beaters <b>20</b> are attached to mixer <b>10</b> for completing an electrical circuit so that heat can be conveyed and distributed to arms <b>24</b> and mixing blades <b>26</b> of beaters <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 2</figref><i>b</i>, mixer <b>10</b> includes a warming element <b>38</b> that runs along arms <b>24</b> and mixing blades <b>26</b> of each beater <b>20</b> and essentially wraps about arms <b>24</b> and mixing blades <b>26</b> in a cylindrical or coiled manner. Warming element <b>38</b> of the preferred embodiment is an electrical lead or wiring, and a second lead or wiring can also extend and wrap about arm <b>24</b> and mixing blades <b>26</b> of each beater <b>20</b>. Warming elements <b>38</b> are electrically connected to electrical contacts <b>36</b> via the electric warming adapter <b>34</b> located at base <b>22</b> of each beater <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in another embodiment, mixer <b>10</b> includes warming elements <b>38</b> and <b>39</b>, where element <b>38</b> runs along arm <b>24</b> and along oppositely disposed mixing blades <b>26</b> of each beater <b>20</b>, and warming element <b>39</b> runs along the second pair of oppositely disposed mixing blades <b>26</b> of each beater <b>20</b>, thereby essentially wrapping around all arms <b>24</b> and mixing blades <b>26</b> in a coiled manner.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In order to protect warming elements <b>38</b>, and to more efficiently distribute or convey heat therefrom to whatever food item or food ingredient the mixing blades <b>26</b> are immersed in, heating element <b>38</b> is embedded within, coated and covered by a heat conductive coating <b>40</b> which may be a dipped insulation material or a ceramic coating material. In the preferred embodiment dipping material nylon <b>11</b> powder coating is used for heat conductive coating <b>40</b>. Heat conductive coating <b>40</b> adheres to external surfaces of mixing blades <b>26</b> to produce a long lasting, chip and peel resistant coating or covering.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Heat conductive coating <b>40</b> must be able to tolerate and readily conduct heat as well as to completely cover warming elements <b>38</b> so that warming elements <b>38</b> are not exposed which would cause a safety problem and hazard. In one representative method of manufacture, warming elements <b>38</b> are wrapped about arms <b>24</b> and mixing blades <b>26</b> and then beaters <b>20</b> are completely submerged in and by the nylon, ceramic or other coating material up to the area adjacent base <b>22</b> and disc <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows warming elements <b>38</b> as exposed and extending about arms <b>24</b> and mixing blades <b>26</b> of both beaters <b>20</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>show warming elements <b>38</b> extending about arms <b>24</b> and mixing blades <b>26</b> and covered by the heat conductive coating <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a representative electrical schematic <b>42</b> for warming elements <b>38</b> that extend about arms <b>24</b> and blades <b>26</b> of beaters <b>20</b>. A power converter <b>44</b> is interconnected to the prime mover&#x2014;motor <b>14</b>&#x2014;of mixer <b>10</b> for regulating amperage/voltage to electric heating adapter <b>34</b> and thence to warming elements <b>38</b>. In addition, mixer <b>10</b> can include a multi-position speed control switch <b>46</b>, such as a three position switch, for more specific heat control. Multi-position speed control switch <b>46</b> can be mounted on housing or casing of mixer <b>10</b> and interconnected to motor <b>14</b> and conventional circuitry of electric mixer <b>10</b>. Thus, multi-position speed control switch <b>46</b> can include settings for low heat, medium heat, and high heat for more specific heat regulation and production dependent on the type and quantity of the food item or ingredient being warmed. Multi-position switch <b>46</b> will also better accommodate variable warming and heating times for different varieties of food items and ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A second embodiment is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> generally at <b>20</b>&#x2032;. The coating <b>40</b> in the first embodiment will be selected for its durability in order to provide the longest useful life for beater <b>20</b> possible. However, it is the nature of coatings to chip and crack thereby limiting the length of time the beater <b>20</b> can be used. Further, the thickness of the coating will necessarily impede the amount of heat which may be delivered to the food being mixed. In this second embodiment the beater <b>20</b>&#x2032; has one or more pairs of mixing blades <b>26</b>&#x2032; (one being shown) which are formed from a tubular member <b>27</b>&#x2032; with the heating element <b>38</b>&#x2032; running through the inner portion of the flattened tube. By way of example, the heating element <b>38</b>&#x2032; may take the form of ni-chrome resistance wire or flat ribbon. In either case, the heating element <b>38</b>&#x2032; will be electrically insulated from the metallic tubular member <b>27</b>&#x2032;. The ends of the blades <b>26</b>&#x2032; are attached, as by tack welding, for example, to arm <b>24</b>&#x2032; and a non-conducting, protective sleeve <b>49</b>&#x2032; provided for the portion of the arm <b>24</b>&#x2032; and heating element <b>38</b>&#x2032; which extend upwardly toward the base of the mixer <b>10</b>. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> depicts the tubular member <b>27</b>&#x2032; being formed by running the heating element <b>38</b>&#x2032; through the tubular member <b>27</b>&#x2032; and being flattened by one or more rollers. While the profile of the resulting mixing blade <b>26</b>&#x2032; is shown as being flat, it will be appreciated that any desired profile can be imparted during this process. Further, although the tubular member <b>27</b>&#x2032; is recited as being metallic, it will be appreciated that certain plastic or hybrid materials could be utilized as well. This design provides a more robust, longer lasting beater <b>20</b>&#x2032; as well as permitting a larger amount of heat to be imparted to the ingredients being mixed. The multi-position switch <b>46</b> employed in the first embodiment <b>20</b> may also be utilized with beater <b>20</b>&#x2032; and may include a separate button to allow the user to vary both the rate of rotation and the rate at which heat is imparted to the ingredients, separately. Additional alternatives to the disclosed embodiments would include a laminated metal design sandwiching the electrical conductor and a heat-conductive plastic outer member which remains rigid when heated up to the highest operating temperature of the device.</p>
