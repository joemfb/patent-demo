<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention is based on known mixing tools and known shearing tools, which are fastened to a shaft, wherein the shaft is mounted rotatably in an at least partially cylindrical trough, and the mixing tools end at a very short distance from an inner surface of the trough and the shaft has driving means.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Mixing tools of this type and shearing tools of this type have been known for decades and are generally used in substantially horizontally oriented troughs in order to mix any type of bulk materials and liquid masses or to subject them to a shearing treatment. This overall manner of operation has proven extremely favorable for the treatment of chocolate, compound and filling masses.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The prior art for mixing tools are plowshare blades, as disclosed by DE-C 1276986. Mixing tools of this type are arranged in a drum in such a manner that product cannot be distributed in the gap between the mixing tool and the inner surface of the drum. This is achieved at the mixing tool by means of a clearance angle which opens counter to the revolving direction of the spinning machine. In order to meet this stipulation, the bottom wall of the mixing tool can be set back, or it is correspondingly beveled or the mixing tool itself is positioned obliquely and therefore the mixing tool obtains a cleaning function scraping off the inner wall of the drum. This does not have an effect on pure mixing tools because the actual mixing action which the tools have to carry out is not impaired as a result.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The prior art for mixing tools also includes throwing blades. Mixing tools of this type are blades which are sickle-shaped, are positioned obliquely with respect to the transverse axis of the shaft axis, and are rectilinear, and blades which are flat and sheet-like, with a distance which is continuously uniformly as small as possible from the inner wall of the drum, wherein the blade edge closest to the inner wall of the drum logically has to be an elliptical curve.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">These mixing tools are arranged in a drum in such a manner that the product is neither drawn in, pressed or sheared in the gap between the mixing tool and the inner surface of the drum, but rather is pushed ahead by the mixer, nor can any wedging action whatsoever take place. In other words: a shearing gap is not formed and therefore only small restructurings of the material can take place.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Shearing tools which, in turn, are intended to have more of a shearing effect than a mixing effect are also known. Said tools, over the entire length thereof, as seen in the revolving direction of the tools, are at a greater distance from the inner surface of the trough continuously in the front region than continuously in the rear region, which causes an action drawing in the material. However, these tools have a small mixing action.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, DE-A-4344995 has disclosed a construction which improves a mixing tool, such as a known plowshare blade, to the effect that, in addition to the mixing operation, restructurings of the material are also promoted. For this purpose, the mixing tool or the mixing tools, as seen in the revolving direction of the mixing tools, is/are spaced apart further from the inner surface of the drum in the front region than in the rear region.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With the intended products, this results in a considerable wedging of the product, and the product, once caught in the gap, and in particular assisted by the shearing surface which becomes larger as the gap becomes narrower, can scarcely escape any more from being compressed when subjected to excessive stress, which may result, in the case of suspensions, to a grinding effect on the solids. The excess friction produced as a result may result in local overheating of the product, which may be undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">GB 702,175 A discloses a mixer in which the tips of the mixing tool blades, which are designed in the form of double-sided plowshare blades, are located at the front, as seen in the revolving direction, and scrape material which is to be mixed off the inner walls of the trough.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">DE 1 082 576 A describes a counterflow mixing mechanism, in which stirring blades are arranged at an angle on supporting arms. The supporting arms are configured in a manner similar to a sword and are positioned at an angle to the axis of the stirring mechanism shaft in such a manner that the conveying direction of the supporting arm surface is opposed to the conveying direction of the stirring blades.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further shearing and mixing tool is disclosed in DE A 19636989, which is characterized by
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">

<p id="p-0013" num="0017">It is the object of the present invention to improve a mixing tool, such as a known throwing blade, to the effect that, in addition to the mixing operation, restructurings of the material in the product to be treated are also promoted (shearing tool), and in the same step, in addition to the shearing operation, a considerable mixing action can also be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">An important aim of the improvement here, along with optimum mixing power, is to bring about restructuring of the material in a manner which still takes care of the product and is nevertheless highly efficient, and to design the tool in such a manner that, with product rheology, structure and consistency changing over the process time, at least one optimally designed shearing gap section, which is matched to the time-dependent structure of the product, is always available as part of the entire length of the shearing gap. Furthermore, the product is not intended to undergo any local overheating, nor in the case of suspensions is a grinding effect, acting on the solids, intended to arise.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">According to the invention, this object is achieved, in particular by developing the tool according to DE-A-19636989, by a shearing/mixing tool which is arrangeable on a shaft which is mounted coaxially and rotatably in an at least partially cylindrical trough (<b>3</b>). The shearing/mixing tool then forms a rotor arrangement with the shaft via a tool carrier. The shearing/mixing tool comprises a shearing/throwing blade and at least one arm which is rectilinear, positioned obliquely and/or is bent.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">The shearing/throwing blade may be planar or curved, it may be sickle-shaped or be in the form of a plate. The latter may have, for example, a polygonal, rectangular or trapezoidal outer contour.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">The arm or arms can be designed to be fittable on a tool carrier or to be integral therewith. The tool carrier, for its part, can be fastened on the shaft. It may be designed as an annular fastening element which is suitable in particular to be mountable on a shaft having a round cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">A plurality of shearing/mixing tools may also be fitted on a shaft, or at least one shearing/mixing tool can be fitted together with one or more further tools, for example, a wall scraper, on a shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">The tool has at least one opening.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">Tests have shown that the hole in the tool has additional positive technological properties, better fluidization in the dry phase and an additional reaction surface on the product veil in the liquid phase, in particular in a conching and liquefying process. The tool also affords additional advantages in the mixing process, for example better mixing of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one opening is provided in an arm, between the arms and/or between the arm and shearing/throwing blade. In the last-mentioned case, the opening is bounded on one side by the arm and on the other side by the shearing/throwing blade.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">At least some of the portion of the mass to be processed that does not pass between the shearing/throwing blade and inner wall of the trough during rotation of the tool, but rather remains within the shearing/throwing blade, is guided through the opening and, upon passing through, undergoes processing, in particular shearing, expansion and/or mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">In this case, the processing of the mass per revolution is therefore intensified, since the throughput of the mass to be processed is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">The greater the distance of the opening from the shaft, the greater is the speed through the opening and the more intensive is the processing. The opening is therefore preferably arranged in that region of the arm which is furthest away radially from the axis.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one opening is provided in the shearing/throwing blade.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">Also in this case, at least part of that part of the mass to be processed that does not pass between the shearing/mixing tool and inner wall of the trough during the rotation of the tool, but rather remains, as viewed radially, within the shearing/throwing blade, is guided through the opening and is thus subject to processing.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">On the other hand, however, at least a portion of the mass which passes into the gap between the shearing/mixing tool and inner wall of the trough can also escape again from said gap through the opening. In this case, the mass is less severely squeezed or sheared and undergoes a more gentle treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032">Either one or the other effect predominates depending on how the shape of the tool is designed, for example, depending on the inclination of the shearing/throwing blade, or depending on the gap distance or depending on the profile of the gap distance between the shearing/mixing tool and inner wall of the trough, and depending on the direction of rotation of the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">The tool may therefore also be rotated initially in one direction and then in the other direction and the mass initially intensively treated, then gently treated, or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0034">The tool may be designed in such a manner that, on the one hand, it acts as a wall scraper and, on the other hand, it simultaneously or subsequently, for example during a reversal of the direction of rotation, processes the mass, in particular shears, expands and/or mixes the mass.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">The opening may have any geometry. It is preferably polygonal, in particular triangular, and/or rounded. If the opening is provided in the blade, the outer contour preferably substantially follows the contour of the blade. In the case of a triangular blade surface, the opening surface is therefore substantially likewise triangular.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">If the arm is of bent design, at least one limb of said arm is preferably arranged at right angles to the shaft axis. During the rotation of the tool, said limb collects material and feeds the material to the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">A hole located in a bent arm is preferably arranged in the bend where mass to be processed collects if the tool rotates in the direction of the opening angle of the bend.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the cross-sectional area is contracted and/or enlarged in and/or counter to the direction of rotation, and therefore the inlet and outlet surfaces of at least one opening preferably differ in size.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0039">If the material thickness is sufficiently large, the cross-sectional area of the opening changes in such a manner that the opening has the shape of a narrowing or widening funnel and an expanding or shearing flow of the material within the opening occurs, depending on the direction of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0040">The cross-sectional area may also initially narrow then widen again, or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">The tool may have an opening in the arm region and an additional opening in the blade. A plurality of openings may also be provided in the blade. The processing of the mass is more intensive or less intensive depending on the cross-sectional area of the particular opening and depending on the sum of the cross-sectional areas.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the shearing/mixing tool according to the invention has an opening which is suitable for receiving an insert. The insert may have no opening or at least one opening. The user can preferably make a choice from a selection of different inserts and equip the tool in such a manner that it is particularly suitable for certain masses to be processed and/or for certain processing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043">As an alternative, the user may make a selection from tools which differ in the arrangement, design and/or number of openings and which the user fits onto the shaft depending on the mass to be processed and/or for the processing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">The shearing/mixing tool according to the invention preferably has a shearing/throwing blade which is sickle-shaped, and is preferably curved in the shape of an arc of a circle in cross section and is preferably rectilinear in the longitudinal direction and rotates at an angle of 1-45&#xb0; obliquely with respect to the shaft axis in the drum, wherein the bending angle in the cross section of the shearing/throwing blade preferably increases in size from the sickle tip to the rear, and therefore the shearing/throwing blade forms an inverted spoon-shaped surface to the rear virtually parallel to the inner surface of the trough and therefore, as the bending angle increases, the distance of the shearing/throwing blade periphery from the inner wall of the trough becomes ever larger (angle &#x3b3;), for example to more than 50 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">The minimum distance from the inner wall of the trough is 0.1-1 mm, depending on the mass to be processed and depending on the processing step.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">The gap between the tool and inner wall of the trough preferably has a width of 1-3 mm if the tool is intended to operate in a wall-stripping manner. For a shearing treatment of the mass to be processed, the gap between the tool edge and inner wall of the trough preferably has a width of approximately 5-30 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">The shearing/mixing tool, which is connected frictionally to the drive shaft via an arm, preferably has at least one further arm which is provided with a wall scraper acting in the direction of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">It goes without saying that, according to the described geometrical shape of the shearing/throwing blade for the optimum treatment of a very wide variety of products, as the bending angle becomes larger, the bending radius can simultaneously also be increased or reduced, and also that the transverse bending may be a curve which has a regressive or else progressive profile, depending on the product, and that the shearing/throwing blade, in addition to the transverse bending, can be bent in the longitudinal direction from the sickle tip toward the left or right side wall and, as seen in top view, with an angle &#x3b4; being formed between the tangent to the bend and the longitudinal axis of the extent of the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">It also goes without saying that, for a desired action, depending on the product, the wall scraper which is attached to the further arm can likewise be designed as a throwing blade which is sickle-shaped, but is flat, i.e. is not curved in cross section, is rectilinear in the longitudinal direction or is curved toward the left or right side wall, with a consistent minimum distance from the inner wall of the trough.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">Accordingly, the shearing/mixing tools according to the invention are preferably used in conching machines for conching chocolate masses and in liquefying or mixing machines of compound and filling masses in the confectionary industry.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">As is known, efficient conching machines are distinguished in that one and the same machine optimally carries out a plurality of basic process operations, such as mixing, shearing and ventilating, in one working step. In the case of chocolate masses, the restructuring of the pulverulent material being rolled into a flowable suspension can therefore be carried out efficiently and at the same time the chocolate masses can be deacidified without suffering aroma losses, caused by local overheating as a consequence of excessive friction of the product.</p>
