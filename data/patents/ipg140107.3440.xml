<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a work vehicle <b>10</b> which could make use of the invention. The particular embodiment illustrated is an articulated dump truck (&#x201c;ADT&#x201d;) <b>10</b> employing an embodiment of the invention, i.e., the stair lighting system <b>100</b>. This illustrated ADT <b>10</b> includes: a front portion <b>20</b> which may have a front chassis (not shown), ground engaging front wheels <b>21</b>, a cab frame <b>22</b>, a roof <b>22</b><i>a</i>, a door <b>22</b><i>b</i>, a door handle <b>22</b><i>c</i>, a battery <b>24</b> an ignition <b>25</b> and stairs <b>26</b>; and a rear portion <b>30</b> having a rear chassis (not shown), ground engaging rear wheels <b>31</b>, and a dump body <b>32</b>; and an articulation joint <b>40</b> allowing angular change between the front portion <b>20</b> and the rear portion <b>30</b>. An exemplary stair light <b>110</b> is shown located on the roof <b>22</b><i>a</i>, in a position over the stairway <b>26</b> enabling it to illuminate the stairs <b>26</b> and the door handle <b>22</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary schematic of the flow of communication for the stairway lighting system <b>100</b> which may include: a stair light <b>110</b>, a vehicle controller <b>120</b>, a light sensor <b>130</b> positioned to detect the intensity of ambient lighting, a motion sensor <b>140</b> which may be designed and positioned on a side of the cab frame <b>22</b> to detect operator motion or presence on or near the stairs <b>26</b>, a first switch <b>150</b> and a second switch <b>160</b>. It gives a simplified view of the lines of communication between elements of the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary schematic of power flow for the stairway lighting system <b>100</b> showing details of a latching arrangement which may include: a seven (7) volt power supply <b>116</b>; a controller <b>120</b>; a light sensor <b>130</b>; a motion sensor <b>140</b>; a first switch <b>150</b>; a second switch <b>160</b>; a door switch <b>170</b> and corresponding transitors <b>121</b>, <b>131</b>, <b>141</b>, <b>151</b>, <b>161</b>, <b>171</b>. Electrical output for each of the transitors <b>121</b>, <b>131</b>, <b>141</b>, <b>151</b>, <b>161</b>, <b>171</b> may flow from the line on the output side when electrical power is supplied to each of the two lines on the input side. The controller <b>120</b> may include: a five (5) volt power supply <b>120</b><i>a</i>; and a processing circuit <b>120</b><i>b </i>with a processor and memory and/or storage. Also included in the stairway lighting system <b>100</b> may be a battery <b>25</b> and, in this particular embodiment, an arming switch <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The arming switch <b>115</b> may be mechanical or electronic and may respond to a remote signal such as a light or radio signal from a conventional remote control device (not shown) to which it may be designed or programmed to recognize and respond to. It may toggle to between an arming on state and an arming off state. Thus, a first signal from the remote control device may arm the system <b>100</b>, i.e., connect the battery <b>25</b> to the other switches <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> and a second signal from the remote control device may disarm the system <b>100</b>, i.e., disconnect the battery <b>25</b> from the other switches <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b>. Arming and disarming the system <b>100</b> may also include disconnecting, i.e., interrupting the flow of electrical power to the seven (7) volt power supply <b>116</b> as illustrated. The arming switch <b>115</b> may, in some circumstances, be disarmed or armed by the controller <b>120</b> if a line of communication is established between the controller <b>120</b> and the arming switch <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first and second switches <b>150</b>, <b>160</b> may be mechanical or electronic and may respond to physical manipulation or to a remote signal such as a light or radio signal from the remote control device to which they (it) may be designed or programmed to recognize and respond. They may also be designed such that activation of one or both of the first and second switches <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, via mechanical manipulation or remote signal, may cause it/them to change state from an off state to an on state for a predetermined minimum time and then revert to the off state. Finally, one of the first and second switches <b>150</b>, <b>160</b> may be designed and located such that it is mechanically manipulated when a weight of the operator is applied to the stairs <b>26</b>. Such a switch may be purely mechanical or in the form of a strain gage and placed at an interface between the stairs <b>26</b> and the cab frame <b>22</b>. The weight of the operator may be applied to the stairs <b>26</b> when the operator steps on any of the stair steps <b>26</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The motion sensor switch <b>140</b>, upon sensing motion, may also enter an on state for the predetermined minimum time and enter into a standby state after the predetermined minimum time is exceeded or an off state if the controller <b>120</b> has disarmed the lighting system <b>100</b>. The predetermined minimum time for the on state of any of the switches <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> may be set to a time required for the controller <b>120</b> to power up and latch the lighting system <b>110</b> to an on state via a constant supply of electrical energy from, for example, the five (5) volt power supply <b>120</b><i>b </i>to the input side of the transistor <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary flow diagram <b>200</b> for actions of the controller <b>120</b> in the schematic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The underlying assumptions for the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is that the stair light <b>110</b> is initially off at step <b>210</b> and the operator is away from the work vehicle <b>10</b>. If the stairway lighting system <b>100</b> is not armed, via the arming switch <b>115</b>, at step <b>215</b>, the lighting system <b>100</b> returns to step <b>210</b> with the stair light <b>110</b> off. If the lighting system <b>100</b> is armed at step <b>215</b>, via the arming switch <b>115</b>, and none of the switches <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> is in an on state, the lighting system <b>100</b> returns to step <b>210</b>. If the lighting system <b>100</b> is armed at step <b>215</b>, via the arming switch <b>115</b>, and at least one of the switches <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> is in an on state, the controller <b>120</b> may check input from the light sensor <b>130</b> to determine if ambient light is less than a predetermined intensity. If ambient light is not less than a predetermined intensity at step <b>250</b>, the lighting system <b>100</b> returns to step <b>210</b>. However, if the ambient light is equal to or greater than the predetermined intensity, the controller latches the power, turns the stair light <b>110</b> on and begins to track the time the stair light <b>110</b> is on at step <b>260</b>. The controller <b>120</b> keeps the lighting system latched and the stair light <b>110</b> on at step <b>270</b> until the tracked time is greater than or equal to a predetermined minimum time. Once the stair light has been on for a time equal to or greater than the predetermined minimum time, the power is unlatched by the controller <b>120</b> ant the lighting system returns to step <b>210</b>. and the stair lighting system <b>100</b> includes the light sensor <b>130</b>, then the intensity of ambient light may be detected and if the light sensor <b>130</b> indicates the ambient lighting is not less than a predetermined intensity, the controller <b>120</b> returns to step <b>210</b> with the stair light <b>110</b> off. If the light sensor <b>130</b> indicates the ambient lighting is less than a predetermined intensity, the stair light is turned on and the controller <b>120</b> may begin to track the time the stair light <b>110</b> is on at step <b>260</b> and may then move to step <b>270</b>. If, at step <b>270</b>, the on time of the stair light <b>110</b> is less than a predetermined minimum value, the lighting system remains at step <b>270</b> and the stair light <b>110</b> remains on. Once the stair light <b>110</b> is on for a time equal to or greater than the predetermined minimum time at step <b>270</b>, the controller <b>120</b> may unlatch the power at step <b>280</b> and, at step <b>290</b>, return to step <b>210</b>. The predetermined intensity may be set at any value but may definitely include light intensities at which the operator would find it difficult to see such as, for example, an ambient nighttime light intensity. Likewise, the predetermined minimum time may be set at any value but may, generally, be large enough to allow the operator to safely board or exit the vehicle <b>10</b> such as, for example, one (1) minute.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, if the stair light is off at step <b>210</b> and the system <b>100</b> is armed at step <b>220</b>, it may determine if the operator is on or near the stairs <b>26</b> via the proximity or motion sensor <b>140</b> at step <b>280</b>. If the proximity or motion sensor <b>140</b> does not indicate that the operator is on or near the stairs <b>26</b>, the system may return to step <b>210</b> with the stair light(s) off. However, if the motion sensor <b>140</b> indicates that the operator is on or near the stairs <b>26</b> at step <b>280</b>, then the system <b>100</b> may move to step <b>240</b> in the process.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The stair light system <b>100</b> may be designed such that the controller <b>120</b> and all sensors and switches are directly powered by the battery <b>24</b>; but in a standby mode when armed and the operator is not present. Thus, the controller <b>120</b> and all sensors and switches may consume a small amount of electrical power when armed but a minimum amount of power when the system is unarmed and mechanical switches are used to arm the system as neither the controllers nor the sensors need be powered until the system is armed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It may be desirable that the system <b>100</b> be perpetually armed if the times of operator absence are relatively short. However, there may be times that it is more desirable for the system <b>100</b> to be unarmed, e.g., the vehicle <b>10</b> will not be operated for an extended period of time, the operator wishes to avoid playful tampering with the lighting of the vehicle <b>10</b> by third parties, etc. The system <b>100</b> may, once again, be armed by manipulation of the first switch <b>150</b> or the second switch <b>160</b> either mechanically, or if equipped, by the remote control device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the system <b>100</b> is equipped with a door switch <b>170</b>, an opening of the door <b>22</b><i>b </i>may cause the door switch <b>170</b> to change state from off to on and change the state of the system <b>100</b> from unarmed to armed. The underlying assumption here is that the operator is in the cab <b>22</b> and is opening the door <b>22</b><i>b </i>to exit the vehicle <b>10</b>. The stair light <b>110</b> may be turned on to aid the operator's exit either automatically upon opening of the door <b>22</b><i>b </i>or, upon both the opening of the door <b>22</b><i>b </i>and the detection of an ambient light intensity that is less than a predetermined minimum if the system is equipped with a light sensor <b>130</b>. The predetermined minimum intensity for ambient light may be set to any value via programming for the controller <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">If the system <b>100</b> is not equipped with a door switch <b>170</b>, it may be armed by a change in state of the ignition <b>25</b>, i.e., the system may be armed when the ignition <b>25</b> moves from an on state to an off state. The underlying assumption here is that the operator is preparing to exit the vehicle <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The default state of the system <b>100</b> may be the last state of the system deliberately chosen by the operator. Thus, if a change in the state of system <b>100</b> from armed to unarmed, or vice versa, is last effected via a remote or mechanical manipulation of one of the first and second switches <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, the state of the system <b>100</b> may remain as such until a change in state is again effected by a remote or mechanical manipulation of one of the first and second switches <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the stair light <b>110</b> located on a side of the cab frame <b>22</b>. Such a position may result in illumination of a greater intensity as the stair light <b>100</b> is located significantly closer to the stairs <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the stair light <b>110</b> as a plurality of lights <b>110</b><i>a </i>directly attached to, and illuminating, the stairs <b>26</b> at each step <b>26</b><i>a. </i></p>
