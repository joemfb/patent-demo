<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The invention relates to a sealing arrangement for a pressurizing-agent-operable control device of a clutch arrangement, for sealing a chamber belonging to the clutch arrangement which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, assigned to the clutch arrangement, from the interior space of the clutch arrangement; in addition, a wet-running double clutch arrangement having a sealing arrangement.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Wet-running double-clutch arrangements are previously known in a plurality of versions from the existing art. These have one input and two outputs, the input being formed of a driver unit, which is connected to a first clutch part of each of the individual clutch arrangements of the wet-running double clutch. Each clutch arrangement has a second clutch part, which may be brought into operative connection with the first clutch part and is coupled with the output in a rotationally fixed connection. Such clutch designs are frequently of multi-disk or lamellar construction, so that the first clutch part is formed of a first lamellar array and the second clutch part is formed of a second lamellar array, where the two lamellar arrays may be brought into a frictionally engaged operative connection with each other by means of an actuating device, usually in the form of a piston element actuated by a pressurizing agent. To that end, each of the clutch arrangements has its own actuating device, preferably in the form of a piston element. Assigned to the piston element for actuation is at least one chamber pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, but preferably two chambers pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, which act on the two faces of the piston element directed away from each other, and where a first of the chambers pressurizable with a pressurizing agent serves directly as a pressure chamber for operating the piston, and the second chamber assigned to a piston element serves as a compensating chamber. The chambers are connected to a pressurizing agent supply and conducting system, with the individual chambers assigned to a piston element being separately addressable. The contact force of the piston can be set by means of the pressure difference in the two chambers. Because of the wet operation of the lamella, which are always running in oil, the chambers which are pressurizable with a pressurizing agent must be separated from the interior space of the wet-running double clutch. The individual clutch arrangements are situated coaxially to each other and one inside the other in the radial direction, and preferably with little or no offset in relation to each other in the axial direction. The sealing of the individual chambers in relation to the interior space or to each other is accomplished by means of sealing arrangements comprising elastic sealing devices, these being moving sealing devices in this case, since they usually seal the piston in relation to a stationary component, and the sealing surface is moved along with the motion of the piston. The sealing arrangements are therefore normally vulcanized directly onto the piston element, or to an element that is frictionally connected thereto. This means that to apply the sealing device, the entire piston element&#x2014;and thus a relatively large component which in some versions has a cross section with complex geometry&#x2014;must be handled and subjected to the vulcanizing process. The geometry of the piston determines both the arrangement of the sealing device and the arrangement and form of the other surface areas of the chamber pressurizable with a pressurizing agent which are to be brought into operative connection with the sealing device. Highly precise fabrication is therefore necessary to realize a reliable sealing function. Furthermore, if the sealing surfaces are damaged there is no simple means of replacing the individual sealing devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">An object of the invention is to provide a sealing arrangement for use in clutch arrangements of any desired construction type, in particular in double clutch arrangements, which is characterized by a simple design independent of the design of the piston and is easily replaceable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, a sealing arrangement, in particular in clutch arrangements, is provided which may include an actuating system having at least one chamber assigned to the actuating system, pressurizable with a pressurizing medium, the sealing device is guided between two coaxial components on at least one sheet metal element, which may be attached to an element that delimits a chamber which is pressurizable with a pressurizing medium. The piston element itself and the elements that delimit the chamber which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent may be free of machining. The shaping may be shifted to the sheet metal element, which is simple to produce because of its lesser thickness. Furthermore, the sheet metal element can be shaped freely in the region that carries the sealing device, so that it is possible here to match various cross sectional geometries of the sealing devices. The sheet metal element can be joined easily with elements that delimit the chamber which may be actuatable with a pressuring agent. Furthermore, because of its guidance on the sheet metal element the individual sealing device is easily replaceable.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">The sheet metal element is preferably a thin sheet metal element, with a thickness in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 mm. That enables its geometry to be matched to the constructional circumstances of the installation situation without major manufacturing expense.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">The element delimiting the chamber that is pressurizable with a pressuring agent may be the actuating device itself or a wall of a housing or of the chamber. The individual sealing device is preferably guided in a seal retainer, comprising two sheet metal elements that form a groove to receive the sealing device. This seal retainer is joined to a connecting element, which at least partially delimits the corresponding chamber pressurizable with a pressurizing agent. That makes it possible to provide a simple sealing arrangement for different applications, maximally independent of the piston design, and also to simplify the manufacturing considerably.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">At the same time, one of the two sheet metal elements of the actuating device, or some element that delimits the chamber which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, can itself be made in a manner that saves parts, or according to an especially advantageous design, since it is also pre-mountable, can be made of two separate sheet metal elements. In the first case, at least two contact surfaces that make the groove may be formed on the sheet metal element, which is joined to the element that delimits the chamber which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent. The element that delimits the chamber which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent may forms only a radial or axial contact surface of the groove for the sealing device. That makes it possible to dispense with milling on the elements that delimit the chamber, which would be necessary to receive the sealing devices, and a correspondingly necessary design of the thickness of the latter. Elements that delimit the chamber form contact surfaces merely with their faces which are present anyway, which require no modification.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Another embodiment of the present invention provides the two sheet metal elements can also be made of separate sheet metal elements which form a seal retainer; in this case these are normally disk-shaped, ring-shaped, ring-disk-shaped or bell-shaped forms, where the concrete design of the cross section can be chosen depending on the installation situation and can be included by these additional functions. The component in the form of the seal retainer, made from the two sheet metal elements, may be joined in a rotationally fixed connection either with an element of the actuator, in particular the piston element, or with some other stationary connecting element that delimits the chamber which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, at least in the axial direction. One of the dimensions of the sealing device, in particular the sealing device guided in the seal retainer, may be independent of the geometry and/or dimensioning on the element delimiting the chamber which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, to which element the seal retainer is also attached, as a result of which the sealing device can be chosen larger or smaller (larger, in the case of the inner circumference) than the dimensioning of the connecting element in the area of the connection. The forming of the groove by means of two separate sheet elements permits individual attention here to installation requirements and spatial circumstances of the design of the piston elements and of the chamber walls. The sealing device and the connecting elements&#x2014;actuating device and another wall delimiting the chamber&#x2014;no longer have to be matched precisely to each other in the design of their regions that carry the seal, since this function is now assumed by the seal retainer, by means of which even relatively large intervals can be compensated for in a simple and economical way. Furthermore, because of the variable configuration of the seal retainer and of the part that holds the sealing device, the positioning of the sealing device can also be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">Furthermore, no grooves may be incorporated into the elements involved in the clutch arrangement for actuation, in particular the piston element. The manufacturing cost and the required manufacturing precision may be lower than when incorporating grooves according to the existing art, especially in the piston elements. Furthermore, a seal retainer also makes it possible to produce a larger interval between the elements that move in the axial direction, in particular the piston element and the walls delimiting the chambers that are pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, as well as making it easier to even out tolerances.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">With regard to the geometry of the construction of the one sheet metal element, or preferably of the seal retainer module from two separate sheet metal elements, and the connection with the actuating system, in particular the piston element or another element delimiting a chamber that is pressurizable with a pressuring agent, there are a plurality of possibilities. When the seal retainer is made of two separate sheet metal elements, the shaping of the groove on the sheet metal elements can be executed on only one sheet metal element or on both. Preferably, a solution on only one is chosen, in which case the second sheet metal element then merely forms an axial contact surface, while the other contact surface then shares in the contact surface function when sealing rings are used. Thus the processing expense for the sheet metal elements can be kept down.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">The forming of the groove on the individual sheet metal elements may then be normally accomplished by simple shaping processes, for example deep drawing or stamping. For sealing devices between coaxial components, the groove is situated in the radial outer or inner end region of the seal retainer, so that the sealing device, in particular the sealing surface, either lies in the same plane or with a different diameter&#x2014;in the case of outside seals, with a larger diameter than the maximum extension of the groove in the radial direction, and in the case of inside seals a smaller diameter than the radial inner extension of the groove. Preferably, the sealing device and thus the sealing surface extend beyond the groove in the radial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">The two sheet metal elements can be constructed together as a pre-assembled module, or else they may be joined together with the actuating device or with an element delimiting the chamber that is pressurizable with a pressurizing medium into a module only at the time of installation. In the first case a separate connection may be made between the sheet metal elements, in the second case the connections with the actuating device or with the element delimiting the chamber which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent may be used to join the sheet metal elements and thus shape the groove, making it possible to save a working step.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">The connection of the sheet metal elements is preferably inseparable, in particular a positive or material connection. The connection is achieved for example with penetrating joints, in particular a clinched connection. Welded connections are also conceivable, with a circumferential welded seam or spot welded connections being possible.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">The geometry of the sheet metal element design, in particular the design of the cross section viewed in axial section, is dependent on the installation situation and the matching to contact surface regions on the actuating device and the elements delimiting the chamber that is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent. Depending on the design of the seal retainer, in particular of the sheet metal element bounding on the connecting element, the sheet metal elements are formed with surfaces parallel to each other over more or less larger areas. It is conceivable to design the extension of the individual sheet metal elements differently, for example so that they are not in contact with each other over their entire axial and/or radial extension. The concrete geometric design of the seal retainer may always be executed depending on the requirements of the application, in particular on the available construction space and on the design geometry of the walls delimiting the chamber that is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, as well as of the piston element, with attention to the piston motion, in a clutch arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">A plurality of possibilities also exist for the connection between the seal retainer made of one or two sheet metal elements, in particular the connection of the sheet metal element with the connecting element. The connection can be made using frictional or positive locking or adhesive force. Furthermore, it can be separable or inseparable. Preferably, the connection with the connecting element, in particular with the actuating device, is inseparable, either through adhesive force or a positive connection or else a joining technique, which is referred to for example as through joining or pressure joining, in particular clinching. This is a joining process for connecting sheet metal elements, free of any additional material. It is a combination of a shaping process and a joining process, with the joining being accomplished through plastic deformation. Another possibility of connection consists in a compression connection, in particular in the case of ring-shaped sealing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">The possibility of a material connection is produced for example by spot welding, it being possible here to apply various welding techniques. The positive connection may be realized here by means of rivet joints, which may involve separate rivets or rivets extruded from the connecting element. If the connection is made in spots along the extent of the seal retainer, it does not produce a closed sealing edge between the seal retainer or the sheet metal element on the piston and the actuating device. In this case leakage flows are possible, so these can be controlled by the connection. If these are to be avoided, an uninterrupted joint that is pressure-tight and liquid-tight over its entire extent is necessary. This can be produced by means of an extended two-dimensional connection or else through additional sealing devices between the sheet metal element on the piston and the actuating device itself, or the element delimiting the chamber pressurizable with a pressurizing agent and the sheet metal element in contact therewith. Depending on whether a complete seal is provided by the sealing device, it may be necessary to also design the connection between the two sheet metal elements and between the sheet metal elements and the connecting element so that it is pressure-tight and liquid-tight. This may involve regions oriented in the axial and/or in the radial direction. Consideration must also be given to whether or not a leakage flow is permissible. If avoidance of a leakage flow between the seal retainer and a connecting element is desired, it is conceivable to provide sealing lips in the area of contact between these, preferably a plurality of sealing lips placed one behind another. In the simplest case these can be incorporated in the form of beads running in the circumferential direction, which form correspondingly sealed surfaces after the seal retainer is joined to the connecting element. Another possibility would be to use a surface seal.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">An especially advantageous embodiment provides a wet-running multi-plate clutch, in particular a double clutch arrangement. The latter includes a first clutch arrangement and a second clutch arrangement, which may be situated between an input and one output each, each of the two clutch arrangements having a first clutch part that may be connected to the input in a rotationally fixed connection and a second clutch part that may be connected to an output in a rotationally fixed connection, with an actuating device bringing the two clutch parts into operative connection with each other. To that end, the actuating device includes an actuating element in the form of a piston element that may be operated by a pressurizing agent. In addition, at least one and preferably two chambers that can be pressurized with a pressurizing agent may be assigned to the piston element. The first chamber here may be a pressure chamber, the second may be a compensating chamber. In order to seal the individual chambers off from the rest of the interior of the clutch, sealing arrangements designed according to the invention are provided. These may be situated in each case between two coaxial components, in particular the piston element and a connecting element, preferably an element that forms a wall.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a detail from an axial cross section of a wet-running double clutch assembly <b>15</b> according to the existing art, comprising an input E and two outputs A and clutch devices situated between them, a first clutch device K<b>1</b> and a second clutch device K<b>2</b>, each of which is operable by means of actuating devices <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> respectively assigned to them, which are actuated by a pressurizing agent, there being assigned to each of the individual actuating devices in the form of a piston element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> at least one chamber pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, preferably chambers situated on both sides of the piston element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and pressurizable with a pressurizing agent. Assigned to piston element <b>20</b> are a first chamber <b>26</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent and a second chamber <b>27</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, the two chambers taking effect on the opposing faces <b>20</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>.<b>2</b> respectively. Assigned to piston element <b>21</b> are a first chamber <b>30</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent and a second chamber <b>31</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, the two chambers taking effect on the faces <b>21</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>.<b>2</b> respectively. Chambers <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> function as pressure chambers, and chambers <b>27</b> and <b>31</b> as compensating chambers. The pressure difference between the chambers <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> or <b>30</b>, <b>31</b> respectively, assigned to a piston element <b>20</b> or <b>21</b> respectively, determines the contact force of the piston element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>. The sealing off of the individual chambers <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, which are pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, from the interior space <b>16</b> of the double clutch arrangement <b>15</b>, is accomplished by means of sealing devices <b>28</b>.<b>1</b> through <b>28</b>.<b>4</b> between the individual piston element <b>20</b> or <b>21</b> and another element that delimits the chambers <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> which are pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, in this case the housing parts <b>17</b> and <b>29</b> and another element <b>87</b> that delimits the pressure chamber <b>30</b>. To that end, the sealing devices <b>28</b>.<b>1</b> through <b>28</b>.<b>4</b> are vulcanized onto the piston elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>. The process is relatively complex because of the required handling of the piston elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, and exact assignment of positions among the piston elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and the materials forming the respective sealing devices <b>28</b>.<b>1</b> through <b>28</b>.<b>4</b> is necessary in the vulcanizing procedure. Replacement in the event of damage to an individual sealing device is possible only at considerable effort and expense. In order to avoid this detriment, in particular when sealing off components that are situated coaxially and are movable in the axial direction relative to each other, according to the invention a sealing arrangement <b>1</b> is utilized, comprising a seal retainer <b>10</b> and at least one elastic sealing device <b>5</b>, which may be in the form of an individual sealing element, a compound element or a unit made up of a plurality of sealing elements. Seal retainer <b>10</b> includes at least one sheet metal element that is attached to a component which delimits the chamber <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>30</b> or <b>31</b> which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>illustrates in a simplified schematic depiction one possible variant of a first embodiment of a sealing arrangement <b>1</b> according to the invention with a seal retainer <b>10</b>, for use in sealing concepts for clutch arrangements, in particular for wet-running double clutch arrangements <b>15</b>, to seal off the chambers <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, which are assigned to the actuating system, in particular actuating devices <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and are pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, from the interior space <b>16</b>, and to seal the chambers from each other. Seal retainer <b>10</b> in the first embodiment comprises two sheet metal elements, a first sheet metal element <b>2</b> and a second sheet metal element <b>3</b>, which form a groove <b>4</b> to receive at least one sealing device <b>5</b>. Sheet metal elements <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> here are ring-disk-shaped elements, which have a middle axis M that coincides with the axis of rotation R of the double clutch arrangement <b>15</b> in the installed position. In the simplest case, sealing device <b>5</b> is designed as a sealing ring. This is placed in groove <b>4</b> and is held in position by the two sheet metal elements <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. Sealing device <b>5</b> has at least one sealing surface <b>6</b>, which is formed by at least a partial surface of the outer circumference <b>7</b> of sealing device <b>5</b>, preferably by the entire surface describing the outer circumference <b>7</b>. Sealing device <b>5</b> is at least partially received in groove <b>4</b>, at least far enough so that when sealing device <b>5</b>, and thus sealing surface <b>6</b>, moves relative to a stationary sealing surface, in particular in the axial direction, sealing device <b>5</b> cannot be pushed out. To that end, second sheet metal element <b>3</b> is designed in the area bounding groove <b>4</b>, in particular in the end region <b>9</b>, so that it forms a flat contact surface <b>13</b> facing in the axial direction for sealing device <b>5</b>, while first sheet metal element <b>2</b> is cranked in its radial end zone, or shaped so that it forms the contact surfaces <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> that form the groove <b>4</b>. The shaping of the ring-disk-shaped elements can be accomplished in a simple way through forming, in particular deep drawing. Other procedures are conceivable. Contact surface <b>11</b> here is an axial contact surface, contact surface <b>12</b> a surface facing in the radial direction, in this case to support the inner circumference <b>32</b> of sealing device <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032">Depending on the design of the sealing device <b>5</b>, in particular of the sealing surface <b>6</b> as a flat surface or inclined surface extending in the axial direction, the sealing surface <b>6</b> may extend over only a part of the outer circumference <b>7</b>, viewed in the radial direction, or completely over the entire outer circumference <b>7</b>. In the first-named case, the sealing device <b>5</b> can end with its outer circumference <b>7</b> in the region free of the sealing surface <b>6</b> flush with the end area <b>8</b> or the end area <b>9</b> on the respective sheet metal element <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, as shown in a concrete embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. Otherwise, the groove <b>4</b> is designed so that its depth t is less than the thickness D of the sealing device <b>5</b> in the radial direction. The embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>illustrates an especially advantageous design, with little processing expense to produce the groove <b>4</b> on the second sheet metal element <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033">It is also conceivable, however, to form a groove <b>4</b>.<b>1</b><i>b </i>by means of the formed execution of both sheet metal elements <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>.<b>1</b><i>b</i>, through proper design of the end regions <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>.<b>1</b><i>b </i>of the two sheet metal elements <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>1</b><i>b</i>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, so that the sealing device <b>5</b> on each of the sheet metal elements <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>1</b><i>b </i>finds support both in the axial direction with its faces <b>5</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>5</b>.<b>2</b> as well as in the radial direction with its inner circumference <b>32</b> on contact surfaces <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> facing outward in the radial direction on the two sheet metal elements <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>1</b><i>b</i>. At the same time, seal retainer <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>1</b><i>b </i>can be delivered preassembled as a separate module. In that case, a rotationally fixed connection between the two sheet metal elements <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> or <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>1</b><i>b </i>would be necessary, which is produced by positive connection, frictional lock or material connection, or else seal retainer <b>1</b> is assembled only in the installation situation, in which case the linkage for clutch arrangements <b>15</b> is to the elements of the actuating system, in particular the individual actuating devices <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> or some other component delimiting the chamber which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, in particular in the form of housing walls that are fixed in the axial direction. The linking of the sealing device <b>5</b> through the seal retainer <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>1</b><i>b </i>offers the advantage that the latter can be integrated into any installation situation by means of the adapted shaping and design of the sheet metal elements <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and also that the most varied sealing layers are possible by means of the corresponding geometric shaping of the sheet metal elements in cross section. This offers the advantage, in particular with larger connecting parts, that the individual sealing devices <b>5</b> in a sealing arrangement <b>1</b> according to the invention can be integrated into the connecting elements here in a simple way without great effort and expense, and also can be retrofitted. Wet-running double clutch arrangements are an especially advantageous area of application for the sealing arrangement <b>1</b> according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates, on the basis of a detail from an axial section, the use of sealing arrangements <b>1</b> according to the invention with a seal retainer <b>10</b>, in sealing concepts for the actuating unit <b>33</b> in double clutch arrangements <b>15</b>. Double clutch arrangement <b>15</b> includes a first clutch device K<b>1</b> and a second clutch device K<b>2</b>. The basic construction corresponds to that described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>; for that reason the same reference numbers are used for the same elements. Each of the clutch devices K<b>1</b> and K<b>2</b> has an actuating device <b>18</b> or <b>19</b> assigned to it, comprising a piston element <b>20</b> or <b>21</b> in the simplest case. These act on the individual clutch devices K<b>1</b>, K<b>2</b>, in order to bring the individual clutch parts into operative connection with each other. In this instance each clutch device K<b>1</b> or K<b>2</b> comprises a first clutch part <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> respectively and a second clutch part <b>23</b> or <b>25</b> respectively, with the first clutch part <b>22</b> of the first clutch device K<b>1</b> being connected to the input E in a rotationally fixed connection, while the first clutch part <b>24</b> of the second clutch device K<b>2</b> is likewise connected to the input E, and the second clutch part <b>23</b> of the first clutch device K<b>1</b> and the second clutch part <b>25</b> of the second clutch device K<b>2</b> are coupled with the output A of the double clutch arrangement <b>15</b>. The individual outputs A are each couplable with a transmission input shaft of a downline transmission, or they constitute that input shaft. When the system is designed as a disk clutch, first clutch part and second clutch part are designed in disk form, preferably in lamellar construction. The transmission of force takes place through frictional locking by means of the contact pressure between first and second clutch parts <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> or <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>, which is realized by means of the actuating devices <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>, in particular the piston elements <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>. To actuate pistons <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, chambers pressurizable with a pressurizing agent are assigned to each individual piston element <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>; these chambers pressurizable with a pressurizing agent act directly on one of the piston end faces. Assigned to first piston element <b>20</b> are a first chamber <b>26</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent and a second chamber <b>27</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, which take effect on the opposite end faces <b>20</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>20</b>.<b>2</b> of piston element <b>20</b>. By analogy to the above, a first chamber <b>30</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent and a second chamber <b>31</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent are assigned to piston element <b>21</b>, with the first chamber <b>30</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent taking effect here on end face <b>21</b>.<b>1</b> of piston element <b>21</b>, and the second chamber <b>31</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent taking effect on end face <b>21</b>.<b>2</b> of piston element <b>21</b>. The first chambers <b>26</b>, <b>30</b>, acting in the operating direction of piston element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> against clutch devices K<b>1</b> and K<b>2</b> function in this case as pressure chambers, while the other chambers <b>27</b> and <b>31</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, acting on the opposite end faces <b>20</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>21</b>.<b>2</b>, function as compensating chambers. Depending on the adjustment of the pressure ratios in the two chambers assigned to a piston element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, the contact of the piston element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> is varied. To this end, the individual piston element <b>20</b> or <b>21</b> is guided so that it can slide in the axial direction, but it is preferably connected to the input E at least indirectly in a rotationally fixed connection. The connection is made here in an exemplary manner by means of a corresponding piston hub <b>34</b>, on which the piston elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and the walls of the clutch housing <b>35</b> are carried. In this design, the individual pressure chambers <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>31</b> are each sealed off by means of at least one sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>1</b>.<b>3</b>, <b>1</b>.<b>4</b> and <b>1</b>.<b>5</b>. One sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>2</b> here is situated in the middle of a component <b>36</b> that is stationary in the axial direction, which functions as a housing wall <b>17</b> in the clutch arrangement <b>15</b>. Sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>2</b> serves to seal off the second chamber <b>27</b>, pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, which is assigned to piston element <b>20</b>. Sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>1</b> is situated between another component <b>37</b> in the form of housing part <b>29</b>, which is stationary in the axial direction, and piston element <b>20</b>, and serves to seal off the chamber <b>26</b>, which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent. These statements are also applicable by analogy to second piston element <b>21</b> and to the chambers <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>, which are assigned thereto and are pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, where the first chamber <b>30</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent is sealed off by means of sealing arrangements <b>1</b>.<b>3</b> and sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>4</b> serves to seal off the chamber <b>31</b> which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent. The individual sealing arrangements <b>1</b>.<b>3</b>, <b>1</b>.<b>5</b> and <b>1</b>.<b>4</b> here are each situated between a housing part that is stationary in the axial direction and piston element <b>21</b>, where sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>3</b> is situated in the middle of a component <b>38</b> in the form of a housing wall <b>39</b>, while sealing element <b>1</b>.<b>4</b> is situated between piston element <b>21</b> and the component <b>37</b> which forms housing wall <b>29</b>. Sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>5</b> is situated between piston hub <b>34</b> and piston element <b>21</b>. Here the individual housing parts that form housing walls can be connected to input E of the clutch arrangement in a rotationally fixed connection, and rotate with it. This means that sealing device <b>5</b>, in particular the fully formed sealing surfaces <b>6</b> of the individual sealing devices <b>5</b> in the circumferential direction, do not have to move relative to the components which are adjacent or which form the contact surfaces, but because of the movability of the piston element <b>20</b> or <b>21</b> are in any case movable in the axial direction or interact with a movable surface in the sealing pairing.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">For the individual sealing arrangements <b>1</b>.<b>1</b> through <b>1</b>.<b>5</b> there now are a plurality of possibilities of design and of attachment to the piston elements <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>; in particular, the individual chamber <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent is always sealed off between piston element <b>20</b> or <b>21</b> and a connecting element. Thus the pressure conditions in the individual chambers <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> which are pressurizable with a pressurizing agent can adapt free of the conditions in the internal space <b>16</b> of the clutch arrangement, in particular if the clutch here is a wet-running friction clutch such as a multi-plate clutch, in which the plates are running in oil. The individual chambers pressurizable with a pressurizing agent are connected to corresponding pressurizing agent supply and removal channels, for which they each have at least one connection <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>. The channels can be operatively connected with each other, and the circumstances in the chambers <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>31</b> which are pressurizable with a pressurizing agent can be set and at least controlled using means for controlling the flow of process fluid or pressurizing agent.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates, on the basis of an enlarged detail from a cross sectional depiction of double clutch arrangement <b>15</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sealing concept of sealing off chamber <b>27</b> by sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>2</b>, which is situated between piston element <b>20</b> and the connecting elements that delimit chamber <b>27</b>, which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent. To that end, sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>2</b> comprises two sealing devices <b>5</b> and <b>44</b>, which are situated and guided on a seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>4</b>. Seal retainer <b>10</b> consists of two sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>4</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>4</b>, whose faces <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> rest against each other, and where face <b>47</b> of sheet metal element <b>2</b>.<b>4</b> forms a contact surface <b>11</b>.<b>4</b> for sealing device <b>5</b> in the axial direction in the area of the outer circumference <b>46</b> in the end region <b>8</b>.<b>4</b> formed in the radial direction, while second sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>4</b> forms the groove <b>4</b>.<b>4</b>, in that the end region <b>9</b>.<b>4</b> of second sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>4</b> is L-shaped when viewed in cross section and forms a stop face <b>14</b>.<b>4</b> in the radial direction and <b>13</b>.<b>4</b> in the axial direction for sealing device <b>5</b>. Furthermore, sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>2</b> includes a second sealing device <b>44</b>, which is situated in the area of the inner circumference <b>50</b> of sealing retainer <b>10</b>.<b>4</b>, and when piston element <b>20</b> is guided at an interval from the piston hub <b>34</b> coupled with input E, it largely seals off the chamber <b>27</b> which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent from chamber <b>26</b>. To that end, seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>4</b>, in particular the sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>4</b> on the piston side, is also designed with corresponding shaping in the radially inner end region. The groove on the inner circumference <b>50</b> is designated as <b>49</b>. The latter is only partially formed by seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>4</b>, however. Sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>4</b>, situated on the piston side, assumes the function of a seal retainer here together with piston element <b>20</b>; that is, piston retainer <b>10</b>.<b>4</b> is a component of another seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>41</b> made from piston element <b>20</b> and sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>4</b>. To save construction space and material, seal retainers <b>10</b>.<b>4</b> and <b>10</b>.<b>41</b> can thus have jointly used components, in particular sheet metal elements. Seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>4</b> here supports the two seals <b>5</b> on the outer circumference and <b>44</b> on the inner circumference <b>50</b>. At the same time, the function of seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>4</b> for sealing device <b>44</b> on the inner circumference <b>50</b> is assumed by sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>4</b> and directly by piston element <b>20</b>, so that sealing device <b>44</b> is passed directly in the axial direction between the second disk-shaped element <b>3</b>.<b>4</b> and piston element <b>20</b>. The sealing surface <b>52</b> of sealing device <b>44</b> in the radial direction is formed here by the inner circumference of sealing device <b>44</b>, preferably by the entire surface of sealing device <b>44</b> that describes the inner circumference. To guide the two sealing devices <b>5</b> and <b>44</b>, second sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>4</b> has a double-S-shaped cross section, or is formed in opposite directions in the radial outer region and in the radial inner region, in particular deep drawn. Seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>4</b> is connected to piston element <b>20</b> here in a rotationally fixed connection. Theoretically, all the possibilities of frictional or positive locking or adhesive force are conceivable for connecting them. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one possibility of positive locking here by means of riveting. In this version, the rotationally fixed coupling is executed inseparably by riveting with rivets <b>53</b> extruded from piston element <b>20</b>. A possible version with spot welding or clinching would also be conceivable here, however. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the section pattern in the axial section through the riveting of sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>2</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the section pattern in the area free of the riveting.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">Teflon rings, elastic shaped rings in the form of X-rings or butterfly rings, or else elastic lip rings can be utilized as sealing devices <b>5</b> and <b>44</b>. All of these are always contacting and movable seals.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">No additional sealing is necessary on the individual sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>4</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>4</b> to prevent leakage. This function is assumed here by the two seals <b>5</b> and <b>44</b>. Even if possible leakage passes between the two sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>4</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>4</b>, this task is taken over by sealing surface <b>6</b> with respect to the stationary component <b>36</b><i>s </i>and by the axially directed sealing surfaces <b>5</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>5</b>.<b>2</b> of sealing device <b>5</b> with the seal retainers <b>10</b>.<b>4</b> and <b>44</b>.<b>2</b> with piston element <b>20</b>, under the precondition that the connection of the two sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>4</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>4</b> with piston element <b>20</b> is pressure-tight. Furthermore, if the connection is not pressure-tight the possible leakage flow, which cannot be held back by means of the sealing surfaces <b>6</b>, <b>5</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>5</b>.<b>2</b> and <b>44</b>.<b>2</b>, is guided between the piston-side sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>4</b> of seal retainers <b>10</b>.<b>4</b> and <b>10</b>.<b>41</b> and the end face <b>20</b>.<b>2</b> of piston element <b>20</b>. In addition, a leakage path between sheet metal element <b>3</b> and piston element <b>20</b> can be prevented by means of full or half beads formed on the sheet metal parts, as depicted by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, or by means of an additionally inserted seal, such as a paper seal for example.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0040">If <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a first possible embodiment of the sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>2</b> for sealing off the first outer compensating chamber, which corresponds to chamber <b>27</b> which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>illustrate another possible version of the sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>25</b>.

There is no provision here for sealing off this chamber <b>27</b> which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent from chamber <b>26</b> which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, which functions as a pressure chamber. Therefore only an outer sealing device <b>5</b> in the radial direction is provided. Sealing device <b>5</b> is attached to piston element <b>20</b> by means of a seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>5</b>. Seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>5</b> consists in this case of two disk-shaped sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>5</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>5</b>, which form a groove <b>4</b>.<b>5</b> to receive sealing device <b>5</b>. Sealing device <b>5</b> preferably forms with its outer circumference a complete sealing surface <b>6</b>, which forms a seal pairing with a surface <b>54</b> formed on fixed part <b>36</b> facing in the radial direction relative to sealing surface <b>6</b>. Groove <b>4</b>.<b>5</b> is designed so that the second sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>5</b> on the piston side is formed in its outer end region <b>9</b>.<b>5</b> in the radial direction and forms a radial contact surface <b>14</b>.<b>5</b> and an axial contact surface <b>13</b>.<b>5</b> for sealing device <b>5</b>, while first sheet metal element <b>2</b>.<b>5</b> forms a contact surface <b>11</b>.<b>5</b> in the axial direction for sealing device <b>5</b> in the radial outer end region <b>8</b>.<b>5</b>, with its face <b>47</b> directed toward the second sheet metal element. In order to prevent an outward shift of a leakage flow from chamber <b>27</b>, pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, in the direction of the interior space <b>16</b> of the clutch arrangement, seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>5</b> is designed with one or more formed-on sealing lips <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>, which are arranged one behind the other in the direction of the leakage flow, in particular one behind the other in the radial direction, and which extend in the circumferential direction around the entire circumference of seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>5</b>, with the extension covering a certain diameter d<b>55</b> and d<b>56</b> for the individual sealing lips <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>these sealing lips <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> are produced by full beads. But a half-bead design is also conceivable.

<p id="p-0043" num="0041">The pre-tensioning at the individual seal locations, in particular sealing lips <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>, results here from the elastic deformation of the sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>5</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>5</b> during riveting. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>shows the condition before riveting, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>illustrates the condition after riveting.

The two sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>8</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>8</b> are designed with different thicknesses here, with sheet metal <b>3</b>.<b>8</b> simultaneously assuming the function of a wall, and thus a bearing function. Second sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>8</b> is designed as a thick, sturdy carrier plate that supports the compression forces.

Here too, both sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>17</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>17</b> are involved in forming the groove <b>4</b>.<b>17</b>, with sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>17</b> on the piston side forming an axial contact surface <b>13</b>.<b>17</b>, viewed in the installed position for the sealing device <b>61</b>, while the other second sheet metal element <b>2</b>.<b>17</b> forms a contact surface <b>11</b>.<b>17</b> oriented opposite the first axial contact surface <b>13</b>.<b>17</b> in the axial direction, and also a contact surface <b>12</b>.<b>17</b> in the radial direction. To that end, first sheet metal element <b>2</b>.<b>17</b> has a region facing in the radial direction. The second sheet metal element, in particular sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>17</b> on the piston side, is situated in the cylindrical region <b>76</b> in the radial direction in such a way that it is situated above first sheet metal element <b>2</b>.<b>17</b>. Sheet metal element <b>2</b>.<b>17</b> is in contact with sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>17</b> on the piston side, on the inner circumference as it were of the cylindrical region <b>76</b>. Viewed in cross section, the sheet metal element describes at least one quasi-L-shape in this region; preferably it is matched as closely as possible to the geometry of piston element <b>21</b>. Sheet metal element <b>2</b>.<b>17</b> extends only in the cylindrical region <b>76</b>, and over just a sub-region of the face of sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>17</b>. To limit the deformation of the clinched seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>17</b> due to the high pressure (maximum 20 bar) prevailing in the chamber <b>26</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, the seal retainer is braced against the stationary component <b>29</b>, which is formed by the outer plate carrier of the outer clutch K<b>2</b> in the radial direction. The region of the bracing, designated here as <b>78</b>, should be at the smallest possible distance from the sealing edge, i.e. the sealing devices <b>61</b>, in order to form the smallest possible effective lever arm.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0051">If the leakage path, which is sketched in with an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>, is obstructed by the seal by means of the sealing device <b>61</b> and the corresponding contact surface on sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>17</b>, no additional sealing is necessary between sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>17</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>17</b>. If this is not the case, the clinch connection must be pressure-tight. The second sealing device <b>75</b> is situated between piston hub <b>34</b> or the hollow shaft and the sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>17</b> on the piston side. The latter is responsible for the inner sealing of pressure chamber <b>26</b>. Advantageously, sheet metal part <b>3</b>.<b>17</b> is formed with a slope <b>79</b> in this region, so that a larger sealing region is produced between sealing device <b>75</b> and sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>17</b>. The radial fixing of seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>17</b> is performed by the cylindrical region formed on the inner circumference, i.e. a region <b>80</b> extending in the axial direction, which forms a surface area that describes an inner circumference, which acts together with piston hub <b>34</b> or the hollow shaft or is attached thereto, preferably for example by means of a compression connection. The axial bracing of seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>17</b> on the outer plate carrier is partially interrupted, to form a connection from compensating chamber <b>27</b> through overflow bore <b>81</b> to the rest of the clutch chamber. This provides for ventilation when filling the chamber <b>27</b>, which functions as a compensating chamber for the outer clutch, and as an overflow analogous to the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0052">The overflow function is depicted in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b </i>contains a cross section in accordance with that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, but not through the bracing but through the regions free of bracing. It is evident from this that an overflow <b>81</b> is ensured here.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an embodiment for sealing off the outer pressure chamber, in particular the chamber <b>30</b> pressurizable with a pressurizing agent according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Here too, seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>37</b> is fabricated as a two-piece seal retainer made of two sheet metal elements, sheet metal elements <b>3</b>.<b>37</b> and <b>2</b>.<b>37</b>. These are preferably connected to each other positively by means of a clinch connection. Other possibilities are also conceivable. Because of the prevailing pressures in the chamber <b>30</b> which is pressurizable with a pressurizing agent, and the pressure forces caused thereby, the total stiffness of the sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>37</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>37</b> and also their merger into one module is reduced, most especially in the seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>37</b>. Sealing arrangement <b>1</b>.<b>37</b> here includes a sealing device <b>61</b>, which is situated in the groove between the two sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>37</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>37</b>, where the two sheet metal elements preferably extend jointly over their entire extent from the outer to the inner circumference, forming two cylindrical zones <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> situated at an offset from each other in the radial direction, which are connected by means of a connecting region <b>83</b>, and form an integrated arrangement, and thus are combined into one reinforced sheet metal unit. In this case the groove <b>4</b>.<b>7</b> is formed between first sheet metal element <b>2</b>.<b>37</b> and second sheet metal element <b>3</b>.<b>37</b>. The embodiments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a </i>can be referenced for the design of the groove <b>4</b>.<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0054">The sheet metal unit in the form of seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>37</b> is essentially Z-shaped, viewed in cross section, with the radially outer cylindrical region <b>82</b> forming the groove <b>4</b>.<b>7</b>, while the radially inner region <b>84</b> also functions as sealing surface <b>85</b>. Sealing device <b>86</b> serves in this case to seal off pressure chamber <b>30</b>. The latter is situated between seal retainer <b>37</b>, which at the same time delimits pressure chamber <b>30</b>, and piston element <b>21</b>. The radially inner sealing device <b>86</b> is situated between a region of seal retainer <b>10</b>.<b>37</b> that forms an inner circumference, and piston hub <b>34</b>. Sealing device <b>86</b> is preferably in the form of an O-ring. This is integrated into a groove <b>88</b> in the piston hub.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0055">If the leakage path between the individual sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>37</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>37</b> is prevented at least one of the sealing edges that are formed at the contact surfaces of the sealing device, no other sealing measures are necessary between the sheet metal parts <b>2</b>.<b>37</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>37</b>. If the sealing effect is not sufficient, the clinch connection between sheet metal elements <b>2</b>.<b>37</b> and <b>3</b>.<b>37</b> takes over the job of sealing between the two sheet metal parts. The air passage of the piston is limited by an integrated stop <b>89</b>, which is advantageously made of plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 10</figref> show by way of example advantageous embodiments of the sealing arrangement according to the invention, in particular of the seal retainer on the output side of a dual clutch, to seal off the individual chambers, assigned to the actuating system, in particular pressure chambers and compensating chambers. The depicted embodiments are intended as examples, and at the same time represent advantageous designs. Other versions and deviations, in particular in designing the geometry of the seal retainer as viewed in cross section, comprise a great many possibilities, not all of which can be gone into in detail here, but which fall within the discretionary power of the responsible person skilled in the art, in particular as dictated by the space conditions and the requisite functions.</p>
