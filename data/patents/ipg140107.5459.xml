<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates to metrics determined based on preference information. More specifically, the invention relates to a variety of metrics that are determined based on preference information associated with respondents and are usable at least to evaluate products and/or markets.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">During the design of a product, a manufacturer must choose from among several available product features, or attributes, to include in the product. For each included attribute, a manufacturer must also choose an attribute level to associate with the attribute. Attribute levels that may be associated with the attribute &#x201c;color&#x201d; include &#x201c;black&#x201d;, &#x201c;white&#x201d;, &#x201c;blue&#x201d;, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Trade-off analysis techniques determine preference information associated with respondent consumers in an attempt to identify product configurations or combinations of attribute levels that promote a particular objective, such as value creation, value capturing, maximizing sales, maximizing profit, minimizing competitors' sales, etc. A respondent, in this regard, may be any entity having particular preferences for particular product attributes and attribute levels. Such respondents include individuals, businesses, and purchasing managers. Many techniques exist for determining preference information associated with respondents, including those discussed in above-mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09/754,612 and 09/845,051.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some conventional systems gather preference information by asking a respondent several questions regarding her product needs or her preferences for particular product features. The preference information is then used to identify a product that is arguably suited to the respondent. Other systems use gathered preference information to compare the relative attractiveness of products. For example, these systems allow comparison between the attractiveness of a Sony television priced at $599 and the attractiveness of a Magnavox television priced at $399. Such a comparison is possible because the preference information includes numerical values associated with respondent's preferences for each attribute and attribute level on which different products can be described and on which the products may vary among one another. Accordingly, the relative attractiveness of differences or changes in an attribute with respect to differences or changes in any other attribute can be determined simply by comparing appropriate associated numerical values. For example, the attractiveness of a price change from $599 to $399 may be compared with the attractiveness of a brand change from Magnavox to Sony.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Such usages of preference information are not particularly useful for making business decisions and for evaluating a product market, either because of inaccuracies or because they cannot provide answers to useful questions about a product market. Many potential users of current systems for processing preference information, including manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and market analysts, therefore do not believe that benefits provided by the current systems outweigh their costs. Consequently, what is needed is a system to process preference information that produces data that is more useful than that produced by current systems. Such a system may allow a manufacturer to choose product configurations, as well as production amounts and prices for each product configuration, which increase customer satisfaction, customer loyalty and overall profit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to address the foregoing, the present invention provides, in one aspect, a method, an apparatus, a system, a medium, and means to process preference information in which one or more acceptable changes are determined corresponding to one or more attribute levels of a comparison product, and a change in share of the comparison product is determined in a case that the comparison product is changed according to one or more of the one or more acceptable changes, wherein the determination of the change in share of the comparison product is based at least on the one or more acceptable changes and on preference information associated with a plurality of respondents.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, one or more acceptable changes are determined corresponding to one or more attribute levels of a comparison product, and a share of the comparison product is determined in a case that the comparison product is changed according to one or more of the one or more acceptable changes, wherein the determination of the share is based at least on the one or more of the one or more acceptable changes and on preference information associated with a plurality of respondents.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In yet another aspect, one or more acceptable changes are determined corresponding to one or more attribute levels of a comparison product, and, based at least on preference information associated with a respondent, a change in a normalized utility associated with a change in an attribute of the comparison product is determined, wherein the change comprises one or more of the one or more acceptable changes.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one aspect, one or more acceptable changes corresponding to one or more attributes of a comparison product are determined, and an amount willing to be paid for one or more of the one or more acceptable changes is determined based on preference information associated with a respondent.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In still another aspect, one or more acceptable changes corresponding to one or more attribute levels of a comparison product are determined, and, for each of a plurality of changes in price of the comparison product, a change in share in a case that the comparison product is changed according to the one or more acceptable changes is determined based on preference information associated with a respondent.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another aspect, preference information associated with a respondent is determined, attribute levels for one or more comparison products are determined, and a value relating a theoretical optimal product associated with the respondent and one of the one or more comparison products that is most preferred by the respondent is determined based on the preference information and on the attribute levels.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An aspect of the invention provides determination of preference information associated with a respondent, determination of attribute levels of each of one or more client's products and of each of one or more competitor's products, and determination, based on the preference information and on the attribute levels, of a value relating the respondent's preference for the attribute levels of a most-preferred one of the one or more client's products and the respondent's preference for the attribute levels of a most-preferred one of the one or more competitor's products.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one aspect, preference information associated with a plurality of respondents is determined, attribute levels that are unacceptable are determined for each of the plurality of respondents based on the preference information, and, for an attribute level, a percentage and/or an indication of a number of respondents for whom the attribute level is unacceptable is presented.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In yet another aspect, attribute levels of each of one or more client's products and of each of one or more competitor's products are determined, preference information associated with a respondent for whom at least one of the client's products is preferred over each of the one or more competitor's products is determined, and a value relating the respondent's preference for the at least one of the client's products and the respondent's preference for a most-preferred one of the one or more competitor's products is determined. According to this aspect, the competitor's products may be products of one or more competitors.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to other aspects, attribute levels of each of one or more client's products and of each of one or more competitor's products are determined, preference information associated with a respondent for whom at least one of the competitor's products is preferred over each of the one or more client's products is determined, and a value relating the respondent's preference for the at least one of the competitor's products and the respondent's preference for a most-preferred one of the one or more client's products is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other aspects, preference information associated with a plurality of respondents is determined, the preference information including preference information for a plurality of brands, one or more of the plurality of respondents for whom a first brand is a most-preferred brand is determined based on the preference information, and a value relating preferences of the one or more respondents for a second brand and preferences of the one or more respondents for the plurality of brands is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In still another aspect, preference information associated with a plurality of respondents is determined, the preference information including preference information for a plurality of brands, and values are determined, for each of the plurality of brands, relating preferences of one or more of the plurality of respondents for whom a brand is most-preferred to preferences of the one or more respondents for each of the remaining brands.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an aspect, the invention provides the determination of one or more attribute levels of a comparison product, the determination of one or more acceptable changes corresponding to one or more of the determined one or more attribute levels, determination of a cost of the one or more acceptable changes, determination of a willingness to pay for the one or more acceptable changes based on preference information associated with a respondent, and determination of a value representing a change in margin in a case that the comparison product is changed according to the one or more acceptable changes, based at least in part on the cost and the willingness to pay.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow diagram of process steps <b>10</b> according to embodiments of the invention. Process steps <b>10</b> will be described briefly below in the interest of providing an immediate introduction to features of the present invention. Accordingly, process steps <b>10</b> will be described later with respect to more specific examples and specific hardware and software embodiments, along with details of alternative embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Process steps <b>10</b> begin at step S<b>1</b>, in which preference information associated with one or more respondents is determined. The preference information may be determined by retrieving locally- or remotely-stored preference information, by receiving preference information from an external entity or by using a system such as those described in aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/754,612 to generate preference information. In this regard, the generated preference information may be pre-processed according to a system described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/845,051. Of course, other systems to determine preference information may be used in step S<b>1</b> in accordance with embodiments of the invention, with varying degrees of metric quality resulting therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">After the preference information is determined in step S<b>1</b>, a client may be presented with a choice of metrics. The client may be any entity desiring preference information-based metrics, including manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and market analysts. Moreover, the presented metrics may include one or more of: impact of change in attribute on change in share; impact of change in attribute on share; impact of change in attribute on change in normalized utility; willingness to pay; relation of price and share, given a change in an attribute; gap analysis; gap with competition; unacceptable attribute levels; vulnerability; clout; brand favorability; brand vulnerability; and change in margin due to acceptable change in comparison product. Descriptions of each of these metrics are set forth below. An employee or representative of the client selects a metric and the selection is received in step S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, in step S<b>3</b>, inputs that are required for determination of the selected metric are determined. It should be noted that the required inputs may vary from metric to metric. Accordingly, the determination of step S<b>3</b> comprises both identifying the types of inputs that are required for determination of the metric and also generating the actual inputs. The types of inputs may include information specifying respondents who the metric should reflect, attributes and attribute levels of the client's products and/or the client's competitors' products, acceptable changes to the client's products and/or to the competitors' products, as well as other information described below. Accordingly, the actual inputs may be generated by receiving all or a portion of the inputs from the client, from one or more competitors of the client, from a data repository, from local storage, from a respondent, or from another entity, and/or by calculating the inputs from received information.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In step S<b>4</b>, the selected metric is determined based on the inputs and on the determined preference information. Detailed steps for determining each of the above-listed metrics are described below and illustrated in the appended flow diagrams. It will be noted that the metrics described herein may be determined in more than one manner. Additionally, several of the metrics may be determined with respect to one or more respondents, one or more attributes, and/or one or more attribute levels.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The determined metric is presented to the client in step S<b>5</b>. The determined metric may be presented in any manner, including by transmitting a graph, chart or other indication of the metric to a client device in electronic format, by displaying such a graph, chart or indication on a device, or by sending a hardcopy of the graph, chart or indication to the client. Of course, the metric may be presented in step S<b>5</b> to an entity other than the entity from whom the selection was received in step S<b>2</b>. Also, an entity performing steps <b>10</b> may both input the selection and be presented with the metric.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Presentation of the metric may occur in many forms, many of which are illustrated by the attached figures. As a general example, a metric that was determined with respect to each of a plurality of respondents may be presented so as to indicate the mean or a distribution of the metric across the plurality of respondents. Also, a metric may be determined with respect to each of a plurality of attributes or attribute levels, with the presentation in step S<b>5</b> including presentation of the mean or distribution of each determined metric. Of course, various combinations of these presentation systems may also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It should be noted that process steps <b>10</b> need not be performed in the order illustrated. For example, step S<b>1</b> may be executed after the required inputs are determined in step S<b>3</b>. Advantageously, such an arrangement could avoid the determination of non-required preference information, if any. In some embodiments, some or all required inputs are determined between steps S<b>4</b> and S<b>5</b>, rather than in step S<b>3</b>. Also, in some embodiments, individual metrics are determined for a respondent as soon as preference information for the respondent is received. These metrics are stored and retrieved to determine requested aggregate metrics.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Network Architecture</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a topographic view of a network architecture according to embodiments of the present invention. Of course, many other architectures may be used to implement the invention. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is central system <b>200</b>, depicted as a mainframe computer. Central system <b>200</b> may be used to perform, for example, process steps <b>10</b> in order to process preference information according to embodiments described herein. Central system <b>200</b> may be operated by a company, such as assignee Blue Flame Data, Inc., providing valuable market data to manufacturers and/or other types of clients. It should be noted that many other types of computing hardware may be used to perform the functions of central system <b>200</b> described herein, including, but not limited to, a server, a workstation, a network, or any combination of one or more of the foregoing. Further details of central system <b>200</b> are set forth below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In communication with central system <b>200</b> are client systems <b>300</b> and <b>301</b>. Client systems <b>300</b> and <b>301</b> may be used to perform any functions required by a client, including scheduling, inventory tracking, billing, accounting, etc. Client systems <b>300</b> and <b>301</b> may also operate to transmit attributes and attribute levels for given products, preference information, and requests for metrics to central system <b>200</b>. Of course, central system <b>200</b> may receive these transmissions from other sources as well. Metrics are presented to client systems <b>300</b> and <b>301</b> by central system <b>200</b> over a communication link (e.g., the Internet), and the metrics may in turn be presented to a client. Any suitable device may be used as client systems <b>300</b> and <b>301</b>, including but not limited to a workstation, a mainframe computer, and a computer terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Data used to determine preference information may be transmitted to and/or received from respondents through respondent devices <b>400</b> and <b>401</b>. In one example, central system <b>200</b> embodies a system such as that disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/754,612 to produce preference information by transmitting questions to and receiving responses from respondents. However, such data may be transmitted to and received from a respondent device by a client system, such as client system <b>301</b>. In some embodiments, metrics may be requested by and presented to a respondent through respondent devices <b>400</b> and <b>401</b> by central system <b>200</b> or by a client system.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown, respondent devices <b>400</b> and <b>401</b> respectively comprise a personal digital assistant and a workstation. However, respondent devices <b>400</b> and <b>401</b> may include any device capable of presenting information, visually and/or aurally, and of transmitting information to an external device. Of course, respondent devices <b>400</b> and <b>401</b> should be able to communicate with the device or devices with which they are in communication over whatever types of network media exist between the devices.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Data repository <b>500</b> stores information usable by central system <b>200</b> in accordance with the processes described herein. The information may include preference information, product information including product attributes and attribute levels, respondent demographic information, and process steps executable to determine and/or present a metric. The information may be received by data repository <b>500</b> from other sources or may be generated, in whole or in part, by data repository <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Although the connections illustrated between the components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> appear dedicated, it should be noted that each of the connections may be shared by other components. Moreover, the connections may comprise one or more of a local area network, a wide area network, a virtual private network, a telephone network, a cellular network, a fiber-optic network, a satellite network, an infra-red network, a radio frequency network, or any other type of network which may be used to transmit information between devices. The information may be transmitted using any current or future protocol for transmitting information over the appropriate network. Additionally, the devices shown as in communication with other devices need not be constantly exchanging data, rather, the communication may be established when necessary and severed at other times or always available but rarely used to transmit data.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Central System</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of the internal architecture of central system <b>200</b> according to embodiments of the invention. As illustrated, central system <b>200</b> includes microprocessor <b>210</b> in communication with communication bus <b>220</b>. Microprocessor <b>210</b> may be a Pentium&#x2122;, RISC&#x2122;-based, or other type of processor and is used to execute processor-executable process steps so as to control the components of central system <b>200</b> to provide desired functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Also in communication with communication bus <b>220</b> is communication port <b>230</b>. Communication port <b>230</b> is used to transmit data to and to receive data from external devices. Communication port <b>230</b> is therefore preferably configured with hardware suitable to physically interface with desired external devices and/or network connections. In one embodiment, requests for metrics are received from and metrics are presented over communication port <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Input device <b>240</b>, display <b>250</b> and printer <b>260</b> are also in communication with communication bus <b>220</b>. Any known input device may be used as input device <b>240</b>, including a keyboard, mouse, touch pad, voice-recognition system, or any combination of these devices. Input device <b>240</b> may be used by an operator to input product-related information such as attributes and attribute levels, preference information, billing and transaction information, and commands to central system <b>200</b>. In this regard, a command may be input to central system <b>200</b> to present a chart to a client.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Such a report may be output to display <b>250</b>, which may be an integral or separate CRT display, flat-panel display or the like. Display <b>250</b> is used to output graphics and text to an operator in response to commands issued by microprocessor <b>210</b>. Printer <b>260</b> is also an output device, but produces a hardcopy of data using ink-jet, thermal, dot-matrix, laser, or other printing technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">RAM <b>270</b> is connected to communication bus <b>220</b> to provide microprocessor <b>210</b> with fast data storage and retrieval. In this regard, processor-executable process steps being executed by microprocessor <b>210</b> are typically stored temporarily in RAM <b>270</b> and executed therefrom by microprocessor <b>210</b>. ROM <b>280</b>, in contrast, provides storage from which data can be retrieved but to which data cannot be stored. Accordingly, ROM <b>280</b> is used to store invariant process steps and other data, such as basic input/output instructions and data used during system boot-up or to control communication port <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Data storage device <b>290</b> stores, among other data, processor-executable process steps of metrics server <b>292</b>. According to some embodiments, the process steps of metrics server <b>292</b> may be read from a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk, a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM, a Zip disk, a magnetic tape, or a signal encoding the process steps, and then stored in data storage device <b>290</b>. Microprocessor <b>210</b> executes instructions of server <b>292</b> to cause central system <b>200</b> to operate in accordance with the process steps described in detail herein. Of course, metrics server <b>292</b> need not include process steps to determine each metric described below.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Also included in metrics server <b>292</b> may be processor-executable process steps to provide a World Wide Web server. Such a Web server would allow central server <b>200</b> to communicate with devices executing a Web client (e.g., client devices <b>300</b> and <b>301</b> and respondent devices <b>400</b> and <b>401</b>) over the World Wide Web.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Metrics server <b>292</b> may be stored in data storage device <b>290</b> in a compressed, uncompiled and/or encrypted format. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, processor-executable process steps for implementation of the processes of the present invention. Thus, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Also stored in data storage device <b>290</b> is preference information database <b>294</b>. Preference information database <b>294</b> includes preference information associated with a plurality of respondents. As described above, the stored preference information associated with one or more respondents may be used to determine metrics. Usage of preference information database <b>294</b> is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Data storage device <b>290</b> also includes elements that may be necessary for operation of central system <b>200</b>, such as other applications, data files, an operating system, a database management system and &#x201c;device drivers&#x201d; for allowing microprocessor <b>210</b> to interface with devices in communication with communication port <b>230</b>. These program elements are known to those skilled in the art, and are therefore not described in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Client Device</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates several components of client system <b>300</b> according to some embodiments. The components may comprise any of the specific examples set forth above with respect to identically-named components of central system <b>200</b>. Of course, specific functions performed by the components may differ from the functions performed by the identically-named components.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this regard, communication port <b>330</b> may be used to transmit requests for metrics to central system <b>200</b> and to receive presented metrics therefrom. Input device <b>340</b> may be used to input product information, to establish communication with central system <b>200</b>, and to transmit a request for metrics to central system <b>200</b>. Received data presenting a metric may be output by display <b>350</b> or by printer <b>360</b>. Input device <b>340</b>, display <b>350</b> and printer <b>360</b> may also be used in conjunction with functionality provided by client system <b>300</b> that is unrelated to the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Data storage device <b>390</b> stores process steps of metrics client <b>392</b>, which is executed by microprocessor <b>310</b> to perform the steps attributed to client system <b>300</b> herein. Metrics client <b>392</b> may also include process steps of a Web client such as a Web browser that may be used to transmit and receive data over the Web. The latter feature is useful in a case that the invention is embodied in a Web-based system.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Also stored in data storage device <b>390</b> is product database <b>394</b>. Product database <b>394</b> includes information relating to products of interest to the entity operating client system <b>300</b>. For example, the products may be made or sold by the entity or by one or more competitors. The information includes attributes and attribute levels of the products, and may be obtained via input device <b>340</b> or from another device, such as data repository <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Data storage device <b>390</b> may also store application files, data files and system files other than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. These files may be used by client system <b>300</b> to provide various functionalities to a client in addition to those described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Preference Information Database</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A tabular representation of a portion of preference information database <b>294</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The information stored in preference information database <b>294</b> may be entered by an operator of central system <b>200</b> through input device <b>240</b>, may be generated by central system <b>200</b> using trade-off analysis techniques, and may be received from another device in communication with central system <b>200</b>. The information specifies, for individual respondents, utilities associated with product attribute levels. As is known in the field of trade-off analysis, a utility associated with a product attribute level represents a respondent's preference for the attribute level.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Identification field <b>510</b> of the illustrated tabular representation indicates a respondent and a product associated with the records of the tabular representation. Each record includes two fields, attribute field <b>512</b> and attribute level/associated utility field <b>514</b>. Attribute field <b>512</b> specifies an attribute of the product specified in identification field <b>510</b>, and attribute level/associated utility field <b>514</b> specifies attribute levels corresponding to an associated attribute as well as a utility associated with each specified attribute level. The illustrated utilities comprise stabilized and normalized preference information as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/845,051, but may also comprise unstabilized and normalized preference information, raw preference information or preference information according to any known format. For example, the associated utilities may be currency-normalized and, more specifically, dollar-normalized as described in application Ser. No. 09/845,051.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Some utilities associated with attribute levels in preference information database <b>294</b> comprise the symbol &#x201c;X&#x201d;. This symbol indicates that the associated attribute level is unacceptable to the associated respondent. Stated differently, any product including the associated attribute level would be unacceptable to the respondent. In the present example, the associated respondent would be unwilling to purchase any $65,000 car and any car providing 20 M.P.G.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">It should be noted that the information stored in preference information database <b>294</b> for a particular product may reflect fewer or more attributes and/or attribute levels than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Furthermore, it is contemplated that preference information database <b>294</b> may store information corresponding to a plurality of respondents and to a plurality of products for each respondent. Preference information database <b>294</b> may include preference information as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that is associated with a plurality of respondents. This aggregate preference information may be determined by computing an arithmetic mean of preference information associated with each of the plurality of respondents or in another manner. In such a case, identification field <b>510</b> also indicates the plurality of respondents.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Product Database</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a tabular representation of a portion of product database <b>394</b>. As described above, the information stored in product database <b>394</b> specifies attributes and attribute levels of particular products. It should be noted that an attribute level may comprise any value that may be associated with a particular attribute. The information may be entered by an operator of client system <b>300</b> through input device <b>340</b> or may be received from another device. The particular products may include existing or hypothetical products made or sold by the entity operating client system <b>300</b>, made or sold by one or more competitors, or otherwise of interest to the entity.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Specifically, product database <b>394</b> includes several records and associated fields. The fields include product category field <b>610</b>, product field <b>620</b>, horsepower field <b>630</b>, miles per gallon (M.P.G). field <b>640</b>, color field <b>650</b>, brand field <b>660</b>, price field <b>670</b>, client product flag field <b>680</b> and existing product flag field <b>690</b>. Product category field <b>610</b> specifies the type of products represented in the portion of database <b>394</b>, and product field <b>620</b> of a record specifies an identifier of a product associated with the record. The remaining fields of the particular record specify attribute levels of the product, whether the product is a product of the client (otherwise the product may be considered a product of a competitor) and whether the product is an existing product (otherwise the product may be considered a future and/or hypothetical product).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the tabular representations and accompanying descriptions of the databases merely represent relationships between stored information. A number of other arrangements may be employed besides those shown. Similarly, the entries of the tabular representations represent sample information only; those skilled in the art will understand that a number and content of the entries may differ.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Determination of Metrics</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The determination of each metric is described below with respect to a corresponding flow diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Impact of Change in Attribute on Change in Share</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram of process steps <b>700</b> according to one embodiment for determining the metric &#x201c;impact of change in attribute on change in share&#x201d;. Although process steps <b>10</b>, process steps <b>700</b> and the other process steps described herein are described as being performed by central system <b>200</b> through execution of processor-executable process steps of metrics server <b>292</b> by microprocessor <b>210</b>, the process steps may also be performed, in whole or in part, by one or more of central system <b>200</b>, client devices <b>300</b> and <b>301</b>, respondent devices <b>400</b> and <b>401</b>, other devices, and manual means.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">This particular metric is intended to reflect the sensitivity of a share with respect to a change to one or more attributes of the product. Typically, a client is interested in modifying a particular proposed product or existing product (referred to herein as the comparison product) in order to increase a market share and/or sales of the product. Such modifications may also attempt to anticipate effects of possible changes to competing products of a competitor. Accordingly, this metric is determined based on attribute levels of products defining the market, the contemplated modifications (referred to as acceptable changes) to the comparison product, and preference information associated with respondents of interest. This metric may also be used to indicate the relative importance of some or all of a product's attributes. Moreover, the metric may be calculated so as to indicate a change in share of more than one comparison product due to changes to the more than one comparison product.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Prior to process steps <b>700</b>, a request for the present metric is received from client system <b>300</b>. In response, preference information associated with respondents of interest is determined in step S<b>701</b>. As mentioned above with respect to step S<b>1</b> of process steps <b>10</b>, preference information may be determined in step S<b>701</b> using the techniques described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/754,612 or using conventional techniques for determining preference information associated with respondents. The preference information may also be determined simply by receiving the preference information from any source, such as data repository <b>500</b>, or by retrieving stored preference information from preference information database <b>294</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The respondents of interest may comprise all respondents for whom preference information is available, or may be a set of respondents defined according to any criteria, such as demographics, purchasing history, time period/order in which preference information was obtained, or the like. In some embodiments, respondents of interest are those associated with preference information indicating one or more traits, such as preference for a particular attribute level or product. In these embodiments, preference information is analyzed in step S<b>701</b> to determine if the associated respondent is of interest. Criteria for determining the respondents of interest may be received from client system <b>300</b> along with the request for the present metric prior to process steps <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Next, in step S<b>702</b>, attribute levels of each product of interest are determined. The attribute levels are determined by initially identifying the products of interest. As mentioned above, the products may include those products comprising a relevant market or part of a relevant market to be analyzed. These products may include one or more of the client's products and competitors' products. Once the products are identified, attribute levels of the products are determined by retrieving the attribute levels from sources such as data storage device <b>290</b>, by requesting and receiving the attribute levels from other sources such as data repository <b>500</b> and product database <b>394</b>, and/or by generating the attribute levels from other available product information, such as information received from an operator of client device <b>300</b>. The determination of step S<b>702</b> also includes determination of a comparison product, which may also be specified by client system <b>300</b> along with the request for the metric.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Acceptable changes to the comparison product are determined in step S<b>703</b>. The acceptable changes may also be received from client system <b>300</b> along with the request for the metric. According to some embodiments, an acceptable change is a change in an attribute of the comparison product. Advantageously, an acceptable change need not be a change from a most-preferred attribute level to a least-preferred attribute level or vice-versa, but may comprise a change from one attribute level to any other attribute level, with resulting metrics sometimes differing depending on the original and changed attribute levels. For a continuous attribute, such as M.P.G., an acceptable change may be a relative increase or decrease in an attribute level of the attribute, such as +5 M.P.G. For discontinuous attributes, such as color, an acceptable change may be a change to a particular attribute level. Although each metric described herein may be determined with respect to one or more acceptable changes, the flow diagrams used herein to describe the determination of metrics concern one acceptable change.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In step S<b>704</b>, a total utility for each product of interest is determined for each respondent. Specifically, for each respondent, utilities associated with each attribute level of a product of interest may be summed to determine, for each respondent, a total utility associated with the product. This process is repeated for each product of interest, including the comparison product. For some continuous attributes, an attribute level of a comparison product as changed according to an acceptable change might not reflect an attribute level for which a corresponding utility is known. In this case interpolation may be used to determine a utility for the reflected attribute level.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Next, a most-preferred product is identified for each respondent in step S<b>705</b> by identifying, for each respondent, a product that the respondent associates with a highest total utility. In step S<b>706</b>, a total is generated for each product of interest reflecting a number of respondents for whom the product was identified in step S<b>706</b> as most-preferred. These totals are then used in step S<b>707</b> to determine a share of the comparison product. As a simple illustration, it is assumed that products A, B, C and D are of interest, with product A being the comparison product. Corresponding totals determined in step S<b>706</b> are as follows: A=100; B=25; C=75; D=200. Therefore, the share of the comparison product determined in step S<b>707</b> is 100/(100+25+75+200)=25%. As can be seen from this example, the share of each product of interest is determined in step S<b>707</b> according to some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The comparison product is substituted with the comparison product as changed according to one or more of the acceptable changes in step S<b>708</b>. That is, the attribute levels of the comparison product are changed according to one or more of the acceptable changes. Next, in steps S<b>709</b> and S<b>710</b>, the processes of steps S<b>704</b> through S<b>707</b> are repeated for the new set of products of interest, which are identical to the original products of interest except for the changed comparison product. Accordingly, after step S<b>710</b>, a share of the changed comparison product has been determined.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">A change in share of the comparison product in a case that the comparison product is changed according to the one or more acceptable changes is determined in step S<b>711</b>. The change in share may be determined by subtracting the share determined in step S<b>707</b> from the share determined in step S<b>710</b>. In a case that a share of each product of interest was determined in step S<b>707</b>, a change in share of each of these products may also be determined in step S<b>711</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Of course, the present metric may be determined differently than described above. For example, steps S<b>701</b> to S<b>703</b> may be performed in a different order, and the specific manner in which each step is performed may differ across embodiments. In some embodiments, determination of a most-preferred product of a respondent in step S<b>705</b> includes an analysis of whether a product includes an attribute level that is unacceptable to the respondent. If so, the product cannot be considered a most-preferred product of the respondent, regardless of a total utility to the respondent of the product's acceptable attribute levels. This feature provides, in some instances, a more accurate metric than would otherwise be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>is a view of presentation <b>810</b> illustrating an embodiment of the metric determined according to process steps <b>700</b>.

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Presentation <b>810</b> illustrates, for each of several attributes, a change in share of a comparison product in a case that the comparison product is changed according to an acceptable change in the attribute. Accordingly, each change in share shown in presentation <b>810</b> was determined for one acceptable change to the illustrated comparison product. It should be noted that, for each presentation described herein except those associated with the &#x201c;relation of price and share, given a change in attribute&#x201d; metric, the displayed metrics reflect only one acceptable change to an attribute of a comparison product. Each metric may, however, be determined with respect to more than one acceptable change to a comparison product. Moreover, each presentation reflects only one comparison product.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Specifically, presentation <b>810</b> indicates how a change in an attribute of a comparison product can affect sales of various products in a market of interest.

Such a presentation is particularly useful to a client since price is an attribute that can be changed easily and even after a product is manufactured. Presentation <b>850</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>e </i>indicates that a change in price of the comparison product will result in an approximately linear decrease in share of the comparison product.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Presentation <b>860</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>f </i>shows a change in profit based on an addition of a new product to a set of products. Specifically, a client considering to offer a new car uses presentation <b>860</b> to determine a net effect of the new car on its profitability. Presentation <b>860</b> shows that offering the new car would erode profit in the client's other product lines and cause a net decrease in profit to the client. To calculate the profits, a profit margin per sale of each product is determined based on information received from the client or from another source, or by subtracting a cost for a product from a market price of the product. The profit margin of each product is multiplied by the share of the product calculated in steps S<b>707</b> and S<b>711</b> (the share before the acceptable change and the share after the acceptable change) and this product is multiplied by the number of respondents used to determine the shares. In some embodiments, respondents for whom all products include an unacceptable attribute level are not included in the determination of share and are therefore not included in the aforementioned number.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>g </i>shows presentation <b>870</b>. Presentation <b>870</b> illustrates a relationship between a share, a total profit and a profit margin per product. Each of these variables may be determined as described above.

For example, an attribute may be flagged if a statistical measurement such as a standard deviation of respondents' utilities associated with the attribute falls outside a specified threshold. The statistical measurement may be presented upon client selection of the flag. Additionally, a flag may be presented if a certain number or percentage of respondents find a particular attribute level unacceptable. Such a flag may be presented adjacent to products including the particular attribute level, and may be selectable by a client to provide the number or percentage to the client.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Impact of Change in Attribute on Share</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Process steps <b>900</b> provide one embodiment of a determination of the metric &#x201c;impact of change in attribute on share&#x201d;. This metric is intended to illustrate a percentage of respondents that would select a particular product from a given set of products. Advantageously, the previously-described metric indicates how shares might change based on a change to a product, and the present metric enables a client to learn where a change in share comes from/goes to. Questions that may be answered by this metric include &#x201c;Does or would the comparison product actually draw customers from the competitors' products?&#x201d;, &#x201c;To what extent does the comparison product cannibalize sales of the client's other products?&#x201d;, &#x201c;Which of the competitors' products gain/lose share?&#x201d;, and &#x201c;How much share do the products gain/lose?&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Prior to process steps <b>900</b>, as well as prior to any other of the process steps described below, a request for a metric may be received. The request may specify a desired metric and may also include information specifying respondents of interest, preference information, and other required inputs such as one or more comparison products, one or more acceptable changes to the one or more comparison products, and attribute levels of products of interest. Of course, such information may be determined in any other manner, including any of those mentioned herein. According to process steps <b>900</b>, only one comparison product is specified.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Preference information associated with respondents of interest is determined in step S<b>901</b>, and one or more acceptable changes to a comparison product are determined in step S<b>902</b>. These steps may proceed as described with respect to steps S<b>701</b> and S<b>703</b>, respectively. Next, in step S<b>903</b>, attribute levels are determined for each product of interest, with the attribute levels of the comparison product being changed according to one or more of the one or more acceptable changes. More particularly, attribute levels are determined for each product of a market of interest, including a comparison product as changed according to one or more of the acceptable changes. As mentioned in relation to step S<b>702</b>, the attribute levels may be determined from sources such as data storage device <b>290</b>, data repository <b>500</b>, and product database <b>394</b>, and/or by generating the attribute levels from other available product information.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A total utility of each product of interest is determined for each respondent in step S<b>904</b> based on the determined preference information. Next, a most-preferred product is identified for each respondent in step S<b>905</b> and, for each product, a number of respondents for whom the product is most-preferred is totaled in step S<b>906</b>. Specific details of one embodiment of steps S<b>904</b> through S<b>906</b> are set forth with respect to steps S<b>704</b> through S<b>706</b> of process steps <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">A share of the changed comparison product is determined in step S<b>907</b> by dividing a total number of respondents for whom the changed product is most-preferred by the total number of respondents.

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As described with respect to steps S<b>706</b> and S<b>710</b>, determination of a most-preferred product of a respondent in step S<b>905</b> may include an analysis of whether a product includes an attribute level that is unacceptable to the respondent.

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Impact of Change in Attribute on Change in Normalized Utility</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The present metric shows a change in individual or aggregate utility that results from an acceptable change in one or more attributes of one or more comparison products. Process steps <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> set forth one embodiment for determining the metric.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Flow begins at step S<b>1101</b>, in which preference information is determined for respondents of interest. Attribute levels of a comparison product are determined in step S<b>1102</b>, and an acceptable change to an attribute of the comparison product is determined in step S<b>1103</b>. In some embodiments, the respondents of interest must be respondents for whom all attribute levels of the comparison product and of the comparison product as changed according to the acceptable change are acceptable attribute levels. For each respondent of interest, a total utility of the comparison product is determined in step S<b>1104</b>. Next, in step S<b>1105</b>, a total utility of the comparison product as changed according to the acceptable change is determined for each respondent. A difference between the utility determined in step S<b>1104</b> and the utility determined in step S<b>1105</b> is determined for each respondent in step S<b>1106</b>, and a mean and/or distribution measure of the determined differences is calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">It should be noted that process steps <b>1100</b> may be performed with respect to acceptable changes to more than one attribute level. In such a case, the total utility determined in step S<b>1105</b> is a total utility of the comparison product as changed according to the acceptable changes.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>a </i>shows presentation <b>1210</b>, which illustrates a change in utility for each of several changes to a comparison product. Presentation <b>1210</b> indicates that the one or more respondents value the specified improvement in price more than the specified changes to the other attributes. It should be noted that each bar in presentation <b>1210</b> is associated with a change in utility resulting from a change in a single attribute of a comparison product. Accordingly, to produce presentation <b>1210</b>, four iterations of process steps <b>1100</b> would be performed, with each iteration involving a single change to a different attribute of the comparison product. It should also be noted that presentation <b>1210</b> may reflect a single respondent of interest or aggregate utilities of a plurality of respondents. In the case of a plurality of respondents, a product may be flagged if the utilities associated with the product deviate by more than a specified range, if the product includes an attribute level that is unacceptable to a threshold number of respondents, or if some other threshold of interest is exceeded.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>b </i>shows presentation <b>1220</b>, illustrating a change in utility with respect to a plurality of changes in a single attribute. Presentation <b>1220</b> illustrates that improving the M.P.G. attribute level from 45 causes an approximately linear increase in value of the comparison product, and that decreasing the level to 40 results in a sharper decrease in value of the product. To produce presentation <b>1220</b>, four iterations of process steps <b>1100</b> would be performed, with each iteration involving a single change to the single attribute of the comparison product. Again, presentation <b>1220</b> may reflect a single respondent of interest or aggregate utilities of a plurality of respondents. The illustrated change in normalized utility corresponding to 45 M.P.G. equals zero because the comparison product includes the attribute level 45 M.P.G.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Presentation <b>1230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>c </i>is similar to presentation <b>1220</b>, as presentation <b>1230</b> indicates a change in utility with respect to a plurality of changes in a single attribute. However, presentation <b>1230</b> also indicates, for each change in the attribute, a distribution of the metric over all respondents of interest. Therefore, while a wide bar illustrates an aggregate utility value, superimposed thin bars show a range (e.g., one standard deviation) of respondents' utility values that were used to determine the aggregate value. Presentation <b>1230</b> indicates, among other things, that respondents are in relative agreement regarding the value of M.P.G. in the comparison product for values other than 60 M.P.G.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Presentation <b>1240</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>d </i>indicates a percentage of respondents associated with each of a plurality of changes in normalized utility as a result of a particular change to an attribute. Presentation <b>1240</b> may be generated using differences, determined in step S<b>1106</b>, in individual respondents' normalized utilities resulting from the particular change. Of course, the particular change may include changes to more than one attribute. In this example, there is a wide, asymmetric distribution of the change in normalized utility indicating that customer reaction would not be uniform if the M.P.G. attribute level of the comparison product were changed as reflected in presentation <b>1240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Unacceptable attribute levels are reflected in presentation <b>1250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>e. </i>Presentation <b>1250</b> is similar to presentation <b>1220</b>, but superimposed at each attribute level is an indication of a percentage of the respondents of interest for whom the attribute level is unacceptable. In this example, over 40% of respondents will not accept a product having an attribute level of 40 M.P.G. Such an indication may, for example, play a role in determining whether to change a level of the M.P.G. attribute in next year's model.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Finally, presentation <b>1260</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>f </i>shows price sensitivity for the comparison product and the utility of the most-preferred product assuming that the comparison product is not changed. In this regard, the greater the difference in total utility between two products, the higher the likelihood that the product with the higher total utility will be purchased. Presentation <b>1260</b> also shows the price sensitivity of a particular respondent in relation to the price sensitivity of an average respondent. In this example, the particular respondent is less price-sensitive than the average respondent.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Willingness to Pay</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The &#x201c;willingness to pay&#x201d; metric indicates an amount of money a respondent is willing to pay for a change in a comparison product. This metric is closely related to the &#x201c;impact of change in attribute on change in utility&#x201d; metric in a case that the utility is a currency-normalized utility. However, the determination of the present metric is believed to more accurately reflect a &#x201c;willingness to pay&#x201d; because the metric is based on the whole utility curve of the price attribute rather than a specific part of it.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> includes process steps <b>1300</b> to determine the present metric. Steps S<b>1301</b> through S<b>1303</b> proceed similarly to steps S<b>1101</b> through S<b>1103</b> of process steps <b>1100</b>. More specifically, preference information associated with respondents of interest is determined, attribute levels of a comparison product are determined, and an acceptable change to an attribute of the comparison product is determined. In some embodiments of step S<b>1303</b>, more than one acceptable change is determined; one change is considered in the present example for simplicity of explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In step S<b>1304</b>, a utility of the price of the comparison product is determined for each respondent, and, in step S<b>1305</b>, a utility of the attribute of the comparison product is determined for each respondent. These two utilities are summed in step S<b>1306</b> to determine a summed utility for the attribute of the comparison product. Next, and also for each respondent, it is assumed that the attribute of the comparison product is changed according to the acceptable change and the utility of the changed attribute is determined in step S<b>1307</b> for each respondent.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In step S<b>1308</b>, a utility associated with the price of the changed comparison product is determined for each respondent. This utility is determined by subtracting the determined utility of the changed attribute from the summed utility of the comparison product. For example, attribute levels &#x201c;$30,000&#x201d; and &#x201c;25 M.P.G.&#x201d; of a comparison product may correspond to utilities &#x201c;500&#x201d; and &#x201c;50&#x201d;. Also, an assumed acceptable change to the attribute &#x201c;M.P.G.&#x201d; results in the attribute level &#x201c;35 M.P.G.&#x201d;, which corresponds to a utility of &#x201c;200&#x201d;. Therefore, the utility determined in step S<b>1308</b> for this respondent and this acceptable change is (500+50)&#x2212;200=350.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In step S<b>1309</b>, a price is determined corresponding to each utility determined in step S<b>1308</b>. The prices may be determined by any appropriate reverse interpolation process. Next, in step S<b>1310</b> a willingness to pay is determined for each respondent and for each acceptable change by subtracting the price of the comparison product from each price determined in step S<b>1309</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">According to the foregoing process, the price of the changed product is calculated so that the total utility of the changed product is at least equal to the total utility of the comparison product. Such a requirement is intended to ensure that the changed product is at least as attractive to a respondent as the comparison product. Therefore, the foregoing process may be most accurate in determining a willingness to pay if the comparison product, for each respondent, is a product that the respondent is willing to buy.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Presentation <b>1410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a </i>illustrates a willingness to pay for an acceptable change to each of several attributes. The information presented by presentation <b>1410</b> may be determined by performing process steps <b>1300</b> once for each attribute change. Presentation <b>1410</b> may reflect a willingness to pay of a single respondent or of a plurality of respondents. It should be noted that an increase in horsepower from 300 to 400 elicits a greater willingness to pay than each of the other three illustrated acceptable changes, and a change from Blue to Red makes the comparison product less valuable to a respondent.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b </i>illustrates presentation <b>1420</b>, which shows a willingness to pay for several incremental changes to a single attribute. To determine the data shown in presentation <b>1420</b>, one iteration of process steps <b>1300</b> would be performed for each change to the single attribute (e.g., M.P.G.) of the comparison product. Again, the data may reflect a single respondent or a plurality of respondents. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b</i>, a rate of increase of M.P.G. is relatively non-linear around 30 M.P.G. and 40 M.P.G.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>c </i>shows presentation <b>1430</b>, which illustrates the data shown in presentation <b>1410</b> in addition to a distribution of the metric over all respondents of interest for each change in an attribute. More specifically, each wide bar illustrates an aggregate willingness to pay, and each superimposed thin bar show a range (e.g., one standard deviation) of respondents' willingnesses to pay that were used to determine the aggregate value.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Presentation <b>1440</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>d </i>shows a respondent's willingness to pay for various features, as well as a market price and a cost to the client of the feature. Presentation <b>1440</b> can therefore be used to determine potential additional features for the comparison product. Accordingly, presentation <b>1440</b> is particularly useful for a salesman selling the comparison product to a particular customer. For example, the market price for a sunroof is $2000, the cost is $1600, and an estimated willingness to pay for the sunroof is $600. Accordingly, there is little reason to bother offering a sunroof to the respondent because the respondent would only accept the sunroof for a price well below it's cost. However, the market price for GPS is $1200, the cost is $960, and an estimated willingness to pay is $1100. Therefore, the respondent could be offered GPS for a discount price less than or equal to $1100 and more than or equal to $960.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">If the cost to the client for changing an attribute is known, a price gap between the market price and the respondent's willingness to pay for the change can be shown using presentation <b>1440</b>. The present metric thereby shows the client how much of a discount must be given in order for the respondent to agree to buy the changed product. Even if the market price is unknown, the metric can still be used to help the client judge whether to offer the respondent the original product or the changed product.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Relation of Price and Share Given a Change in an Attribute</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The present metric is intended to assist in illustrating a relationship between changes in price and changes in share. The metric may therefore be used to determine whether a certain enhancement to a product should be made, given that the market price of that product must be increased in view of the enhancement. For example, a client may use the metric &#x201c;impact of change in attributes on change in shares&#x201d; to judge the importance of certain changes in attributes. However, a change that improves an attribute often implies a price increase and a corresponding decrease in utility that may or may not offset an increase in utility of the changed attribute. Similarly, a change that diminishes an attribute decreases a utility corresponding to the attribute but often implies a price decrease and a corresponding increase in utility of the price attribute. Therefore, it is useful to also consider a change in share due to a change in price.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Process steps <b>1500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> set forth one process for determining the present metric. Flow begins at step S<b>1501</b>, in which preference information is determined for respondents of interest. Attribute levels of each product of interest, including a comparison product, are determined in step S<b>1502</b>. Next, a change to the comparison product and a price range are determined in steps S<b>1503</b> and S<b>1504</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Of course, steps S<b>1501</b> through S<b>1504</b> may be performed in any order, and the determinations therein may proceed according to any method described herein. In one example, a client requests the present metric from central system <b>200</b> and specifies information including a comparison product, a change to the comparison product, a price range, a relevant market, and a description of respondents of interest. Attribute levels for products comprising the market and preference information of the respondents are then retrieved by central system <b>200</b> in response to the request and information.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Steps S<b>1505</b> through S<b>1508</b> proceed similarly to steps S<b>704</b> through S<b>707</b> of process steps <b>700</b>. Accordingly, after step S<b>1508</b>, a share of the comparison product is known. The comparison product is replaced in step S<b>1509</b> by a product identical to the comparison product except for the change determined in step S<b>1503</b>. Then, in step S<b>1510</b>, steps S<b>1505</b> through S<b>1508</b> are repeated to determine a share of the changed comparison product.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Steps S<b>1509</b> and S<b>1510</b> are repeated for the changed comparison product, which is associated with a different price within the price range. For example, the determined price range may be $0 to $500 greater than the comparison product. Accordingly, when steps S<b>1509</b> and S<b>1510</b> are originally repeated, the changed comparison product is associated with a price $50 greater than the price of the comparison product. In subsequent iterations of steps S<b>1509</b> and S<b>1510</b>, only the price of the changed comparison product is increased. As a result, after step S<b>1511</b>, a share of the changed comparison product is determined for each of several prices over the price range.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Changes in share over the price range are determined in step S<b>1512</b>. The change in share is determined by subtracting, for each of the several prices over the price range, a share of the comparison product determined in step S<b>1508</b> from a share of the changed product at the price. The changes may be presented in presentation <b>1610</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Presentation <b>1610</b> illustrates a projected change in share of the comparison product for each of several changes in price of the comparison product in cases where the attribute &#x201c;M.P.G.&#x201d; of the comparison product is increased by 15 M.P.G. As shown, the change in share is approximately linear with respect to changes in price.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In some embodiments, process steps <b>1500</b> are performed for several changes to an attribute. More particularly, process steps <b>1500</b> may be performed for more than one change to an attribute at each price of the price range.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Gap Analysis</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The metric &#x201c;gap analysis&#x201d; allows a client to evaluate a fit between the client's current product line and a theoretical optimal product of one or more respondents. If the fit is poor, the client may decide to revise its product line to better meet its customers' preferences. Process steps <b>1700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> provide one system for determining this metric.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Specifically, in step S<b>1701</b>, preference information is determined for respondents of interest. In some embodiments, the respondents of interest are the client's existing customers. In some embodiments, the respondents of interest are respondents for whom one of the client's products is more preferred than all other products in the relevant market, regardless of whether or not the respondents are customers of the client. Attribute levels of each product of interest are determined in step S<b>1702</b>. As described above, the products of interest may comprise the client's product line, but may also comprise a competitor's product line, a set of competitors' products, or another group of products.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">A total utility of each product of interest is determined for each respondent in step S<b>1703</b>, and a most-preferred product of the products of interest is determined for each respondent in step S<b>1704</b>. Next, in step S<b>1705</b>, a theoretical optimal product is determined for each respondent. The theoretical optimal product of a respondent is a theoretical product that possesses, for each attribute, the attribute levels that the respondent associates with the highest utility. Of course, for some respondents the theoretical optimal product may correspond to an actual product. A theoretical optimal product for a respondent may also be specified by a client.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In step S<b>1706</b>, a value is determined for each respondent relating the respondent's theoretical optimal product with the respondent's most-preferred product. In some embodiments, the value is calculated by subtracting the respondent's total utility for the respondent's most-preferred product from the respondent's total utility for the respondent's theoretical optimal product, and by dividing the difference by the respondent's total utility for the respondent's theoretical optimal product. In other embodiments, the value is calculated simply by subtracting the respondent's total utility for the respondent's most-preferred product from the respondent's total utility for the respondent's theoretical optimal product. An aggregate value may be determined by computing the mean of the values determined for each respondent.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Presentation <b>1810</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>a </i>shows the value described above as well as attribute-specific values of the present metric. As shown, each illustrated attribute contributes approximately a same amount to discrepancies between the theoretical optimal product and the base product. These attribute-specific values are determined in some embodiments by identifying, for each respondent, a most-preferred product of the products of interest and by determining values as in step S<b>1706</b> relating each utility of the attributes of the most-preferred product with utilities of respective attributes of the theoretical optimal product. It should be noted that presentation <b>1810</b> may reflect values associated with a single respondent or a plurality of respondents. Also, presentation <b>1810</b> may include an indication of a number or a percentage of respondents for whom each of the products of interest include an unacceptable attribute level.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Presentation <b>1820</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>b </i>illustrates, for two different sets of products of interest, a percentage of respondents for whom a particular value was determined in step S<b>1706</b>. As shown, one set of products is a client's current product line, while the second set of products is a proposed replacement product line. Accordingly, presentation <b>1820</b> may be used to determine whether or not to make changes to an existing product line. As shown, it may be beneficial to replace the current product line because the determined gap for the replacement line is smaller for more respondents than the determined gap for the current product line.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Gap with Competition</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The &#x201c;gap with competition&#x201d; metric may relate a difference between a client's most-preferred product with a most-preferred product of one or more competitors. According to process steps <b>1900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, determination of the metric begins with a determination of preference information of a respondent of interest. Next, in step S<b>1902</b>, attribute levels are determined for one or more client's products and one or more competitors' products. For each respondent, a total utility of each of the one or more client's products and of the one or more competitors' products (i.e., the &#x201c;products of interest&#x201d;) is determined in step S<b>1903</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In step S<b>1904</b>, a most-preferred of the client's products and a most-preferred of the competitors' products is determined for each respondent. Such a determination may be performed by analyzing the total utilities determined in step S<b>1903</b>. Next, in step S<b>1905</b>, a value relating the most-preferred of the client's products and the most-preferred of the competitors' products is determined for each respondent. In some embodiments, the value is determined by subtracting a respondent's total utility for the respondent's most-preferred competitors' product from the respondent's total utility for the respondent's most-preferred client's product, and by dividing the difference by the respondent's total utility for the respondent's most-preferred client's product. Of course, values relating the two most-preferred products may be determined in other manners, such as by only subtracting a respondent's total utility for the respondent's most-preferred competitors' product from the respondent's total utility for the respondent's most-preferred client's product.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref><i>a </i>includes presentation <b>2010</b>, which shows a gap with competition index for a most-preferred product of the client and for a most-preferred product of a competitor, represented by the indication &#x201c;Total Product&#x201d;. As shown, the most-preferred competitor's product is associated with more utility for the respondent or respondents reflected in presentation <b>2010</b> than the most-preferred product of the client. However, presentation <b>2010</b> shows that the difference between the two products is relatively small. Also shown are that GPS and brand are the attributes that most contributed to the competitor's product's advantage over the client's product, while acceleration is the only attribute for which the client's product is &#x201c;better&#x201d; than the competitor's product. In some embodiments, presentation <b>2010</b> shows a number or percentage of people for whom all of the client's products contain an unacceptable attribute level, and/or a number or percentage of people for whom all of the competitors' products contain an unacceptable attribute level.</p>

<p id="p-0177" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref><i>c </i>illustrates a percentage of respondents associated with each of several Gap indexes. Specifically, presentation <b>1030</b> indicates that respondents of interest basically fall into two categories&#x2014;those who prefer the client product line with an index of greater than 0.1 and those who prefer the competitor product line with an index of less than &#x2212;0.1. Few of the respondents are indifferent.</p>

<p id="p-0179" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates process steps <b>2100</b> to determine the metric &#x201c;unacceptable attribute levels&#x201d;. This metric is intended to provide a client with an idea of unacceptable attribute levels specified in preference information.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Initially, preference information of respondents of interest is determined in step S<b>2101</b>. Next, attribute levels that are unacceptable are determined for each respondent in step S<b>2102</b>. In step S<b>2103</b>, a percentage of respondents for whom an attribute level is unacceptable is determined for each of a plurality of attribute levels.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Presentation <b>2210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates the metric determined in process steps <b>2100</b>. As shown, each attribute level is associated with a percentage of respondents for whom the attribute level is unacceptable. Attribute levels $40,000 and 20 M.P.G. are unacceptable to a large percentage of respondents. Of course, a raw number or another measure may be used instead of a percentage.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Vulnerability</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Typically, a client is interested in the changes of share due to an attribute change in one or more of its products. These changes in share do not show, however, how the client's competitive advantage changes among the relevant products. Accordingly, the present metric may be used to show how &#x201c;close&#x201d; a client's customers are to switching from a product of the client's product line to a product of the competitor's product line.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows process steps <b>2300</b> for determining the vulnerability metric. In step S<b>2301</b>, attribute levels are determined for one or more client's products and for one or more competitor's products. As described above, it may be useful if the products for which attribute levels are determined are products comprising a particular market. Preference information is then determined in step S<b>2302</b> for respondents of interest, who are defined as those respondents who prefer at least one of the client's products to each of the one or more competitor's products.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Next, in step S<b>2303</b>, a total utility of each of the one or more client's products and of the one or more competitor's products is determined for each respondent of interest. Using the determined utilities, a most-preferred of the one or more client's products and a most-preferred of the one or more competitor's products are determined for each respondent in step S<b>2304</b>. A value is determined for each respondent of interest in step S<b>2305</b> relating the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more client's products and the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more competitor's products. In some embodiments of step S<b>2305</b>, the value is determined by dividing the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more client's products by the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more competitor's products. In other embodiments, the value equals the difference between the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more client's products and the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more competitor's products, divided by the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more competitor's products.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Presentation <b>2410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref><i>a </i>illustrates two different values of the present metric. The smaller value reflects a case in which the one or more client's products are a client's current products, while the larger value reflects a case in which one of the one or more client's products (client product Y) is replaced with another product (client product X). According to presentation <b>2410</b>, the client's product line would be less vulnerable to the competitor's product line if product X were replaced by product Y.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Presentation <b>2420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref><i>b </i>also contrasts the vulnerability of a current set of client's products with the vulnerability of a proposed set of products. However, presentation <b>2420</b> illustrates a change in vulnerability resulting from changing one attribute of one of the current set of products. In order to determine the data presented in presentation <b>2420</b>, the metric is calculated for the current set of products. Next, the metric is calculated for a set of products identical to the original set of products except for a change to one attribute of one of the original set of products. The difference between the two vulnerability metrics may then be calculated for display with respect to the attribute change as shown in presentation <b>2410</b>. Of course, presentation <b>2420</b> shows such a difference with respect to four different independent calculations of vulnerability corresponding to four different attribute changes. In some embodiments, presentation <b>2420</b> also presents a red flag indicating that at least a threshold number of respondents find the original attribute level unacceptable and are therefore not included in the metric calculation.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Presentation <b>2420</b> indicates that the specified change in price would make the client's product line more vulnerable, and the other specified changes in attributes would make the client's product line less vulnerable. In fact, the specified M.P.G. change would result in a least-vulnerable client product line.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Presentation <b>2430</b> illustrates a vulnerability for each of several attribute levels of an attribute. Presentation <b>2430</b> indicates that a client's product line gets less vulnerable at an approximately linear rate as horsepower of the comparison product is increased from 300 HP to 500 HP. As described with respect to presentation <b>2420</b>, the vulnerabilities may be determined by performing steps <b>2300</b> for sets of client's products that are identical to each other except for a change to the attribute.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Presentation <b>2440</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref><i>d </i>illustrates, for a particular set of one or more client's products and a particular set of one or more competitor's products, a percentage of respondents associated with each of several vulnerability index values. The illustrated information may be determined from the vulnerabilities for each respondent determined in step S<b>2305</b>. As shown, a distribution of respondents' vulnerability indices is approximately bell-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Presentation <b>2450</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref><i>e </i>shows the same information as shown in presentation <b>2440</b>, and also includes a percentage of respondents associated with each of several vulnerability values determined in view of a second set of one or more client's products and the particular set of one or more competitor's products. As shown, the second set of client's products differs from the particular set of client's products in that one attribute of one product is changed. Specifically, a change in horsepower of the comparison product shifts the distribution of vulnerability indices to the left (toward a state of greater vulnerability).</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref><i>f </i>illustrates presentation <b>2460</b>, which shows a percentage of respondents associated with each of several mean vulnerability index values as in presentation <b>2440</b>. However, presentation <b>2460</b> shows such percentages for each of several comparison products. In this regard, each graphed line of presentation <b>2460</b> represents a comparison product differing in only one attribute from the comparison products represented by the other graphed lines. Presentation <b>2460</b> also illustrates that a change from 40 to 50 M.P.G. in the comparison product flattens the distribution of respondent vulnerability indices, and a change to 60 M.P.G. shifts and concentrates the distribution of respondent vulnerability indices.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Clout</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The &#x201c;clout&#x201d; metric provides a measure of how close a competitor's customers are to switching to a client's product line. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows process steps <b>2500</b> for determining the clout metric. Attribute levels are determined for one or more client's products and for one or more competitor's products in step S<b>2501</b>. As described with respect to step S<b>2301</b>, the products for which attribute levels are determined are products may comprise a particular market. Next, in step S<b>2502</b>, preference information is determined for respondents of interest, defined as those respondents who prefer at least one of the competitor's products to each of the one or more client's products.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">A total utility of each of the one or more client's products and of the one or more competitor's products is then determined for each respondent of interest in step S<b>2503</b>. Based on the determined utilities, a most-preferred of the one or more client's products and a most-preferred of the one or more competitor's products are determined for each respondent in step S<b>2504</b>. In step S<b>2505</b>, a value is determined for each respondent of interest that relates the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more client's products and the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more competitor's products.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The value may be determined in step S<b>2505</b> by dividing the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more client's products by the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more competitor's products. It should be noted that even though this calculation is identical to one embodiment of step S<b>2305</b>, a result of this calculation should be a value less than one, as opposed to a value of greater than one generated by step S<b>2305</b>. The different values result because the respondents of interest in process steps <b>2300</b> are those who prefer one at least one of the client's products to each of the one or more competitor's products and the respondents of interest in process steps <b>2500</b> are those who prefer at least one of the competitor's products to each of the one or more client's products. The value may also be determined in step S<b>2505</b> by subtracting the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more competitor's products from the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more client's products and by dividing the difference by the respondent's preference for the most-preferred of the one or more competitor's products.</p>

<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The &#x201c;brand favorability&#x201d; metric provides a client with an understanding of the importance of brands and the relative strength of brands. According to process steps <b>2700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the metric is determined by determining preference information associated with one or more respondents in step S<b>2701</b>.

<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In step S<b>2702</b>, one or more of the one or more respondents is determined for whom a first brand is a most-preferred brand. In order to determine a most-preferred brand for a respondent, a brand having a highest utility for the respondent may be identified.

For each of the one or more respondents determined in step S<b>2702</b>, a value relating preferences for a second brand and preferences for the plurality of brands is determined in step S<b>2703</b>. In some embodiments, the value is determined by dividing a utility for the second brand by a sum of the utilities for each brand.

<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Change in Margin Due to Acceptable Change in Comparison Product</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The present metric provides a client with an estimated change in profit margin resulting from an acceptable change in a comparison product. The metric may be used, for instance, by a car salesman trying to determine an offer to provide to a customer. According to some embodiments of process steps <b>3100</b>, preference information associated with a respondent is determined in step S<b>3101</b>. Next, one or more attribute levels of a comparison product are determined in step S<b>3102</b>. In step S<b>3103</b>, an acceptable change corresponding to one or more of the determined attribute levels is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">A cost to the client of the acceptable change is determined in step S<b>3104</b>, and a willingness to pay for the acceptable change is determined based on the preference information in step S<b>3105</b>. The cost may be determined based on information received from client system <b>300</b> or from depository <b>500</b>, and the willingness to pay may be determined as set forth with respect to process steps <b>1300</b>. More specifically, the cost determined in step S<b>3104</b> is a cost to the client for resources used per unit of product in order to implement the acceptable changes. For example, it may cost the client $600 to add a sunroof, and a respondent may be willing to pay $700 for an added sunroof.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">A change in margin in a case that the comparison product is changed according to the one or more acceptable changes is determined in step S<b>3106</b>. The change may be determined by subtracting the cost determined in step S<b>3104</b> from the willingness to pay determined in step S<b>3105</b>. Of course, process steps <b>3100</b> may be performed to determine the metric for several different respondents and to produce an aggregate metric therefrom. Moreover, steps <b>3100</b> may be performed with respect to more than one acceptable change.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Presentation <b>3210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref><i>a </i>illustrates the present metric as determined with respect to three different scenarios. Specifically, presentation <b>3210</b> shows the metric as independently calculated for three different changes to attribute levels of a product. The illustrated metrics may be determined for an individual or multiple respondents. According to presentation <b>3210</b>, a significant profit margin may be obtained by changing the Color attribute of the product from blue to red, because the change substantially increases a willingness to pay for the product but requires an insubstantial cost, if any.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref><i>b </i>shows presentation <b>3220</b> shows an individual or aggregate value of the metric as calculated for each of a plurality of changes to a single attribute. The value of the metric peaks around <b>410</b> horsepower and then decreases, perhaps because of a decrease in a difference between a willingness to pay for greater horsepower and a cost for providing the greater horsepower. Presentation <b>3230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref><i>c </i>shows, for a plurality of values of the metric, a percentage of respondents corresponding to each value in view of a particular change to a comparison product. As shown, the respondents' change in margin due to a specified change in horsepower creates a bell-shaped distribution.</p>
