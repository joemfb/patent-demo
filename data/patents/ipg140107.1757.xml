<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a hand-held massage device, and more particularly to a massage device that requires no electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Modern living is causing more and more people to suffer from high stress. A massage is one of the more common relaxation methods, which can help induce relaxation and rest. However, a massage service requires making an appointment and traveling to the appointment, which is also costly. Therefore, massage mechanisms are also very popular relaxation products.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">But, most hand-held massage devices require electric power and have complicated structures and are relatively heavy. Furthermore, most hand-held massage devices can only provide beating and rolling movements to the body, which may cause damage or injury to the body due to poor strength control, and such types of massage devices are not suitable for the head or face areas.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is desirable to provide a hand-held massage device to mitigate and/or obviate the aforementioned problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An objective of the present invention is to provide a hand-held massage device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve the above-mentioned objective, a hand-held massage device comprises: a control handle, a first engaging member, a second engaging member, a gripping section, a casing, a rotation disk and a massage member. The control handle is an extended hollow rod providing a containment space for the first engaging member. One end of the control handle has an enlarged portion and another end is capable of accepting the second engaging member. The first engaging member is a screw rod and has a spiral slot around a periphery of the screw rod and a sleeve respectively extending from both ends. The second engaging member has a threaded hole with a spiral slot, the threaded hole engaging with the screw rod of the first engaging member when the second engaging member is secured onto the control handle. The gripping section is a hollow tube and has an inner diameter substantially equal to an outer diameter of the control handle and the second engaging member, such that the control handle is capable of being disposed in the gripping section and sliding inside of the gripping section. The casing is installed onto another end of the gripping section opposite the end accepting the control handle, and has a first bearing containment space for accepting a first bearing at a central position on a front side. The first bearing containment space has a through aperture for allowing the sleeve of the first engaging member to be connected to the rotation disk. The rotation disk has a socket at a central position on a side for accepting and securing the sleeve, a second bearing containment space formed at an eccentric position on another side, and after a second bearing is placed in the second bearing containment space, a cover is placed to close the space. The second bearing containment space further has a through hole. The massage member is cup-shaped. A raised portion is formed at a central position of an end. The raised portion further has a securing knob placed through the cover and screwed with a corresponding screw at an end adjacent to the through hole, such that the raised portion of the massage member is secured onto the cover. A flange is inwardly formed at an open end of the massage member. The flange provides a curved and smooth massage surface and a predetermined space is formed between the massage surface and a bottom of the massage member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">With the above-mentioned structure, the following benefits can be obtained: 1. The massage device requires no electricity and has a convenient size, which is highly portable for the user. 2. The massage device only affects the surface of the skin, which can avoid causing any damage or injury to the body, and the material of the massage member is suitable for use on the facial area or the area of the head or any other fragile area of the human body. 3. The movements of the hands also serves as hand exercises for the user. 4. Since the massage member is made of silicon, the massage surface can have a complete contact surface with the skin of the body area, which can prevent painful feelings caused by the liner contact. 5. The massage device provides a large contact surface, which can improve the massage effect.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

For actual use, the user places the massage member <b>70</b> on a body area, so this area has contact with the flange <b>73</b>, and with different application forces, the flange <b>73</b> can be bent due to the predetermined space <b>75</b> to make the massage surface <b>74</b> to have complete surface contact with the body area which prevents uncomfortable liner contact. The user holds the gripping section <b>40</b> with one hand and pushes the enlarged end <b>12</b> with another hand to push in or pull away the control handle <b>10</b> repeatedly. Consequently, the second engaging member <b>30</b> moves along the control handle <b>10</b>, with the second engaging member <b>30</b> and the screw rod <b>21</b>, the horizontal force is converted into a rotational force for the rotation disk <b>60</b>, such that the massage member <b>70</b> generates eccentric rotations and the reverse force generated by the rotations is counteracted by the rotations generated by the first bearing <b>51</b> and the second bearing <b>61</b>. Meanwhile, the massage member <b>70</b> generates a slow pressing massage force to the body area instead of a direct beating force. Furthermore, since the massage member <b>70</b> only provides a gentle massage to the surface of the skin, this massage device is also suitable for the head area or the facial area, and the movements of the hands also serve as hand exercises for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, a buffer ring <b>23</b> is placed around the raised edge of the first engaging member <b>20</b>, to prevent noise caused by the collision between the second engaging member <b>30</b> and the raised edge <b>212</b> while the control handle <b>10</b> moves to a maximum travel distance.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With the above-mentioned structure, the following benefits can be obtained: 1. The massage device requires no electricity and has a convenient size, which is highly portable for the user. 2. The massage device only affects the surface of the skin, which can avoid causing any damage or injury to the body, and the material of the massage member <b>70</b> is suitable for use on the facial area or the area of the head or any other fragile area of the human body. 3. The movements of the hands also serves as hand exercises for the user. 4. Since the massage member <b>70</b> is made of silicon, the massage surface <b>74</b> can have a complete contact surface with the skin of the body area, which can prevent painful feelings caused by the liner contact. 5. The massage device provides a large contact surface, which can improve the massage effect.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although the present invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that many other possible modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.</p>
