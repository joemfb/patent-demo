<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a beam homogenizer to homogenize energy distribution of a beam spot on an irradiated surface in a particular region. Moreover, the present invention also relates to a laser irradiation apparatus using the beam homogenizer. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device using the laser irradiation apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, a technique has been extensively researched in which the laser annealing is performed to a non-single crystal semiconductor film (the non-single crystal semiconductor includes an amorphous semiconductor and a semiconductor having crystallinity such as poly-crystal or micro-crystal, which is not single crystal) formed over an insulating substrate such as a glass substrate. It is noted that the laser annealing described herein indicates a technique to recrystallize an amorphous layer or a damaged layer formed in a semiconductor substrate or in the semiconductor film and a technique to crystallize the non-single crystal semiconductor film formed over the substrate. Moreover, a technique applied to planarize or modify a surface of the semiconductor substrate or the semiconductor film is included in the laser annealing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The laser annealing is performed in the crystallization because the glass substrate has a low melting point. The laser can give high energy only to the non-single crystal semiconductor film without changing the temperature of the substrate that much.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is preferable to perform the laser annealing in such way that a pulsed laser beam having high output such as an excimer laser is shaped into a square spot having a length of several cm on a side or into a rectangular spot having a length of 10 cm or more on a longer side at an irradiated surface through an optical system and that an irradiation position of the beam spot is scanned relative to the irradiated surface because this method can enhance productivity and is superior industrially. Among the rectangular beam spots, a rectangular beam spot having a high aspect ratio is referred to as a linear beam spot in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, unlike a punctuate beam spot requiring to be scanned from front to back and from side to side, the linear beam spot can provide high productivity because the linear beam spot can be irradiated to the large irradiated surface by scanning the linear beam spot only in a direction perpendicular to the long-side direction of the linear beam spot. The laser beam is scanned in the direction perpendicular to the long-side direction of the linear beam spot because it is the most effective way to scan the laser beam. Because of such high productivity, at present, the laser annealing process mainly employs the linear beam spot obtained by shaping the beam spot emitted from a pulsed excimer laser through an appropriate optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> show an example of an optical system to transform the sectional shape of the beam spot into linear on the irradiated surface. The optical system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> is an extremely general optical system. This optical system not only transforms the sectional shape of the beam spot into linear, but also homogenizes the energy distribution of the beam spot on the irradiated surface at the same time. Generally, the optical system for homogenizing the energy distribution of the beam spot is referred to as a beam homogenizer. The optical system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> is also the beam homogenizer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When a XeCl excimer laser (having a wavelength 308 nm) is used as a light source, the above optical system is made of quartz. When a laser having a shorter wavelength is used as the light source, the optical system is made of fluorite, MgF<sub>2</sub>, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">First, a side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> is explained. A laser beam emitted from a XeCl excimer laser oscillator <b>1201</b> is divided in one direction through cylindrical lens arrays <b>1202</b><i>a </i>and <b>1202</b><i>b</i>. This direction is herein referred to as a vertical direction. When a mirror is inserted in the optical system, the vertical direction is bent to the direction of the laser beam bent by the mirror. In this structure, the laser beam is divided into four beams. These divided beams are combined into one beam spot once by a cylindrical lens <b>1204</b>. The beam spots separated again are reflected by a mirror <b>1206</b> and then are condensed into one beam spot again on an irradiated surface <b>1208</b> by a doublet cylindrical lens <b>1207</b>. The doublet cylindrical lens is a lens consisting of two cylindrical lenses. This homogenizes the energy distribution of the linear beam spot in the vertical direction and determines the length thereof in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Next, a top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> is explained. The laser beam emitted from the laser oscillator <b>1201</b> is divided in a direction perpendicular to the vertical direction by a cylindrical lens array <b>1203</b>. The direction perpendicular to the vertical direction is herein referred to as a horizontal direction. When a mirror is inserted in the optical system, the horizontal direction is bent to the direction of the beam bent by the mirror. In this structure, the laser beam is divided into seven beams. These divided beams are combined into one beam spot by a cylindrical lens <b>1205</b> on the irradiated surface <b>1208</b>. A dotted line shows a correct optical path and correct positions of the lens and the irradiated surface in the case not disposing the mirror <b>1206</b>. This homogenizes the energy distribution of the linear beam spot in the horizontal direction and determines the length thereof in the horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As described above, the cylindrical lens arrays <b>1202</b><i>a</i>, <b>1202</b><i>b</i>, and <b>1203</b> are the lenses to divide the beam spot of the laser beam. The homogeneity of the energy distribution of the obtained linear beam spot depends on the number of the divided beam spots.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In general, the excimer laser emits a rectangular laser beam having an aspect ratio in the range of approximately 1 to 5. The beam spot of the laser beam has Gaussian distribution where the intensity is higher toward the center. The optical system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> transforms the beam spot so as to form the beam spot having homogeneous energy distribution and having a size of 320 mm&#xd7;0.4 mm</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The linear beam spot shaped by the above structure is irradiated as being overlapped in such a way that the linear beam spot is displaced gradually in the direction of the short side of the linear beam spot. Such an irradiation method makes it possible to perform the laser, annealing to the whole surface of the non-single crystal silicon film to crystallize it or to enhance its crystallinity. In a mass-production factory, at present, the laser annealing is performed to the semiconductor film using the linear beam spot shaped by the optical system as above.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Some beam homogenizers use a reflection mirror. (For example, patent document 1)

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">However, a laser irradiation apparatus using the pulsed excimer laser has a problem that, for example, the homogeneity of the energy distribution of the beam spot on the irradiated surface deteriorates because of the fluctuation of a beam axis, which is explained later, or the change in the divergence angle of a laser beam due to the change in the oscillation condition of the excimer laser or due to the cleaning of the window for isolating the gas, which is the laser medium of the excimer laser, from the outside. Therefore, such a laser irradiation apparatus is not yet of high quality for the mass production. The term &#x201c;beam axis&#x201d; herein used means a path in which the laser beam travels. The fluctuation or the change of the beam axis means that of the travel direction of the laser beam including the parallel shift of the travel direction of the laser beam.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">The present invention is made in view of the above problem, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a beam homogenizer that can suppress as much as possible the change in the energy distribution of the beam spot on the irradiated surface due to the change in the oscillation condition of the excimer laser or due to the maintenance. Moreover, it is an object of the present invention to provide a laser irradiation apparatus and a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device that use the beam homogenizer.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">In the present invention, an optical element having a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely and having a curved shape in its entrance surface where the laser beam is incident is used to homogenize the energy distribution of the beam spot on the irradiated surface. As such an optical element, there are a light pipe and an optical waveguide for example. The light pipe is an optical element made of a transparent material having a shape of rectangular solid, circular conic, pyramid, cylinder, or the like, which transmits the light from one end to the other end by the total reflection. The optical waveguide is an optical element that can confine radiation light to a certain region and can transmit the radiation light by guiding the flow of the beam thereof. It is noted that reflection by a mirror may be used to transmit the light. The light pipe belongs to a field of the illumination optics while the optical waveguide belongs to a field of optical communication, which is typified by an optical fiber. Although these two optical elements belong to the different field, it can be said that their optical actions are almost the same.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">The present invention discloses a beam homogenizer for shaping a beam spot on an irradiated surface into rectangular. The beam homogenizer includes an optical element for homogenizing energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in a direction of its long or short side on the irradiated surface, wherein the optical element has a curved shape in the entrance surface where the laser beam is incident and wherein the optical element has a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely. The entrance surface herein means a surface of the optical element where the laser beam is incident first. As the curved shape, a lens is given for example.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">In the present invention, the optical element has the curved shape in its entrance surface where the laser beam is incident according to the following reason. When the center axis of the beam axis does not match the center axis of the optical element, the laser beam is incident obliquely into the entrance surface of the optical element. When the laser beam is incident obliquely into the entrance surface of the optical element, the reflection of the laser beam in the optical element is asymmetrical to the center axis of the optical element. Therefore, the energy distribution of the beam spot at the exit surface of the optical element is not sufficiently homogenized. Consequently, the present invention provides the optical element having the curved shape in its entrance surface. With this optical element, the reflection of the laser beam in the optical element can be made symmetrical or near symmetrical to the center axis of the optical element. This can homogenize the energy distribution of the beam spot at the exit of the optical element.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">The present invention discloses another beam homogenizer for shaping a beam spot on an irradiated surface into rectangular. This beam homogenizer includes an optical element for homogenizing energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in a direction of its long or short side on the irradiated surface and includes one or a plurality of cylindrical lenses for projecting a plane having homogeneous energy distribution formed by the optical element to the irradiated surface, wherein the optical element has a curved shape in its entrance surface where the laser beam is incident and wherein the optical element has a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">The present invention discloses another beam homogenizer for shaping a beam spot on an irradiated surface into rectangular. This beam homogenizer includes a plurality of optical elements including at least a first optical element for homogenizing energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in a direction of its long side on the irradiated surface and a second optical element for homogenizing energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in a direction of its short side on the irradiated surface, wherein each of the first and second optical elements has a curved shape in its entrance surface where the laser beam is incident and wherein the first and second optical elements respectively have a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">In the beam homogenizer disclosed in the present invention for shaping a beam spot on an irradiated surface into rectangular, a light pipe or an optical waveguide can be used as the optical element for homogenizing the energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot on the irradiated surface in the direction of its long or short side.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">In the beam homogenizer of the present invention for shaping a beam spot on an irradiated surface into rectangular, the curved shape is cylindrical and has curvature in a direction where the optical element acts.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">Hereinafter, an embodiment mode and embodiments of the present invention are explained based on drawings. However, since the present invention can be embodied in many different modes, it is easily understood by those skilled in the art that the modes and the details of the present invention can be changed and modified in various ways unless such changes and modifications depart from the scope and the content of the present invention hereinafter defined. Thus, the present invention is not limited to the description of the embodiment mode and the embodiments. It is noted that the same reference numeral is used to indicate the same thing throughout the drawings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">First, the method to homogenize the energy distribution of the beam spot by the optical element having a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely for reflecting the laser beam in the direction where the energy distribution of the beam spot is homogenized is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>. A top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> is explained first. There are an optical element <b>1102</b> having a pair of reflection planes <b>1102</b><i>a </i>and <b>1102</b><i>b </i>provided oppositely and an irradiated surface <b>1103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. The ray is made incident from the left side on the paper. The ray is drawn with a continuous line <b>1101</b><i>a </i>when there is the optical element <b>1102</b> and is drawn with a dotted line <b>1101</b><i>b </i>when there is not the optical element <b>1102</b>. When there is not the optical element <b>1102</b>, the ray incident from the left side on the paper reaches regions <b>1103</b><i>a</i>, <b>1103</b><i>b</i>, and <b>1103</b><i>c </i>in the irradiated surface <b>1103</b> as shown with the dotted line <b>1101</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">On the other hand, when there is the optical element <b>1102</b>, the ray is reflected by the reflection planes of the optical element <b>1102</b> as shown with the ray <b>1101</b><i>a</i>, and then all the rays reach a region <b>1103</b><i>b </i>in the irradiated surface <b>1103</b>. That is to say, when there is the optical element <b>1102</b>, all the rays that reach the regions <b>1103</b><i>a </i>and <b>1103</b><i>c </i>when there is not the optical element <b>1102</b> reach the region <b>1103</b><i>b </i>in the irradiated surface <b>1103</b>. Therefore, when the rays are made incident into the optical element <b>1102</b>, the rays are reflected repeatedly and are led to the exit. That is to say, the rays are superposed in the same position as if the incident rays are folded on the region <b>1103</b><i>b </i>in the irradiated surface <b>1103</b>. In this example, the total divergence of the rays <b>1103</b><i>a</i>, <b>1103</b><i>b</i>, and <b>1103</b><i>c </i>on the irradiated surface <b>1103</b> when there is not the optical element is defined as A, and the divergence of the ray <b>1103</b><i>b </i>on the irradiated surface <b>1103</b> when there is the optical element is defined as B. Then, A/B corresponds to the number of rays divided by the homogenizer. Thus, when the incident ray is divided and all the divided rays are superposed on the same position, the energy distribution of the ray is homogenized on the superposed position.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">In general, the more the homogenizer divides the ray, the more homogeneous the energy distribution becomes on the position where the divided rays are superposed. The number of divisions by the optical element <b>1102</b> can be increased when the ray is reflected more times in the optical element <b>1102</b>. In other words, the length of the pair of reflection planes in the direction where the rays are incident may be made longer. Moreover, the number of divisions can be increased by narrowing the space between the reflection planes provided oppositely or by increasing NA (numerical aperture) of the ray incident into the optical element.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">The light pipe or the optical waveguide, having a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely for reflecting the laser beam in the direction where the energy distribution of the beam spot is homogenized, can be used as the optical element to homogenize the energy distribution of the ray.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">The optical system for forming a rectangular beam spot disclosed in the present invention is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. First, a side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is explained. A laser beam emitted from a laser oscillator <b>301</b> propagates in a direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. The laser beam is expanded by spherical lenses <b>302</b><i>a </i>and <b>302</b><i>b</i>. The spherical lenses <b>302</b><i>a </i>and <b>302</b><i>b </i>are not required in the case where the beam spot emitted from the laser oscillator <b>301</b> is sufficiently large.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">The direction of the long side hereinafter means the direction of the long side of the rectangular beam spot formed on the irradiated surface <b>307</b>. The direction of the short side hereinafter means the direction of the short side of the rectangular beam spot formed on the irradiated surface <b>307</b>. The laser beam is focused by a cylindrical lens <b>304</b> in a direction of the short side and is incident into an optical element <b>305</b> positioned behind the cylindrical lens <b>304</b>, having a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely for reflecting the laser beam in the direction where the energy distribution of the beam spot is homogenized. The entrance surface of the optical element <b>305</b> has cylindrical curvature in a direction of the short side, which means the direction where the energy distribution is homogenized. The laser beam is totally reflected in the light pipe repeatedly and is led to the exit. Then, a plane having homogeneous energy distribution in a direction of the short side of the rectangular beam spot is formed at an exit surface of the optical element <b>305</b>. Here, the exit surface means a surface of the optical element from which the laser beam is emitted. It is necessary to determine the curvature of the cylindrical lens <b>304</b> so that the laser beam is totally reflected at the interface between the optical element <b>305</b> and the air.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069">The reason why the optical element <b>305</b> has the curvature in the entrance surface thereof is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are the drawings observed from a direction perpendicular to the direction where the energy distribution is homogenized. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a laser beam emitted from a laser oscillator (not shown diagrammatically) is focused by cylindrical lenses <b>101</b> and <b>201</b> so that the laser beam is incident into optical elements <b>102</b> and <b>202</b>. The incidence position of the laser beam is not the center of the cylindrical lenses <b>101</b> and <b>201</b> in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, and the focal points are not on the center axis of the optical elements <b>102</b> and <b>202</b>, having a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely for reflecting the laser beam in the direction where the energy distribution of the beam spot is homogenized. The laser beams are incident obliquely at a certain angle into the optical elements <b>102</b> and <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the laser beam is focused by the cylindrical lens <b>201</b> and is incident into the optical element <b>202</b> obliquely. After that, the laser beam is reflected repeatedly in the optical element asymmetrically to the center axis of the light pipe and is led to the exit. Thus, a beam spot having inhomogeneous energy distribution is formed at the exit surface of the optical element. On the other band, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, after the laser beam is focused by the cylindrical lens <b>101</b>, the laser beam is incident into the optical element <b>102</b> having the curved shape in the entrance surface thereof. When the optical element has the curved shape in the entrance surface, the laser beam incident obliquely into the optical element expanded to correct the reflection of the laser beam incident into the optical element so that the reflection becomes symmetrical or near symmetrical to the center axis of the optical element. This can form the beam spot having homogeneous energy distribution at the exit surface of the optical element.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">The curvature of the curved shape is determined based on the specification of the optical system in the previous paragraph such as the incidence angle and the length and the width of the optical element.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">As described above, when the optical element having the curved shape in its entrance surface is used, the energy distribution of the beam spot formed by the optical element can be kept homogeneous even though the beam axis changes for every pulse oscillation or even though the beam axis changes due to the maintenance or due to the effect of the pointing stability of the laser beam emitted from the laser oscillator. Moreover, with the optical element, the position of the plane having homogeneous energy distribution can be fixed completely by the optical system. This makes it possible to obtain the laser beam having homogeneous energy distribution that is not affected by the condition of the laser oscillator on the irradiated surface.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">The longer the optical element <b>305</b> is in the direction where the laser beam is incident or the shorter the focal length of the cylindrical lens <b>304</b> is, the more homogeneous the energy distribution becomes. However, since the actual system must be manufactured in consideration of the size of the optical system, it is necessary that the length of the light pipe and the focal length are practical in accordance with the size of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a doublet cylindrical lens <b>306</b> positioned behind the optical element <b>305</b> projects the plane having homogeneous energy distribution formed at the exit surface of the optical element <b>305</b> to an irradiated surface <b>307</b> positioned behind the doublet cylindrical lens. The doublet cylindrical lens <b>306</b> is a lens consisting of two cylindrical lenses <b>306</b><i>a </i>and <b>306</b><i>b</i>. This projects the plane having homogeneous energy distribution formed at the exit surface of the optical element <b>305</b> to another surface (irradiated surface). In other words, the plane having homogeneous energy distribution and the irradiated surface <b>307</b> are in the conjugated position with respect to the doublet cylindrical lens <b>306</b>. The optical element <b>305</b> and the doublet cylindrical lens <b>306</b> homogenize the energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in the direction of its short side and determine the length thereof in the direction of its short side. In addition, when the homogeneity of the energy distribution of the beam spot at the irradiated surface is not required that much or when the F-number (F=focal length of the lens/diameter of the entrance pupil) of the doublet cylindrical lens is extremely large, a singlet cylindrical lens may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">Next, a top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is explained. A beam spot of a laser beam emitted from a laser oscillator <b>301</b> is divided by a cylindrical lens array <b>303</b> in a direction of a long side. The cylindrical lens array <b>303</b> has a plurality of cylindrical lenses arranged in a direction of its curvature. In the present embodiment mode, five cylindrical lenses are arranged in the cylindrical lens array. This homogenizes the energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in a direction of its long side and determines the length thereof in the direction of its long side. It is noted that a cylindrical lens for combining the laser beams divided by the cylindrical lens array may be provided behind the cylindrical lens array.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">The laser oscillator used in combination with the beam homogenizer of the present invention preferably has high output power and has a wavelength region that is sufficiently absorbed in the semiconductor film. In the case of using a silicon film as the semiconductor film, the laser beam emitted from the laser oscillator preferably has a wavelength of 600 nm or shorter in consideration of the absorption coefficient. As the laser oscillator emitting such a wavelength, there are an excimer laser, a YAG laser (harmonic), and a glass laser (harmonic), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">In addition, although high output power is not yet obtained by the current technology, a YVO<sub>4 </sub>laser (harmonic), a YLF laser (harmonic), an Ar laser, and an GdVO<sub>4 </sub>are given for example as the laser oscillator emitting the laser beam having a wavelength appropriate for crystallizing the silicon film.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">The optical system disclosed in the present invention may be used under the atmosphere or may be used under a nitrogen or Ar atmosphere in order to minimize the damage of the light pipe and the surface of the lens due to the laser beam having high energy.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">Although this embodiment mode explains the optical element having a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely to homogenize the energy distribution of the beam spot, the light pipe or the optical waveguide may be also used because they have the similar optical advantageous effect.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0080">Hereinafter a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device using the beam homogenizer and the laser irradiation apparatus of the present invention is explained. A glass substrate having enough resistance against the heat up to 600&#xb0; C. is used as the substrate. A silicon oxide film is formed on the glass substrate as a base film, and a non-single crystal silicon film is formed thereon. These films are formed by a sputtering method or a plasma CVD method.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0081">The substrate with the films formed thereon is heated under the nitrogen atmosphere to decrease the concentration of hydrogen in the non-single crystal silicon film. This process is performed because the film cannot resist the laser power when the film contains too much hydrogen. The concentration of hydrogen in the film is appropriate on the order of 10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. Here, 10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>means that 10<sup>20 </sup>hydrogen atoms exist in 1 cm<sup>3</sup>. The processing time and the temperature of the substrate in this heating process may be determined by a practitioner appropriately. However, the heating temperature must be determined in consideration of the resistivity of the glass substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0082">This embodiment mode employs a XeCl excimer laser as the laser oscillator. The excimer laser is a pulsed laser oscillator. When the power of the pulsed laser beam fluctuates within &#xb1;5%, preferably within &#xb1;2%, in each pulse during the laser processing performed to one substrate, it is possible to perform homogeneous crystallization. It is noted that the lenses and the optical element that has a curved shape in its entrance surface for homogenizing the energy distribution of the laser beam shown in the present embodiment mode are made of the synthetic quartz having high transmittance and resistance to the XeCl excimer laser.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083">The fluctuation of the laser power described above is defined as follows. The average value of the laser power in the period of the irradiation to one substrate is assumed to be standard. Then, the fluctuation of the laser power is defined as the value expressing the difference between the average value and the maximum or minimum value in the period of the irradiation in percentage terms.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">The laser beam is irradiated in such a way that a stage with the irradiated surface <b>307</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> mounted thereon is scanned in the direction of the short side of the rectangular beam spot. On this occasion, a practitioner may determine the energy density and the scanning speed of the beam spot on the irradiated surface appropriately. The energy density is appropriate in the range of 200 to 1000 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. It is feasible to perform laser annealing homogeneously when the scanning speed is selected in the range where the width of the rectangular beam spot in its short side is overlapped one another by 80% or more, preferably by approximately 90%. The optimum scanning speed depends on the pulse repetition rate of the laser oscillator and it may be regarded to be proportional to the pulse repetition rate thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0085">Thus, the laser annealing process is completed. When the above step is performed repeatedly, many substrates can be processed. The substrate processed thus can be utilized to manufacture an active matrix liquid crystal display and an EL display device according to the known method.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0086">The above example used the excimer laser as the laser oscillator. Since the excimer laser has a coherent length as short as several &#x3bc;m, it is suitable for the above optical system. Although some of the lasers shown below have the long coherent length, the laser whose coherent length is changed deliberately may be employed. It is also preferable to use the harmonic of the YAG laser or the harmonic of the glass laser because the energy of the laser beam is sufficiently absorbed in the silicon film. As the laser oscillator appropriate for the crystallization of the silicon film, the YVO<sub>4 </sub>laser (harmonic), the YLF laser (harmonic), the Ar laser, the GdVO<sub>4 </sub>laser, and the like are given. The wavelengths of these laser beams are sufficiently absorbed in the silicon film.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">The above example used the non-single crystal silicon film as the non-single crystal semiconductor film. However, it is easily supposed that the present invention can be applied to another non-single crystal semiconductor film. For example, a compound semiconductor film such as a non-single crystal silicon germanium film or a poly-crystalline silicon germanium film may be employed as the non-single crystal semiconductor film. Alternatively, a poly-crystalline silicon film may be used as the non-single crystal semiconductor film. For example, the poly-crystalline silicon film can be formed as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">A silicon oxide film is formed on a glass substrate and a non single-crystal silicon film is further formed thereon. The silicon oxide film and the non-single crystal silicon film are formed by the sputtering method or the CVD method. In addition, plasma CVD may be used. After that, a silicon oxide film may be formed on the non-single crystal silicon film by applying a hydroxy solution to the non-single crystal silicon film. Forming this silicon oxide film is because the following process of applying an acetate solution including nickel can be performed so that the acetate solution can be spread all over the surface of the non-single crystal silicon film. For example, when the acetate solution is applied directly on the surface of the non-single crystal silicon film, the acetate solution is repelled on the non-single crystal silicon film, and therefore the nickel cannot be applied uniformly all over the surface of the non-single crystal silicon film. Therefore, the wettability can be improved by forming the silicon oxide film. Next, an acetate solution including nickel in the range of 1 to 100 ppm is applied to the non-single crystal silicon film. After that, the heating process is performed to crystallize the non-single crystal silicon film and to form a crystalline silicon film.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0089">An example of an optical system used in the present embodiment is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. A side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is explained first. A laser beam emitted from a XeCl excimer laser oscillator <b>401</b> propagates in a direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. First, the laser beam is expanded by spherical lenses <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b</i>. The spherical lenses <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b </i>are not necessary when the beam spot emitted from the laser oscillator <b>401</b> is sufficiently large. It is noted that the lenses and the light pipe that has a curved shape in its entrance surface for homogenizing the energy distribution of the laser beam shown in the present embodiment are made of synthetic quartz having high transmittance and resistance to the XeCl excimer laser.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">The direction of the long side herein described mean the direction of the long side of the rectangular beam spot formed on an irradiated surface <b>408</b>. The direction of the short side herein described mean the direction of the short side of the rectangular beam spot formed on the irradiated surface <b>408</b>. A cylindrical lens <b>405</b> has a first surface having a radius of curvature of 486 mm, a second surface that is plain, and a thickness of 20 mm, which focuses the beam spot in a direction of the short side. It is noted that the first surface of the lens is the surface into which the light is incident, and the second surface means the surface from which the light is emitted. The sign of the radius of curvature is positive when the center of the curvature is in the side where the beam is emitted with respect to the lens surface. The sign is negative when the center of the curvature is in the side where the beam is incident with respect to the lens surface. A light pipe <b>406</b> positioned 1000 mm behind the cylindrical lens <b>405</b> has a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely for reflecting the laser beam in the direction where the energy distribution of the beam spot is homogenized and a cylindrical shape in the entrance surface thereof having a radius of curvature of &#x2212;38 mm. The laser beam incident into the light pipe <b>406</b> is totally reflected in the light pipe <b>406</b> repeatedly and is led to the exit. This homogenizes the energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in the direction of its short side on the irradiated surface. The direction of the cylindrical curvature is the direction of the short side, which is the direction where the energy distribution is homogenized. The light pipe <b>406</b> has a length of 250 mm in a direction where the laser beam is incident and has a distance of 2 mm between the total-reflection planes.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">In the present embodiment, the light pipe <b>406</b> is made of the synthetic quartz having a refractive index of approximately 1.486 to a wavelength of 308 nm, which is higher than that of the air (the air has a refractive index of approximately 1). Since the laser beam is incident into the light pipe <b>406</b> at a critical angle or more in this embodiment, the laser beam is totally reflected at the reflection plane. In other words, the transmittance of the light in the light pipe is high compared with the case where the laser beam is not totally reflected. Therefore, the laser beam emitted from the laser oscillator <b>401</b>, which is the light source, can be focused at the irradiated surface <b>408</b> more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0092">A cylindrical lens <b>407</b> positioned 1250 mm behind the light pipe <b>406</b> has a first surface having a radius of curvature of 97 mm, a second surface that is plane, and a thickness of 30 mm. The cylindrical lens <b>407</b> focuses the laser beam on the irradiated surface <b>408</b> positioned 220 mm behind the cylindrical lens <b>407</b> in a direction of the short side of the rectangular beam spot. In other words, the cylindrical lens <b>407</b> projects the plane having homogeneous energy distribution formed at the exit surface of the light pipe <b>406</b> to the irradiated surface <b>408</b>. This homogenizes the energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in the direction of its short side and determines the length thereof in the direction of its short side.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0093">Next, a top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is explained. The beam spot of the laser beam emitted from the laser oscillator <b>401</b> is divided by a cylindrical lens array <b>403</b> in a direction of the long side of the rectangular beam spot. The cylindrical lens array <b>403</b> has seven cylindrical lenses arranged in a direction of its curvature, each of which has a first surface having a radius of curvature of 24.5 mm, a second surface that is plane, a width of 6.5 mm in a direction of its long side, and a thickness of 5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">A cylindrical lens <b>404</b> positioned 500 mm behind the cylindrical lens array <b>403</b> has a first surface having a radius of curvature of 2140 mm and a second surface that is plane. The cylindrical lens <b>404</b> combines the laser beams divided by the cylindrical lens array <b>403</b> on the irradiated surface <b>408</b>. This homogenizes the energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in the direction of its long side and determines the length thereof in the direction of its long side. It is noted that the cylindrical lens <b>404</b> is not used in the embodiment mode of the present invention. The cylindrical lens <b>404</b> can decrease the portion where the energy attenuates in opposite ends of the rectangular beam spot in a direction of its long side. However, when this lens is used in the apparatus having the above structure, the lens may have an extremely long focal length. In such a case, since the advantageous effect by this lens decreases, it may not be used.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0095">As described above, even though the beam axis changes, it is possible to form a rectangular beam spot having homogeneous energy distribution and having a size of 320 mm in the long side and 0.4 mm in the short side by using the beam homogenizer including the optical element having the curved shape in the entrance surface thereof.</p>

A cylindrical lens <b>1002</b> has a first surface having a radius of curvature of 194.25 mm, a second surface that is plane, and a thickness of 20 mm, which focuses the beam spot in the direction of the long side. An entrance surface of a light pipe <b>1003</b> positioned 400 mm behind the cylindrical lens <b>1002</b> has a cylindrical shape having a radius of curvature of &#x2212;38 mm, the light pipe <b>1003</b> having a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely for reflecting the laser beam in the direction where the energy distribution of the beam spot is homogenized. The laser beam incident into the light pipe <b>1003</b> is totally reflected in the light pipe <b>1003</b> repeatedly and is led to the exit. This homogenizes the energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in the direction of the long side on the irradiated surface. It is noted that the direction of curvature is the direction of the long side, which means the direction where the energy distribution is homogenized. The light pipe <b>1003</b> has a length of 300 mm in the direction of the beam axis and the distance between the total-reflection planes is 2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0121">A cylindrical lens <b>1004</b> positioned 20 mm behind the light pipe <b>1003</b> has a first surface having a radius of curvature of 9.7 mm, a second surface that is plane, and a thickness of 5 mm. The cylindrical lens <b>1004</b> focuses the laser beam emitted from the light pipe <b>1003</b> on an irradiated surface <b>1008</b> positioned 3600 mm behind the cylindrical lens <b>1004</b>. In other words, the plane having homogeneous energy distribution formed at the exit surface of the light pipe <b>1003</b> is projected to the irradiated surface <b>1008</b> by the cylindrical lens <b>1004</b>. This homogenizes the energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in the direction of the long side and determines the length thereof in the direction of the long side.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0122">Then, a side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is explained. The beam spot of the laser beam emitted from the XeCl excimer laser oscillator <b>1001</b> is focused in the direction of the short side by a cylindrical lens <b>1005</b> having a first surface with a radius of curvature of 486 mm, a second surface that is plane, and a thickness of 20 mm. An entrance surface of a light pipe <b>1006</b> positioned 1000 mm behind the cylindrical lens <b>1005</b> has a cylindrical shape having a radius of curvature of &#x2212;38 mm, the light pipe <b>1006</b> having a pair of reflection planes provided oppositely for reflecting the laser beam in the direction where the energy distribution of the beam spot is homogenized. The laser beam incident into the light pipe <b>1006</b> is totally reflected in the light pipe <b>1006</b> and is led to the exit. This homogenizes the energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in the direction of the short side on the irradiated surface. It is noted that the direction of curvature is the direction of the short side, which means the direction where the energy distribution is homogenized. The light pipe <b>1006</b> has a length of 250 mm in the direction of the beam axis and the distance between the total-reflection planes is 2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0123">In the present embodiment, the light pipes <b>1003</b> and <b>1006</b> are made of synthetic quartz having a refractive index of approximately 1.486 to the wavelength of 308 nm, which is higher than the refractive index of the air (the air has a refractive index of approximately 1). Since the laser beam is incident into the light pipes <b>1003</b> and <b>1006</b> at a critical angle or more in the present embodiment, the laser beam is totally reflected on the reflection planes. In other words, the transmittance of the laser beam in the light pipe is high compared to the case in which the laser beam is not totally reflected. Therefore, the laser beam emitted from the laser oscillator <b>1001</b>, which is the light source, can be focused on the irradiated surface <b>1008</b> more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0124">A cylindrical lens <b>1007</b> positioned 1250 mm behind the light pipe <b>1006</b> has a first surface having a radius of curvature of 97 mm, a second surface that is plane, and a thickness of 30 mm. The cylindrical lens <b>1007</b> focuses the laser beam emitted from the light pipe <b>1006</b> on the irradiated surface <b>1008</b> positioned 200 mm behind the cylindrical lens <b>1007</b>. In other words, the plane having homogeneous energy distribution formed at the exit surface of the light pipe <b>1006</b> is projected to the irradiated surface <b>1008</b> by the cylindrical lens <b>1007</b>. This homogenizes the energy distribution of the rectangular beam spot in the direction of the short side and determines the length thereof in the direction of the short side.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0125">The above optical system forms the rectangular beam spot having homogeneous energy distribution and having a size of 320 mm in the long side and 0.4 mm in the short side.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0126">The optical system shown in the present embodiment is used to perform the laser annealing to the semiconductor film according to the method shown in the embodiment mode of the present invention for example. Moreover, the semiconductor film annealed thus can be used to manufacture an active matrix liquid crystal display or an EL display device. A practitioner may manufacture these by the known method.</p>
