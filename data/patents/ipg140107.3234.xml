<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In semiconductor technology, due to their characteristics, Group III-Group V (or III-V) semiconductor compounds are used to form various integrated circuit devices, such as high power field-effect transistors, high frequency transistors, or high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). A HEMT is a field effect transistor incorporating a junction between two materials with different band gaps (i.e., a heterojunction) as the channel instead of a doped region, as is generally the case for metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). In contrast with MOSFETs, HEMTs have a number of attractive properties including high electron mobility, the ability to transmit signals at high frequencies, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">From an application point of view, enhancement-mode (E-mode) HEMTs have many advantages. E-mode HEMTs allow elimination of negative-polarity voltage supply, and, therefore, reduction of the circuit complexity and cost. Despite the attractive properties noted above, a number of challenges exist in connection with developing III-V semiconductor compound-based devices. Various techniques directed at configurations and materials of these III-V semiconductor compounds have been implemented to try and further improve transistor device performance.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The making and using of illustrative embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the disclosure provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative and do not limit the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one or more embodiments of this disclosure, a semiconductor structure includes a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). The HEMT includes a heterojunction formed between two different semiconductor material layers, such as material layers with different band gaps. In at least one embodiment, the HEMT includes a first III-V compound layer (also referred to as a channel layer) formed on a substrate and a second III-V compound layer (also referred to as a donor-supply layer) formed on the channel layer. The channel layer and the donor-supply layer are compounds made from the III-V groups in the periodic table of elements. However, the channel layer and the donor-supply layer are different from each other in composition. The first III-V compound layer is undoped or unintentionally doped (UID). The second III-V compound layer is intentionally doped.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The band gap discontinuity exists between the second III-V compound layer and the first III-V compound layer. The electrons from a piezoelectric effect in the second III-V compound layer drop into the first III-V compound layer, creating a very thin layer of highly mobile conducting electrons in the first III-V compound layer. This thin layer is referred to as a two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG), forming a carrier channel. The carrier channel of 2-DEG is located at the first III-V compound layer near an interface of the second III-V compound layer and the first III-V compound layer. Thus, the carrier channel has high electron mobility because the first II-V compound layer is undoped or unintentionally doped, and the electrons can move freely without collision or with substantially reduced collisions with impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one or more embodiments of this disclosure, the semiconductor structure is formed within a chip region of the substrate. A plurality of semiconductor chip regions is marked on the substrate by scribe lines between the chip regions. The substrate will go through a variety of cleaning, layering, patterning, etching and doping steps to form the semiconductor structures. The term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; herein generally refers to the bulk substrate on which various layers and device structures are formed. In some embodiments, the bulk substrate includes silicon or a compound semiconductor, such as GaAs, InP, Si/Ge, or SiC. Examples of such layers include dielectric layers, doped layers, polysilicon layers or conductive layers. Examples of device structures include transistors, resistors, and/or capacitors, which may be interconnected through an interconnect layer to additional integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>100</b> of forming a semiconductor structure having a HEMT according to one or more embodiments of this disclosure. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the flowchart of the method <b>100</b>, at operation <b>101</b>, a first III-V compound layer is provided. The first III-V compound layer is formed on a substrate. Next, the method <b>100</b> continues with operation <b>102</b> in which a second III-V compound layer is epitaxially grown on the first III-V compound layer. The method <b>100</b> continues with operation <b>103</b> in which a dielectric cap layer is deposited over the second III-V compound layer. The method <b>100</b> continues with operation <b>104</b> in which two through holes are etched in the dielectric cap layer to expose a portion of the second III-V compound layer. The method <b>100</b> continues with operation <b>105</b> in which a source feature and a drain feature are formed in the two through holes respectively on the second III-V compound layer. The method <b>100</b> continues with operation <b>106</b> in which an opening in the dielectric cap layer and a recess of the second III-V compound layer under the opening are etched with a fluorine gas. The method <b>100</b> continues with operation <b>107</b> a gate electrode is formed in the opening and the recess over the second III-V compound layer. It should be noted that additional processes may be provided before, during, or after the method <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, the opening <b>217</b>A is formed in the protection layer <b>214</b> and the dielectric cap layer <b>210</b> between the source/drain features <b>212</b>. A patterned mask layer (not shown) is formed on a top surface of the protection layer <b>214</b> (also over the dielectric cap layer <b>210</b>) and an etching process <b>215</b> is performed to remove a portion of the protection layer <b>214</b> and the dielectric cap layer <b>210</b>.

The opening <b>217</b>A and the recess <b>217</b>B are configured as a location for the later gate electrode formation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain embodiments, the opening <b>217</b>A and the recess <b>217</b>B are etched in the same plasma etching process <b>215</b> including a fluorine gas.

The fluorine gas includes SF<sub>6</sub>, CF<sub>4 </sub>or C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>. A gas flow of the fluorine gas is in a range of from about 10 sccm to about 100 sccm. As a result of the etching of the recess <b>217</b>B, a fluorine region <b>218</b> is formed in the second III-V compound layer <b>206</b> under the opening <b>217</b>A. The fluorine atoms in the fluorine region <b>218</b> may provide strong immobile negative charges and effectively deplete the electrons in the carrier channel <b>208</b>. Hence, a depletion region <b>220</b> is created in the carrier channel <b>208</b>. The carrier channel <b>208</b> becomes normally-off because of the depletion region <b>220</b>. A positive gate voltage should be applied to turn on the carrier channel <b>208</b> of this HEMT. This HMET is also called an enhanced-mode HEMT.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In conventional methods, a portion of the second III-V compound layer <b>206</b> may be etched to form a recess for an enhanced-mode HEMT by using other gases except the fluorine gas. However, the carrier channel <b>208</b> could not be normally-off completely under the recess, because the fluorine region would not be formed in such a process. Under those circumstances, there would remain residual carriers in a location which should be the depletion region <b>220</b> in the carrier channel <b>208</b>. A threshold voltage of such a HEMT is hard to be adjusted from negative-polarity voltage supply to positive-polarity voltage supply. Hence, the capability of forming an enhanced-mode HEMT is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Various embodiments of the present disclosure implement a fluorine gas for etching the recess <b>217</b>B. After the recess <b>217</b>B etching, the fluorine region <b>218</b> is formed in the second III-V compound layer <b>206</b>. The fluorine region <b>218</b> may effectively deplete the electrons in the depletion region <b>220</b> of the carrier channel <b>208</b>. The carrier channel <b>208</b> becomes normally-off because of the depletion region <b>220</b>. The fluorine region <b>218</b> under the recess <b>217</b>B eliminates the previous mentioned drawbacks in conventional methods.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, a remaining segment of the second III-V compound layer <b>206</b> after the recess <b>217</b>B formation has a thickness D<sub>2</sub>. A ratio of the thickness D<sub>1 </sub>(the thickness of the second III-V compound layer <b>206</b>) to the thickness D<sub>2 </sub>to is in a range from about 2.5 to about 7. Out of this range, the fluorine region <b>218</b> may not effectively deplete the electrons in the depletion region <b>220</b> of the carrier channel <b>208</b>, or the HEMT may suffer from low on-current issue.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In at least one embodiment, the gate dielectric layer <b>222</b> is formed by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. The ALD method is based on the sequential use of a gas phase chemical process. The majority of ALD reactions use two chemicals, typically called precursors. These precursors react with a surface one-at-a-time in a sequential manner. By exposing the precursors to the growth surface repeatedly, the gate dielectric layer <b>222</b> is deposited. The ALD method provides an uniform thickness of the gate dielectric layer <b>222</b> with high quality. In one example, the gate dielectric layer <b>222</b> is zirconium oxide. In some embodiments, a first precursor includes tetrakis(ethylmethylamino) zirconium (TEMAZr) or zirconium chloride (ZrCl<sub>4</sub>). In some embodiments, a second precursor includes oxygen in order to oxidize the first precursor material to form a monolayer.

The annealing process may recover from the possible damage on the second III-V compound layer <b>206</b> during the operation <b>106</b>.
