<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a check valve and a storage body equipped therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are conventionally sealed bags in which an item storage portion including a space for storing items such as clothing and food can be sealed off. In such a sealed bag, a check valve that joins the item storage portion and the bag outside portion in a manner allowing ventilation therebetween for exhausting various gasses such as air in the item storage portion and maintaining this state is used.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When exhausting the gases, the check valve can allow an air flow to pass through in one direction and blocks an air flow to pass through in the other direction by opening and closing an air flow passage space as a space through which gases pass.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The inventor of the present invention has developed many inventions relating to check valves, and one of these conventional examples is the check valve described in Patent Document 1. This check valve includes outer sheets made of a soft resin and a plurality of valve sheets, and as the valve sheets, at least two sheets of an upstream side valve sheet and a downstream side valve sheet are paired and bonded to a one-side outer sheet. The upstream side valve sheet is bonded at the upstream side to the one-side outer sheet, and the downstream side thereof is movable with respect to the outer sheet. The downstream side valve sheet is bonded as described above at the downstream side, and the upstream side is movable with respect to the outer sheet. The movable portions (that is, the downstream side of the upstream side valve sheet and the upstream side of the downstream side valve sheet) can come into close contact with, and separate from the other-side outer sheet. The valve sheets constituting the pair are bonded to the one-side outer sheet, and this one-side outer sheet is made of nonwoven cloth breathable over the entire surface. This check valve is used by disposing a portion with nonwoven cloth inside the sealed bag as an inlet when a fluid flows forward to the check valve and disposing an outlet from the check valve at the outside of the sealed bag.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The check valves described in Patent Document 2 and Patent Document 3 also use breathable nonwoven cloth, and are attached to a sealed bag by disposing a portion with the nonwoven cloth inside the sealed bag as an inlet when a fluid flows forward to the check valve and disposing an outlet from the check valve at the outside of the sealed bag.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Each of the check valves disclosed in these Patent Documents is attached across the inside and outside of a sealed bag as described above. Particularly, the check valve is attached to a sealed bag so that the movable portions of the valve sheets are substantially positioned outside the sealed bag.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">The inventor of the present invention has tried to improve these check valves to develop a check valve the whole of which could be disposed inside a sealed bag. However, when the whole of the check valve is disposed inside a sealed bag, the check valve does not normally work during forward flowing. In detail, during forward flowing, in some cases, the pressure inside the sealed bag increases, and a fluid flows out from the inside to the outside of the sealed bag through the check valve, and on the other hand, in the case where the check valve is used to prevent a fluid from flowing into the inside from the outside of the sealed bag, when the pressure inside the sealed bag increases, the sheets such as valve sheets, etc., constituting the check valve are pressurized in the thickness direction and the whole check valve is pressed against the bag sheet of the sealed bag, so that the check valve cannot be opened, and the fluid cannot flow out through the check valve.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">In view of the above-described circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a check valve through which allows a fluid to satisfactorily open the valve and pass. Particularly, an object of the present invention is to provide a check valve that allows a fluid to satisfactorily open the valve and pass through it even when a pressure is applied in the thickness direction of valve sheets of the check valve by disposing the whole check valve inside a sealed bag. Another object of the present invention is to provide a storage body having an excellent fluid passage function by being equipped with the check valve.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">The present invention provides a check valve that includes a plurality of layered sheets and allows a fluid to pass in a forward direction from an inlet to an outlet and blocks a flow of a fluid in a reverse direction from the outlet to the inlet by opening and closing a valve flow channel as a space for fluid passage formed between the sheets, where the plurality of sheets include a plurality of base sheets including a one-side base sheet and the other-side base sheet and at least one valve sheet disposed between the plurality of base sheets, the valve sheet includes a fixation portion bonded to at least the one-side base sheet, the fixation portion is bonded across the valve flow channel, and a portion on the downstream side of the fixation portion of the valve sheet is separable from the one-side base sheet, and a portion between the valve sheet and the other-side valve sheet or another valve sheet layered on the valve sheet is formed as the valve flow channel, wherein a fluid introduction recess recessed in the thickness direction is formed on at least one of the other-side valve sheet or another valve sheet layered on the valve sheet constituting the valve flow channel and the valve sheet, and the fluid introduction recess is provided on the fixation portion of the valve sheet or at a position on the upstream side of the fixation portion in the up-down direction of the flow channel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">Further, the present invention can be carried out as a check valve in which the inlet is positioned on the front surface or the back surface of the check valve, the outlet is positioned on the back surface or the front surface opposite the inlet, the front surface or the back surface of the check valve is along the surface or the inner surface of a storage body, the entire periphery of the check valve is bonded to the storage body by a storage body fixing seal, and an area from the inlet to the outlet through the valve flow channel is positioned within a region surrounded by the storage body fixing seal.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">Further, the present invention can be carried out as a check valve in which a part of the one-side base sheet is formed as a fluid passage portion breathable to allow an air flow in the forward direction to pass through in the front-rear direction, and the fluid passage portion is an inlet through which an air flow in the forward direction flows to the inside of the check valve, and the fluid passage portion is disposed on the upstream side of the fixation portion of the one-side base sheet, and the fluid introduction recess is formed from the fluid passage portion to the fixation portion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">Further, the present invention can be carried out as a check valve in which the fixation portion includes a first valve fixing seal and a second valve fixing seal formed on the downstream side of the first valve fixing seal, and the fluid introduction recess is not formed on the second valve fixing seal but is formed at a position including the first valve fixing seal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">Further, the present invention provides a storage body to which the check valve is attached, wherein the storage body includes bag sheets made of a soft resin, and the entire periphery of the check valve is bonded to the inside or the outside of the bag sheet.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Effects of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">The present invention provides a check valve that allows a fluid to satisfactorily open the valve and pass through it when the fluid flows forward. Specifically, by disposing the whole check valve inside a sealed bag, a fluid can satisfactorily open the valve and pass through it even when a pressure is applied in the thickness direction of the valve sheet of the check valve. Further, the present invention provides a storage body having an excellent fluid passage function by being equipped with the check valve.</p>

This check valve <b>10</b> includes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a total of five sheets including three base sheets of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b>, a one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b>, and a one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, a valve sheet <b>61</b>, and an auxiliary sheet <b>51</b>. The lateral widths of the five sheets (right-left widths in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>) are set equal to each other. For convenience of description, in each sectional view, the thickness and intervals of the sheets are drawn to be larger than actual, however, in actuality, the sheets are layered in contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">The base sheets constitute an outer surface that forms a casing of the check valve <b>10</b>, and two sheets of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> and one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> are made of simple bodies or composite bodies of a synthetic resin film without breathability (referred to as hereinafter for representing fluid permeability), and the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> is made of a breathable sheet such as nonwoven cloth or woven cloth. The valve sheet <b>61</b> is attached movably for opening and closing the valve, and made of a simple body or a composite body of a synthetic resin film. For making the valve sheet <b>61</b> movable, the thickness of the valve sheet <b>61</b> to be used is preferably thinner than the thickness of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> and the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b>, without limiting to this. The auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> is provided for balancing with the shape and thickness of the valve sheet <b>61</b> in relation to the valve sheet <b>61</b>, and is preferably made of the same material with the same thickness as those of the valve sheet <b>61</b>, without limiting to this.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">Next, a position relationship and a bonded state of these sheets will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">Describing in order from the back surface side (left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(C)</figref> and FIG. <b>2</b>(D)), the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> is disposed on the extreme back surface side, and on the front surface side thereof, the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> is disposed. On the front surface side of the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, the valve sheet <b>61</b> and the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> are disposed, and on the front surface side of these, the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> is disposed. Right and left ends of these sheets are bonded to each other by side seals in the same manner as in this type of check valve. For this bonding, welding such as heat seal or ultrasonic seal is preferable, and bonding using an adhesive agent is also possible (these can also be used not only for this sealing but also for other sealing). In this example, two side seals of a first side seal <b>81</b> and a second side seal <b>82</b> are applied although application of one side seal is also possible. The portion between the first side seal <b>81</b> and the second side seal <b>82</b> is a side non-sealed portion <b>83</b>. To this side non-sealed portion <b>83</b>, a storage body fixing seal <b>84</b> for sealing to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>is applied, and accordingly, the check valve <b>10</b> is fixed to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">Describing the relationship between the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> and the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> is disposed across substantially the entire length of the check valve <b>10</b>, and the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> is disposed on the back surface side of the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>. This one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> has, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(C)</figref>, an up-down length set shorter than that of the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, and on the upper portion of the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> is not layered and the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> is exposed. The one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> is breathable as described above, and the exposed portion thereof is a fluid passage portion that serves as an inlet <b>11</b> into the inside of the check valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">The one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> is layered on the lower portion of the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, and the upper portion of the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> is fixed to the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> by a first valve fixing seal <b>73</b> and a second valve fixing seal <b>74</b>. The first valve fixing seal <b>73</b> and the second valve fixing seal <b>74</b> connect the right and left sides of the bag (right and left side seals), and in this example, by sealing at least the second side seal <b>82</b> on the left and the second side seal <b>82</b> on the right, a boundary between the inlet <b>11</b> and the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> is formed. In this example, two seals of the first valve fixing seal <b>73</b> and the second valve fixing seal <b>74</b> are provided, however, at least one seal will suffice. Further, the entire surface of the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> at the lower portion (downstream side) of the boundary may be sealed to the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">The lower portion of the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> is sealed to the lower portion of the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> by an auxiliary fixing seal <b>75</b>, a second lower end seal <b>76</b>, and a first lower end seal <b>77</b>. The auxiliary fixing seal <b>75</b>, the second lower end seal <b>76</b>, and the first lower end seal <b>77</b> also connect the right and left sides of the bag (right and left side seals) similar to the first valve fixing seal <b>73</b> and the second valve fixing seal <b>74</b>, and in this example, seal at least the second side seal <b>82</b> on the left and the second side seal <b>82</b> on the right to each other. The portion between the second lower end seal <b>76</b> and the first lower end seal <b>77</b> is a non-sealed portion on the lower end. To this non-sealed portion, a storage body fixing seal <b>84</b> for sealing to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>is applied, and accordingly, the check valve <b>10</b> is fixed to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b</i>. The one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> covers the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> except for the inlet <b>11</b>, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref>, the lower portion of the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> covered by the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> may not be provided. The one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> and the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> may be divided up and down.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">An original purpose of the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> is to perform a filtering function. In detail, the purpose is to prevent fine particles such as fragments of coffee beans from entering the inside of the check valve <b>10</b> while breathability of the inlet <b>11</b> is secured. When contents of the bag <b>1</b><i>a </i>are items that do not produce fragments or a simple liquid or gas, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(B)</figref>, the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> may not be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">Next, the valve sheet <b>61</b> will be described. The upper portion (preferably, the uppermost end) of the valve sheet <b>61</b> is sealed to the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>. In this example, the valve sheet is fixed by the above-described first valve fixing seal <b>73</b> and second valve fixing seal <b>74</b>. These first valve fixing seal <b>73</b> and second valve fixing seal <b>74</b> serve as a fixation portion <b>14</b> described in the claims. However, the valve sheet <b>61</b> and the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> are not necessarily bonded by the same seal, and may be bonded by different seals. The lower portion of the valve sheet <b>61</b> is not bonded to the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, and is separable from the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>. Similar to a conventional check valve, both sides of the valve sheets <b>61</b> are fixed by the above-described first side seal <b>81</b> and the second side seal <b>82</b>, however, most of the center of the valve sheet <b>61</b> is separable from the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">Next, the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> will be described. The auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> is provided for balancing the lamination structure and the seals in relation to the valve sheet <b>61</b>, and is sealed to the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>. In this example, the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> is fixed by the auxiliary fixing seal <b>75</b>, the second lower end seal <b>76</b>, and the first lower end seal <b>77</b>. However, the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> and the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b> are not necessarily bonded by the same seal, and may be bonded by different seals. The upper end of the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> is not bonded to the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, and is slightly separable from the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, however, the uppermost end of the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> may be sealed by the auxiliary fixing seal <b>75</b>, and the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> may be integrated with the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>. In the example shown in the drawing, a gap is provided between the upper end of the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> and the lower end of the valve sheet <b>61</b>. The upper end of the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> and the lower end of the valve sheet <b>61</b> may overlap each other, however, the upper end of the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> must be positioned on the back surface side relative to the lower end of the valve sheet <b>61</b>. The auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> may not be provided, and in the check valves of the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and subsequent drawings, the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> is not provided.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">Last, the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> will be described. The upper portion of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> is sealed to the upper portion of the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> by a first upper end seal <b>71</b> and a second upper end seal <b>72</b>. The first upper end seal <b>71</b> and the second upper end seal <b>72</b> also connect the right and left sides (right and left side seals) of the bag similar to the second lower end seal <b>76</b> and the first lower end seal <b>77</b>, and in this example, seal at least the second side seal <b>82</b> on the left and the second side seal <b>82</b> on the right to each other. Then, the portion between the first upper end seal <b>71</b> and the second upper end seal <b>72</b> is a non-sealed portion. To this non-sealed portion, a storage body fixing seal <b>84</b> for sealing to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>is applied, and accordingly, the check valve <b>10</b> is fixed to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">Here, summarizing the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>seals the first side seal <b>81</b> and the second side seal <b>82</b> on the both left and right side to each other, the first lower end seal <b>77</b> and the second lower end seal <b>76</b> on the lower side to each other, and seals the first upper end seal <b>71</b> and the second upper end seal <b>72</b> on the upper side to each other, and the entire periphery including the upper, lower, right, and left sides of the check valve <b>10</b> to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and a fluid that flowed from the inlet <b>11</b> on the back surface side of the upper portion into the inside of the bag <b>1</b><i>a </i>passes through the valve flow channel <b>13</b> inside the check valve <b>10</b>, and flows out to the outside of the bag <b>1</b><i>a </i>from the opening <b>1</b><i>c </i>through the outlet <b>12</b> on the front surface side of the lower portion.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">In this check valve <b>10</b>, the portion between the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> and the valve sheet <b>61</b> opposed to the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> serves as the valve flow channel <b>13</b>. In the valve flow channel <b>13</b>, the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> and the valve sheet <b>61</b> normally overlap each other, and a fluid that flowed in from the inlet <b>11</b> moves the valve sheet <b>61</b> to the back surface side, and accordingly, the valve flow channel <b>13</b> opens and the fluid flows out. Even when the fluid flows in the opposite direction, the pressure in the portion between the valve sheet <b>61</b> and the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> becomes negative as compared with the pressure in the portion between the valve sheet <b>61</b> closed by the fixation portion <b>14</b> and the inlet <b>11</b> and one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b>, so that the valve sheet <b>61</b> comes into close contact with the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> and the valve flow channel <b>13</b> closes. Therefore, the length of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> is set on condition that the above-described valve function is performed, and the lower end of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> is set at a position which is lower than the fixation portion <b>14</b> and at a position where close contact with the valve sheet <b>61</b> is secured. In the example shown in the drawing, the lower end of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> is set to be lower than the lower end of the valve sheet <b>61</b>, however, the position of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> may be the same as or higher than the position of the valve sheet <b>61</b>. The lower end of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> is at substantially the same position as the upper end of the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b>, however, the lower end of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> may be higher than, or according to the circumstances, may be lower than the upper end of the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b>. The portion between the lower end of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> and the sheet on the back surface side thereof serves as the outlet <b>12</b>, however, in this example, as described above, the outer periphery of the check valve <b>10</b> is bonded to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>by the storage body fixing seal <b>84</b>, so that the portion between the lower end of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> and the storage body fixing seal <b>84</b> on the lower side (specifically, the storage body fixing seal <b>84</b> between the second lower end seal <b>76</b> and the first lower end seal <b>77</b>) serves as the outlet <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">A fluid that flowed out from the outlet <b>12</b> flows out to the outside of the bag <b>1</b><i>a </i>from the opening <b>1</b><i>c</i>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the opening <b>1</b><i>c </i>is provided at substantially the same position as that of the outlet <b>12</b> on the lower side, however, it may be provided at any position as long as the position is inside of the storage body fixing seal <b>84</b>. According to the circumstances, it is also possible that the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> is not provided and the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>is commonly used as the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b>, however, in this case, the opening <b>1</b><i>c </i>serves as the outlet <b>12</b>, so that the opening <b>1</b><i>c </i>is provided at a position lower than the fixation portion <b>14</b> at a position where close contact with the valve sheet <b>61</b> and the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>is secured.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">The check valve <b>10</b> having the above-described structure is used after it is sealed at the entire periphery to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and unlike Patent Documents described above, the check valve <b>10</b> is not fixed by heat seal to the bag <b>1</b><i>a </i>at the position of the fixation portion <b>14</b>, so that it is not necessary to provide welding preventive means such as a heat-resistant ink or a heat-resistant plate for preventing the portion as the valve flow channel <b>13</b> between the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> and the valve sheet <b>61</b> from being heat-sealed concurrently. However, if the internal pressure of the bag <b>1</b><i>a </i>increases, as shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pressure is applied in the thickness direction to the entirety of all sheets constituting the check valve <b>10</b>. Therefore, the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> and the valve sheet <b>61</b> come into close contact with each other, and a valve opening operation for opening the valve by moving the valve sheet <b>61</b> by a fluid that flowed in from the inlet <b>11</b> may not be smoothly performed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">Therefore, according to the present invention, introduction recesses <b>15</b> for smoothly moving the valve sheet <b>61</b> by a fluid are provided. In this example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(D)</figref>, introduction recesses <b>15</b> are partially provided on the fixation portion <b>14</b> and the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> on the upstream side of the fixation portion <b>14</b>. The introduction recesses <b>15</b> are formed by forming the fixation portion <b>14</b> by the first valve fixing seal <b>73</b> and the second valve fixing seal <b>74</b> and then pressing a mold (not shown) from the front surface side to the back surface side of the valve sheet <b>61</b>. This mold is preferably heated in advance to partially melt the valve sheet <b>61</b> and the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, however, the sheet can be recessed without heating the mold immediately after the formation of the fixation portion <b>14</b>. Instead of this method using a mold, a sheet provided with irregularities in advance can also be used, or the introduction recesses can be formed by an appropriate method, however, by the method using a mold after the formation of the fixation portion <b>14</b>, the introduction recesses can be most accurately and satisfactorily formed when the irregularities are formed on the melted seals of the fixation portion <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">The introduction recesses <b>15</b> may be directionless like spots or planar shapes, however, they preferably have directionality. As the directionality, provision in the up-down direction along the fluid flow direction is more preferable than provision in the direction orthogonal to the fluid flow direction. In particular, the introduction recesses are preferably provided so that the irregularities are formed in the width direction of the valve sheet <b>61</b>, and preferably provided at a position including the upper end of the valve sheet <b>61</b>. The reason for this is that the upper end of the valve sheet <b>61</b> is a portion that serves as a weir for a flow from the inlet <b>11</b> to the valve flow channel <b>13</b>, and by providing the introduction recesses <b>15</b> on this portion serving as a weir, a smooth valve sheet <b>61</b> is realized. In this example, the lower ends of the introduction recesses <b>15</b> are within the first valve fixing seal <b>73</b>. The first valve fixing seal <b>73</b> and the second valve fixing seal <b>74</b> sandwich a portion that is not sealed, and the introduction recesses <b>15</b> are not formed on the second valve fixing seal <b>74</b>. This is a measure for preventing smoothness of the valve sheet <b>61</b> from being lost more than necessary due to the mold of the introduction recesses <b>15</b>, and for securing close contact between the valve sheet <b>61</b> and the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> when the valve closes. However, the introduction recesses <b>15</b> may range to the second valve fixing seal <b>74</b> and may be further extended to the downstream portion of the fixation portion <b>14</b> on the valve sheet <b>61</b> as long as the close contact between the valve sheet <b>61</b> and the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> when the valve closes is not lost. On the other hand, the upper ends of the introduction recesses <b>15</b> may be provided on the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> on the upstream side over the fixation portion <b>14</b>. By providing the introduction recesses <b>15</b> on the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, a fluid can be more smoothly guided to the valve flow channel <b>13</b>. According to the circumstances, the introduction recesses may be provided only on the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, however, provision on the fixation portion <b>14</b> of the valve sheet <b>61</b> is advantageous for getting over the weir as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">This will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When the section a (the portion of the inlet <b>11</b> of the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>), the section b (the upper portion of the first valve fixing seal <b>73</b>), the section c (the lower portion of the first valve fixing seal <b>73</b>), the section d (the second valve fixing seal <b>74</b>), and the section e (the movable portion lower than the second valve fixing seal <b>74</b> of the valve sheet <b>61</b>) are defined, the introduction recesses <b>15</b> according to the preferred embodiment shown in the drawing are provided in the section a to the section b. Other examples are also possible in which the introduction recesses are provided only in the section b, in the section b to the section c, in the section b to the section d, in the section b to the section e, in the section a to the section c, in the section a to the section d, in the section a to the section e, and only in the section a, etc. Even when the fixation portion <b>14</b> is not divided into the first valve fixing seal <b>73</b> and the second valve fixing seal <b>74</b> but is formed as one seal portion, the introduction recesses <b>15</b> can be provided in the same manner as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">In the above-described examples, the introduction recesses <b>15</b> are provided on the valve sheet <b>61</b> and the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b>, however, the introduction recesses <b>15</b> may be provided on the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> on the opposite side. In this case, the introduction recesses <b>15</b> may be provided only on the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b>, or may be provided on both of these sheets. The positions at which the introduction recesses <b>15</b> are provided are set to be the same as the positions of the introduction recesses <b>15</b> on the side of the valve sheet <b>61</b> and the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> in the direction of thickness of the sheets, and are provided at positions shown by using the sections in the above-described examples.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">Three introduction recesses <b>15</b> are provided, however, at least one introduction recess is necessary, and the number of introduction recesses can be appropriately changed according to the lateral width of the valve flow channel <b>13</b>. Further, a flow channel limiting seal (not shown) can also be provided to bond the valve sheet <b>61</b> and the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> to the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">Next, auxiliary recesses <b>16</b> will be described. The auxiliary recesses <b>16</b> are provided on a portion including the upper end of the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b>, and are provided from the lower portion of the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> to the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b>. The auxiliary recesses <b>16</b> are provided for balancing with the introduction recesses <b>15</b> and restraining movements of the auxiliary sheets <b>51</b>, and the auxiliary recesses may not be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">Last, a method for manufacturing this check valve <b>10</b> will be described. At the time of manufacturing, a continuous welding device for a sheet that is generally used for manufacturing a sheet-like check valve can be used. First, four rolls made of webs for forming sheets are prepared. A first web is for the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b>, a second web is for the inlet <b>11</b>, a third web is for the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> and the valve sheet <b>61</b>, and a fourth web is for the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">The auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> and the valve sheet <b>61</b> are formed by forming a slit that becomes a boundary between the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> and the valve sheet <b>61</b> in the third web. For adjusting their lengths in relation to the inlet <b>11</b>, slits are formed in the first web and the third web.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">In the first web, the second web and the third web, seals of the first valve fixing seal <b>73</b>, the second valve fixing seal <b>74</b>, the auxiliary fixing seal <b>75</b>, and the second lower end seal <b>76</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">In the first web, the second web, and the third web, the introduction recesses <b>15</b> and the auxiliary recesses <b>16</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">The fourth web is supplied onto the first web, the second web, and the third web, and the first side seal <b>81</b>, the second side seal <b>82</b>, the first upper end seal <b>71</b>, the second upper end seal <b>72</b>, and the first lower end seal <b>77</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">Last, check valves <b>10</b> may be separated from each other and then shipped, or may be wound like a continuous roll and shipped. Then, each check valve is supplied onto the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>for manufacturing the bag <b>1</b><i>a</i>, and the storage body fixing seal <b>84</b> is formed between the side non-sealed portion <b>83</b> and the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>and bonded. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref>, other seals are formed on the side non-sealed portion <b>83</b>, however, it is also preferable that no seal is formed on the side non-sealed portion <b>83</b> to improve the completeness of sealing to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the check valve <b>10</b> is attached to the inside of the bag <b>1</b><i>a</i>, however, it can also be attached to the outside. In this case, the inlet <b>11</b> is aligned with and attached to the opening <b>1</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, on the assumption that the bag is used as a bag for storing coffee beans or rice, a compression storage bag for storing various items such as clothing or food, and a bag for pouring seasoning liquids or oil out, the check valve is used as a check valve that allows a fluid inside to flow out and prevents the fluid from flowing back from the outside to the inside.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">To the contrary, the check valve can also be used as a check valve that allows a fluid to flow from the outside to the inside and prevents the fluid from flowing back from the inside to the outside. In detail, in order to allow a fluid to flow-in from the opening <b>1</b><i>c </i>of the bag <b>1</b><i>a</i>, in the case where the check valve is attached to the inside of the bag <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the back surface of the illustrated check valve <b>10</b> is attached along the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and the inlet <b>11</b> is aligned with and attached to the opening <b>1</b><i>c </i>of the bag <b>1</b><i>a</i>. In a similar example, when the check valve is attached to the outside of the bag <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the front surface of the check valve <b>10</b> is set along the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the opening <b>1</b><i>c </i>is aligned with and attached to the outlet <b>12</b>. As a purpose of the bag <b>1</b><i>a </i>in this case, it can be used as a cushioning material in which air is sealed inside or as a liquid injection sealing bag by way of example. The check valve can also be used for a rigid container made of a synthetic resin plate, etc., as well as bags.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">Next, another preferred embodiment will be described briefly, and the above-described description is applied when there is no description of the details.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">First, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example in which the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> is not provided. In this example, the outer periphery of the second lower end seal <b>76</b> is directly sealed and attached to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref> shows an example in which the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> is not provided and the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> is provided only at the portion corresponding to the inlet <b>11</b>. It is also possible that the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> is provided only at the portion corresponding to the inlet <b>11</b> and the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> is provided although this is not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(B)</figref> shows an example in which neither the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> nor the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> is provided. It is also possible that the one-side breathable base sheet <b>41</b> is not provided and the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> is provided although this is not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an example in which the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> is not provided and the second valve sheet <b>62</b> is provided on the front surface side of the valve sheet <b>61</b>. It is also possible that the second valve sheet <b>62</b> is provided and the auxiliary sheet <b>51</b> is provided although this is not shown. In this example, the portion between the valve sheet <b>61</b> and the second valve sheet <b>62</b> serves as the valve flow channel <b>13</b>. The second valve sheet <b>62</b> may be provided so as to have substantially the same shape and the same size as those of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b>, however, the shape and the size may be different as long as the valve function is performed. The second valve sheet <b>62</b> may be sealed and attached to the inlet <b>11</b> together with the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b>, and the introduction recesses <b>15</b> may be provided on the second valve sheet <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">The check valve of the present invention may include not only one valve flow channel but a plurality of partitioned valve flow channels.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">Each of the check valves according to the preferred embodiments described above is used upon sealing its entire periphery to the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b</i>, however, as in the case of the above-described Patent Documents, the check valve may be fixed by heat seal, etc., to the bag <b>1</b><i>a </i>at the position of the fixation portion <b>14</b>. This example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this attaching structure, the check valve <b>10</b> is sandwiched and fixed between the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>constituting the bag <b>1</b><i>a</i>. In detail, at the position of the fixation portion <b>14</b>, a bag fixing seal <b>91</b> is formed between the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>on the front surface side and the front surface of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b>, and a bag fixing seal <b>91</b> is formed between the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>on the back surface side and the one-side airtight base sheet <b>31</b>. For the bag fixing seals <b>91</b>, an adhesive agent may be used, or heat seal may be applied. In order to prevent the valve flow channel <b>13</b> from being closed by heat of heat seal, a welding preventive portion <b>92</b> such as a heat-resistant ink is formed on the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b>. This welding preventive portion <b>92</b> may be formed on the valve sheet <b>61</b> side, and may be formed on both of the other-side airtight base sheet <b>21</b> and the valve sheet <b>61</b> side. The bag fixing seal <b>91</b> and the fixation portion <b>14</b> (<b>73</b>, <b>74</b>) may be heat-sealed by one heat seal. In this case, at the stage for shipping the check valve <b>10</b>, heat seal of the fixation portion <b>14</b> (<b>73</b>, <b>74</b>) is not performed, and at the stage for processing the bag <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the check valve <b>10</b> may be sandwiched between the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the bag sheet <b>1</b><i>b </i>at the stage of processing of the bag <b>1</b><i>a </i>and heat seal is applied.</p>
