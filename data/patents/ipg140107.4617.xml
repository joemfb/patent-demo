<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to the field of communication technologies, and in particular, to a data modulation and demodulation method, a spectrum management method, a spectrum management apparatus, and a spectrum management system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With development of communication technology, cognitive radio attracts more and more attention. Cognitive radio is characterized by flexibility, intelligence, and re-configurability. By sensing external environment and learning from the environment through an artificial intelligence technology, the cognitive radio changes certain operation parameters (such as transmission power, carrier frequency, and modulation technology, etc.) purposefully in real time, and makes the internal state adaptable to the statistical change of received radio signals, thereby implementing highly reliable communication anytime anywhere and making efficient use of limited radio spectrum resources in a heterogeneous network environment. The essence of the cognitive radio is to implement dynamic spectrum allocation and spectrum sharing through spectrum sensing and the intelligent learning capability of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To manage and allocate spectra to different systems dynamically, researchers put forward a concept of cognitive pilot channel (CPC, Cognitive Pilot Channel). It is very time-consuming and power-consuming to obtain radio environment information by only sensing and sweeping the spectra one by one in the frequency band from 400 MHz to 6 GHz. The CPC can manage and allocate the spectra in real time, and a terminal can obtain information on use of the radio spectrum by reading the CPC channel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A Long Term Evolution (LTE, long term evolution) system can share a spectrum with TV channels or a GSM system, and so on, and different LTE operators can also share the spectrum. An LTE transmitting terminal is a data modulation apparatus for modulating and sending data, and an LTE receiving terminal is a data demodulation apparatus for receiving and demodulating data. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of sharing a spectrum between the LTE and the TV channel, in which a busy frequency band in use, whose bandwidth is 8 MHZ, exists between two idle frequency bands. The frequency band on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has a bandwidth of 8 MHZ. The LTE system uses only frequency bands whose bandwidth is 5a MHZ (a is an integer) such as 5 MHZ, 10 MHZ, 15 MHZ, and so on. Therefore, the LTE system is unable to make full use of a frequency band whose bandwidth is 8 MHZ, and 2 MHZ or (2+5a) MHZ need to be added to the 8 MHZ to make up a 10 MHZ frequency band so that the frequency band can be made full use of by the LTE system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the conventional art, as a spectrum management apparatus, the CPC network senses the use of spectrum in a radio scenario, and sends the spectrum usage information to the transmitting terminal and the receiving terminal of the LTE system. The spectrum usage information includes specific locations and bandwidths of the idle frequency bands and the busy frequency bands among the frequency bands. The LTE transmitting terminal receives the spectrum usage information and converts the data, and then performs windowing and filtering and sends the processed data out through an idle frequency band according to the spectrum usage information of the CPC network; the LTE receiving terminal receives and demodulates the data. Artisans find that when the LTE system shares the spectrum, if the data is modulated through a traditional filtering method, discontinuous frequency bands generate considerable out-of-band emission. Therefore, artisans propose to pre-filter baseband signals when the LTE transmitting terminal modulates data to suppress out-of-band emission of discontinuous bands.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In researching and practicing the conventional art, the inventor finds that the LTE transmitting terminal pre-filters the baseband signals, but the pre-filtering operation is not notified to the LTE receiving terminal; with the receiving terminal being unaware of the pre-filtering operation, the demodulation error is considerable.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The following detailed description of the technical solutions of embodiments is given in conjunction with the accompanying drawings of embodiments to provide a thorough understanding of the claims. The drawings and the detailed description are merely representative of some particular embodiments of the claims rather than all the embodiments. Other embodiments, which can be derived by those skilled in the art from the embodiments given herein without any creative effort, shall fall within the protection scope of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The embodiments provide a spectrum management method that enables a data transmitting system to transmit data in a dynamic discontinuous spectrum environment, and also provide a spectrum management apparatus and a spectrum management system correspondingly, which are detailed below.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A basic procedure of a spectrum management method in a first embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The method in this embodiment includes:</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Step <b>101</b>: Obtaining a target frequency band allocated to a transmitting terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A CPC network can sense spectrum usage of a current radio scene, and allocate an idle frequency band as a target frequency band to the transmitting terminal; or the CPC network receives the usage information of the radio scene sensed by the transmitting terminal, and determines the target frequency band accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Step <b>102</b>: Calculating a precoding codeword index of spectrum shaping according to a codebook corresponding to the radio scene and the target frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Specifically, the codebook corresponding to the radio scene is a predefined standard parameter, and includes a codeword index and a corresponding return-to-zero subcarrier sequence. Each codeword corresponds to a spectrum mask shape. The codebook is obtained beforehand through training. Corresponding codeword indexes are created for the spectrum mask shapes corresponding to all possible spectrum distributions, and the return-to-zero subcarrier sequence corresponding to the codeword is obtained through an emulation test. Each return-to-zero subcarrier sequence serves to calculate a precoding vector in the radio scene.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An index of a finite set of finite return-to-zero frequencies is calculated and determined according to the codebook corresponding to the radio scene and the allocated target frequency band. The index is the precoding codeword index of spectrum shaping.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Specifically, the steps of calculating the precoding codeword index are: obtaining the spectrum mask shape of the target frequency band according to the radio scene and the spectrum sensing result; and comparing the spectrum mask shape of the target frequency band with the spectrum mask shape corresponding to each codeword in the codebook, where the comparison may be performed by using a pattern matching algorithm; and outputting a codeword set of the spectrum mask shape closest to the spectrum mask shape of the target frequency band as a codeword index. For example, spectra are sampled in a target frequency band to obtain a sampled sequence; the sampled sequence is compared with spectrum occupancy sequences of all code words in the codebook, and the codeword index corresponding to the closest spectrum occupancy sequence is output as a precoding codeword index. The specific pattern matching methods may differ. Here we give only a simple example to describe the method of matching the spectrum mask according to the sampled sequence of the target frequency band. The ideal spectrum occupancy corresponding to three code words <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, and <b>2</b> in the codebook is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and the spectrum sensing measurement result is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in which the oblique line part represents a busy frequency band. Through spectrum sampling, a sampled sequence e={e<b>1</b> e<b>2</b> . . . } is obtained. It is assumed that the sampled sequence is e={0 1 0}. Therefore, the sampled sequence is compared with the codeword spectrum mask shapes of the sequences corresponding to A, B, and C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is closest to B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, where Index<sub>opt</sub>=min=&#x2225;&#xea;&#x2212;e<sub>i</sub>&#x2225; (e<sub>i </sub>is the sequence corresponding to each codeword in the codebook) represents a set of the code words corresponding to graph B. This set is the precoding codeword index and indicates the frequency return-to-zero sequence corresponding to the spectrum mask shape. The transmitter calculates and obtains precoding vector according to the frequency return-to-zero sequence corresponding to Index<sub>opt</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Step <b>103</b>: Sending the precoding codeword index out.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The precoding codeword index determined in step <b>102</b> is delivered to each terminal over a CPC or another control channel through broadcast. The transmitter calculates the precoding vector G according to the frequency return-to-zero sequence corresponding to Index<sub>opt</sub>. After receiving the precoding codeword index, the receiving terminal calculates the precoding vector, knows pre-distortion operation of the transmitting terminal, and demodulates the data.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Through this embodiment, the codebook corresponding to the radio scene is obtained, the codeword index of the precoding vector is calculated, the precoding vector is obtained, and the data is modulated or demodulated according to the precoding vector. Therefore, the spectrum is sensed and allocated dynamically according to the radio scene, the out-of-band emission is reduced, the interference is reduced between users who share the spectrum, and the receiving terminal's capability of demodulating data is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">For ease of understanding, the following expounds a spectrum shaping signaling method in an embodiment by taking a master-slave mode as an example. In the master-slave mode, the CPC network is a spectrum management apparatus, senses radio spectrum usage, and determines and allocates an idle target frequency band to the transmitting terminal and the receiving terminal in the LTE system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a spectrum management method in a second embodiment includes the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Step <b>201</b>: The CPC network senses spectrum usage of a current radio scene, and estimates a current noise level.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The CPC network senses the spectrum usage of the current radio scene, and estimates and measures an interference level acceptable to the master system dynamically.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Step <b>202</b>: The CPC network obtains a specific location of an idle frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">By sensing the spectrum usage of the radio scene, the CPC network knows the specific locations of the idle frequency bands and the busy frequency bands, and therefore, can determine the specific location of the idle frequency bands in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Step <b>203</b>: The CPC network receives from an LTE system a request for initializing spectrum bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Step <b>204</b>: According to the estimated noise level and the spectrum usage of the radio scene, making a selection in the idle frequency bands, and allocating a proper spectrum bandwidth to the LTE system, thereby determining the allocated target frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Step <b>205</b>: The CPC network calculates and determines an index of a finite set of finite return-to-zero frequencies according to the codebook corresponding to the radio scene and the allocated target frequency band. The index is the precoding codeword index of spectrum shaping.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The codebook corresponding to the radio scene is a predefined standard parameter, and includes a codeword index and a corresponding return-to-zero subcarrier sequence. Each codeword corresponds to a spectrum mask shape. The codebook is obtained beforehand through training. Corresponding codeword indexes are created for the spectrum mask shapes corresponding to all possible spectrum distributions, and the return-to-zero subcarrier sequence corresponding to the codeword is obtained through an emulation test. Each return-to-zero subcarrier sequence serves to calculate a precoding vector in the radio scene.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">An index of a finite set of finite return-to-zero frequencies is calculated and determined according to the codebook corresponding to the radio scene and the allocated target frequency band. The index is the precoding codeword index of spectrum shaping. Specifically, the steps of calculating the precoding codeword index are: the codeword set corresponding to the spectrum occupancy sequence closest to the spectrum mask shape of the target frequency band in the codebook is output as the precoding codeword index, according to the radio scene and the spectrum sensing result (spectrum mask shape of the target frequency band).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Step <b>206</b>: The CPC network delivers the precoding codeword index determined in step <b>205</b> to each terminal over a CPC or another control channel through broadcast. After receiving the precoding codeword index, the receiving terminal may calculate the precoding vector according to the codeword index, thereby demodulating the received data.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The following expounds a spectrum shaping signaling method in this embodiment by taking an on-demand mode as an example. In the on-demand mode, the LTE system senses radio spectrum usage, determines a target frequency band, and requests the target frequency band from the CPC network (spectrum management apparatus). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a spectrum management method in a second embodiment includes the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Step <b>301</b>: The CPC network receives spectrum usage of a current radio scene and a noise level, which are sensed by a LTE system, and receives a frequency band requested by the LTE and a codebook corresponding to the radio scene, thereby obtaining an allocated target frequency band. The target frequency band is the frequency band requested by the LTE.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Step <b>302</b>: The CPC network sends a codebook requested by the LTE system to the LTE system.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Step <b>303</b>: The CPC network determines a precoding codeword index and delivers it through broadcast.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The CPC network may calculate and determine an index of a finite set of finite return-to-zero frequencies according to the estimated noise level, the spectrum usage of the radio scene and the target frequency band requested by the CPC network. The detailed calculation method is the same as step <b>205</b> in the second embodiment. The index is the precoding codeword index of spectrum shaping.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Step <b>304</b>: The CPC network delivers the precoding codeword index determined in step <b>303</b> to each terminal over a CPC or another control channel through broadcast. After receiving the precoding codeword index, the receiving terminal may calculate a precoding vector according to the codebook, thereby demodulating the received data.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Through this embodiment, the codebook corresponding to the radio scene is obtained, then the codeword index of the precoding vector is calculated, such that the precoding vector is obtained, and the data is modulated or demodulated according to the precoding vector. Therefore, the spectrum is sensed and allocated dynamically according to the radio scene, the out-of-band emission is reduced, the interference is reduced between users who share the spectrum, and the receiving terminal's capability of demodulating data is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The following expounds a data modulation method provided in an embodiment, in which a transmitting terminal of an LTE system serves as an entity for executing the data modulation method. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the method includes the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Step <b>401</b>: Obtaining a precoding codeword index.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The LTE system may sense a radio scene and a noise level, and calculate a precoding codeword index by determining a target frequency band; or, LTE system senses the spectrum usage of the radio scene and the noise level, and then the CPC calculates the precoding codeword index and returns it to the LTE system; or, the CPC network senses the long-term spectrum usage of the radio scene and the noise level, calculates the precoding codeword index, and returns it to the LTE system.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Step <b>402</b>: Calculating a precoding vector according to a codebook corresponding to the radio scene and the precoding codeword index. The precoding codeword index may be broadcast by the CPC network, and the precoding vector can be calculated easily according to the precoding codeword index broadcast by the CPC network.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Step <b>403</b>: Modulating data according to the precoding vector and sending the data out.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The subcarrier data are mapped according to the precoding vector, and then the operations including IFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) serial-to-parallel transformation, and so on are performed, and the data are transmitted out through antennas. Such a data modulation method differs from the traditional transmitting method of a windowing and filtering transmitter in that: in modulating the data according to the precoding vector, the out-of-band emission is suppressed and the spectrum is shaped dynamically through pre-distortion of baseband signals.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Through this embodiment, the codebook corresponding to the radio scene is obtained, and the codeword index of the precoding vector is calculated, such that the precoding vector is obtained, and the data is modulated or demodulated according to the precoding vector. Therefore, the spectrum is sensed and allocated dynamically according to the radio scene, the out-of-band emission is reduced, the interference is reduced between users who share the spectrum, and the receiving terminal's capability of demodulating data is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The following expounds a data demodulation method provided in an embodiment, in which a receiving terminal of an LTE system serves as an entity for executing the method. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the method includes the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Step <b>501</b>: Receiving a precoding codeword index broadcast through a CPC.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Step <b>502</b>: Calculating a precoding vector according to a codebook corresponding to a radio scene and the precoding codeword index. In the on-demand mode, the codebook corresponding to the radio scene is requested and downloaded by the LTE terminal; in the master-slave mode, the codebook corresponding to the radio scene is determined by the CPC and delivered to the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Step <b>503</b>: Calculating the precoding vector according to the codeword index, and demodulate received data according to the calculated precoding vector.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The receiving terminal knows the precoding vector, and therefore, knows the pre-distortion operation of the transmitting terminal. Through repeated iterative calculation, the error baseline possibly occurring on the demodulation side can be eliminated, and thus the transparent transmission can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Through this embodiment, the codebook corresponding to the radio scene is obtained, the codeword index of the precoding vector is calculated, such that the precoding vector is obtained, and the data is modulated or demodulated according to the precoding vector.
