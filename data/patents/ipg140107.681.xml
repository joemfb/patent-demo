<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the field of work vehicles. It relates more particularly to work vehicles having a fluid system for manipulating attachments.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Work vehicles, such as a loader backhoe, also referred to as a backhoe, are versatile machines that are commonly used on job sites. A wide arrangement of attachments that operate using the pressurized fluid systems such as thumbs, hammers, compactors, brooms, planers, augers, etc., contribute to the versatility of the work vehicle. While a number of the attachments are configured to operate using uni-directional fluid flow (one flow direction; having dedicated pressure and return line), others are configured to operate using bi-directional fluid flow (reversible flow direction; i.e., forward and reverse).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is desirable to have the capability to run both uni-directional and bi-directional attachments on the same work vehicle. That is, the work vehicle would have a uni-directional mode to operate uni-directional attachments, as well as a bi-directional mode to operate bi-directional attachments. To accommodate both attachments, albeit one attachment at a time, a number of manufacturers run four (4) hoses/tubes through the boom to power the attachments. However, the use of four hoses/tubes increases cost, as well as the opportunity for damage to the hoses during normal use and hoses extending exterior of the machine structure may also reduce visibility to the working area of the machine, even when no attachments are in use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, mindful that users may wish to switch between uni-directional and bi-directional attachments, protections must be provided in case a bi-directional attachment is utilized when the work vehicle is configured to operate in a uni-directional mode, possibly causing damage to the bi-directional attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it would be advantageous to prevent inadvertent damage to a bi-directional attachment when the work vehicle is configured to operate in a uni-directional mode, while also avoiding other disadvantages of the known art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to a work machine including a fluid circuit for use with an attachment configured to operate using one of a uni-directional flow and a bi-directional flow through the attachment. The circuit includes an operator-enabled mode selection switch operably connected to a controller. An electrical circuit includes the operator-enabled mode selection switch and a second operator-enabled switch. A first control valve is in fluid communication with the attachment, the first control valve including a first bi-directional position, a uni-directional position and a second bi-directional position. In response to the mode selection switch being actuated to a bi-directional mode setting by the operator, the first control valve via the controller, is actuatable by the operator to one of the bi-directional positions, and electrical power is unavailable to the second operator-enabled switch of the electrical circuit. In response to the mode selection switch being actuated to a uni-directional mode setting by the operator, the first control valve via the controller, secures the first control valve in the uni-directional position, and electrical power is provided to the second operator-enabled switch of the electrical circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention further relates to a work machine including a fluid circuit for use with an attachment configured to operate using one of a uni-directional flow and a bi-directional flow through the attachment. The fluid circuit includes an operator-enabled mode selection switch operably connected to a controller. An electrical circuit includes the operator-enabled mode selection switch and a second operator-enabled switch. A first control valve is in fluid communication with the attachment, the first control valve comprising a first bi-directional position, a uni-directional position and a second bi-directional position. The first control valve includes a solenoid to selectively secure the control valve in the uni-directional position. In response to the mode selection switch being actuated to a bi-directional mode setting by the operator, the first control valve via the controller, is actuatable by the operator to one of the bi-directional positions, and electrical power is unavailable to the second operator-enabled switch of the electrical circuit. In response to the mode selection switch being actuated to a uni-directional mode setting by the operator, the first control valve via the controller, secures the first control valve in the uni-directional position, and electrical power is provided to the second operator-enabled switch of the electrical circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An advantage of the present invention is enhanced protection for uni-directional and bi-directional attachments for use with the work vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of the preferred embodiment, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to the drawings for a description of an earthworking machine <b>10</b> that employs the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a boom <b>14</b> in a lowered position. Boom <b>14</b> pivots about a pivot joint <b>34</b> and coincident pivot axis of a frame <b>20</b> and is controlled by extension/contraction of a fluid ram <b>22</b> connected between pivot joints <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. Similarly, an arm <b>16</b>, often referred to as a dipper, pivots about pivot joint <b>32</b> of boom <b>14</b> and is controlled by extension/contraction of fluid ram <b>24</b> connected between pivot joints <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>. In addition, implement or attachment <b>18</b>, such as a bucket, is pivotably connected to arm <b>16</b> and is controlled by extension/contraction of a fluid ram <b>26</b> connected between pivot joint <b>40</b> and interconnected linkages <b>42</b>. A backhoe <b>12</b> comprises the combination of boom <b>14</b>, arm <b>16</b>, implement <b>18</b> and pivoting connections therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure is directed to attachments that operate using a fluid circuit of a pressurized fluid system of the machine, such as thumbs, hammers, compactors, brooms, planers, augers, etc., which attachments are configured to operate using uni-directional fluid flow or bi-directional fluid flow. The present disclosure is further directed to preventing damage to these attachments in case the operator selects an incorrect mode of operation. That is, for example, configuring the machine to operate with a uni-directional attachment, when in fact, a bi-directional attachment is utilized. In such a circumstance, the attachment may be damaged by providing a greater pressure to the return line of the attachment than the attachment is designed to handle, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;backflowing&#x201d; the attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a fluid circuit <b>50</b> configured for operation with a bi-directional attachment <b>52</b>, including an electrical circuit <b>60</b>. In the bi-directional mode, an operator-enabled mode selection switch <b>62</b> is actuated to a bi-directional mode setting. In response to the operator selecting the bi-directional mode setting, electrical power is removed or is otherwise unavailable to a second operator-enabled switch <b>64</b>. That is, second operator-enabled switch <b>64</b>, which selectively provides pressurized fluid to attachment <b>52</b> when electrical power from electrical circuit <b>60</b> is provided to the switch, is disabled. Also in response to the operator selecting the bi-directional mode setting, a control valve <b>80</b> having an open position <b>82</b> and a closed position <b>84</b> is actuated to its open position <b>82</b>, such as by a controller <b>66</b>. By virtue of control valve <b>80</b> being maintained in open position <b>82</b>, lines <b>98</b>, <b>99</b> are maintained in fluid communication with line <b>100</b> which is in fluid communication with a reservoir <b>86</b>. Line <b>98</b> is in fluid communication with a line <b>102</b> that is connected to a control valve <b>88</b> having an open position <b>90</b> and a closed position <b>92</b>. In response to the low fluid pressure level maintained in line <b>98</b>, control valve <b>88</b> is urged to closed position <b>92</b>. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, pressurized fluid from a pressurized fluid source (not shown), enters a variable flow control valve <b>76</b> via line <b>94</b>. Fluid having a raised pressure level is directed from control valve <b>76</b> via line <b>96</b>, which line <b>96</b> bifurcates into lines <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> that lead to a first control valve <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first control valve <b>54</b> includes a first bi-directional position <b>68</b>, a uni-directional position <b>70</b>, and a second bi-directional position <b>72</b> In response to the operator selectably placing operator-enabled mode selection switch <b>62</b> in the bi-directional setting position, controller <b>66</b>, which controls solenoid <b>56</b> of first control valve <b>54</b>, urges solenoid <b>56</b> to disengage position control of the first control valve, permitting operator control of the position of the first control valve by an operator-controlled lever <b>74</b>, such as between first bi-directional position <b>68</b> and second bi-directional position <b>72</b>. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first control valve <b>54</b> has been placed in first bi-directional position <b>68</b>, so that pressurized fluid in line <b>108</b> flows through first control valve <b>54</b>, through line <b>112</b>, providing fluid power to attachment <b>52</b>. On the return side from attachment <b>52</b>, line <b>106</b> is in fluid communication with first control valve <b>54</b> and with line <b>118</b>, emptying into reservoir <b>87</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows fluid circuit <b>150</b>, similar to fluid circuit <b>50</b>, configured for operation with a uni-directional attachment <b>152</b>, including an electrical circuit <b>60</b>. In the uni-directional mode, operator-enabled mode selection switch <b>62</b> is actuated to a uni-directional mode setting. In response to the operator selecting the uni-directional mode setting, electrical power is provided to second operator-enabled switch <b>64</b>. That is, second operator-enabled switch <b>64</b>, which selectively provides pressurized fluid to attachment <b>152</b> when electrical power from electrical circuit <b>60</b> is provided to the switch, is enabled. Also in response to the operator selecting the uni-directional mode setting, control valve <b>80</b> is actuated to its closed position <b>84</b>, such as by controller <b>66</b>. By virtue of control valve <b>80</b> being maintained in closed position <b>84</b> in fluid communication with a relief valve <b>59</b>, the fluid pressure level is maintained at a raised pressure in lines <b>98</b>, <b>99</b>. Line <b>98</b> is in fluid communication with a line <b>102</b> that is connected to a control valve <b>88</b>. In response to the raised fluid pressure level maintained in line <b>98</b>, control valve <b>88</b> is urged to open position <b>90</b>. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, pressurized fluid from a pressurized fluid source (not shown), enters a variable flow control valve <b>76</b> via line <b>94</b>. Fluid having a raised pressure level is directed from control valve <b>76</b> via line <b>98</b>, which raised pressure level opens a check valve <b>58</b>, and flowing via lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> to attachment <b>152</b>, providing fluid power to the attachment <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in response to the operator selectably placing operator-enabled mode selection switch <b>62</b> in the uni-directional setting position, controller <b>66</b>, which controls solenoid <b>56</b> of first control valve <b>54</b>, urges solenoid <b>56</b> to engage position control of the first control valve in uni-directional position <b>70</b>, disabling operator control of the position of the first control valve by an operator-controlled lever <b>74</b>. On the return side from attachment <b>152</b>, line <b>112</b> is in fluid communication with line <b>118</b> that is in fluid communication with first control valve <b>54</b>, but flow through the first control valve via lines <b>112</b>, <b>118</b> is prevented in the uni-directional position <b>70</b>. Fluid flow from the return side of attachment <b>152</b> via line <b>112</b> may return to reservoir <b>87</b>. Alternately, due to control valve <b>88</b> being maintained in open position <b>90</b>, fluid from the return side of attachment <b>152</b> via line <b>112</b> may flow through line <b>114</b>, then through control valve <b>88</b>, before emptying into reservoir <b>86</b> via line <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is to be understood that the fluid circuit of the present disclosure may be used with either at an open-center hydraulic system, in which the control valves are positioned in series in the fluid circuit, or a closed-center hydraulic system, in which the control valves are positioned in parallel in the fluid circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an alternate embodiment, an electro-hydraulic control system may be utilized instead of a spool lock solenoid as described above in the exemplary embodiment described above. In an electro-hydraulic control system, power may be provided when the operator-enabled mode switch is set to bi-directional mode, and not provided when the mode switch is set to uni-directional mode. Alternately, a hydraulic pilot system may be employed. For example, control valve <b>88</b> may be a pilot operated check valve or a non-proportional solenoid operated valve.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
