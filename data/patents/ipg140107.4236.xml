The first chassis may comprise a coupling recess, and the second chassis may comprise a coupling projection that is received in and coupled to the coupling recess. In the first chassis, the coupling recess may be formed so that a side facing the second chassis is concave in a closed state.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Each chassis may comprise a case member whose depth is substantially equal to a thickness of the chassis. Each case member may comprise an accommodation recess to receive electronic components, and a side of each accommodation recess that faces its counterpart chassis can be concave. In this way, air-tightness (i.e., water-proof property) of the chassis or strength of the chassis can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when the first chassis comprises a case member with a depth substantially equal to the thickness of the chassis, both the coupling recess and the accommodation recess are formed while the facing sides are concave. This requires the accommodation recess and the coupling recess to be in separate regions so as not to overlap each other. As a result, space in the first chassis is not utilized effectively and therefore a size of the first chassis and thus a size of the mobile phone may be larger than they could be if space were used more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need to establish a balance between a formation of the coupling recess and effective utilization of space in the first chassis.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are illustration of a mobile phone <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of a perspective view of the mobile phone <b>1</b> in an opened state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an illustration of a perspective view of the mobile phone <b>1</b> in a closed state.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The mobile phone <b>1</b> is a so-called foldable mobile phone. The mobile phone <b>1</b> comprises a first chassis <b>3</b> and a second chassis <b>5</b>. The first chassis <b>3</b> and the second chassis <b>5</b> are coupled to each other and are rotatable about a rotating axis RA relative to each other. States of the mobile phone <b>1</b> can change between an opened state and a closed state. The first chassis <b>3</b> and second chassis <b>5</b> are coupled to each other by a coupling portion <b>6</b> at one of their respective ends. In the closed state, surface <b>36</b> of the first chassis <b>3</b> and surface <b>38</b> of the second chassis <b>5</b> overlap with each other, that is, face each other. In the opened state, surfaces <b>37</b> and <b>39</b> are separated, and the first chassis <b>3</b> and the second chassis <b>5</b> are substantially parallel to each other. Each of the first chassis <b>3</b> and second chassis <b>5</b> has a low-profile shape, such as but without limitation, substantially rectangular solid shape. Outlines of shape of the first chassis <b>3</b> and the second chassis <b>5</b> substantially match with each other in the closed state. Various components of the first chassis <b>3</b> and the second chassis <b>5</b> are explained in more detail in the context of discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, a side on which the surface <b>36</b> of the first chassis <b>3</b> and the surface <b>38</b> of the second chassis <b>5</b> face each other is referred to as a front side and an opposite side is referred to as a rear side.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The coupling portion <b>6</b> may, for example but without limitation, have a cylindrical shape having a rotating axis RA. The coupling portion <b>6</b> comprises first external portions <b>51</b> and a second external portion <b>53</b>. The first external portions <b>51</b> and the second external portion <b>53</b> are configured to rotate relative to each other about the rotating axis RA. The first external portions <b>51</b> comprise a portion of the first chassis <b>3</b>, and the second external portion <b>53</b> comprises a portion of the second chassis <b>5</b>. The two first external portions <b>51</b> are arranged in a direction of the rotating axis RA, and the second external portion <b>53</b> is located between the first external portions <b>51</b>. Diameters of the first external portions <b>51</b> are substantially equal to a diameter of the second external portion <b>53</b>. The first external portions <b>51</b> and the second external portion <b>53</b> are coaxially positioned to have one unified cylindrical shape as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the diameter d of each of the first external portions <b>51</b> and the second external portion <b>53</b> is smaller than sum of thicknesses of the first chassis <b>3</b> and second chassis <b>5</b> but larger than the thickness of the second chassis <b>5</b>. As used herein thickness of the first chassis <b>3</b> and the second chassis <b>5</b> mean a length of the first chassis <b>3</b> and second chassis <b>5</b> along the direction in which the chassis face each other (i.e., the direction Y shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first external portions <b>51</b> and the second external portion <b>53</b> are positioned such that a surface positioned on the rear side of the second chassis <b>5</b> is substantially matched with the rear side of the second chassis <b>5</b>. The first chassis <b>3</b> comprises a coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to accommodate the second external portion <b>53</b> such that a surface positioned on the rear side (not shown) of the second external portion <b>53</b> is substantially matched with the rear surface of the second chassis <b>5</b>. In other words, the second external portion <b>53</b> constitutes a coupling projection located in the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a</i>. In this manner, the first chassis <b>3</b> and the second chassis <b>5</b> are coupled to each other and are foldable between the opened state and the closed state by a rotation relative to each other about the rotating axis RA piercing through the coupling projection.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A hinge unit (not shown) may be located in the first external portions <b>51</b> and second external portion <b>53</b>, which allows the first chassis <b>3</b> and the second chassis <b>5</b> to be rotated relative to each other about the rotating axis RA. The hinge unit may include a first component that is fixed to the first chassis <b>3</b> and a second component that is fixed to the second chassis <b>5</b> while being rotatable about the rotating axis RA with respect to the first component. Alternatively, the hinge unit may be a shaft member that is inserted in the first chassis <b>3</b> and second chassis <b>5</b> in the direction of the rotating axis RA, and the hinge unit is rotatable with respect to at least one of the first chassis <b>3</b> and second chassis <b>5</b>. A signal line may also be inserted in the first external portions <b>51</b> and second external portion <b>53</b> to connect electronic circuits of the first chassis <b>3</b> and second chassis <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustration of an exploded perspective view of a first chassis <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> viewed from a front side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustration of an exploded perspective view of a first chassis <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> viewed from a rear side. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> differs from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in disassembled components.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first chassis <b>3</b> comprises a front case <b>11</b> comprising a front-side portion of the first chassis <b>3</b>, an inner case <b>13</b> comprising an inner-side portion of the first chassis <b>3</b>, a rear case <b>15</b>, and a cover <b>17</b>. The rear case <b>15</b> and the cover <b>17</b> comprise the rear-side portion of the first chassis <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The mobile phone <b>1</b> comprises a main board assembly <b>22</b>, a camera unit <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), a sub-board assembly <b>25</b>, and a battery <b>27</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), which are disposed in a laminated manner in the order from the side substantially near the front case <b>11</b> in the first chassis <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the inner case <b>13</b> has a substantially box shape in which a side of the front case <b>11</b> is opened. The inner case <b>13</b> comprises a base portion <b>13</b><i>v </i>and a wall portion <b>13</b><i>w</i>. The base portion <b>13</b><i>v </i>faces the rear side of a main board <b>23</b>. The wall portion <b>13</b><i>w </i>is vertically located on the side substantially near the front case <b>11</b> in a periphery of the base portion <b>13</b><i>v</i>. The wall portion <b>13</b><i>w </i>and the base portion <b>13</b><i>v </i>comprise a first recess <b>13</b><i>r</i>. That is, the inner case <b>13</b> comprises the first recess <b>13</b><i>r </i>that face the front side. An opening is in the base portion <b>13</b><i>v </i>to insert and take out a battery <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The front case <b>11</b> has a substantial box shape in which the side substantially near the inner case <b>13</b> is opened, and the front case <b>11</b> is thinner than the inner case <b>13</b>. The front case <b>11</b> is placed on the inner case <b>13</b> from the front side to cover the front side of the inner case <b>13</b> therewith. The front case <b>11</b> surrounds the front-side portion of the wall portion <b>13</b><i>w. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The rear case <b>15</b> has a substantially box shape in which the side substantially near the inner case <b>13</b> is opened, and the rear case <b>15</b> is thinner than the inner case <b>13</b>. An opening is in the rear side of the rear case <b>15</b> to insert and take out the battery <b>27</b>. A shape of the opening in the rear case <b>15</b> is substantially structurally isomorphic to the opening in the inner case <b>13</b>, and the size of the opening in the rear case <b>15</b> is larger than the opening in the inner case <b>13</b>. The rear case <b>15</b> is placed on the inner case <b>13</b> from the rear side to cover the rear side of the inner case <b>13</b> therewith. The rear case <b>15</b> surrounds the rear-side portion of the wall portion <b>13</b><i>w. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The cover <b>17</b> has a substantially plate shape whose shape and dimensions are substantially similar to those of the opening in the rear side of the rear case <b>15</b>. The cover <b>17</b> is located in the opening in the rear side of the rear case <b>15</b> to close the opening of the base portion <b>13</b><i>v </i>of the inner case <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, the inner case <b>13</b> is surrounded by the front case <b>11</b>, the rear case <b>15</b>, and the cover <b>17</b>. That is, the front case <b>11</b>, the rear case <b>15</b>, and the cover <b>17</b> comprise an exterior chassis <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that envelopes the inner case <b>13</b>. Since, the exterior chassis <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) envelopes the inner case <b>13</b>, the inner case <b>13</b> servers as an internal chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The front case <b>11</b>, the inner case <b>13</b>, the rear case <b>15</b>, and the cover <b>17</b> may, for example and without limitation, be mainly made of a non-conductive resin and the like. The inner case <b>13</b> is integrally molded. The inner case <b>13</b> has a depth which is substantially equal to the thickness of the first chassis <b>3</b> and all of electric devices are stored in the first chassis <b>3</b>. The front case <b>11</b>, the inner case <b>13</b>, and the rear case <b>15</b> are mutually fixed to one another by, for example but without limitation, a screw, an engagement portion, or the both, and the like. The cover <b>17</b> is detachably fixed to the inner case <b>13</b>, the rear case <b>15</b>, or the both by an engagement portion.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the keys <b>35</b> that receive the user input are exposed in the front case <b>11</b>. For example, the keys <b>35</b> may be in the front case <b>11</b>. The front case <b>11</b> comprises a case body <b>11</b><i>a </i>and a key constructing portion <b>11</b><i>b</i>. The case body <b>11</b><i>a </i>has a frame shape and comprises an opening in which the keys <b>35</b> are exposed. The key constructing portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>has a plate shape and is bonded to the case body <b>11</b><i>a </i>so as to close the opening of the case body <b>11</b><i>a</i>. The key constructing portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>may be made of a material having a relatively low rigidity, and/or a thickness of the key constructing portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>is reduced, which allows the key constructing portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>to be easily bent in response to a force/pressure from the user. The keys <b>35</b> have indexes (i.e., concavity and convexity or pattern) indicating a pressing position in the key constructing portion <b>11</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The main board assembly <b>22</b>, the camera unit <b>24</b>, and the sub board assembly <b>25</b> are sandwiched between the front case <b>11</b> and the inner case <b>13</b> in the direction in which these members are laminated. Specifically, these members are supported between the front case <b>11</b> and the base portion <b>13</b><i>v </i>of the inner case <b>13</b> mainly on both sides in a longitudinal direction of the first chassis <b>3</b>. The battery <b>27</b> is fitted in the inner case <b>13</b>, and the cover <b>17</b> supports the battery <b>27</b> so that the battery <b>27</b> doesn't drop out from the inner case <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, the main board assembly <b>22</b> comprises a main board <b>23</b>, a shielding case <b>21</b>, a flexible printed circuit (FPC) board <b>43</b>, and a key sheet <b>19</b>, which are laminated in the order from the side closed to the rear case <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The main board <b>23</b> may be, for example but without limitation, a rigid circuit board in which a hard resin is used as a base. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, the main board <b>23</b> comprises a first mounting surface <b>23</b><i>a </i>that is located on the side substantially near the front case <b>11</b> and a second mounting surface <b>23</b><i>b </i>that is located on the rear side of the first mounting surface <b>23</b><i>a</i>. Electronic components <b>29</b> are located on the first mounting surface <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the second mounting surface <b>23</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The shielding case <b>21</b> may be made of, for example but without limitation, metal. Alternatively, the shielding case <b>21</b> may comprise a non-conductive base such as resin and a conductive layer such as a metallic layer on a surface of the non-conductive base. The shielding case <b>21</b> is coupled to a ground layer of the main board <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the sub board assembly <b>25</b> comprises a sub-board <b>26</b> and a frame <b>28</b>, which are laminated in the order from the side substantially near the rear case <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The sub-board <b>26</b> may, for example but without limitation, be a rigid circuit board in which the hard resin is used as the base. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the sub-board <b>26</b> comprises a third mounting surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>that is located on the side substantially near the front case <b>11</b> and a fourth mounting surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>that is located on the rear side of the third mounting surface <b>26</b><i>a</i>. The electronic components <b>29</b> are located on the third mounting surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>and the fourth mounting surface <b>26</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An external connector <b>65</b> of the electronic component <b>29</b> is mounted on the third mounting surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the sub board <b>26</b>.

The wall portion <b>13</b><i>w </i>of the inner case <b>13</b> comprises a hole <b>13</b><i>j </i>to expose the external connector <b>65</b> to the outside. An end portion of the external connector <b>65</b> and an end portion of the sub-board <b>26</b> are disposed in the hole <b>13</b><i>j. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The frame <b>28</b> may, for example but without limitation, be made of resin. The frame <b>28</b> couples the sub-board <b>26</b> and camera unit <b>24</b> to the main board assembly <b>22</b>. For example, the frame <b>28</b> may comprises an engagement portion (not shown) and support the sub-board <b>26</b> using the engagement portion. While the camera unit <b>24</b> is sandwiched between the frame <b>28</b> and the main board <b>23</b>, the frame <b>28</b> is attached by engaging with the main board <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the camera unit <b>24</b> comprises a lens <b>24</b><i>a </i>and is disposed while the lens <b>24</b><i>a </i>faces the base portion <b>13</b><i>v </i>of the inner case <b>13</b>.

Hereinafter, the assembly except for the key sheet <b>19</b> is referred to as an internal assembly <b>67</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The internal assembly <b>67</b> is then put in the first recess <b>13</b><i>r </i>from the opening <b>13</b><i>h </i>of the inner case <b>13</b>, thereby accommodating the internal assembly <b>67</b> in the first recess <b>13</b><i>r</i>.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Advantages of the embodiment of the disclosure comprise the following:</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As described above, the mobile phone <b>1</b> comprises the first chassis <b>3</b> comprising the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second chassis <b>5</b> comprising the second external portion <b>53</b> that is positioned in the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The second chassis <b>5</b> is coupled to the first chassis <b>3</b> at the second external portion <b>53</b> while being foldable between the opened state and the closed state. The mobile phone <b>1</b> also comprises the vibrator <b>54</b> that is accommodated in the first chassis <b>3</b> and the electronic components such as the main board <b>23</b>. The first chassis <b>3</b> comprises the inner case <b>13</b>. The inner case <b>13</b> comprises the first recess <b>13</b><i>r </i>accommodating the main board <b>23</b> and the like and the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>accommodating the vibrator <b>54</b>. The coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a </i>has the side facing the second chassis <b>5</b> that is concaved in the closed state. The first recess <b>13</b><i>r </i>is at the position where the first recess <b>13</b><i>r </i>does not overlap with the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the direction facing the second chassis <b>5</b> in the closed state, and the first recess <b>13</b><i>r </i>faces the second chassis <b>5</b> in the closed state. The second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>is at the position where the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>overlaps with the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the direction facing the second chassis <b>5</b> in the closed state, and the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>faces the side opposite the facing direction of the first recess <b>13</b><i>r. </i></p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Accordingly, the space at the rear of the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a </i>can effectively be utilized. Therefore, the first chassis <b>3</b> can be downsized with having the water-proof property, that is, the balance between the formation of the coupling recess and the effective utilization of space can be established in the first chassis <b>3</b> comprising the inner case <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Specifically, in the mobile phone <b>1</b>, the space can be utilized effectively without expanding substantially onto the region at the rear of the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the space can be utilized effectively without using an assemble method wherein the electronic components are inserted at an angle toward the side substantially near the rotating axis RA to place the main board <b>23</b> and the like in the inner case <b>13</b>. That is, the assemble method of first inserting the electronic component with inkling toward the side substantially near the external connector <b>65</b> is adopted to locate the main board <b>23</b> and the like in the inner case <b>13</b>, and the vibrator <b>54</b> can be located in the inner case <b>13</b> through another process. Accordingly, the space is effectively utilized while the ease of the work for accommodating the electronic components is maintained. Additionally, because the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>is located in the inner case <b>13</b> so as not to be an undercut portion in injection molding, the inner case <b>13</b> comprising the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a</i>, the first recess <b>13</b><i>r </i>and second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>is easy to form. Thus, the inner case <b>13</b> is easily molded, and the work for accommodating the electronic components is easily performed in the inner case <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Additionally, because the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a</i>, the first recess <b>13</b><i>r</i>, and the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>are located in the inner case <b>13</b>, the depth of the inner case <b>13</b> can be substantially equal to the thickness of the first chassis <b>3</b>. Therefore the strength and air-tightness of the first chassis <b>3</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Accordingly, the balance between the excellent water-proof property and the compactness can be established in the mobile phone <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The mobile phone <b>1</b> also comprises the key sheet <b>19</b> sealing the first recess <b>13</b><i>r </i>and the external cover <b>57</b> sealing the second recess <b>13</b><i>i</i>. Therefore, the inner case <b>13</b> is sealed to make the chassis have the high sealing property.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The communication hole <b>13</b><i>y </i>is in the inner case <b>13</b> to communicated the first recess <b>13</b><i>r </i>and the second recess <b>13</b><i>i</i>. The main board <b>23</b> and the like and the vibrator <b>54</b> are connected by the connecting the FPC <b>61</b> inserted in the communication hole <b>13</b><i>y</i>. Accordingly, the electronic circuit can be formed in the inner case <b>13</b> while the effective utilization of space is achieved in the inner case <b>13</b> by the two recesses facing different directions.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The first chassis <b>3</b> comprises the exterior chassis <b>10</b> that surrounds the inner case <b>13</b>, and the exterior chassis <b>10</b> comprises the opening <b>10</b><i>h </i>to expose the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the design of the first chassis <b>3</b> is improved by the exterior chassis <b>10</b>, and the inner case <b>13</b> is exposed from the exterior chassis <b>10</b> in the portion covered by the second external portion <b>53</b>, which allows the coupling portion <b>6</b> to be downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The electronic component positioned in the first recess <b>13</b><i>r </i>is the circuit board (i.e., main board <b>23</b>), and the electronic component received in the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>is the vibrator <b>54</b>. Accordingly, the vibrator <b>54</b> can be located in the end portion of the first chassis <b>3</b> to which the vibration is easily transmitted while the relatively large electronic component is accommodated in the relatively wide first recess <b>13</b><i>r</i>, whereby the electronic component is properly disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Other advantages of the embodiment of the disclosure comprise the following:</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As described above, the mobile phone <b>1</b> comprises the inner case <b>13</b> comprising the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>and the vibrator <b>54</b> press-fitted in the second recess <b>13</b><i>i</i>. The vibrator <b>54</b> is latched in the inner case <b>13</b> while pressed in the direction in which the vibrator <b>54</b> is press-fitted in the second recess <b>13</b><i>i</i>. The mobile phone <b>1</b> also comprises the internal cover <b>55</b> obstructing the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>and the external cover <b>57</b> covering the internal cover <b>55</b> and sealing the second recess <b>13</b><i>i. </i></p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Because the vibrator <b>54</b> is received and sealed in the inner case <b>13</b> independently of other electronic components, the vibrator <b>54</b> can be brought into close contact with the inner case <b>13</b> to facilitate transmission of the vibration of the vibrator <b>54</b> to the outside, and an influence of the vibration on other electronic components can be reduced. Additionally, because the vibrator <b>54</b> is pressed by the internal cover <b>55</b> latched in the inner case <b>13</b>, the vibration of the vibrator <b>54</b> can better be transmitted to the inner case <b>13</b>, and the influence of the vibration on a sealing property of the external cover <b>57</b> can be reduced. That is, the improvement of the vibration transmission property and the improvement of the water-proof property are achieved by one member (i.e., internal cover <b>55</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The vibrator <b>54</b> comprises the motor <b>58</b> and the holder <b>60</b> that is of the elastic member interposed between the motor <b>58</b> and the second recess <b>13</b><i>i</i>, so that the vibrator <b>54</b> can securely be brought into close contact with the inner surface of the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>to transmit the vibration to the inner case <b>13</b>. The internal cover <b>55</b> can reduce a loss of the sealing property of the external cover <b>57</b> caused by an elastic force of the holder <b>60</b>. Further, the holder <b>60</b> can be brought into close contact with the inner surface of the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>in the surroundings of the communication hole <b>13</b><i>y </i>to reduce leakage of the water from the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>to the first recess <b>13</b><i>r. </i></p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The inner case <b>13</b> comprises the first engaged portion <b>13</b><i>k</i>. The first engaged portion <b>13</b><i>k </i>is located in the second recess <b>13</b><i>i</i>, and the first engaged portion <b>13</b><i>k </i>is projected in the direction orthogonal to the concave direction of the second recess <b>13</b><i>i</i>. The first engaged portion <b>13</b><i>k </i>comprises a first surface <b>13</b><i>m </i>located on a side substantially near a bottom of the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>(i.e., a back side of the first engaged portion <b>13</b><i>k</i>) and facing the rear side. Because the internal cover <b>55</b> is supported by the first surface <b>13</b><i>m </i>of the first engaged portion <b>13</b><i>k</i>, it is not necessary to make a through-hole in the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>for inserting a member in order to fit the internal cover <b>55</b> to the second recess <b>13</b><i>i</i>. Therefore, the property for sealing the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>is improved, and the vibrator <b>54</b> is pressed in the press-fitting direction while the internal cover <b>55</b> is securely supported by the inner case <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Because the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>is on the end portion of the inner case <b>13</b>, the vibration of the vibrator <b>54</b> is easily transmitted to the outside of the inner case <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The inner case <b>13</b> also comprises the first recess <b>13</b><i>r</i>, and the first recess <b>13</b><i>r </i>is sealed while the electronic components such as the main board <b>23</b> are accommodated therein. The second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>is located outside the first recess <b>13</b><i>r</i>. Accordingly, as described above, the influence of the vibration of the vibrator <b>54</b> on the properties for sealing other electronic components such as the main board <b>23</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As described above, in the mobile phone <b>1</b>, the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>is located at the position where the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>overlaps with the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the direction facing the second chassis <b>5</b> in the closed state. That is, a part of the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>is located at the rear of the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the region that overlaps with the coupling recess <b>3</b><i>a </i>to easily be a dead space in the inner case <b>13</b> can be utilized, and the vibrator <b>54</b> can be disposed in the end portion in which the vibration can easily be transmitted to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The mobile phone <b>1</b> is an example of the portable electronic device, the second external portion <b>53</b> is an example of the coupling projection, the main board <b>23</b> is an example of the first electronic component, and the vibrator <b>54</b> is an example of the second electronic component. The inner case <b>13</b> is an example of the case member, the key sheet <b>19</b> is an example of the first sealing member, the external cover <b>57</b> is an example of the second sealing member, the connecting the FPC <b>61</b> is an example of the signal line, and the exterior chassis <b>10</b> is an example of the exterior case.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The internal cover <b>55</b> is an example of the obstructing member, the external cover <b>57</b> is an example of the sealing member, the holder <b>60</b> is an example of the elastic member, and the first engaged portion <b>13</b><i>k </i>is an example of the engaged portion.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The portable electronic device is not limited to the mobile phone. For example, the portable electronic device may be a notebook computer, PDA, a game machine, and a camera. The second electronic component is not limited to the vibrator. For example, the second electronic component may be a speaker or a camera. That is, the second electronic component may be a component that is suitable to transmit the vibration of the speaker to the outside instead of the vibrator.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">It is not necessary to seal the second recess. The chassis of the portable electronic device may be a two-shaft hinge type chassis including a folding operation as long as the chassis is foldable. By the second sealing member (in the first embodiment, the external cover <b>57</b>) that seals the second recess in which the vibrator is accommodated, other recesses and holes may be sealed.</p>

The first chassis <b>3</b> comprises an external cover <b>157</b> comprising a transparent portion <b>157</b><i>a </i>and a double-sided tape <b>156</b>. The external cover <b>157</b> has the dimensions with which not only the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>but the hole <b>13</b><i>g </i>that exposes the lens <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the camera unit <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) are covered. The transparent portion <b>157</b><i>a </i>is located in the portion facing the hole <b>13</b><i>g </i>of the external cover <b>157</b>. The double-sided tape <b>156</b> has the dimensions with which not only the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>but the hole <b>13</b><i>g </i>are surrounded. A peripheral portion of the external cover <b>157</b> is bonded to the surrounding of a region covering both of the opening of the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>and the hole <b>13</b><i>g </i>by the double-sided tape <b>156</b>. Accordingly, the external cover <b>157</b> seals not only the second recess <b>13</b><i>i </i>but the hole <b>13</b><i>g. </i></p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As described above, the influence of the vibrator <b>54</b> on the sealing property of the external cover <b>157</b> is reduced by the internal cover <b>55</b>, so that the external cover <b>157</b> can also be used to seal the hole <b>13</b><i>g</i>.
