<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent disclosure relates generally to split torque variable transmissions, and, more particularly, to a control arrangement for and a method of controlling a transmission in a machine including a split torque continuously variable transmission.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Split torque continuously variable transmissions (CVT), such as multi-range hydromechanical transmissions, are frequently utilized in mobile machines. Hydromechanical transmissions, for example, may include a hydraulic pump and motor in the form of a variator U.S. Pat. No. 7,530,913 to Fabry, et al., which is assigned to the assignee of this disclosure, discloses a multirange hydromechanical transmission that includes a hydraulic pump coupled to a hydraulic motor. Torque from the engine is transmitted to the pump and a parallel mechanical shaft to a planetary gearing arrangement and a plurality of gears, clutch assemblies, and synchronizers. When the transmission is engaged, such arrangements may be configured such that the variator is flowing when the machine is stationary, i.e., at zero ground speed. Maintaining the transmission in this configuration, then results in wasted fuel when the machine is idle. Depending on the configuration of the variator, these losses can be on the order of 20% of the idle fuel burn. This fuel consumption becomes particularly significant when the machine spends a considerable portion of its use at idle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosed method and control system are directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disclosure describes, in one aspect, a method for use in a machine comprising a transmission having an operational mode, and including first and second power source paths, and a combined power output. The first power source path includes a variator. The method of controlling the transmission comprises the steps of: operating the first power source path; providing a signal indicative of the operational mode of the transmission to a controller; and at least partially neutralizing the variator if the signal indicates that the transmission is in neutral for at least a preset period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure further describes, in another aspect, a control system in a variable transmission of a machine. The transmission has an operational mode, and includes first and second power source paths, and a combined power output. The first power source path includes a variator. The control system comprises a selectively adjustable operational mode selector adapted to supply a signal indicative of a selected operational mode, a timer adapted to provide signal indicative of time lapse, and an actuator adapted to control an operative state of at least a portion of the first power source path. The control system further comprises a controller in electrical communication with the actuator. The controller is adapted to receive the signal indicative of the selected operational mode. The controller is further configured to supply a signal to the actuator to at least partially neutralize at least a portion of the variator if the signal indicative of the selected operational mode indicates that the transmission is in neutral for at least a preset period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure also describes, in yet another aspect, a machine comprising a transmission and a controller. The transmission has an operational mode, and includes first and second power source paths, and a combined output from the first and second power source paths. The first power source path includes a pump and a motor (variator). The transmission further includes a selectively adjustable operational mode selector adapted to supply a signal indicative of the selected operational mode, a timer adapted to provide signal indicative of time lapse, and an actuator adapted to control an operative state of at least a portion of the first power source path. The controller is in electrical communication with the actuator and is adapted to receive the signal indicative of the selected operational mode. The controller is further configured to supply a signal to the actuator to at least partially neutralize at least a portion of the variator if the signal indicative of the selected operational mode indicates that the transmission is in neutral for at least a preset period of time.</p>

For example, the continuously variable transmission <b>20</b> may be a hydromechanical transmission <b>26</b> including a hydrostatic transmission <b>30</b> and a mechanical transmission <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">While this disclosure explains a hydromechanical transmission <b>26</b> in detail, any appropriate alternate arrangement may be utilized. By way of example and not limitation, the hydrostatic transmission <b>30</b> may be embodied as an alternate power source path, such as, for example, an electric motor driving an electro-mechanical transmission (not shown), an electric battery and a motor (not shown), a hydraulic accumulator and a motor (not shown), an electric generator and electric motor (not shown), or other device capable of providing input power, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An engine <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) drives the hydromechanical transmission <b>26</b>. The engine <b>34</b> may be, for example, an internal combustion engine, although the engine <b>34</b> may be any kind of device capable of powering the continuously variable transmission <b>20</b> as described herein. The engine <b>34</b> outputs to both the hydrostatic transmission <b>30</b> and the mechanical transmission <b>32</b> through an input member <b>36</b>. The input member <b>36</b> provides split power to the hydrostatic transmission <b>30</b> and a planetary arrangement <b>44</b> of the mechanical transmission <b>32</b> through first and second fixed input gears <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, respectively (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The hydrostatic transmission <b>30</b> and planetary arrangement <b>44</b> then provides outputs to the mechanical transmission <b>32</b> through a planetary output shaft assembly <b>82</b>. The planetary arrangement <b>44</b> includes first and second axially aligned planetary gear sets <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, each first or second axially aligned planetary gear set <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> including a sun gear <b>78</b>, a carrier <b>56</b>, and a ring gear <b>80</b>, as is customary.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; may be understood as being integral with, permanently attached, pinned, interconnected through a splined connection, or fused by welding, for example, or by any other means known to those having ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The hydrostatic transmission <b>30</b> includes a variator <b>28</b> that includes a variable displacement pump <b>46</b> and a motor <b>48</b>, which is in fluid communication with the pump <b>46</b>. Displacement of the pump <b>46</b> may be controlled by a swash plate <b>47</b>, as is known in the art, or by an alternate arrangement (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The angle of the swash plate <b>47</b> may be controlled by an actuator <b>49</b>, which may be of any appropriate design.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The variable displacement pump <b>46</b> is connected to the engine <b>34</b>, through a hydrostatic transmission input gear <b>50</b> engaged with the first fixed input gear <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The motor <b>48</b> may be variable displacement or fixed displacement, as illustrated. The motor <b>48</b> outputs through a hydrostatic transmission output gear <b>54</b> to a second planetary input member <b>52</b> to the planetary arrangement <b>44</b>. Thus, the pump <b>46</b> of the hydrostatic transmission <b>30</b> uses the split input power from the engine <b>34</b> to fluidly drive the motor <b>48</b> to convert the input power from the engine <b>34</b> to hydrostatic output power over a continuously variable speed ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The hydromechanical transmission <b>26</b> includes a second fixed input gear <b>42</b> coupled to the input member <b>36</b>, the second fixed input gear <b>42</b> providing input to the planetary arrangement <b>44</b> by way of a carrier <b>56</b>. The planetary arrangement <b>44</b> combines the hydrostatic output power from the first power source path <b>22</b> to second planetary input member <b>52</b> with the split input mechanical power from second power source path <b>24</b> by way of the second fixed input gear <b>42</b> to provide hydromechanical output power to mechanical transmission <b>32</b> through the planetary output shaft assembly <b>82</b>. The illustrated planetary output shaft assembly <b>82</b> includes an internal shaft <b>84</b> and an aligned sleeve <b>86</b>, such as a hollow member or hub, supported by the internal shaft <b>84</b>. The output to the internal shaft <b>84</b> and sleeve <b>86</b> is dependent upon the arrangement and connections of the components of the first and second axially aligned planetary gear sets <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the sleeve <b>86</b> outputs through a first planetary output gear <b>90</b>. The internal shaft <b>84</b> outputs through a second planetary output gear <b>92</b> and through an auxiliary drive gear <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The speed and torque in each of the ranges initially set by gear ratios of the planetary arrangement <b>44</b> and mechanical transmission <b>32</b> can be continuously varied within a given operational mode by varying the output speed of the hydrostatic transmission <b>30</b>. Thus, the mechanical transmission <b>32</b> allows multiple selectable operational modes that allow a wide range of speed and torque operation, while the continuously variable ability of hydromechanical transmission <b>26</b> through output from hydrostatic transmission <b>30</b> through the planetary arrangement <b>44</b> allows continuously variable speed and torque control within a given operational mode. This allows for application of hydromechanical output power through a continuously variable speed and torque range to a load, such as, for example, one or more driving wheels of a vehicle, or tracks of an earth-working machine. The speed and torque in each of the power source paths <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> ranges initially set by gear ratios of the planetary arrangement <b>44</b> can be infinitely varied by varying the stroke of the hydrostatic transmission <b>30</b>. In other words, the planetary arrangement <b>44</b> provides output to a final output member <b>58</b> by way of a plurality of gears, synchronizing assemblies or synchronizers <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, clutch assemblies <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, and first and second output members <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The output from the planetary output shaft assembly <b>82</b> is transmitted by way of a plurality of rotatably mounted gears <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>128</b>, synchronizers <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, hubs <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and clutch assemblies <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> to one or the other of the first and second output members <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, and on to the final output member <b>58</b>. The first and second output members <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> are in the form of rotatably mounted shafts to which first and second output shaft gears <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> are fixedly mounted, respectively. The first and second output shaft gears <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> are mounted to mesh with a final drive gear <b>100</b>, which, in turn, is fixedly mounted to the final output member <b>58</b>. In this way, rotation from the first and second output members <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> is imparted to the final output member <b>58</b> by way of first and second output shaft gears <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, respectively, and the final drive gear <b>100</b>. In other words, the planetary arrangement <b>44</b> provides a choice of planetary outputs to the mechanical transmission <b>32</b> including the final output member <b>58</b> by way of a plurality of gears <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>128</b>, synchronizers <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, aligned sleeves or hubs <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, first and second clutch assemblies <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, and first and second output members <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In operating the transmission <b>20</b>, the operator (not shown) may select the desired gear by way of a selectively adjustable operational mode selector <b>95</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In various embodiments, the operator may chose from operational modes such as Park, Neutral, Low Forward, High Forward, Low Reverse, High Reverse, and Auxiliary Forward.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in operation, a signal is provided to a controller <b>200</b> indicating the selected operational mode, which corresponds to a particular gear configuration. The signal may be, for example, from the operational mode selector <b>95</b> or from an alternate sensor, as will be understood by those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The transmission <b>20</b> may optionally include further input to the controller <b>200</b>. For example, one or more temperature sensors <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> or the like may provide signals to the controller <b>200</b> indicative of the temperature of the variator <b>28</b>. For example, such a temperature sensor <b>204</b> may be provided to measure the temperature of the pump <b>46</b>, or the motor <b>48</b>, as illustrated, or any other location that would provide an indication of the temperature of the variator <b>28</b>. Alternately, temperature sensors <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> may be disposed to measure the temperature of the oil flowing into or out of the motor <b>48</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The controller <b>200</b> is in electrical communication with the actuator <b>49</b>, and is configured to supply a signal to the actuator <b>49</b>. In this way, the controller <b>200</b> is configured to supply a signal to the actuator <b>49</b> that is indicative of the desired displacement of the pump <b>46</b>, and, therefore, the angle of the swash plate <b>47</b>. The displacement of the pump <b>46</b>, in turn, controls the output of the motor <b>48</b>. The controller <b>200</b> may also include an internal timer, or an external timer <b>202</b> may be further provided.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The controller <b>200</b> may include a processor (not shown) and a memory component (not shown). The processor may be microprocessors or other processors as known in the art. In some embodiments, the processor may be made up of multiple processors. The processor may execute instructions for control of the first power source path <b>22</b>, in this embodiment, by way of the actuator <b>49</b>. Such instructions may be read into or incorporated into a computer readable medium, such as the memory component or provided external to processor. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the method disclosed herein. Thus, embodiments are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The term &#x201c;computer-readable medium&#x201d; as used herein refers to any medium or combination of media that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks. Volatile media includes dynamic memory. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, and can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer or processor can read.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The memory component may include any form of computer-readable media as described above. The memory component may include multiple memory components.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The controller <b>200</b> may be enclosed in a single housing, or it may include a plurality of components operably connected and enclosed in a plurality of housings. The controller <b>200</b> may be located on-board an engine, machine, or vehicle. In still other embodiments the controller <b>200</b> may be located in a plurality of operably connected locations including on-board an engine, on-board a machine or vehicle, and remotely.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the disclosed method (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and control system, a signal indicative of the condition of the selected operational mode is provided to the controller <b>200</b> by way of the operational mode selector <b>95</b> or an alternate sensor. In the illustrated embodiment, the operational mode selector <b>95</b> provides a signal indicating the selected operational mode to the controller <b>200</b>. The controller <b>200</b> then determines whether the selected operational mode is &#x201c;Neutral.&#x201d; If the selected operational mode is not &#x201c;Neutral,&#x201d; no modification is made to the variator <b>28</b> along the first power source path <b>22</b> based upon the disclosed method. Alternatively, if the selected operational mode is &#x201c;Neutral,&#x201d; then the controller <b>200</b> determines if the selected operational mode has been &#x201c;Neutral&#x201d; for at least a preselected period of time. If the selected operational mode has been &#x201c;Neutral&#x201d; for at least the preset period of time, then the controller <b>200</b> sends a signal to neutralize the variator <b>28</b>. In the disclosed embodiment, the controller <b>200</b> sends a signal to the actuator <b>49</b> to adjust the swash plate <b>47</b> to minimize the displacement of the pump <b>46</b>, thus minimizing the motion of the motor <b>48</b>. Thus, the controller <b>200</b> is adapted to receive a signal indicative of the selected operational mode, and configured to supply a signal to the actuator <b>49</b> to at least partially neutralize at least a portion of the variator <b>28</b> if the signal indicative of the selected operational mode indicates that the selected operational mode is &#x201c;Neutral&#x201d; for at least a preset period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The preset period of time may be any appropriate period of time adequate to indicate that the operational mode selector <b>95</b> would be placed immediately into an alternate operational mode. For example, the preset period of time may be on the order ten seconds, although the preset period of time may be greater or lesser than ten seconds. For example, the preset period may be on the order of five, six, seven, eight, nine, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, or fifteen or more seconds. The preset period may be a greater or lesser time period, however.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to another feature of the disclosure, the method may be dependent upon additional input, that is, other conditions may be identified that must be met before the variator <b>28</b> is neutralized. For example, operation of the variator <b>28</b> while in the &#x201c;Neutral&#x201d; mode may assist in warming oil in the system. Thus, in an embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the variator <b>28</b> is only neutralized under the disclosed method once the variator <b>28</b> is warmed up or has reached a preset temperature. In this way, the absolute temperature of the variator <b>28</b> as measured by the sensor <b>204</b> may be utilized. Alternately, the temperature of oil flowing from the variator <b>28</b> as measured by the sensor <b>208</b> may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">By way of another example, alternate criterion may be utilized for neutralization of the variator <b>28</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, once the operational mode selected is &#x201c;Neutral,&#x201d; changes in temperature may be utilized in determining whether it is appropriate to neutralize the variator <b>28</b>. That is, if the temperature of the variator <b>28</b> has dropped to a predetermined level, as measured, for example by the sensor <b>204</b>, or the temperature difference across the variator <b>28</b>, as measured by the sensors <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, for example, has dropped to a predetermined value, the variator <b>28</b> may be neutralized. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the neutralization of the variator <b>28</b> may additionally be dependent upon the sufficient warming of the variator <b>28</b>. Additionally, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the method need not necessary include logic based upon time lapse.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present disclosure is applicable to transmissions <b>20</b> utilizing first and second power source paths <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. For example, the disclosure is applicable to hydromechanical transmissions, and transmissions utilizing a hydrostatic transmission <b>30</b> or alternate arrangement, such as, for example, an electric motor proving an electro-mechanical transmission (not shown), an electric battery and a motor (not shown), a hydraulic accumulator and a motor (not shown), an electric generator and electric motor (not shown), or other device capable of providing input power.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Transmissions <b>20</b> incorporating dual power source paths <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may spend a considerable amount of operating time in neutral. Maintaining maximum flow from the variator <b>28</b>, however, may result in significant fuel consumption. The disclosed method and/or control arrangement may result in fuel savings without objectionable delay when the transmission <b>26</b> is placed into a forward or reverse operational mode from neutral.</p>
