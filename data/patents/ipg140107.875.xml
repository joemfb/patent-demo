<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods and systems for reducing combustion emissions generated in, or released from, a combustion chamber are provided. Systems and methods provided herein may be used to modify, for example, an existing fireplace such that combustion emissions resulting from burning a fuel combustion source are reduced. The method involves providing an emission reduction system which includes a casing assembly with at least one panel of a catalyst-coated media and a support structure supporting the casing assembly. The casing assembly is positioned between a fuel combustion source and a flue by associating the support structure with an interior surface of the firebox. The fuel combustion source is burned to create a fire, such that the catalyst-coated media reduces emissions associated with fuel combustion when contacted with combustion exhaust.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fireplaces, particularly wood burning fireplaces, have been a staple of society for centuries, and are a nearly universally popular means for providing warmth to buildings, such as homes, hotels, and restaurants. A recent U.S. Census survey showed that more than 64,000,000 fireplaces have been installed in homes nationwide. A fireplace is the third most popular option for a new house, outranked only by central heating/air conditioning and a two-car garage. The National Association of Realtors says the addition of a fireplace is one of the best returns on investment a homeowner can make. Fireplaces are also increasingly becoming popular for use in outdoor settings like patios, decks, and balconies.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fireplaces, however, are also known to be relatively inefficient at heating. Common fireplaces at best are only 15%-20% efficient at generating heat. In fact, during some stages of a fire's life, more energy, like the heat in warm air, is taken from the area surrounding the fireplace than is released by the fire itself. Furthermore, cold air from outdoors can enter indoor rooms via the fireplace, making these rooms even colder. With such inefficient heating, users of fireplaces often must stay huddled close to the fire and/or use additional sources of heat to keep warm.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to being inefficient, fireplaces can cause, for example, harmful pollutants including particulates, volatile organic compounds (&#x201c;VOCs&#x201d;), and carbon monoxide to be emitted into the atmosphere. These emissions have been linked to adverse health effects, such as lung cancer, and environmental problems like smog and acid rain. Recognizing the environmental problems burning wood can exasperate, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&#x201c;EPA&#x201d;) has placed strict limits on the emissions permitted by wood burning stoves. The limits are currently 7.5 grams of smoke per hour (g/h) for non-catalytic stoves, and 4.1 g/h for catalytic stoves. The EPA is currently instituting new regulations regarding the use of wood burning fireplaces in the U.S. These regulations (e.g., ASTM E06.54) generally limit a fireplace to the release of about 5.1 g of particulates per kg of material burned. To date, no known solutions have been proposed for traditional fireplaces to meet these regulations. Accordingly, devices and methods for reducing combustion emissions generated in, or released from, a combustion chamber are needed.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The following description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the invention. The scope of the invention should be determined with reference to the claims. The present embodiments address the problems described in the background while also addressing other additional problems as will be seen from the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, depicted is a fireplace <b>100</b> from a side and front view according to an embodiment of the invention. The fireplace <b>100</b> is any architectural element comprising a combustion chamber designed to contain a fire. The fireplace <b>100</b> can be, for example, a traditional brick or stone masonry fireplace, a metal prefabricated fireplace, a wood burning stove, or a gas fireplace. In other embodiments, the fireplace <b>100</b> is an item designed for industrial use, such as an industrial furnace. The fireplace <b>100</b> can be pre-fabricated or built in place. The fireplace <b>100</b> comprises a firebox <b>102</b> in communication with a flue <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The firebox <b>102</b> is a region of the fireplace <b>100</b> where a fuel combustion source <b>106</b> is positioned and ignited to create a fire. The firebox <b>102</b> can be made from masonry, concrete, brick, stone, iron, ceramic, or any other material(s) suitable for withstanding the high temperatures associated fires, which can reach 1800&#xb0; F. in typical household applications. Much higher temperatures can be encountered in industrial applications, and temperatures up to 4000&#xb0; F. or more are possible. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the specific material(s) used for the firebox <b>102</b> will be dictated by the intended use of the fireplace <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the firebox <b>102</b> further comprises a hearth <b>108</b> that defines a bottom portion of the firebox <b>102</b>. The hearth <b>108</b>, in some embodiments of the invention, is made from any of the materials suitable for creating the firebox <b>102</b>, and can also comprise other materials, such as decorative materials like marble, granite, or slate.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fuel combustion source <b>106</b> is any substance suitable for controlled combustion, such as organic matter and natural gases. Example materials comprising organic matter include wood, manufactured wax or sawdust firelogs, paper, and charcoal. Possible natural gases include, for example, methane, propane, and ethane. In some embodiments, the fuel combustion source <b>106</b> is positioned directly on top of the hearth <b>108</b> to be burned, while in other embodiments the fuel combustion source <b>106</b> is placed in a grate <b>110</b>, which facilitates airflow around the fuel combustion source <b>106</b> necessary for combustion. Where the fuel combustion source <b>106</b> comprises natural gas, using methods well known to those skilled in the art, a finite amount of gas is continuously released into the firebox <b>102</b> for immediate combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to one embodiment methods for reducing fuel combustion emissions from a fuel combustion source associated with a firebox are provided. The methods include providing an emission reduction system and inserting the system in to a firebox. In some embodiments the system includes a casing assembly comprising at least one panel of a catalyst-coated media. In general the media reduces emissions associated with fuel combustion when contacted with the combustion exhaust. The system further includes a support structure supporting the casing assembly. In general the support structure positions the casing assembly between a fuel combustion source and a flue. The support structure may be detachably associated with the interior of the firebox.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> an emission reduction system includes a casing assembly (see element <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) comprising at least one panel of a catalyst-coated media <b>112</b>. In general the media reduces emissions associated with fuel combustion when contacted with the combustion exhaust. A system further includes a support structure <b>114</b> supporting the casing assembly (see element <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In general the support structure positions the casing assembly between a fuel combustion source and a flue. The support structure may be detachably associated with the interior of the firebox. For example, in some embodiments the methods provided herein utilize a system that includes a support structure having a suspension element joined to the casing assembly. The suspension element includes fasteners for detachably-fastening the casing assembly to at least one wall of the firebox or the top of the firebox, or at least one wall and top of the firebox. In other embodiments the support structure includes at least one substantially vertical element having a first end in contact with the hearth of the firebox and a second end joined to the casing assembly. The support structure may be positioned substantially at the back of the interior of the firebox.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In other embodiments, a system provided herein includes a support structure having a plurality of substantially vertical elements positioned substantially at the back of the interior of the firebox, substantially at the sides of the interior of the firebox, or any combination thereof. In other embodiments the support structure further includes at least one substantially horizontal element joined to the second end, wherein the substantially horizontal element further supports the casing assembly. In some embodiments the support structure further includes support structure adjusting elements suitable for adjusting the position of the casing assembly in relation to the combustion source.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the media <b>112</b>, in some embodiments, is made from ceramic, metal, or a similar material. The size and shape of the media <b>112</b> is dictated by its use. For instance, when used in a fireplace <b>100</b>, the size and shape of the firebox <b>102</b> the media <b>112</b> is placed in will generally constrain the size and shape of the media <b>112</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the media <b>112</b> may be divided into two pieces to permit the operation of a damper (not shown) by extending a damper handle (not shown) through the middle of the media <b>112</b> and a casing assembly <b>202</b>, discussed in more detail below. The casing assembly <b>202</b> supporting the media <b>112</b> and the media <b>112</b> are sized to fit within a firebox (not shown) and sized to cover most if not all of the flue (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to another embodiment the media <b>112</b> is coated with a catalyst. In some embodiments the catalyst includes a transition metal, such as platinum, palladium, or rhodium, or combinations thereof. In other embodiments, the catalyst comprises any other material that promotes efficient and rapid oxidation of carbon and hydrocarbons, such as ceria or titanium dioxide. Additional catalysts can also be used, such as mixtures of catalysts, or low temperature catalysts and non-ionizing radiation activated catalysts for use during low temperature periods, for instance when the temperature of the catalyst is below 350&#xb0; F. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the specific catalyst(s) to be used will depend on the content of the exhaust to be cleaned, to be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, a casing assembly includes at least one panel of media <b>112</b> comprises an open-celled or reticulated structure. In other embodiments a casing assembly can include a plurality of panels. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts two panels of media <b>112</b> associated with a casing assembly <b>202</b>. It is understood that a casing assembly can include any number of panels in any configuration suitable for use in a method for reducing fuel combustion emissions associated with a firebox as described herein. As is well known to those skilled in the art, a reticulated structure is a three-dimensional latticework of interconnected ligaments that form a porous, open structure. A reticulated structure has a high internal surface area per structure volume, and appears somewhat like a sponge. Unlike a reticulated structure, open-celled structures (&#x201c;foams&#x201d;) comprise a plurality of open and closed cells, but can be engineered to exhibit properties similar to reticulated structures. In some embodiments, the catalyst of the media <b>112</b> coats all the internal surfaces of the media <b>112</b>. In some embodiments the casing assembly is positioned to be substantially non-parallel and substantially non-perpendicular to the flow of the combustion exhaust. In some embodiments the casing assembly is positioned substantially over the fuel combustion source to facilitate the transfer of infrared energy released by the fuel combustion out of the firebox. In general the methods provided herein reduce emissions by reducing particulates, VOCs, or carbon monoxide in the exhaust, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, pore dimensions of the media <b>112</b>, in some embodiments, are kept at a relatively constant size throughout the media <b>112</b>. The pore dimension of the media <b>112</b> can vary from approximately 0.02 to 0.33 inches, depending on the specific application. More specifically, the pore dimension selected for a specific media <b>112</b> depends on the material used to create the media <b>112</b>, and is selected to provide a low back pressure to fluid flow within the firebox <b>102</b> while also providing for the turbulent flow needed to obtain adequate contact between the catalytic surfaces of the media <b>112</b> and the fluid, in this case the exhaust gases of the fire in the fireplace <b>100</b>. Maintaining a low back pressure to fluid flow is necessary to ensure exhaust gases flow through the media <b>112</b> to the flue <b>104</b> rather than through the front of the firebox <b>102</b>. If the back pressure of the media <b>112</b>, caused by an accumulation of particles in the media <b>112</b> and/or the pore density of the media <b>112</b>, drops the differential draft pressure in the firebox <b>102</b> below that of the flue <b>104</b>, then the exhaust will flow out the front of the firebox <b>102</b> rather than through the flue <b>104</b>. Since, in some embodiments, most if not all particulates in the fire exhaust are either immediately combusted by or pass through the media <b>112</b>, pressure drops versus pores per linear inch for various air velocities for typical reticulated structures are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and can significantly aid in the selection of a media <b>112</b> for a specific application.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As discussed above, the pores in the media <b>112</b> also provide turbulent flow within the media <b>112</b>. Turbulent flow refers to the tumbling and mixing of air. This tumbling ensures the contents of the fire exhaust continuously encounter the catalyst coating on the media <b>112</b> and the internal surfaces thereof. Turbulent flow therefore provides much higher contact between any pollutants in the exhaust and the catalyst, resulting in better heating efficiency and fewer pollutants released into the atmosphere, to be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the media <b>112</b> is positioned in the firebox <b>102</b> such that hot exhaust gases resulting from burning the fuel combustion source <b>106</b> will flow through the media <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the media <b>112</b> is positioned in the firebox <b>102</b> to cause little to no effect on the fireplace <b>100</b> draft, even during startup when there is low fluid flow due to the low temperature of the fire. This is due to the combination of the extremely low resistance to airflow through the media <b>112</b>, as discussed above, and the ability of an exhaust draft to simply flow around the media <b>112</b> and its supporting means, discussed in more detail below, during startup and other periods of low exhaust flow. Such fluid flow is accomplished, in some embodiments, because the means for supporting the media <b>112</b> are designed to position the media <b>112</b> in a manner such that it does not completely block the airflow path from the location of the fuel combustion source <b>106</b> to the flue <b>104</b>. Thus, during high flow periods, the inertia of the exhaust will cause it to primarily flow through the media <b>112</b> due to its placement directly in the path of the flow. During low flow periods, however, the low inertia of the exhaust permits it to partially flow around the media <b>112</b> and directly into the flue <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Substances in the exhaust gases flowing through the media <b>112</b> can include, for example, carbon particulates, volatile organic compounds (&#x201c;VOCs&#x201d;), and carbon monoxide. When these substances come in contact with the catalyst on the media <b>112</b>, carbon monoxide is oxidized to carbon dioxide and carbon and hydrocarbons are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. These chemical reactions reduce the particulate emissions of the fireplace <b>100</b> to a level below the new United States Environmental Protection Agency (&#x201c;EPA&#x201d;) regulations for wood burning fireplaces. In addition, these chemical reactions are exothermic and release heat energy. For example, in one embodiment, where the media <b>112</b> has a sufficient source of fuel <b>106</b>, the media <b>112</b> increases in temperature up to or above 1200&#xb0; F. In some embodiments, this released energy is transferred out from the fireplace <b>100</b> into the room in which the fireplace is located, increasing the efficiency of the fireplace <b>100</b>. More detailed methods regarding how this heat is transferred are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the media <b>112</b>, regardless of its pore dimension or catalyst coating, operates on any sized particulates. For example, the media <b>112</b> catalyzes and prevents the emissions of particulates that are smaller than 2.5 microns, which are produced by fireplaces and woodstoves, as well as in industrial applications.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments of the invention, the media <b>112</b> removes between 50% and 90% of the pollutants it is exposed to, depending on the type of catalyst and the type of pollutants the media <b>112</b> is exposed to. In some embodiments, the catalytic efficiency of the media <b>112</b> varies depending on its temperature. For example, in one embodiment, the media <b>112</b> does not generally operate below 350&#xb0; F., operates at a high efficiency, removing between 50% and 70% of the pollutants, between 700&#xb0; F. and 800&#xb0; F., and operates optimally, removing 80% to 90% or more of the pollutants, between 1200&#xb0; F. and 1400&#xb0; F. In some embodiments, the efficiency of the media <b>112</b> increases exponentially as the exhaust temperature of the fireplace <b>100</b> increases. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, depicted is a graph showing typical fireplace test temperatures throughout a 4.25 hour run. The fireplace has an average temperature of about 650&#xb0; F. and a maximum temperature of about 1300&#xb0; F. The efficiency of the media <b>112</b> will increase greatly as the fireplace is maintained at temperatures above 400&#xb0; F. In the test run shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> particulate emissions were 1.8 g per kg of fuel burned.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, because the exhaust produced in many applications is initially at ambient temperature and decreases in temperature as the fuel combustion source <b>106</b> is depleted, the media <b>112</b> may not operate efficiently, or at all. For this reason, in some embodiments of the invention, a heating element is added to the media <b>112</b> in order to bring it up to efficient operating temperatures, such as 350&#xb0; F. to 400&#xb0; F. The heating element can consist of a variety of designs and be powered by a variety of different energy sources. For example, in some embodiments, the heating element comprises an electrical coil or wires embedded within the media <b>112</b>. In other embodiments, because the media <b>112</b> has a high resistance, the media <b>112</b> is directly coupled to an electrical source to cause the media <b>112</b> itself to heat. In some embodiments, the heating element is activated by flipping a switch. In other embodiments, a thermometer measures the temperature of the media <b>112</b> and automatically activates the heating element if the temperature of the media <b>112</b> falls below a set threshold, such as 400&#xb0; F.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as discussed above, the media <b>112</b> is positioned in the firebox <b>102</b> such that hot exhaust gases resulting from burning the fuel combustion source <b>106</b> will flow through the media <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, a support structure <b>114</b> is used to position and support the media <b>112</b> inside the firebox <b>102</b>. The support structure <b>114</b> can be made of carbon steel, iron, stainless steel, ceramic material, or any other material or alloy capable of supporting the media <b>112</b> and withstanding the temperatures of the application. In the case of residential use, the support structure <b>114</b> should be capable of withstanding temperatures in excess of 1300&#xb0; F., while industrial applications can be much higher. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the specific material(s) used for the support structure <b>114</b> will be dictated by the intended use of the fireplace <b>100</b>. In residential applications, however, carbon steel and iron are particularly suited for forming the support structure <b>114</b> due to their low cost and durability.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The implementation of the support structure <b>114</b> can vary greatly, and the following descriptions should serve only as possible examples of the support structure <b>114</b> according to embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the support structure <b>114</b> comprises two vertical members <b>502</b> and <b>504</b> attached to a bottom portion of the media <b>112</b> that are in contact with the hearth <b>108</b>. The support structure <b>114</b> further comprises two horizontal members <b>506</b> and <b>508</b> that are attached to the media <b>112</b> and that extend from a back wall of the firebox <b>102</b> to a front of the firebox <b>102</b>. Collectively, these members <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, and <b>508</b> maintain the media <b>112</b> in a position above the hearth <b>108</b>, and restrict substantial movement of the media <b>112</b> in any direction.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the support structure <b>114</b> comprises two horizontal members <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> that extend from a first side wall of the firebox <b>102</b> to a second firewall of the firebox <b>102</b>. These members are attached to two cantilevered arms <b>606</b> and <b>608</b>. The cantilevered arms <b>606</b> and <b>608</b> in turn support the media <b>112</b> in a position above the hearth <b>108</b> and restrict substantial movement of the media <b>112</b> in any direction.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the support structure <b>114</b> comprises two horizontal members <b>702</b> and <b>704</b> attached to the media <b>112</b> that extend from a first side wall of the firebox <b>102</b> to a second firewall of the firebox <b>102</b>. The horizontal members <b>702</b> and <b>704</b> alone support the media <b>112</b> in a position above the hearth <b>108</b> and restrict substantial movement of the media <b>112</b> in any direction.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the support structure <b>114</b> comprises four vertical members <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, <b>806</b>, and <b>808</b> (not visible) attached to the media <b>112</b> that extend vertically from the hearth <b>108</b> and support the media <b>112</b> in a position above the hearth <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the support structure <b>114</b> comprises a horizontal member <b>902</b> attached to the media <b>112</b> extending horizontally from a first sidewall of the firebox <b>102</b> to a second sidewall of the firebox <b>102</b>. The support structure <b>114</b> further comprises two horizontal members <b>904</b> and <b>906</b> that are attached to the media <b>112</b> and that extend from a back wall of the firebox <b>102</b> to a front of the firebox <b>102</b>. Collectively, these members <b>902</b>, <b>904</b>, and <b>906</b> maintain the media <b>112</b> in a position above the hearth <b>108</b>, and restrict substantial movement of the media <b>112</b> in any direction.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments of the invention, the support structure <b>114</b> comprises metal wires, chains, or like items. These metal wires or chains, either mounted to the firebox <b>102</b> at the time of production, or secured to the firebox <b>102</b> using known methods, provide heat resistant anchor points on which the media <b>112</b> can be supported. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, there are numerous ways to utilize wires, chains, or like items to maintain the position of the media <b>112</b> in the firebox <b>102</b> above the fuel combustion source <b>106</b>. For instance, in one embodiment, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the support structure <b>114</b> comprises four metal wires <b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b>, and <b>1108</b> (not visible). These metal wires <b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>, <b>1006</b>, and <b>1008</b> are mounted to the top of the firebox <b>102</b> and are predetermined lengths. The media <b>112</b> is mounted to these wires <b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b>, <b>1108</b> (not visible) and is therefore suspended from a top of the firebox <b>102</b> and maintained in a position above the hearth <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In another embodiment, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the support structure <b>114</b> comprises two metal wires <b>1202</b> and <b>1204</b>. These metal wires <b>1202</b> and <b>1204</b> are strung from one side of the firebox <b>102</b> to the other side and maintained at tension. The media <b>112</b> is mounted to these wires <b>1202</b> and <b>1204</b> and is maintained in a position above the hearth <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the support structure <b>114</b> is freestanding. In other embodiments, the support structure is mounted or otherwise attached to the firebox <b>102</b>. In these embodiments, the support structure <b>114</b> is attached to the firebox <b>102</b> using a variety of methods, such as utilizing mounting brackets in the firebox <b>102</b>, attaching the support structure <b>114</b> to hard points in the firebox <b>102</b>, or using heat resistant adhesive to adhere the support structure <b>114</b> to the firebox <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the support structure <b>114</b> is &#x201c;built in&#x201d; to the firebox <b>102</b> such that the support structure <b>114</b> is not removable or otherwise separate from the firebox <b>102</b>. One skilled in the art will appreciate that such mounting permits the support structure <b>114</b> to be implemented in numerous variations, such as being built into or otherwise attached to a top of the firebox <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the support structure <b>114</b> is specifically designed to fit within a particular firebox <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, the support structure <b>114</b> is adjustable so that it can be adapted to fit a variety of different shaped fireplaces. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in one embodiment, the support structure <b>114</b> comprises one or more threaded rods <b>1000</b>, well known to those or ordinary skill in the art, that can be adjusted as necessary by being twisted. Each threaded rod <b>1000</b> comprises a receptacle <b>1002</b> with internal threads and a leg <b>1004</b> with complementary external threads. When the threaded rod <b>1000</b> is twisted, the leg <b>1004</b> screws or unscrews into the receptacle <b>1002</b>, thereby permitting the length of the rod <b>1000</b> to vary. By varying the length of the threaded rods <b>1000</b>, a high degree of friction can be exerted on the surrounding firebox <b>102</b>, thereby permitting the support structure <b>114</b> to be secured to the firebox <b>102</b> without any fixed attachments.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another embodiment, the support structure <b>114</b> comprises one or more spring loaded rods (not shown), similar to a spring loaded shower curtain rod. Each spring loaded rod comprises a receptacle with an internal spring and a leg that slides into and out of the receptacle. As the leg slides into the receptacle, the spring is compressed, exerting force on the leg in outward manner. When the rods are inserted into the firebox <b>102</b>, the rods are compressed to fit the internal dimensions of the firebox <b>102</b>. The spring provides a high degree of friction between the support structure <b>114</b> and the firebox <b>102</b>, thereby keeping the support structure <b>114</b> securely in place within the firebox <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The support structure <b>114</b> is attached to the media <b>112</b> in a variety of methods. In one embodiment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, depicted are top and bottom views of the media <b>112</b> attached to a casing assembly <b>202</b>. The casing assembly <b>202</b> is sized and shaped to couple with the media <b>112</b>. The casing assembly <b>202</b> can be made of metal, carbon steel, iron, stainless steel, ceramic material, or any other material or alloy capable of supporting the media <b>112</b> and withstanding the temperatures of the application, as discussed in detail above. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the specific material(s) used for the casing assembly <b>202</b> will be dictated by the intended use of the fireplace <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one embodiment, the edges of the media <b>112</b> are surrounded by the casing assembly <b>202</b>. Bands <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> surround the casing assembly <b>202</b> and the media <b>112</b> and are used to mount the casing assembly <b>202</b> to the support structure (not shown) by means of bolts through bolt holes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b>. In one embodiment, the bands <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> are made of stainless steel, though many other materials can be used. As discussed above, in some embodiments of the invention, the media <b>112</b> is divided into two pieces to permit the operation of a damper (not shown) by extending a damper handle (not shown) through the middle of the media <b>112</b> and the casing assembly <b>202</b>. The casing assembly <b>202</b> is sized to fit snugly within a firebox (not shown) and sized to cover most if not all of the flue (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Other methods (not shown) for attaching the media <b>112</b> to the support structure <b>114</b>, include, for example, utilizing wire to tie the media <b>112</b> or its casing assembly <b>202</b> to the support structure <b>114</b>, clamping the media <b>112</b> or its casing assembly <b>202</b> to the support structure <b>114</b>, utilizing steel clips fashioned on the end of the steel bands <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> to be mounted to the support structure <b>114</b>, or utilizing heat-resistant adhesive to glue the media <b>112</b> or its casing assembly <b>202</b> to the support structure <b>114</b>. Other methods of securing the media <b>112</b> to the support structure <b>114</b> will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the media <b>112</b> is removable from the support structure <b>114</b> for cleaning or replacement purposes. For instance, in one embodiment, the casing assembly <b>202</b> is made of two pieces that are held together by the bands <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b>. When the bolts through bolt holes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b> are disengaged from the support structure <b>114</b>, the bands <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> no longer exert force on the casing assembly <b>202</b>, causing the two pieces of the casing assembly <b>202</b> to separate, and allowing removal of the media <b>112</b> from the casing assembly <b>202</b>. In another embodiment, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, merely disengaging the bands <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> from the support structure (not shown) will release the media <b>112</b> from the casing assembly <b>202</b>. In another embodiment, when clamps are disengaged from the media <b>112</b> or its frame <b>202</b>, the media <b>112</b> and/or its frame <b>202</b> will be released from the support structure <b>114</b> and the frame <b>202</b> will open, permitting removal of the media <b>112</b>. In other embodiments, the media <b>112</b> is attached to the support structure <b>114</b> in a hinging manner such that the media <b>112</b> can be rotated closer or farther from the flue <b>106</b>, facilitating easier access to the media <b>112</b> by a user. Other methods of securing the media <b>112</b> to the support structure <b>114</b> in a manner permitting the media <b>112</b> to be removable from the support structure <b>114</b> will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the means for supporting the media <b>112</b>, be it the support structure <b>114</b>, a self-supporting media <b>112</b> (i.e. a media <b>112</b> and/or casing assembly <b>202</b> that is not mounted to a support structure <b>114</b>, but rather directly mounted to the firebox <b>102</b>), or like structures or methods, can be permanently or temporarily installed in the firebox <b>102</b>. Furthermore, in other embodiments, no fireplace <b>100</b> or firebox <b>102</b> is needed at all, and the support structure <b>114</b> can be configured to simply support itself on the ground above any fuel combustion source <b>106</b>. For instance, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the support structure <b>114</b> comprising vertical members <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, <b>806</b>, and <b>808</b> can simply support itself on the ground above any fuel combustion source, such as at a camp fire or a fire on a beach. Likewise, because of the numerous mounting and installation techniques discussed and known to those of skill in the art, the media <b>112</b> can integrated into new fireplaces, or retrofitted to existing fireplaces.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As discussed above, the chemical reactions between the catalyst of the media <b>112</b> and pollutants release heat energy that can be transferred out from the fireplace <b>100</b> into the room in which the fireplace is located <b>100</b>. Furthermore, the media <b>112</b> and the support structure <b>114</b> absorb energy from the fire and radiate that energy outward. Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, the media <b>112</b> is positioned to reflect and direct the infrared energy released by the bulk of the fire and by the exothermic reactions of the catalyst out of the fireplace <b>100</b> opening and into the room being heated, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In other embodiments, the support structure <b>114</b> is likewise designed and positioned to optimize the amount energy reflected and radiated from the support structure <b>114</b> out of the fireplace <b>100</b>. The radiative energy is then absorbed by items outside of the fireplace <b>100</b>, such as walls, furniture, floor coverings, and people, thereby increasing the temperature of those items and increasing the efficiency of the fireplace <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments of the invention, the media <b>112</b> is positioned at a selected angle that optimally reflects and directs the infrared energy released by the bulk of the fire and by the exothermic reactions of the catalyst out of the fireplace <b>100</b> opening and into the room being heated. The specific degree of the angle of the media <b>112</b> depends on several factors, including the height and position of the fire and the size and shape of the firebox <b>102</b>. Angles from 0 to 65 degrees relative to a top of the firebox <b>102</b>, however, have been found to be ideal for most consumer fireplace applications.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the angle of the media <b>112</b> is adjusted to optimally reflect and direct energy into the room. For instance, where the media <b>112</b> is mounted using hinges or like devices to the support structure <b>114</b>, the angle of the media <b>112</b> can be adjusted by rotating the media <b>112</b> on its hinges. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in another embodiment, the support structure <b>114</b> can comprise a horizontal member <b>1302</b> attached to the media <b>112</b> and extending from a first side wall of the firebox <b>102</b> to a second side wall of the firebox <b>102</b>. A first end of the member <b>1302</b> is pivotably engaged to the firebox <b>114</b> or a mounting device <b>1304</b>, while a second end of the member <b>1302</b> is mounted to a motor <b>1306</b> coupled to the firebox <b>102</b>. The motor <b>1306</b> is capable of rotating the member <b>1302</b>, thereby adjusting the angle of the media <b>112</b>. The motor receives feedback from a thermometer <b>1308</b> and corresponding electronics (not shown), and adjusts the angle of the media <b>112</b> to maximize the amount of heat energy projected from the media <b>112</b> into the room. In a similar embodiment, rather than using feedback from the thermometer <b>1308</b>, the motor <b>1306</b> is controlled manually. For instance, the motor <b>1306</b> can be controlled by a wireless remote (not shown), or by a switch (not shown) wired to the motor <b>1306</b>. An operator utilizes the remote or switch to control the motor <b>1306</b> and adjust the angle of the media <b>112</b> to obtain the desired amount of energy reflection and radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, rather than using electronics, the angle of the media <b>112</b> is adjusted manually. For instance, instead of using a motor <b>1306</b> to adjust the angle of the media <b>112</b>, the media <b>112</b> can be adjusted by using a fireplace tong (not shown) or similar device to rotate the media <b>112</b> into the desired position. In other embodiments, when the media <b>112</b> is cool to the touch, the media <b>112</b> can be rotated by hand. Other methods for changing the angle of the media will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the media <b>112</b> is positioned inside the flue <b>104</b>, directly above the firebox <b>102</b>. Because of the position of the media <b>112</b> within the flue <b>104</b>, it inevitably causes some, although minor, resistance to the fireplace <b>100</b> draft during periods of low exhaust flow, such as when the fire is first starting up. To minimize the amount of resistance to the fireplace draft during periods of low exhaust flow, and maximize the amount of particulate conversion during high exhaust flow, the media <b>112</b> is mounted in a support structure (not shown) that is attached to a bimetallic coil <b>1402</b>. The bimetallic coil <b>1402</b> comprises two strips of different metals, typically steel and copper, that are bonded together. Because the metals have different expansion rates, temperature changes cause the metals to expand or contract at different rates, causing the bonded strips to coil or uncoil. During low exhaust flow periods, which correspond to exhaust temperatures below 300&#xb0; F., the bimetallic coil <b>1402</b> rotates the media <b>112</b> to a full open position. During periods of high exhaust flow, in one embodiment when the temperature is greater than 700&#xb0; F., the bimetallic coil rotates the media <b>112</b> to a full closed position, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments of the invention, when the temperature of the fireplace <b>100</b> is neither high nor low, the bimetallic coil maintains the media <b>112</b> in intermediate positions within the fireplace flue <b>104</b>. Such intermediate positions result in the media <b>112</b> being partially closed such that some exhaust flows through the media <b>112</b>, while some exhaust freely flows around the media <b>112</b>. The exact intermediate position of the media <b>112</b> depends on the temperature of the fireplace, with hotter temperatures, such as 500&#xb0; F. resulting in the media <b>112</b> being more closed, while cooler temperatures such as 350&#xb0; F. resulting in the media <b>112</b> being more open.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In another embodiment of the invention (not shown), rather than rotating the media <b>112</b> within the flue <b>104</b>, a bypass route is provided for low temperature and inertia exhaust. For instance, in some embodiments the diameter of the media <b>112</b> is smaller than the diameter of the flue <b>104</b>. Thus, low temperature exhaust will flow around the media <b>112</b> and up the flue <b>104</b> via the gap between the media <b>112</b> and the flue <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A side effect of cleaning the exhaust stream of the majority of the harmful pollutants is that the interior of the chimney is kept much cleaner thereby reducing the probability of a chimney fire.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> displays the average recorded temperature 36 inches directly outside of the opening of the firebox <b>100</b> of the fireplace during four tests. For each test, a controlled burn was initiated which lasted slightly more than 70 minutes. Tests <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> utilize the media <b>112</b> (referred to as the &#x201c;radiant heater&#x201d;) according to some of the embodiments of the invention, while tests <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> did not. Test <b>1</b> utilized the same testing environment as test <b>2</b>, while test <b>3</b> utilized the same testing environment as test <b>4</b>. The differences in the environments between the two test groups consisted only of the ambient temperatures and the temperatures of the fireplace at the initiation of the test. All other conditions were held constant between all tests. As is apparent, the tests in which the media <b>112</b> was utilized resulted in a higher recorded temperature during essentially all stages of the controlled burn.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, displayed are the differential temperatures between tests <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and tests <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. The differential temperature for each pair of tests was calculated by subtracting the temperatures measured during the tests without the media <b>112</b> installed from the temperature measured with the media <b>112</b> installed. Utilizing the media <b>112</b>, in one embodiment, resulted in an additional 2&#xb0; F. to 14&#xb0; F. increase in temperature outside of the fireplace <b>100</b> over the course of the burn between the first and second tests, and in an additional 2&#xb0; F. to 23&#xb0; F. increase in temperature over the course of the burn between the third and fourth tests.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, displayed is the averaged differential temperature from all four tests. As is apparent, over all four tests, using the media <b>112</b> resulted in an average increase in temperature between 2&#xb0; F. and 14&#xb0; F. over the entire period of the burn. The shaded area under the curve is directly related to the amount of increased radiant energy transmitted from the firebox <b>100</b>.</p>
