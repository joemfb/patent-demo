<heading id="h-0001" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">It is known to provide an on-board unit which uses technology such as GPS (Global Positioning System) to monitor a vehicle's positions and transmit wireless uploads to a central host system as well as manage of incoming data traffic without data losses or corruption and/or without database record locking. Such a unit may also upload vehicle status events such as engine fault events. GB2345824 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,388,518 describes such systems and methods therefor, the entirety of each of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Disclosed is a computer system including at least one computer processor and computer readable storage medium or media including computer code and at least one storage device in which is stored GPS data for at least one vehicle the system comprising: a memory including a GPS event database including GPS event data transmitted from at least one GPS device, each GPS device associated with a vehicle, and stored over a period of time. The one or more processors programmed at least to receive GPS event data transmitted from at least one GPS device, each GPS device associated with a vehicle, the event GPS event data including location information for the vehicle; store the GPS event data in a GPS event database operatively coupled to at least one of the processors; analyze the GPS event data to derive and record vehicle stops for at least one vehicle determine if the number of stops meets a location identification criterion; and automatedly identify at least one frequent stop location based on the vehicle stops. The one or more processors are further programmed at least to: identify a stop location for a vehicle; define an area for the stop location; determine whether a number of the recorded vehicle stops in the area meets a threshold number of stops; and if the number of stops meets the threshold number of stops, identify the area as a frequent stop location.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Disclosed is method comprising, in at least one computer and a computer readable storage medium or media including computer code: receiving GPS event data transmitted from a plurality of GPS devices, each GPS device associated with a vehicle; storing in GPS event database operatively coupled to at least one of the processors, the GPS event data; analyzing the GPS event data to derive and record vehicle stops for at least one vehicle; determining if the number of stops meets a frequent stop location criterion; and automatedly identifying at least one frequent stop location based on the vehicle stops. The method further comprises identifying a stop location for a vehicle; defining an area for the stop location; determining whether a number of the recorded vehicle stops in the area meets a threshold number of stops; and if the number of stops meets the threshold number of stops, identifying the area as a frequent stop location.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Throughout the specification and claims, the following terms take at least the meanings explicitly associated herein, unless the context dictates otherwise. The meanings identified below do not necessarily limit the terms, but merely provide illustrative examples for the terms. The phrase &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; as used herein does not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, though it may. In addition, the meaning of &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural references; thus, for example, &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; is not limited to a single embodiment but refers to one or more embodiments. Similarly, the phrase &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; does not necessarily refer the same embodiment and is not limited to a single embodiment. As used herein, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is an inclusive &#x201c;or&#x201d; operator, and is equivalent to the term &#x201c;and/or,&#x201d; unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is noted that in this disclosure and particularly in the claims and/or paragraphs, terms such as &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprised,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; and the like can have the meaning attributed to it in U.S. patent law; that is, they can mean &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;included,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;including, but not limited to&#x201d; and the like, and allow for elements not explicitly recited. Terms such as &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consists essentially of&#x201d; have the meaning ascribed to them in U.S. patent law; that is, they allow for elements not explicitly recited, but exclude elements that are found in the prior art or that affect a basic or novel characteristic of the invention. Embodiments of the present invention are disclosed or are apparent from and encompassed by, the following description.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the present invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, many other elements which are conventional in this art. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other elements are desirable for implementing the present invention. However, because such elements are well known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, a discussion of such elements is not provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The use of the terms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; &#x201c;one or more,&#x201d; and similar terms indicate one of a feature or element as well as more than one of a feature. The use of the term &#x201c;the&#x201d; to refer to the feature does not imply only one of the feature and element.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When an ordinal number (such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; &#x201c;third,&#x201d; and so on) is used as an adjective before a term, that ordinal number is used (unless expressly or clearly specified otherwise) merely to indicate a particular feature, such as to distinguish that particular feature from another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When a single device, article or other product is described herein, more than one device/article (whether or not they cooperate) may alternatively be used in place of the single device/article that is described. Accordingly, the functionality that is described as being possessed by a device may alternatively be possessed by more than one device/article (whether or not they cooperate). Similarly, where more than one device, article or other product is described herein (whether or not they cooperate), a single device/article may alternatively be used in place of the more than one device or article that is described. Accordingly, the various functionality that is described as being possessed by more than one device or article may alternatively be possessed by a single device/article.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The functionality and/or the features of a single device that is described may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices which are described but are not explicitly described as having such functionality/features. Thus, other embodiments need not include the described device itself, but rather can include the one or more other devices which would, in those other embodiments, have such functionality/features.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention will now be described in detail on the basis of exemplary embodiments. The invention disclosed herein may be practiced using programmable digital computers and networks therefor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the foregoing brief description and the following detailed description are exemplary (i.e., illustrative) and explanatory of the present invention, but are not intended to be restrictive thereof or limiting of the advantages which can be achieved by this invention in various implementations. Additionally, it is understood that the foregoing summary and ensuing detailed description are representative of some embodiments of the invention, and are neither representative nor inclusive of all subject matter and embodiments within the scope of the present invention. Thus, the accompanying drawings, referred to herein and constituting a part hereof, illustrate embodiments of this invention, and, together with the detailed description, serve to explain principles of embodiments of the invention.</p>

The communications interface <b>153</b> may be coupled to a network such as the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Memory <b>157</b> stores information accessible by processor <b>145</b>, including instructions that may be executed by the processor <b>145</b>. It also includes data that may be retrieved, manipulated or stored by the processor. The memory may be of any type capable of storing information accessible by the processor, such as a hard-drive, memory card, ROM, RAM, DVD, CD-ROM, write-capable, and read-only memories. The processor <b>145</b> may be any well-known processor, such as processors from Intel Corporation or AMD. Alternatively, the processor may be a dedicated controller such as an ASIC.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The instructions may be any set of instructions to be executed directly (such as machine code) or indirectly (such as scripts) by the processor. In that regard, the terms &#x201c;instructions,&#x201d; &#x201c;steps&#x201d; and &#x201c;programs&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein. The instructions may be stored in object code format for direct processing by the processor, or in any other computer language including scripts or collections of independent source code modules that are interpreted on demand or compiled in advance. Functions, methods and routines of the instructions are explained in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">One skilled in the art will recognize that, although the data storage device <b>155</b> and memory <b>157</b> are depicted as different units, the data storage device <b>155</b> and memory <b>157</b> can be parts of the same unit or units, and that the functions of one can be shared in whole or in part by the other, e.g., as RAM disks, virtual memory, etc. It will also be appreciated that any particular computer may have multiple components of a given type, e.g., processors <b>145</b>, input devices <b>149</b>, communications interfaces <b>153</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The data storage device <b>155</b> and/or memory <b>157</b> may store an operating system <b>160</b> such as Microsoft Windows 7&#xae;, Windows XP&#xae; or Vista&#x2122;, Linux&#xae;, Mac OS&#xae;, or Unix&#xae;. Other programs <b>162</b> may be stored instead of or in addition to the operating system. It will be appreciated that a computer system may also be implemented on platforms and operating systems other than those mentioned. Any operating system <b>160</b> or other program <b>162</b>, or any part of either, may be written using one or more programming languages such as, e.g., Java&#xae;, C, C++, C#, Visual Basic&#xae;, VB.NET&#xae;, Perl, Ruby, Python, or other programming languages, possibly using object oriented design and/or coding techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Data may be retrieved, stored or modified by processor <b>145</b> in accordance with the instructions. For instance, although the system and method is not limited by any particular data structure, the data may be stored in computer registers, in a relational database as a table having a plurality of different fields and records, XML documents, or flat files. The data may also be formatted in any computer-readable format such as, but not limited to, binary values, ASCII or Unicode. By further way of example only, image data may be stored as bitmaps comprised of pixels that are stored in compressed or uncompressed, or lossless or lossy formats (e.g., JPEG), vector-based formats (e.g., SVG) or computer instructions for drawing graphics. Moreover, the data may comprise any information sufficient to identify the relevant information, such as numbers, descriptive text, proprietary codes, pointers, references to data stored in other memories (including other network locations) or information that is used by a function to calculate the relevant data.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the processor and memory may actually comprise multiple processors and memories that may or may not be stored within the same physical housing. For example, some of the instructions and data may be stored on removable CD-ROM and others within a read-only computer chip. Some or all of the instructions and data may be stored in a location physically remote from, yet still accessible by, the processor. Similarly, the processor may actually comprise a collection of processors which may or may not operate in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One skilled in the art will recognize that the computer system <b>140</b> may also include additional components and/or systems, such as network connections, additional memory, additional processors, network interfaces, input/output busses, for example. One skilled in the art will also recognize that the programs and data may be received by and stored in the system in alternative ways. For example, a computer-readable storage medium (CRSM) reader <b>164</b>, such as, e.g., a magnetic disk drive, magneto-optical drive, optical disk drive, or flash drive, may be coupled to the communications bus <b>147</b> for reading from a computer-readable storage medium (CRSM) <b>166</b> such as, e.g., a magnetic disk, a magneto-optical disk, an optical disk, or flash RAM. Accordingly, the computer system <b>140</b> may receive programs and/or data via the CRSM reader <b>164</b>. Further, it will be appreciated that the term &#x201c;memory&#x201d; herein is intended to include various types of suitable data storage media, whether permanent or temporary, including among other things the data storage device <b>155</b>, the memory <b>157</b>, and the CSRM <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Two or more computer systems <b>140</b> may be connected, e.g., in one or more networks, via, e.g., their respective communications interfaces <b>153</b> and/or network interfaces (not depicted).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A computer system network is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. A network <b>182</b> may, for example, connect one or more workstations <b>184</b> with each other and with other computer systems, such as file servers <b>186</b> or mail servers <b>188</b>. The connection may be achieved tangibly, e.g., via Ethernet&#xae; or optical cables, or wirelessly, e.g., through use of modulated microwave signals according to the IEEE 802.11 family of standards. A computer system that participates in the network may send data to another computer system in the network via the network connection.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One use of a network <b>182</b> is to enable a computer system to provide services to other computer systems, consume services provided by other computer systems, or both. For example, a file server <b>186</b> may provide common storage of files for one or more of the workstations <b>190</b> on a network <b>182</b>. A workstation <b>190</b> sends data including a request for a file to the file server <b>186</b> via the network <b>182</b> and the file server <b>186</b> may respond by sending the data from the file back to the requesting workstation <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As will be recognized by those skilled in the relevant art, the terms &#x201c;workstation,&#x201d; &#x201c;client,&#x201d; and &#x201c;server&#x201d; are used herein to describe a computer's function in a particular context. A workstation may, for example, be a computer that one or more users work with directly, e.g., through a keyboard and monitor directly coupled to the computer system. A computer system that requests a service through a network is often referred to as a client, and a computer system that provides a service is often referred to as a server. But any particular workstation may be indistinguishable in its hardware, configuration, operating system, and/or other software from a client, server, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one aspect, computer <b>204</b> is a server communicating with one or more client computers <b>184</b>,<b>192</b>. For example, computer <b>204</b> may be a web server or a hub and data storage service. Each client computer may be configured similarly to the server <b>184</b>, <b>192</b>, with a processor, memory and instructions. Each client computer <b>184</b>, <b>192</b> may be a personal computer, intended for use by a person, having all the internal components normally found in a personal computer such as a central processing unit (CPU) <b>145</b>, display device <b>151</b> (for example, a monitor having a screen, a projector, a touch-screen, a small LCD screen, a television, or another device such as an electrical device that is operable to display information processed by the processor), CD-ROM, hard-drive, user input <b>149</b> (for example, a mouse, keyboard, touch-screen or microphone), speakers, modem and/or network interface device (telephone, cable or otherwise) and all of the components used for connecting these elements to one another. Moreover, computers in accordance with the systems and methods described herein may comprise any device capable of processing instructions and transmitting data to and from humans and other computers including general purpose computers, PDAs, network computers lacking local storage capability, and set-top boxes for televisions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although the client computers <b>184</b>, <b>192</b> may comprise a full-sized personal computer, the system and method may also be used in connection with mobile devices capable of wirelessly exchanging data with a server over a network such as the Internet. For example, client computer <b>184</b>, <b>192</b> may be a wireless-enabled PDA such as an iPhone, and Android enabled smart phone, a Blackberry phone, or another Internet-capable cellular phone. In either regard, the user may input information using a small keyboard (in the case of a Blackberry phone), a keypad (in the case of a typical cell phone), a touch screen (in the case of a PDA and/or smart phone) or any other means of user input.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Client computers <b>184</b>, <b>192</b> may include a component, such as circuits, to determine the geographic location of the device. For example, mobile device may include a GPS receiver. By way of further example, the component may include software for determining the position of the device based on other signals received at the mobile device, such as signals received at a cell phone's antenna from one or more cell phone towers if the mobile device is a cell phone.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Servers <b>186</b>, <b>188</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and client computers <b>184</b> and <b>192</b> are capable of direct and indirect communication, such as over a network <b>180</b>, <b>200</b>. Although only a few computers are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>, it should be appreciated that a typical system can include a large number of connected computers, with each different computer being at a different node of the network <b>200</b>. The network, and intervening nodes, may comprise various configurations and protocols including the Internet, World Wide Web, intranets, virtual private networks, wide area networks, local networks, private networks using communication protocols proprietary to one or more companies, Ethernet, WiFi and HTTP, and various combinations of the foregoing. Such communication may be facilitated by any device capable of transmitting data to and from other computers, such as modems (e.g., dial-up, cable or fiber optic) and wireless interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Although certain advantages are obtained when information is transmitted or received as noted above, other aspects of the system and method are not limited to any particular manner of transmission of information. For example, in some aspects, information may be sent via a medium such as a disk, tape or CD-ROM. In other aspects, the information may be transmitted in a non-electronic format and manually entered into the system. Yet further, although some functions are indicated as taking place on a server and others on a client, various aspects of the system and method may be implemented by a single computer having a single processor.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A network <b>182</b> may be connected to one or more other networks <b>180</b>, e.g., via a router <b>196</b>. A router <b>196</b> may also act as a firewall, monitoring and/or restricting the flow of data to and/or from a network <b>180</b> as configured to protect the network. A firewall may alternatively be a separate device (not pictured) from the router <b>196</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A network of networks <b>180</b> may be referred to as an internet. The term &#x201c;the Internet&#x201d; <b>200</b> refers to the worldwide network of interconnected, packet-switched data networks that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) to route and transfer data. A client and server on different networks may communicate via the Internet <b>200</b>. For example, a workstation <b>190</b> may request a World Wide Web document, interface or other object from a Web Server <b>202</b>. The Web Server <b>202</b> may process the request and pass it to, e.g., an Application Server <b>204</b>. The Application Server <b>204</b> may then conduct further processing, which may include, for example, sending data to and/or receiving data from one or more other data sources. Such a data source may include, e.g., other servers on the same network.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example in one embodiment, an on-board GPS unit uploads information (eg. via a hub <b>153</b>) about a vehicle v<b>1</b>, v<b>2</b> . . . vn to a central host system <b>208</b>. Information about the vehicle derived from the GPS information can be presented as a graphic user interface to a user on a display device <b>151</b>, for example, as a layout shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, the system is programmed at least to receive GPS event data recorded by a GPS (Global Positioning System) device, for example, using an on-board unit which uses technology such as GPS to monitor a vehicle's positions and transmit wireless uploads to a central host system. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> a vehicle tracking system comprises on-board units <b>1</b> in vehicles v<b>1</b>, v<b>2</b>, v<b>3</b> . . . vn, which communicate wirelessly via mobile networks <b>2</b> to gateways <b>3</b>. In this diagram two wireless protocols are indicated, namely GPRS and SMS. However there are typically a variety of additional protocols. The gateways <b>3</b> communicate using protocols such as UDP and TCP via the Internet <b>4</b> with a host system <b>7</b> having receivers <b>5</b> which are operating system services, and a data storage system <b>208</b>. The incoming data is written from the receivers <b>5</b> to the data storage system <b>208</b>, which includes a communication hub <b>153</b> and database <b>208</b>. GB2345824 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,388,518 describes such systems and methods therefor, the entirety of each of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a block diagram of a host system <b>7</b> showing an exemplary system configuration for a host system <b>7</b>. As shown therein, a communications layer <b>153</b> is operable to receive incoming GPS data and write data from the receivers <b>5</b> to the data storage system <b>208</b>. The data storage system can be divided into any number of databases and logical layers for data analysis and storage. For example, a messaging layer <b>208</b><i>b </i>can be configured to store GPS event data from GPS on-board units <b>1</b> in a GPS event database <b>211</b>. A separate routing database <b>212</b> could be provided to store mapping and route data based on, inter alia, GPS data to store routes traveled by vehicles. Another database layer <b>208</b><i>a </i>can include a business logic database <b>204</b> and a reporting database <b>210</b> to store rules for analysis of data and reports analyzed data respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A database layer <b>208</b><i>b </i>can be operably connected to other databases, for example external databases <b>214</b>. For example the system can be operatively connected to at least one speed database including mapping data.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, an external database <b>214</b> can provide mapping data, which can be used in conjunction with GPS data <b>211</b> and business logic <b>204</b> to identify or create reports as to frequent stop locations. An applications layer <b>214</b>, such as an application sever <b>204</b>, can be used to run applications processing, which may include, for example, sending data to and/or receiving data from one or more other data sources such as client workstations, as described above. For example the application layer <b>214</b> can be used to provide a graphic user interface <b>151</b> of a client workstation <b>184</b>,<b>190</b> a user-interactive interface.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another example an external database <b>214</b> can provide mapping data which provides data for addresses and mapping.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An applications layer <b>204</b>, such as an application sever <b>204</b>, can be used to run applications processing, which may include, for example, sending data to and/or receiving data from one or more other data sources such as client workstations <b>184</b>, <b>190</b>, as described above. For example the application layer <b>214</b> can be used to provide a graphic user interface <b>151</b> of a client workstation for a user-interactive interface.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, a system is configured to received, store, and process GPS data to provide to a graphic user interface of a client a user-interactive interface for tracking and reporting on vehicles and vehicle fleets. For each vehicle, GPS event data is stored for over an operation period. For example, the data can be stored and processed to show event data for at least one vehicle v for an operation period of a workday, a week, a month, a quarter, a year, the life of a service contract, or any desirable time period. The GPS event data can then be analyzed to derive a plurality of operational metrics for each vehicle. Exemplary operational metrics that can be derived from GPS data include: engine on/off, stop duration, vehicle mileage, idling, number of stops, distance travelled, and speed (including high speed and average speed). For example, an on-board GPS device can be configured to be operational to transmit when a vehicle engine is on, thus engine on/off time can be derived. Idling (stopped while engine running) and speeding (distance/time), as well as vehicle mileage can also be derived from tracking via GPS. This data in turn can be used to derive a number of other operational metrics, including vehicle activity over a predetermined time period, vehicle operational reports, employee performance (e.g., working hours, deliveries per day), driver behavior (e.g.: speeding violations, idling over limits), and fleet performance (e.g., metrics based on data above derived for multiple vehicles). Accordingly any number of operational metrics can be derived from GPS data, either alone or in conjunction with data from other databases, including number of stops per vehicle, duration of stops, performance against a criterion, employee performance, driver behavior, and fleet performance, speeding severity, a speeding violation, average vehicle speed, vehicle speed versus a posted speed limit, vehicle speed versus a speed threshold, and an average road speed for a fleet or driver speed for a route versus average road/traffic speed for a route. A graphic user interface can be configured to display including a representation of at least one operational metric for each of a plurality of vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Exemplary graphic representations or interfaces <b>300</b> for a graphic user interface for a user is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. Such interfaces could be in the form of application software for computer and digital devices as described above, or in the form of webpage accessed by a client from at least one host server, or any combinations thereof as broadly disclosed herein and without limitation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a &#x201c;Dashboard&#x201d; <b>320</b> page gives a user a first interactive screen to view GPS data and operational metrics. The top of the graphic user interface <b>300</b> has, in one embodiment, tabs for &#x201c;Reports&#x201d; <b>322</b>, &#x201c;Live Fleet,&#x201d; <b>324</b> &#x201c;Route Replay,&#x201d; <b>326</b> &#x201c;Alerts,&#x201d; <b>328</b> Fleet Service,&#x201d; <b>330</b> and &#x201c;Admn&#x201d; <b>332</b>, which lead to other user interactive displays. Of course any number of tabs or links could be configured for the features as described herein, for example for &#x201c;Speed&#x201d; &#x201c;Trending,&#x201d; &#x201c;Score Card,&#x201d; and/or a &#x201c;MyFleetmatics&#x201d; or &#x201c;My Fleet&#x201d; page which can include user configurable fleet statistics and alerts, or can have default statistics personal to a user, or some mix of user configurable and default features and statistics.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> in one embodiment a user can select &#x201c;Live Fleet&#x201d; <b>324</b> using an input such as a keyboard or a mouse, which would lead to a page with GPS data and mapping software which tracks vehicles v<b>1</b>, v<b>2</b> . . . vn. The page can allow a user such as a dispatcher to, for example, locate and dispatch the closest vehicle to any job site and reroute the nearest vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The Dashboard <b>320</b>, as with any other screen, can be configured to offer preset modules or objects for a user to interact with or view, or in the alternative it can be configured to allow a user to customize the information, reports, alerts, etc most important to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the Dashboard <b>320</b> screen includes various graphic representations of operational metrics, including reports and alerts, to aid a user in, among other things, vehicle, employee, and fleet management. For example, the operational metrics <b>302</b> for individual vehicles include operational metrics such as a engine on/off <b>302</b><i>a</i>, vehicle mileage <b>302</b><i>b</i>, idling, <b>302</b><i>c</i>, and speeding <b>302</b><i>d</i>. Other operational metrics could also be shown such as average speed, number of stops, speeding severity, and speeding violations. The Dashboard <b>320</b> shows at the top of the interface <b>300</b> a graphic information display for an individual vehicle <b>301</b>, which can be selected from a drop down menu <b>301</b><i>a</i>. Other methods of selection can be used, for example, by selecting with a mouse, a graphic for the vehicle v<b>4</b> (shown as &#x201c;Van <b>1006</b>&#x201d;) in a fleet report graphic <b>335</b>. The graphic information display for the vehicle <b>301</b> includes a reporting and alerts for the vehicle v<b>4</b>, for example, operational metrics such as at least one engine on/off graphic <b>302</b><i>a</i>, vehicle mileage graphic <b>302</b><i>b</i>, idling graphic <b>302</b><i>c</i>, and a speeding graphic <b>302</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown, the graphics <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, <b>302</b><i>c</i>, <b>302</b><i>d </i>on the individual vehicle <b>301</b> is shown reporting graphic that shows a rating <b>303</b> under each operational metric comparing the vehicle performance against other vehicles in the fleet for a 24 hour period. For instance, an engine on/off rating graphic <b>303</b><i>a </i>puts the vehicle v<b>4</b> in 4<sup>th </sup>place in the fleet, a vehicle mileage rating graphic <b>303</b><i>b </i>puts the vehicle v<b>4</b> in 6<sup>th </sup>place, idling rating graphic at <b>303</b><i>c </i>at 19<sup>th </sup>place, and a speeding rating graphic <b>303</b><i>d </i>puts the vehicle v<b>4</b> at 7<sup>th </sup>place.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The interface <b>300</b> also provides, for the graphic user interface, an alert when an operational metric for a vehicle exceeds a predetermined threshold established for the operational metric. For example, report graphic on the individual vehicle <b>301</b> shows the name of the driver, that the vehicle has shutdown (e.g.,: for the end of the workday), the time for shutdown, and for each of the operational metrics, a pie chart graphic <b>305</b><i>a</i>, <b>305</b><i>b</i>, <b>305</b><i>c</i>, <b>305</b><i>d</i>, and a split-window graphic <b>306</b><i>a</i>/<b>308</b><i>a</i>, <b>306</b><i>b</i>/<b>308</b><i>b</i>, <b>306</b><i>c</i>/<b>308</b><i>c</i>, <b>306</b><i>d</i><b>8</b>/<b>308</b><i>d</i><b>8</b>/<b>309</b><i>d </i>for the individual's engine on/off, vehicle mileage, idling, and speeding graphics respectively, each of which are designed to alert and report to a user when a vehicle has exceeded a predetermined criterion such as a predetermined threshold. Each of the pie charts <b>305</b> and split window graphics <b>306</b>/<b>308</b> show the time the vehicle spent within threshold <b>306</b>, as well as a representation that alerts when the vehicle exceeded the threshold. For example, each metric has in the split window graphic <b>306</b>/<b>308</b> a predetermined criterion or threshold <b>306</b> established for the 24 hour period: 8 hours for engine on/off <b>306</b><i>a</i>, 150 miles for vehicle mileage <b>306</b><i>b</i>/<b>308</b><i>b</i>, 1.0 hours for idling <b>306</b><i>c</i>/<b>308</b><i>c</i>, and three speeding thresholds of over 70 mph, 80 mph, and 90 mph under speeding <b>306</b><i>d</i><b>8</b>/<b>308</b><i>d</i><b>8</b>/<b>309</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, the &#x201c;Engine On/Off&#x201d; split window <b>306</b><i>a</i>/<b>308</b><i>a </i>has in a left-hand window, for vehicle operation within the predetermined threshold <b>306</b><i>a</i>, a graphic which includes a color (green) and text describing the vehicle's v<b>4</b> operation statistic under the threshold, 7 hours, 50 m. The right-hand window <b>308</b><i>a</i>, shows a window with the time remaining in the 24 hour period (16 hours, 10 min.) Because this is time where the engine was not running, and thus within the threshold, the window <b>308</b><i>a </i>is configured to show neutral color or identifier (e.g. white, tan, clear). The pie chart <b>305</b><i>a </i>shows a visual with green and neutral coloring corresponding to the times in the split window <b>306</b><i>a</i>,<b>308</b><i>a </i>which allows a user to readily visualize the percentages for the Engine On/Off time.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The &#x201c;Vehicle Mileage&#x201d; split window <b>306</b><i>b</i>/<b>308</b><i>b </i>shows the predetermined threshold of 150 miles in the left-hand window <b>306</b><i>b</i>, which is in green as with Engine On/Off. However, the right-hand window <b>308</b><i>b </i>shows the driver has exceeded the threshold by another 28 miles. As this is in excess of the threshold, where the window <b>308</b><i>b </i>is configured to alert the user with a red color. The pie chart <b>305</b><i>b </i>shows a visual with green and red coloring corresponding the times in the split window <b>306</b><i>b</i>, <b>308</b><i>b </i>which allows a user to readily visualize the percentages for the vehicle mileage, as well as alert the user that the vehicle is excess of the threshold.</p>

The system also includes logic for at least one criterion for identifying a frequent stop location. The GPS event data includes location information for the vehicle and stop duration and stop number information, which is stored in the GPS event database. Operational metrics for the GPS event history are derived for, inter alia, a vehicle stop event data, using for example engine on/off event at a location where an engine for a vehicle is shutdown and started up, indicating a vehicle stop. For another example, idling for a predetermined period of time at a location (e.g. a time in the range of at least 5 minutes to at least 30 minutes or more). The operational metrics can include other metrics described herein useable to identify a vehicle stop.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one embodiment, the computer system comprises: a criterion for GPS event data used for identifying a frequent stop location. As will be appreciated, the embodiments described herein can be implemented such that a computer can automatedly and without human intervention identify frequent stop locations for fleet, referred to herein in various embodiments as &#x201c;Hotspots,&#x201d; based on vehicle behavior such as vehicle stop data.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Data acquisition is as follows. GPS event data is acquired and stored from GPS devices with vehicles as described herein. GPS event data for the vehicle is associated with a stop event parameter, such as engine on and engine shutoff or engine idling for a predetermined period of time. As will be understood, as more GPS data events are accumulated, accuracy and options for reporting can become more robust as well.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a flow chart for a method and system flow for processing and presenting GPS event data for a graphic user interface, in accord with embodiments as described herein. As shown in block <b>402</b>, the system receives GPS event data transmitted from a plurality of GPS devices, each GPS device being a vehicle. At block <b>404</b>, the system stores, for each vehicle, in a memory operatively coupled to at least one of the processors, the GPS event data over an operation period. At block <b>406</b>, the GPS event data is analyzed to derive a plurality of operational metrics for each vehicle, including analyzing the GPS event data to derive vehicle stops for at least one vehicle. At block <b>408</b>, the system determines if the number of stops meets a frequent stop location criterion. At block <b>409</b>, the system identifies at least one frequent stop location based on the vehicle stops. At block <b>410</b>, the system can provide, for a graphic user interface, a display a representation of the frequent stop location for at least one vehicle associated with an entity, as for example a company or company fleet. As used herein, a fleet or vehicle fleet is understood to refer to any entity (e.g. a business entity) for whom at least one vehicle is being tracked and GPS based data is provided for, including frequent stop locations as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The method further comprises identifying a stop location for a vehicle. Described is a method to identify a frequent stop location in accord with embodiments described herein comprises recording vehicle stops for an entity associated with the vehicle over a predetermined period of time. For example, stops are collected or processed for a predetermined time period, for example 1-6 months, which act as &#x201c;seed&#x201d; stops. In one embodiment the system processes stops for 3 months. As will be appreciated, any time period can be used depending on the type of entity for whom the stops are being used to identify frequent stop locations. If the number of stops meets the threshold number of stops, the area is identified as a frequent stop location.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5B</figref> shows a flow chart for a method flow for processing GPS event data to identify a frequent stop location in accord with embodiments of the system as described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an embodiment, illustrated with respect to an initial determination of frequent stop locations taken first for an entity. At block <b>501</b>, the system starts with the identified seed stop. At block <b>502</b> the system determines if a number of stops meets a threshold number of stops for an area in the time period. In one embodiment the system is configured determine the area as a function of the distance from the stop location of the vehicle. For example the system can be configured to employ a trigonometry function to determine a radial distance around the seed stop, as described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The distance can be in the range of a radius of about 0.1 miles to 1.0 miles. In an embodiment, distance is in a radius of about 0.1 miles around the seed stop. As will be understood, the threshold number of vehicle stops can any number of stops over any defined time period, depending on variables such as, for example, fleet size. For example, for a fleet of up to around 200-400 vehicles, stops can be in a range of 2 to 50 stops over a month. However for a much larger fleet, numbering in the thousands or larger, the threshold number of stops can be proportionally or similarly greater, and the time period can be shorter as well. In one embodiment the threshold number of vehicle stops in a range of 5-10, over a defined time period of one to three months.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">For example, in making an initial determination of frequent stop locations for a fleet, the threshold number of vehicle stops can be at least 5, and the distance is in a radius of about 0.1 miles. In making an initial determination for seed stops, the system can be configured to use a lower stop number variable for the threshold frequent stop location determination. For example, the while a system may be configured to use 10 stops as a threshold, as described in an embodiment below; at an initial batch the system can be configured to use a 5 stops variable for this data and unlimited frequent stop location per company (i.e., with no limitations on the number of hotspots identified). However, embodiments with a limitation on the number hotspots can be configured as well. For example, in one embodiment the stop events are calculated month by month for Hotspots, which can be extended to a previous number of months (e.g., up to 3 months) for &#x201c;orphans&#x201d;&#x2014;stops that do not yet correlate with a Hotspot.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">If the system determines that a stop does not have the threshold number of stops within the area, at block <b>503</b> the system then proceeds to the next identified stop to start another analysis for the next vehicle stop <b>501</b>. If, however, the number of stops does meet the threshold, at block <b>504</b> the system saves the stop as a frequent stop location seed stop. At block <b>505</b>, determines if there are any more stops to identify for the entity. If so, at block <b>503</b> the system then proceeds to the next identified stop to start another analysis for the next vehicle stop <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">If at block <b>505</b> the system determines there are no more stop events to analyze, the system proceeds to process the frequent stop location seed stops saved at block <b>504</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. At block <b>507</b> the frequent stop location hotspots are ordered by stop count, e.g. from highest stop counts per frequent stop location to lowest stop counts per frequent stop location. At block <b>508</b>, the frequent stop location with the highest number of stop counts is recorded and saved as a file for the frequent stop location.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Next, the system is configured to exclude any stops associated with an identified frequent stop location from being identified a separate frequent stop location. At block <b>509</b> the system determines if any stops in the frequent stop location are within the boundaries of a previously identified frequent stop location. If so, at block <b>510</b> the system deletes all stops from the data structure that are within the boundaries of the previously identified frequent stop location. The system flow then returns to block <b>507</b>, where the system reorders the frequent stop locations to run the process again. The system continues the process until it determines there are no further frequent stop locations for the fleet above the required threshold of stops, and further, attributes the stops to each frequent stop location without overlap. The system is thereby configured to run the process to determine all the frequent stop locations for the data structure and create and record frequent stop location files therefor.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a flow chart for a method and system flow for to implement a trigonometry function to determine a radial distance around the seed stop, as described above. At block <b>601</b> the system identifies a stop derived from the GPS data and gets the location data for the stop, for instance, a latitude and longitude for the stop. As noted above, an on-board GPS device can be configured to be operational to transmit when a vehicle engine is on, thus engine on/off time can be derived. Such events can be stored over time as explained herein (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>) and arrival (shutoff) and departure (engine on) times can be logged. At block <b>602</b>, the system is then configured to take the position for the location and define the area for the frequent stop location. At block <b>603</b>, the system identifies the furthest outside stops in the remaining area; and defines a boundary shape for the frequent stop location using the furthest outside stops. For example, the system is configured to take the furthest stops, for example (e.g., the outermost stops) in the north, south, east, and west, to define a square boundary. At block <b>604</b> the system determines number of stops in the area meets the threshold number of stops for the area. At block <b>605</b>, the system associates and saves vehicle stop information with the identified frequent stop location, for example location information such as an address. The vehicle stop information can also include a time and an entity identifier, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">For example, in one embodiment the threshold number of vehicle stops is 10, and the distance is in a radius of about 0.1 miles. Each stop is compared to a 0.1 mile radius to see if there were 10 stops in the vicinity. If there are 10 stops, then the area is identified as a frequent stop location, shown for example as a &#x201c;Hotspot&#x201d; in illustrative embodiments herein. The system is then configured to define the area for the frequent stop location, by taking latitude and longitude (0.1) and remove anything that is either side of it. For example, with a lat/long of 75.234, the system removes 75.134 and 75.334. The system is configured to take the furthest stops, for example the outermost stops in the north, south, east, and west as noted above, to define a square boundary. The system is also further configured to record and save the boundaries, a company ID and a Hotspot name, as well as a time stamp. The Hotspot name can be for, example an address plus the Hotspot ID and Time Stamp (when it was created). A total stop count for the Hotspot is also recorded in a database. The total stop count can power a ranking as described herein. The frequent stop location with the highest number of stop counts can be saved as a record in a frequent stop location database for the frequent stop location, for example in an &#x201c;HSCreate&#x201d; folder.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As noted above, the system can be configured rank a plurality of frequent stop locations. The system is configured to determine a total number of recorded vehicle stops for each of the plurality of frequent stop locations; and ranking the frequent stop locations by the total number of recorded stops in each frequent stop location.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The address can comprise, for example, a relevant or targeted address that is relevant to the frequent stop location. An identified frequent stop location may have a number of addresses associated with it. In one embodiment, the system is configured to determine if there is an address for each latitude/longitude identified as a frequent stop location. For example, the system may employ a reverse geocode, which is a process of back (reverse) coding of a point location (latitude, longitude) to a readable address or place name, as known in the art. For each frequent stop location, the system performs a comparison to see which address is determined the most. The system can then be configured to use the address for the Hotspot name. In another embodiment, the system is configured to identify the most central prevalent address. For example by series of stop points in a bounding box for a frequent stop location as described herein, the system can be configured to obtain the average lat/long&#x2014;which for a grouping of points may not be a center point for the box. For a concentration of points in an area of the box, an average lat/long it taken and the stop point closest to that average lat/long-point is identified as the most relevant address for the frequent stop location. This stop can be identified as a prevalent stop in addition to the identified stop's latitude/longitude. In one embodiment, the record stored in a frequent stop location database can have a format configured in accord with the frequent stop location information, for example &#x201c;[Hostpot pk_id, 4 corners (min and max lat/long), timestamp, most prevalent address, and relevant lat/long]&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In an embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the system is configured for updating frequent stop locations for an entity such as a fleet. After one or more frequent stop locations for a fleet have been identified, the system can record vehicle stops for a period of time subsequent to identifying and establishing frequent stop locations and updating the frequent stop locations with the subsequently recorded stops. As shown at block <b>701</b>, the system inserts a new frequent stop location file of subsequently recorded stops to a frequent stop location database. The system is also configured to determine whether one or more subsequently recorded vehicle stops are associated with an existing frequent stop location; or determining if the subsequently recorded vehicle stop(s) meet a criterion for a new frequent stop location. At block <b>702</b>, the system determines whether any subsequently recorded vehicle stops are associated with an existing frequent stop location by comparing information about the subsequently recorded vehicle stops against saved frequent stop location identification information. For example the new file can be compared against an existing frequent stop location file created or saved from a prior time period, as described above. The system can compare, for example, frequent stop location identification information including any or all of: a location associated with the frequent stop location; an address associated with the frequent stop location a name associated with the frequent stop location; or a total number of stops for a frequent stop location. At block <b>703</b> the system determines if at least one existing frequent stop location matches the new stop at least one existing frequent stop location matches any stops from the new stops, at block <b>710</b> the system updates the existing frequent stop location(s) with the new information, such as adding any stops to the total stop count for respective frequent stop locations.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">If there is not an existing frequent stop location, at block <b>706</b> the system determines if the stop meets a frequent stop location threshold criterion for identifying a frequent stop location as described herein (for instance as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). For example, the system may determine that a new, non-overlapping area that previously had no stops now has over 15 stops in a 0.1 radius and boundaries derived therefrom, as described herein, where the threshold criterion for stops is 10 or more. In such case at block <b>709</b> the system identifies and saves this as a new frequent stop location for the fleet. If, however, the number of stops does not meet the threshold at block <b>708</b>, the process ends, although as noted below, the in certain embodiments the stops may be saved and rolled in to a subsequent update or predetermined number of updates over subsequent time periods to determine if the area should be identified as a new frequent stop location.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The updating process can be repeated continually, for example on a periodic basis. Accordingly, frequent stop locations can be updated, for example every 1 month, 2 months, every 3 months (e.g., every quarter), or even every week. In one embodiment, the periods or any other choice of time for updating can be customized or adjusted to fit a given entity's needs. In another embodiment, the system is configured to offer updates on a fixed basis, for example, a period in the range of every 1-6 months (e.g., every 3 months or every month). For example in one embodiment the system updates on a fixed, non-overlapping basis every month to determine if there are any new frequent stop locations, and does not save any stop locations that do not meet the threshold at each update</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In an embodiment, the system is configured to update at different periods over time. This embodiment can be implemented a &#x201c;rolling&#x201d; system that updates for a number of time periods (e.g., every month for 3 months) saving a record of seed stops from the analysis of the prior time period that did not meet the threshold. For example after an initial determination of frequent stop locations, the system updates every month for 3 months on a rolling basis, and then on a fixed, non-rolling basis every 3 months thereafter. The system rolls these stops over the number of time periods (e.g., 3 months), whereupon if in that given number of time periods the number of recorded stops meets or exceeds the threshold, then the area is saved as a frequent stop location.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As will be appreciated, the above-noted examples of fixed and rolling updates can be configured in any number of ways depending on, for example, the needs of the fleet or combinations or other implementations as may be useful (e.g., continually rolling updates, rolling updates at certain time periods and fixed updates at others, or fixed updates with no rolling or overlapping stops).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As explained above, the computer system includes a GPS event database. The GPS event data is analyzed to derive a plurality of operational metrics for each of a plurality of vehicles; and can also be configured to identify, from the analysis, at least one trend for a GPS event history using the GPS event data. The system can be configured to provide to a graphic user interface an interactive display configured display a representation (e.g., a graphic presentation of the trend). Reports and alerts based on GPS data and tracking and trending can be provided, including for frequent stop locations, driving behavior including vehicle speed (including average speed and high speed), engine start-up and shut-down, idling time, number of stops or any others including as described herein A description of systems and methods for accumulating and presenting data for GPS data for a fleets and vehicles, including for operational metrics and trends, can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/097,689 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING VEHICLE AND FLEET PROFILES AND PRESENTATIONS OF TRENDS, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref> shown a graphic flow for analyzing received GPS event data and GPS data stored over time to identify, report, and display trending. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, GPS event data for each vehicle, as described herein, is gathered over a period of time. The data is analyzed for over time (shown over 6 months) derive operational metrics <b>302</b>, for example, mileage <b>302</b><i>b</i>, speeding, <b>302</b><i>d </i>and idling <b>302</b><i>a</i>. Trending can also be derived and displayed for other operational metrics as described herein or other such metrics as are or become available using data from GPS events and external databases. Such data can be analyzed for each month to identify statistics for each operational metric, for example, for each vehicle or employee, as well as to derive statistic for the fleet (e.g. averages under each operational metric, or averages for defined groups under each metric, frequent stop locations). Such data can be collected and stored indefinitely.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the analyzed historical event data for each operational metric <b>302</b> shows trend data <b>362</b>, for example, the performance of a vehicle/driver v over the 6 month period, for example, a mileage trend <b>362</b><i>b</i>, a speeding trend, <b>362</b><i>d </i>and an idling trend <b>362</b><i>a </i>for each month.
