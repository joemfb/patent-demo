<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from French Patent Application No. 09/57249, filed Oct. 15, 2009, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a device adapted to be fitted with propeller blades. More specifically, the invention relates to a device adapted to be fitted with large propeller blades and to withstand all the forces to which these blades are subjected, such as centrifugal or aerodynamic forces. For example devices of this type are used to equip aeroplanes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As is known, current devices adapted to be fitted with propeller blades are generally formed by a ring (typically made of titanium or a composite material) called a retention ring. Devices of this type are fixed to the rotating driving shafts. The ring constitutes a disc of relatively substantial mass able to withstand the centrifugal forces applied to it during rotation of the driving shaft. A ring of this type <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The ring <b>100</b> is a polygonal ring (i.e. the periphery of the ring <b>100</b> is polygonal in shape) formed of two polygonal structures <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> having identical dimensions, arranged side by side and distanced from one another. Each polygonal structure <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> is formed by a plurality of arms <b>103</b> or ligaments. The ring <b>100</b> comprises a plurality of bores <b>104</b> distributed uniformly over its periphery, each bore <b>104</b> being located between two parallel consecutive arms <b>103</b>. These bores <b>104</b> are able to receive the bearings <b>105</b> for the feet of the blades <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Each bearing <b>105</b> for the foot of a blade <b>106</b> inserted into a bore <b>104</b> is consequently connected to a neighbouring bearing <b>105</b> by two arms <b>103</b>. The use of two parallel polygonal structures distanced from one another instead of a full polygonal ring is advantageous in that it makes it possible to reduce the mass of the assembly formed by the ring and propeller blades <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Devices of this type are, however, susceptible to some drawbacks.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In fact it should be noted that the arms forming the ring are subjected to substantial centrifugal forces. In this instance the arms operate via tension. The formation of a crack caused by these tensile forces may cause an arm to break and therefore the ring to open. A solution therefore consists in oversizing the ring, thus leading to an increase in the mass of the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">More specifically, the object of the invention is therefore to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of these devices. In this regard the invention aims to propose a device adapted to be fitted with propeller blades making it possible to ensure optimal safety without oversizing the device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To this end, the invention relates to a device adapted to be fitted with propeller blades comprising a first retention ring comprising over its periphery a plurality of radial bores, said device comprising a second retention ring comprising over its periphery a plurality of radial bores, said first and second retention rings being mounted one on top of the other in the radial direction, each bore in said first retention ring being positioned opposite a bore in said second retention ring, a bore in said first retention ring arranged opposite a bore in said second retention ring forming a bore pair able to receive a foot of a blade.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a result of the invention, even if one of the rings fails (typically due to the breaking of this ring), the presence of a second, safety-redundant ring makes it possible to ensure, at least temporarily, that any forces are absorbed and the device functions. In other words, the device according to the invention proposes a secure design in which the force paths are redundant. If one of the paths of one of the rings fails, the paths of the unfailed ring therefore make it possible to absorb the forces.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition to the main features that have just been described in the paragraph above, the device according to the invention may have one or more of the additional features below, taken individually or in any technically feasible combination:

This device is called device <b>1</b> in the rest of the description. In particular, the device <b>1</b> differs from the device <b>100</b> described above in that it has two rings, called retention rings, of substantially similar construction. The device <b>1</b> is adapted to be rotated at high speed via a driving shaft, for example on a turboprop engine of an aeroplane. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exploded and enlarged view Z of part of this partial view, making it possible to illustrate the assembly of the different components comprised by the device <b>1</b> according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0033">The device <b>1</b> comprises, in particular:

    <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0034">a first ring <b>2</b>, called a lower retention ring, (the inner face <b>3</b> of the first ring <b>2</b> is referenced in order to illustrate the assembly of the different components of the device <b>1</b>);</li>

<p id="p-0022" num="0038">The first and second rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> are formed of a polygonal structure (i.e. the periphery of the rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> is polygonal in shape).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0039">The first and second rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> carry the bores <b>6</b>, distributed uniformly over the periphery of said rings. Said bores are able to receive the bearings <b>10</b> for the feet <b>11</b> of the blades <b>9</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0048">As illustrated in the enlarged view Z, the lower collar <b>14</b> is inserted, via the inner face <b>3</b> of the first ring <b>2</b>, inside the bore <b>6</b> formed in the first ring <b>2</b>, and the upper collar <b>17</b> is inserted, via the outer face <b>5</b> of the second ring <b>4</b>, inside the bore <b>6</b> formed in the second ring <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0049">The upper collar <b>17</b> is then screwed by the thread <b>19</b> in the lower collar <b>14</b> comprising the thread <b>16</b>. The lower and upper collars <b>14</b> and <b>17</b> are screwed until the shoulder <b>18</b> of the upper collar <b>17</b> contacts the shoulder <b>13</b> of the second ring <b>4</b> and until the shoulder <b>15</b> of the lower collar <b>14</b> contacts the shoulder <b>12</b> of the first ring <b>2</b>. In other words, each pair of lower and upper collars <b>14</b>, <b>17</b> plays a bolting role making it possible to keep the first and second rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> connected.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0050">A collar pair (lower collar <b>14</b> and upper collar <b>17</b>) is positioned inside each bore pair <b>7</b> comprised by the device <b>1</b> in order to precisely position and connect the first and second rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0051">Generally, when the device <b>1</b> is mounted on a shaft (not shown), such as the shaft of a rapid pusher engine, the device <b>1</b> according to the invention is subjected to centrifugal forces generated by inertia. For example, this inertia leads to tensile forces on the arms <b>8</b>. Forces of this type may eventually form a crack, causing an arm <b>8</b> to break and consequently causing one of the rings <b>2</b> or <b>4</b> comprising the broken arm <b>8</b> to open.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0052">If one of the arms <b>8</b> of the first or second rings <b>2</b> or <b>4</b> breaks, the portion of the remaining material is sufficient to hold the device <b>1</b> on the driving shaft, the rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> being dimensioned in such a way that the mechanical overload of the remaining arms is compatible with operation in the plastic state. It is not therefore necessary to oversize the rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>. Advantageously, the total section of the first and second rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> is preferably less than or equal to the section of a standard ring, i.e. a ring implemented by the devices of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0053">The material of the first and second rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> has two mechanical operating states: a resilient state and a plastic state. The rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> are preferably made of the same material, such as a metal, preferably titanium, or a composite material.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0054">The rest of the description refers to:
<ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0055">a normal mode of operation: a mode of operation of the device <b>1</b>, during which the first and second rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> are intact (i.e. no broken arms <b>8</b>) and are in the resilient state;</li>
        <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0056">a damaged mode of operation: a mode of operation of the device <b>1</b>, during which any one of said first or second rings <b>2</b> or <b>4</b> is damaged (i.e. at least one arm <b>8</b> of one of the rings <b>2</b> or <b>4</b> is broken). If one of the rings <b>2</b> or <b>4</b> is damaged, the undamaged material of the arms <b>8</b> of the ring absorbs the mechanical overload by passing from a resilient state into a plastic state.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0057">The total section of the arms <b>8</b> of the first and second rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> is dimensioned in such a way that the materials forming said arms are in a resilient state when the device <b>1</b> is in the normal operating mode.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0058">In the scenario in which an arm <b>8</b> of the first ring <b>2</b> or of the second ring <b>3</b> breaks, the undamaged arms <b>8</b> of the other ring withstand a greater mechanical load. This increase in load generates a change in state for the material forming the undamaged ring: the material thus passes from a resilient state to a plastic state. The device <b>1</b> is thus imbalanced and enters into the damaged operating state. The damaged operation results in non-axisymmetric plastic deformation of the device <b>1</b> generating, during rotation thereof, an imbalance and therefore vibrations. It should be emphasised that the breaking of an arm <b>8</b> does not lead to the destruction of the device <b>1</b> and makes it possible to ensure, at least temporarily, operation of the device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0059">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the invention also relates to a system <b>30</b> comprising a device <b>1</b> according to the invention. The device <b>1</b> is rotated by a driving shaft <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0060">The system <b>30</b> comprises:
<ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0061">the device <b>1</b>;</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0062">detection means <b>31</b> adapted to detect a signal representing a change in the state of the material of at least one of the first or second rings <b>2</b> or <b>4</b>;</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0003" num="0063">engine stop means <b>32</b> able to stop the engine <b>33</b> and therefore rotation of the device <b>1</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0064">The detection means <b>31</b> are formed, for example, by vibration sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0065">The detection means <b>31</b> are adapted to detect a signal representing a change in the state of the material of at least one of the first or second rings <b>2</b> or <b>4</b>. Since damaged operation of the device <b>1</b> consists of non-axisymmetric plastic deformation of the device <b>1</b>, said device is imbalanced, generating vibrations in rotation; the signal representing a change in the state of the material of one of the first or second rings <b>2</b> or <b>4</b> is, in this instance, a vibratory signal.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0066">In accordance with implementation of this type, the detection means <b>31</b> are preferably arranged on the engine <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0067">As soon as the detection means <b>31</b> detect vibrations of the engine <b>33</b> caused by vibrations of the device <b>1</b>, they therefore inform the engine stop means <b>32</b> of this and said engine stop means therefore disconnect the engine <b>33</b> of the device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0068">The device <b>1</b> of the invention is generally of a design in accordance with which the force paths, formed by the arms <b>8</b> of the first and second rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, are redundant. As a result, in the scenario in which one path is faulty, for example because an arm <b>8</b> has broken, other paths (of the undamaged arms <b>8</b>) will therefore absorb these forces that were initially absorbed by the arms <b>8</b>. The forces exerted over the other paths are thus increased. This increase in force leads to the material of the other paths passing into a plastic state. Advantageously, this design makes it possible to avoid complete breaking of the device <b>1</b>. The device <b>1</b> is therefore completely fail-safe.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0069">The invention is described above by way of example; it is understood that the person skilled in the art will be able to form different variants of the device according to the invention, in particular with regard to the assembly means (lower and upper collars) of the first and second rings <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> without departing from the scope of the patent.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0070">Similarly, although the invention has been described more specifically in the case of a ring having a polygonal periphery, it may be applied to any type of ring, including circular rings.</p>
