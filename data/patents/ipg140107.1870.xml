<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following detailed description relates to a device for distracting the spine. More particularly the description relates to a tool for distracting a facet joint of the spine and an implant for maintaining the distracted position of the joint. More particularly the description relates to an implant that may be used together with a tool to distract a facet joint, the implant remaining in place separated from the tool. In some instances, the implant itself may extract the joint.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Chronic back problems cause pain and disability for a large segment of the population. Adverse spinal conditions may be characteristic of age. In particular, spinal stenosis (including, but not limited to, central, canal, and lateral stenosis) and facet arthropathy may increase with age. Spinal stenosis results in a reduction of foraminal area (i.e. the available space for the passage of nerves and blood vessels), which may compress cervical nerve roots and cause radicular pain. Both neck extension and ipsilateral rotation, in contrast to neck flexion, may further reduce the foraminal area and contribute to pain, nerve root compression, and neural injury.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Cervical disc herniations may be a factor in spinal stenosis and may predominantly present upper extremity radicular symptoms. In this case, treatment may take the form of closed traction. A number of closed traction devices are available that alleviate pain by pulling on the head to increase foraminal height. Cervical disc herniations may also be treated with anterior and posterior surgery. Many of these surgeries are performed through an anterior approach, which requires a spinal fusion. These surgeries may be expensive and beget additional surgeries due to changing the biomechanics of the neck. There is a three percent incidence of re-operation after cervical spine surgery. Moreover, these surgeries may be highly invasive leading to long recovery times.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is a need in the art for a device and procedure to increase foraminal height to reduce radicular symptoms of patients suffering the effects of spinal stenosis. There is also a need for the device to be adapted to allow for the procedure to be minimally invasive and to avoid modifying the biomechanics of the spine.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The following description generally relates to devices and methods for treating spinal stenosis. Spinal stenosis reflects a narrowing of one or more areas of the spine often in the upper or lower back. This narrowing can put pressure on the spinal cord or on the nerves that branch out from the compressed areas. Individual vertebrae of the spine are positioned relative to each other and their separation is maintained by discs separating main vertebral bodies and by capsules positioned within facet joints. The discs and capsules are separated from the bone of their respective joints by cartilage. Spinal stenosis is often indicative of degeneration of a disc, a capsule, or the cartilage in a joint, which leads to a compression of the joints and the narrowing mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">As such, the following detailed description includes discussion of a device for distracting a facet joint of the spine to remedy this condition. The device may include a tool and an implant for distracting and maintaining the distracted position of the joint. Several embodiments of an implant are described in addition to several embodiments of a tool. In addition, several embodiments are described where the implant and the tool work together to distract the facet joint and thereafter leave the implant behind to maintain the distraction of the joint. In short, the device may be adapted to access a facet joint by inserting a delivery tool and an implant, forcibly separate the associated articular surfaces with the tool, the implant, or both, and leave the implant in place to maintain the separation of the articular surfaces. This approach may allow for maintaining the distraction of the joint, thereby relieving symptoms associated with spinal stenosis.</p>

<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-28</figref>, a first embodiment of a tool and an implant is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the tool <b>100</b> in position posterior to the spine <b>102</b>. The tool <b>100</b> includes a delivery device <b>104</b>, a decorticator <b>106</b>, and a chisel <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The delivery device <b>104</b> may include a receiving assembly <b>110</b> at a proximal end, anchoring forks <b>112</b> at a distal end, and a generally tubular shaft <b>114</b> defining a longitudinal axis and extending between the receiving assembly <b>110</b> and the anchoring forks <b>112</b>. The tubular shaft <b>114</b> may have an annular shaped cross-section with an inner radius and an outer radius, where the difference between the two radii defines a thickness of the tubular shaft <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The receiving assembly <b>110</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b> may have a generally conical outer surface defining a generally hollow volume or solid mass. The conical outer surface may have a longitudinal axis that coincides with that of the tubular shaft <b>114</b>. The conical outer surface may be defined by a first radius at a proximal end and a second radius at a distal end. Where the tubular shaft <b>114</b> and the receiving assembly <b>110</b> are manufactured as one piece, the second radius may match the outer radius of the tubular shaft. Alternatively, the distal end of the receiving assembly <b>110</b> may be adapted for a press fit over the proximal end of the tubular shaft <b>114</b>. The receiving assembly <b>110</b> may also include a longitudinally extending bore <b>116</b> having an inner radius matching that of the tubular shaft <b>114</b> or may have a conically shaped inner surface leading to the tubular shaft <b>114</b>. The receiving assembly <b>110</b> may also include a relatively thin annular ring <b>118</b> offset from its distal end by two relatively thin extension elements <b>120</b>. The space between the proximal end of the conical portion of the receiving assembly <b>110</b> and the distal end of the annular ring <b>118</b> may define an access opening <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">In another embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>, a receiving assembly <b>111</b> may not include the annular ring <b>118</b> and the extension elements <b>120</b>, but may remain generally conical and may include the longitudinally extending bore <b>116</b>. In addition, near the proximal end of the receiving assembly <b>111</b>, seating recesses <b>119</b> may be included. These recesses <b>119</b> may be positioned on opposing sides of the bore <b>116</b> and may recess into the proximal end of the receiving assembly <b>111</b> and the inner surface of the bore <b>116</b>. These recesses may function to receive positionally matched protrusions from any one or all of the devices being inserted into the deliver device. As such, the recesses <b>119</b>, may allow for orienting the devices properly relative to the forks <b>112</b> positioned in the facet joint. It is noted that any number of recesses may be provided and that any orientation may be used, either symmetrical or non-symmetrical, such that one or several orientations may be controlled. That is, an asymmetrical arrangement may allow for only one proper insertion position as opposed to the symmetrical orientation shown, which may allow for two proper insertion positions.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the delivery device <b>104</b> may include two anchoring forks <b>112</b> formed by coping two opposing portions of the distal end of the tubular shaft <b>114</b>. The forks <b>112</b> may have a generally V-shaped tip <b>124</b> at their distal end and may have a generally rectangular cross-section extending from the V-shaped tip <b>124</b> to the proximal end of the forks <b>112</b>. The rectangular cross-section may have an inside face and an outside face where the inside face faces the longitudinal axis of the delivery device <b>104</b>. The rectangular cross-section may also have opposing surfaces connecting the inside face to the outside face and completing the rectangular cross-section. At the proximal end of the forks <b>112</b>, as suggested by the coping mentioned above, the cross-section may gradually change from rectangular to a shape matching that of half of the annular shape of the tubular shaft portion. The forks <b>112</b> may also include serrations or teeth along the opposing surfaces to assist with anchoring the delivery device <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the chisel <b>108</b> may have a generally cylindrical cross-section forming a shaft <b>128</b>. The shaft <b>128</b> may have a radius substantially equal to the inner radius of the tubular shaft <b>114</b> portion of the delivery device <b>104</b> allowing for slidable insertion of the chisel <b>108</b> within the delivery device <b>104</b>. The chisel <b>108</b> may include a basic single or doubly chamfered tip <b>130</b> at a distal end or may have a coped distal end. The chisel <b>108</b> may also include a head <b>132</b> at a proximal end. The head <b>132</b> may be a generally solid material and may have a generally flat distal face and a spherically shaped proximal face. The shaft <b>128</b> and tip <b>130</b> portion of the chisel <b>108</b>, measured from the distal face of the head <b>132</b> to the distal end of the chamfered tip <b>130</b>, may have a length substantially equal to the distance from a proximal face of the annular ring <b>118</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b> to the distal tip of the delivery device <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">In another embodiment, the chisel <b>108</b> may include a longitudinal lumen <b>131</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. While not shown, this embodiment may also include the head <b>132</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the lumen <b>131</b> may extend there through. The lumen <b>131</b> in the chisel <b>108</b> may be used for advancing a scope along with the chisel <b>108</b> to properly place the chisel <b>108</b> and the delivery device <b>104</b>. The lumen <b>131</b> may also be used to provide suction or fluid flushing to the surgical site to remove or flush debris created by inserting the serrated forks <b>112</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b> and the tip <b>130</b> of the chisel <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tip <b>130</b> of the chisel <b>108</b> may have a coped shaped similar to that of the forks <b>112</b> of delivery device <b>104</b>. In this condition, the tip <b>130</b> may include a generally V-shaped distal end matching that of the forks <b>112</b>. The tip <b>130</b> may have a width substantially equal to twice the inner radius of the tubular shaft <b>114</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b> such that the tip <b>130</b> extends between the two inside faces of the forks <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the decorticator <b>106</b> may have a tubular shaft <b>134</b> portion, an abrasive distal end <b>136</b>, and a handle <b>138</b> at a proximal end. The tubular shaft <b>134</b> may have an inner radius substantially equal to the outer radius of the tubular shaft <b>114</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b> and may allow for sliding movement of the decorticator <b>106</b> along the length of the delivery device <b>104</b> and rotationally around the delivery device <b>104</b>. The abrasive distal end <b>136</b> may include serrated teeth as shown, or may include a more flat annular surface with a gritty surface. The handle <b>138</b> may have a generally cylindrical portion with randomly or patterned raised portions or recesses adapted to assist gripping the handle. The proximal and distal ends of the handle <b>138</b> may be generally spherical. It is noted that the decorticator <b>106</b> may alternatively be separate from the delivery device <b>104</b> and may be slidably inserted within the delivery device <b>104</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this embodiment, the decorticator <b>106</b> may be inserted, advanced to the implantation site, and rotated similar to the decorticator <b>106</b> described above to roughen the bone surface.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">In still another embodiment, a decorticator <b>106</b> may take the form of a relatively sharp pick, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A-6C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the decorticator <b>106</b> may include a control handle <b>139</b> for advancing and pivoting the device. The control handle <b>139</b> may be connected to a tubular shaft <b>135</b>, which may be connected to a sharp flexible tip <b>137</b>. As shown, the tip <b>137</b> may be relatively thin and may have a neutral position relative to the longitudinal axis of the delivery device <b>104</b> so as to position the tip <b>137</b> within the boundary defined by the inner surface of the delivery device <b>104</b>. As such, when inserted in the delivery device <b>104</b>, the tip <b>137</b> may slide readily through the delivery device <b>104</b>. When the decorticator <b>106</b> is advanced to the distal end of the delivery device <b>104</b>, the tip <b>137</b> may be rotated and maneuvered to decorticate the surface of the lateral mass. It is noted that the shaft <b>135</b> may be relatively narrow when compared to the inner bore of the delivery device <b>104</b> to facilitate better maneuverability of the tip of the decorticator as it extends out the end of the deliver device. The decorticator may be used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</figref> to rotationally scrape or longitudinally penetrate the lateral mass of a facet joint. A driving member may be used to assist the decorticating process.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the tool <b>100</b> is shown with the chisel <b>108</b> fully inserted into the delivery device <b>104</b> such that the distal face of the head <b>132</b> of the chisel <b>108</b> is in abutting relationship with the annular ring <b>118</b> of the receiving assembly <b>110</b> on the delivery device <b>104</b>. The distal tip <b>130</b> of the chisel <b>108</b> thus extends to the distal end of the delivery device <b>104</b>. A hammer <b>140</b> is shown for use in tapping the proximal end of the chisel <b>108</b> and thus advancing the forks <b>112</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b> and the tip <b>130</b> of the chisel <b>108</b> into the facet joint. As the chisel <b>108</b> and the delivery device <b>104</b> are advanced into the joint, the forks <b>112</b> of the delivery device may channel into the fact surface and displace or remove tissue. In some embodiments, this may be removed by a suction lumen in the chisel. Once the chisel <b>108</b> and delivery device <b>104</b> are tapped into place, the chisel <b>108</b> may be removed and the serrations on the opposing surfaces of the forks <b>112</b> may aid in anchoring the delivery device <b>104</b> in the joint and preventing dislodgement.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the decorticator <b>106</b> in an advanced position along the length of the delivery device <b>104</b> such that the distal end is in contact with the bone surfaces surrounding the facet joint. The handle <b>138</b> is being used to rotate the decorticator <b>106</b> around the perimeter of the delivery device <b>104</b> to roughen the associated bone surfaces. Alternatively, either of the internal decorticators shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the decorticator <b>106</b> retracted and also shows the resulting roughened bone surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the tool <b>100</b>, including the delivery device <b>104</b> and retracted decorticator <b>106</b>, is shown lodged in a facet joint. Also shown is a driver assembly <b>142</b> portion of the tool <b>100</b>. The driver assembly <b>142</b> includes a distractor knob <b>144</b>, an implant shaft <b>146</b>, implant holding arms <b>148</b>, an implant distractor <b>150</b>, and an internal actuator <b>152</b>(not shown). The driver assembly <b>142</b> shown is holding an implant <b>154</b> and is poised for insertion into the delivery device <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-15</figref> several views of the driver assembly <b>142</b> are shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a portion of the delivery device <b>104</b> is shown for receiving the driver assembly <b>142</b>. The distal end of the driver assembly <b>142</b> is also shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a close-up view of the distal end of the driver assembly <b>142</b> where the implant <b>154</b>, the implant distractor <b>150</b> and the internal actuator <b>152</b> are not shown. As shown, the implant shaft <b>146</b> of the driver assembly <b>142</b> defines a longitudinal axis thereof and has a generally annular cross-section with an inner radius and an outer radius where the difference between the two radii defines the wall thickness of the shaft <b>146</b>. The outer radius of the implant shaft <b>146</b> is substantially equal to the inner radius of the tubular shaft <b>114</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b>. The implant shaft <b>146</b> also includes a keyway feature <b>156</b> for preventing relative rotation between the tubular shaft <b>114</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b> and the implant shaft <b>146</b> of the driver assembly <b>142</b> when inserted. As shown, the keyway feature <b>156</b> may include a pair of tabs on opposing sides of the implant shaft <b>146</b> for engaging with a corresponding longitudinal slot in the inner surface of the tubular shaft <b>114</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b>. In another embodiment, this keyway feature <b>156</b> may be in the form of a longitudinal slot in the outer surface of the implant shaft <b>146</b> of the driver assembly <b>142</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, which may receive an internal ridge, tab, or other protrusion from the inner surface of the tubular shaft <b>114</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, two arms <b>148</b> are shown extending from the distal end of the implant shaft <b>146</b>. The arms <b>148</b> may be formed by coping opposing surfaces of the implant shaft <b>146</b>. As shown, the arms <b>148</b> have a generally rectangular cross-section with an inside face facing the longitudinal axis of the implant shaft <b>146</b> and an opposite outside face. The inside and outside faces of the cross-section are connected by two opposing faces. The arms <b>148</b> may include an engagement feature <b>158</b> at a distal end for engaging an implant <b>154</b>. As shown, the engagement feature <b>158</b> may include a generally rectangular element positioned orthogonal to the arms <b>148</b> and flush with the outside face of the arms. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the implant <b>154</b> may slide over the distal end of the arms <b>148</b> and may include a receiving feature <b>160</b> for receiving the engagement feature <b>158</b> of each of the arms <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, another embodiment of the arms <b>148</b> is shown in relation to an implant <b>154</b>. In this embodiment, the arms <b>148</b> may still be formed by coping opposing surfaces of the implant shaft <b>146</b>. In this embodiment, the outside face of the arm <b>148</b> may be a continuation of the outside surface of the implant shaft <b>146</b>. However, the inside face of the arm <b>148</b> is more detailed than that of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the inside surface may include a longitudinal ridge <b>162</b> extending the length of the arm <b>148</b>. The arm <b>148</b> may also include a bull nose engagement feature <b>158</b> extending transverse to the longitudinal axis of the implant shaft <b>146</b> along the inside face of the arm <b>148</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, where the arms <b>148</b> are engaged with and holding the implant <b>154</b>, the longitudinal ridges <b>162</b> of each arm <b>148</b> are positioned between upper and lower planar members of the implant <b>154</b> and the bull nose engagement features <b>158</b> are positioned in the U-shaped receiving feature slots <b>160</b> on the lateral edges of the implant <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">The implant distractor <b>150</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and a close-up view is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The implant distractor <b>150</b> may be a generally narrow conical element tapered to a point at a distal end. At a proximal end, the implant distractor <b>150</b> is shown to include an extruded hexagon shape <b>164</b>. In the present embodiment, the outer surface of the implant distractor <b>150</b> includes a continuous coil-shaped thread feature <b>166</b>. The implant distractor <b>150</b> is shown positioned proximal to the implant <b>154</b> and engaged by the internal actuator <b>152</b>. Those of skill in the art will understand and appreciate that the implant distractor <b>150</b> may take on a variety of shapes and sizes other than that shown in the present embodiment. For example, the implant distractor <b>150</b> may be a triangular shaped wedge, a generally conical shape without threads, or other shape adapted to cause separation and distraction of a facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the internal actuator <b>152</b> is visible extending from the distal end of the implant shaft <b>146</b>. The internal actuator <b>152</b> generally includes a longitudinal shaft positioned within the driver assembly <b>142</b>. The internal actuator <b>152</b> may have a radius substantially equal to the inner radius of the driver assembly <b>142</b> and may be adapted for slidable longitudinal and rotational movement relative to the driver assembly <b>142</b>. The internal actuator <b>152</b> may be moved relative to the implant shaft <b>146</b> longitudinally, rotationally, or both via the distractor knob <b>144</b> and may cause a corresponding motion of the implant distractor <b>150</b>. As such, the internal actuator <b>152</b> may advance the implant distractor <b>150</b> into the implant <b>154</b> thus expanding the implant <b>154</b> in the joint causing distraction of the joint. The distal end of the internal actuator <b>152</b> may include a hex driver type tip as most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> for engaging the extruded hexagonal shaped proximal end of the implant distractor <b>150</b>. Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that several driving engagements are known in the art including flat screwdriver types, phillips head types, square drive, etc. and that these are within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">In one embodiment, when the driver assembly <b>142</b> is inserted, it may carry the internal actuator <b>152</b>, the implant distractor <b>150</b>, as well as the implant <b>154</b> with it. However, to properly position the driver assembly <b>142</b> and the implant <b>154</b>, some force may be required via a mallet or other member driving member. In this embodiment, the internal actuator <b>152</b> may be slightly isolated from the driver assembly <b>142</b>, so as to avoid advancing the internal actuator <b>152</b>, and thus the implant distractor <b>150</b>, when forcing the driver assembly <b>142</b> into the joint. This isolation may help to avoid inadvertently advancing the internal actuator <b>152</b> and the implant distractor <b>150</b>, thus avoiding inadvertent distration prior to proper placement. The isolation of the internal actuator <b>152</b> from the driver assembly may take the form of a loosely fitting threaded engagement between the driver assembly <b>142</b> and the internal actuator <b>152</b>. Alternatively, this isolation may be in the form of a clip between the two features.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">For a detailed discussion of an implant <b>154</b> according to certain embodiments, reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">As can be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, the implant <b>154</b> may include upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members. The members <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> may be generally planar and may also be generally rectangular. As most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, each of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members may include a proximal edge <b>172</b>, a distal edge <b>174</b>, and a pair of parallel lateral edges <b>176</b> extending longitudinally between the distal edges <b>174</b> and the proximal edges <b>172</b>. The distal <b>174</b> and proximal edges <b>172</b> may be generally square edges, while the lateral edges <b>176</b> may be defined by a radiused curve. As shown in cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the inner surface <b>178</b> of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> member may be generally flat as it approaches the lateral edge <b>176</b>. Gradually, the inner surface <b>178</b> departs from generally flat and follows a radiused curve until it intersects with the outer surface <b>180</b>. The members <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> may be joined at their respective distal edges <b>174</b> by a U-member <b>182</b> to form a leading end. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, the leading end may be formed via a weld (not shown) that couples the distal edges <b>174</b> of the planar members <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> together. In yet another embodiment, the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members may be formed from a single plate bent to create the implant as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 24A</figref>. In any or all of these embodiments, the planar members <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> may be biased by the leading end to be generally parallel to each other, the inner faces <b>178</b> of the planar members <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> facing each other in an opposed fashion and abutting or nearly abutting each other. A guide feature <b>184</b> may be included on each of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members as well as teeth <b>186</b> projecting outwardly from the outer faces <b>180</b> of the members <b>168</b>, <b>170</b>. The receiving features <b>160</b> mentioned above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> may also be included. Threaded slots <b>188</b> may also be included in each planar member <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> for receiving the coil-shaped thread feature <b>166</b> on the implant distractor <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, the guide feature <b>184</b> may take the form of a half-conical feature and may be positioned at or near the proximal edge <b>172</b> of each of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members. The half-conical feature may begin at the proximal edge <b>172</b> with the widest radius of the half-conical feature and may taper to a zero or approximately zero radius as the half-conical feature extends in the direction of the distal edge <b>174</b>. Where the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members are in parallel position, the half conical features may oppose one another and function to receive and guide an advancing implant distractor <b>150</b>. As such, like the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members described above, the half-conical features may also include threaded slots <b>188</b> for receiving the coil-shaped thread feature <b>166</b> on the implant distractor <b>150</b>. In other embodiments, the half-conical feature may not actually be a full half cone. Instead, the proximal end of the feature may be a segment of a circle and the feature may be relatively subtle in the form of a cone segment. In another embodiment the guide feature <b>184</b> may include a V-shaped notch or a rectangular notch in the proximal end of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 18A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16B and 18B</figref> respectively. Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that other shaped notches or elements may be positioned on proximal end of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members to guide the implant distractor <b>150</b>, and these elements are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">As shown, the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members may also each include teeth <b>186</b> projecting outwardly (e.g. a direction opposite the position of the other upper or lower member) from the outer surfaces <b>180</b> of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the teeth <b>186</b> may be equally spaced along each lateral edge <b>176</b> and may have a linearly sloped distal face <b>190</b> and a proximal face <b>192</b> oriented orthogonally to its respective upper <b>168</b> or lower <b>170</b> member. The distal face <b>190</b> and proximal face <b>192</b> may intersect to form a point <b>194</b>. The teeth <b>186</b> may also be bounded by opposing inside <b>196</b> and outside <b>198</b> lateral faces separated by a thickness approximately equal to the thickness of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the outside face <b>198</b> of the teeth <b>186</b> follows an extension of the radiused curve formed by the inner surface <b>178</b> of the upper <b>168</b> or lower <b>170</b> member at the lateral edge <b>176</b>, this curve being referred to as a first radiused curve. Additionally, the inside face <b>196</b> of the teeth <b>186</b> follows a second radiused curve offset from the first radiused curve, such that the teeth <b>186</b> have a generally constant thickness from the location where they depart from the outer surface <b>180</b> of the upper <b>168</b> or lower <b>170</b> member to the point <b>194</b>. The radiused shape of the teeth <b>186</b> allows the implant <b>154</b> to slidably engage the inside of the delivery device <b>104</b> when it is advanced toward the implantation site. Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that one, as opposed to both, of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members may include teeth <b>186</b> to facilitate freedom of motion of the facet joint once the implant <b>154</b> is in place.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, where a U-member <b>182</b> is used to connect the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members, the U-member <b>182</b> may overlap the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the U-member <b>182</b> may attach to the distal ends <b>174</b> of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members via a butt joint. In either case, the U-member <b>182</b> may be fastened via welding, fusing, or other techniques known in the art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, the U-member <b>182</b> may be a relatively thin, generally rectangular piece of material formed into the shape of the letter &#x2018;U&#x2019;. The rectangular piece of material may have a length defined by the amount of overlap of the upper member <b>168</b> and the lower member <b>170</b> in addition to the length associated with hairpin or U portion of the member <b>182</b>. The width of the rectangular plate may be substantially equal to the distance between the teeth <b>186</b> of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members. The U-member <b>182</b> may be adapted to provide the parallel biased position mentioned and yet allow distraction of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> member when a separation force is applied, the proximal edge <b>172</b> of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> member distracting more than the distal edge <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, where the distal edges <b>174</b> of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> member are joined via welding, the distal edges <b>174</b> may include a notch to facilitate more weld length and to cause flexure to occur in the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members rather than in the weld itself. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref> are the U-shaped receiving feature slots <b>160</b> for receiving the bull nosed engagement features <b>158</b> of the arms <b>148</b> of the driver assembly <b>142</b>. As shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the U-shaped receiving feature slots <b>160</b> are positioned between the equally spaced teeth <b>186</b> and extend into the lateral edges <b>176</b> of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> member just beyond the inside edge of where the teeth <b>186</b> begin extending from the outer surfaces <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">The receiving feature <b>160</b> may take several forms including a rectangular notch in the lateral edge <b>176</b> of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> member or a U-shaped notch. The receiving feature <b>160</b> may be adapted to receive an engagement feature <b>158</b> positioned on the arm <b>148</b> of the driver assembly <b>142</b>. The receiving feature <b>160</b> may be any shaped recess and may be adapted to be engaged by the engagement feature <b>158</b> so as to prevent or limit relative longitudinal motion between the arms <b>148</b> and the implant <b>154</b>, when the implant <b>154</b> is in the neutral position. However, when in an expanded or distracted position, the receiving features <b>160</b> may be such that they are lifted free of the engagement feature <b>158</b> of the arms <b>148</b>, thus allowing relative longitudinal motion between the driver assembly <b>142</b> and the implant <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">The driver assembly <b>142</b> and implant <b>154</b> described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-24</figref>, may be used to distract a facet joint. With the delivery device <b>104</b> positioned as shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the implant <b>154</b> may be positioned to be held by the arms <b>148</b> of the driver assembly <b>142</b>. The driver assembly <b>142</b> and implant <b>154</b> may then be inserted into the delivery device <b>104</b> and slidably advanced such that the implant <b>154</b> is positioned between the forks <b>112</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b> and within the facet joint. The advanced position of the driver assembly <b>142</b> and implant <b>154</b> within the delivery device <b>104</b> may be most clearly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The proximal end of the driver assembly <b>142</b> may be tapped on to fully advance the driver assembly <b>142</b> and properly position the implant <b>154</b>. The implant shaft <b>146</b> of the driver assembly <b>142</b> may be prevented from rotating by the keyway feature <b>156</b> securing it against relative rotation with respect to the delivery device <b>104</b>. As such, once positioned, the distractor knob <b>144</b> of the driver assembly <b>142</b> may be turned, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, thereby advancing the internal actuator <b>152</b> and further advancing the implant distractor <b>150</b>. In the embodiment described, the coil-shaped thread feature <b>166</b> on the implant distractor <b>150</b> may engage the threaded slots <b>188</b> of the half-conical features <b>184</b> of the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members of the implant <b>154</b>. As such, the implant distractor <b>150</b> may be guided and remain in position to further engage the threaded slots <b>188</b> on the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members. As the implant distractor <b>150</b> continues to advance, those of skill in the art will understand and appreciate that its tapered shape advancing between the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members will force the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members of the implant <b>154</b> apart causing them to pivot about a point defined by the attachment to each other at their distal ends <b>174</b>. As the implant <b>154</b> continues to be distracted, the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> members of the implant <b>154</b> are laterally separated such that they clear the engagement features <b>158</b> on the arms <b>148</b> of the driver assembly <b>142</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, when the implant distractor <b>150</b> has been fully advanced and the implant <b>154</b> is in place, the driver assembly <b>142</b> may be slidably removed from the delivery device <b>104</b> leaving behind the implant distractor <b>150</b> and the implant <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows yet another device, the device being adapted for placing bone paste over the implant <b>154</b> in the joint. An injector <b>202</b> is shown and includes a syringe type cannula <b>204</b> with a closed distal end <b>206</b> and two exit doors <b>208</b> positioned on opposite sides of the distal end <b>206</b> of the cannula <b>204</b>. The cannula <b>204</b> includes a plunger <b>210</b> with a seal and further includes a stopping disc <b>212</b> at its proximal end, the plunger <b>210</b> penetrating the stopping disc <b>212</b> and having a handle <b>214</b>. The cannula <b>204</b> may have an outer radius substantially equal to that of the inner radius of the delivery device <b>104</b> to allow for slidable engagement of the two devices. The disc <b>212</b> at the proximal end is generally flat and is adapted to engage the receiving assembly <b>110</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b> and provide a stop point for the injector <b>202</b> when inserted into the delivery device <b>104</b>. As shown, the cannula <b>204</b> may contain a bone paste material in a liquid form.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the injector <b>202</b> may be inserted into the delivery device <b>104</b> and slidably advanced such that the distal end <b>206</b> is near the implantation site and the disc <b>212</b> abuts the annular ring <b>118</b> of the receiving assembly <b>110</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b>. The injector <b>202</b> may be rotatably positioned such that the doors <b>208</b> are positioned to open perpendicular to a line connecting the distal ends of the forks <b>112</b>. The disc <b>212</b> may include tabs <b>216</b> for such positioning relative to the annular ring <b>118</b> on the receiving assembly <b>110</b>. Once in position, the plunger <b>210</b> may be actuated to compress the bone paste material creating an internal pressure which forces the exit doors <b>208</b> open allowing the bone paste to escape and flow over the implantation site.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">The above description has included some references to use to allow for a better understanding of the structure. Below is a more detailed discussion of that use including the devices and techniques for distracting and retaining a facet joint in a distracted and forwardly translated condition. The implantation procedure may be performed under conscious sedation in order to obtain intra-operative patient symptom feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Initially an incision may be made in the patients back. Tools known in the art may be used to create this incision and to open an access path through the tissues of the back to access the spine. Once an access path is created, the chisel <b>108</b> described above may be inserted into the delivery device <b>104</b> and the two of them may be inserted through the incision and the distal tip <b>130</b> may be positioned adjacent the target facet joint. It is noted that visualization may be provided by first inserting a scope down the delivery device <b>104</b> rather than the chisel <b>108</b>. Additionally, an incision in the facet joint capsule may be made prior to beginning the procedure, and thus prior to insertion of the chisel <b>108</b>. Once the distal tip of the delivery device <b>130</b> is properly positioned adjacent the facet joint and any other preparation steps are completed, the chisel <b>108</b> may be inserted. Once the chisel <b>108</b> and delivery device <b>104</b> are properly positioned, the head <b>132</b> of the chisel <b>108</b> may be tapped with a driving device <b>140</b> such as a hammer or other instrument to advance the distal tip <b>130</b> of the chisel <b>108</b> and the forks <b>112</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b> into the facet joint. Once the delivery device<b>104</b> is properly positioned, the chisel <b>108</b> may be removed. At this point, the implant <b>154</b> may be placed in the driver assembly <b>142</b> and the implant <b>154</b> and driver assembly <b>142</b> may be slidably advanced through the delivery device <b>104</b>. The forks <b>112</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b> may be holding the facet joint slightly distracted. As such, the implant <b>154</b>, in its flat and parallel position, may slide relatively easily into the facet joint. To the extent that it does not, the proximal end of the driver assembly <b>142</b> may be tapped to properly advance and position the implant <b>154</b>. Once properly positioned, the distractor knob <b>144</b> on the driver assembly may be rotated or otherwise actuated to activate the internal actuator <b>152</b>. The internal actuator <b>152</b> advances the implant distractor <b>150</b> into the implant <b>154</b> and thus distracts the implant <b>154</b>. It is noted here that the distraction of the implant <b>154</b> may cause the upper <b>168</b> and lower <b>170</b> member of the implant <b>154</b> to clear the engagement features <b>158</b> of the holder arms <b>148</b> thus allowing the driver assembly <b>142</b> to be freely removed from the delivery device <b>104</b> leaving the implant <b>154</b> and the implant distractor <b>150</b> behind. The injector <b>202</b> may then be advanced through the delivery device <b>104</b> and positioned to allow the doors <b>208</b> to open in a direction approximately perpendicular to the forks <b>112</b> of the delivery device <b>104</b>. The handle <b>214</b> may be depressed thus advancing the plunger <b>210</b> and ejecting the bone paste or other anchoring material. The injector <b>202</b> may then be removed. The delivery device <b>104</b> may also be removed and the incision closed.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that several modifications or variations from the above the identified embodiments may be made while still falling within the scope and spirit of the present disclosure. For example, several alternative actuation mechanisms at the proximal end of the tool for actuating the distracting elements of the tool may be available. Additionally, several alternative implants may be available. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>, an implant <b>218</b> similar to that previously described is shown and includes a body <b>220</b> and a screw <b>222</b>. The body <b>220</b> includes an upper <b>224</b> and lower <b>226</b> face joined together at a leading end <b>228</b> and separated from each other at a trailing end <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, when the screw <b>222</b> is not received in the body <b>220</b>, the upper <b>224</b> and lower <b>226</b> faces may reside against each other such that the body <b>220</b> is generally flat. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, when the screw <b>222</b> is received in the body <b>220</b>, the upper <b>224</b> and lower <b>226</b> faces may be separated from each other, the degree of separation increasing as the screw <b>222</b> is increasingly received in the body <b>220</b>. As the upper <b>224</b> and lower <b>226</b> faces are separated from each other, the body <b>220</b> takes on more of a wedge shape, with the leading end <b>228</b> being the narrow end of the wedge and the trailing end <b>230</b> being the wide end. The faces may include teeth <b>232</b> and the trailing end <b>230</b> of the upper face <b>224</b> may be formed to project towards the leading end, both of these features assisting in the implant <b>218</b> anchoring to the bone facet surfaces. Holes <b>234</b> may exist in the faces <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> such that when the screw <b>222</b> is received in the body <b>220</b>, the thread edges of the screw <b>222</b> may project through the holes <b>234</b> to bite into the facet surfaces. The wedge shape of the implant <b>218</b> may facilitate anchoring the implant <b>218</b> within the facet joint and may also facilitate distraction, translation, or subluxation of the facet surfaces relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">As can be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the collapsed and flattened body <b>220</b> may be placed between the opposing surfaces of the facet joint. The posterior or trailing end <b>230</b> of the body <b>220</b> is configured to be capable of receiving a screw, bolt, or some other inserted component <b>222</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, upon insertion of the screw, bolt, etc. <b>222</b>, the body <b>220</b> begins to expand. This expansion and separation is enabled by a hinge <b>236</b> at the anterior or leading end <b>228</b> of the body <b>220</b>. As the body <b>220</b> expands, sharp directional teeth, cleats, or keels <b>232</b> on the opposing (superior &#x26; inferior) surfaces or faces <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> of the body <b>220</b> may become anchored in the cortical bone of the opposing facet surfaces. These teeth, cleats, or keels <b>232</b> may engage the facet surfaces and provide acute fixation of the body <b>220</b> within the facet joint. The teeth, cleats, or keels <b>232</b> may be included on only one surface <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> as opposed to both surfaces <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> so as to allow for a movement of the joint after placement of the implant <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">The distraction and separation of the facet joint via the expanded implant (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>) may increase foraminal area and reduce the symptoms associated with nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Another implant embodiment is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>, wherein a screw <b>238</b> also acts to spread apart the faces <b>240</b>, <b>242</b> of the body <b>244</b> of the implant <b>236</b>. In this embodiment, the implant <b>236</b> may have an upper <b>240</b> and a lower <b>242</b> member positioned adjacent to each other. The upper <b>240</b> and lower <b>242</b> member may be substantially rectangular with a distal edge a proximal edge and parallel lateral edges. The distal edge may be slightly radiused. The upper <b>240</b> and lower <b>242</b> members may be connected along their distal edge by a connection member <b>246</b> in the form of a triangularly bent plate or other connection. The connection member may include a penetration <b>248</b> adapted to receive an implant distractor <b>238</b>. As with the previous embodiments, the implant <b>236</b> may include teeth <b>250</b> on the outer surface of the upper member <b>240</b> or the lower member <b>242</b> or both as shown. In one embodiment, the implant <b>236</b> may be formed from a single plate and folded to create the shape shown. In use, the implant <b>236</b> may be positioned in a facet joint and the implant distractor <b>238</b> may be advanced thereby separating the upper <b>240</b> and lower <b>242</b> member and distracting the joint. Similar to that discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>, such an embodiment as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref> may have holes (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>) in the body surfaces <b>240</b>, <b>242</b> so as to allow the threads of the implant distractor <b>238</b> to extend through the surfaces of the body <b>244</b> to bite into the facet surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref> depict isometric views of another implant <b>248</b> with V-shaped members <b>250</b> residing on a threaded bolt <b>252</b> between an anterior threaded block <b>254</b> and a posterior non-threaded block <b>256</b>. The V-shaped members <b>250</b> may slidably engage the bolt <b>252</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the V-shaped members <b>250</b> are in a non-expanded state and are spaced apart from each other along the length of the bolt <b>252</b>. The implant <b>248</b> may be inserted into the facet joint in the non-expanded state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. As can be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the bolt <b>252</b> may be rotated to cause the anterior threaded block <b>254</b> to travel along the bolt <b>252</b> towards the posterior non-threaded block <b>256</b>. It is noted that in use, the rotation of the blocks <b>254</b>, <b>256</b> may be prevented by their position within a facet joint, thus causing the anterior threaded block <b>245</b> to travel rather than rotate when the bolt <b>252</b> is rotated. The posterior non-threaded block <b>256</b> may be in abutting position against the head <b>258</b> of the bolt <b>252</b> thereby preventing it from moving away from the anterior thread block <b>254</b>. Thus, as the anterior threaded block <b>254</b> advances toward the posterior non-threaded block <b>256</b>, the V-shaped members <b>250</b> are squeezed together. As the V-shaped members <b>250</b> are increasingly squeezed together between the blocks <b>254</b>, <b>256</b>, the V-shaped members <b>250</b> are increasingly expanded outward, thereby biting into the facet joint surfaces to anchor the implant <b>248</b> in the facet joint and distract, translate and/or subluxate the facet surfaces relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35-36</figref> and <b>37</b>A-D, depict isometric views of another implant <b>260</b> with planar plates or leaves <b>262</b> residing on a threaded bolt <b>264</b> and parallel shafts <b>266</b> between an anterior threaded block <b>268</b> and a posterior non-threaded block <b>270</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the planar plates <b>262</b> are in a skewed non-expanded state and are spaced apart from each other along the length of the bolt <b>264</b> such that may lie generally flat or, more specifically, at approximately 45 degrees on the bolt <b>264</b> and shafts <b>266</b>. The plates <b>262</b> may include a slotted hole for receiving the bolt <b>264</b>, which allows for the position described. The implant <b>260</b> may be inserted into the facet joint in the non-expanded state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. As can be understood, the bolt <b>264</b> may then be rotated to cause the anterior threaded block <b>268</b> to travel along the bolt <b>264</b> towards the posterior non-threaded block <b>270</b>, thereby causing the planar plates <b>262</b> to squeeze together. As the planar plates <b>262</b> are increasingly squeezed together between the blocks <b>268</b>, <b>270</b>, the planar plates <b>262</b> are increasingly expanded outward or, more specifically, are caused to be generally perpendicular to the bolt <b>264</b> and shafts <b>266</b>. As a result, the planar plates <b>262</b> bite into the facet joint surfaces to anchor the implant <b>260</b> in the facet joint and distract, translate and/or subluxate the facet surfaces relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A-D</figref> show an embodiment, which combines features of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref> with features of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 36</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38A-C</figref> shows another embodiment of an implant <b>272</b>. The implant <b>272</b> may include two stacked structures <b>274</b> that interface along a plane <b>276</b>. Each structure <b>274</b> may include opposing ratchet teeth <b>278</b> along the plane. The position and orientation of the ratchet teeth <b>278</b> may be such that relative translation between the two structures <b>274</b> is allowed when a force is applied to each structure <b>274</b> in opposing directions. That is, once the implant <b>272</b> is properly positioned within the facet, a device may be use to apply a force to the superior structure <b>274</b> which causes forward translation of that structure <b>274</b> relative to the inferior structure <b>274</b>. The ratchet teeth <b>278</b> on the superior structure <b>274</b> may slide up the slope of the teeth <b>278</b> on the inferior structure <b>274</b> until opposing apexes of teeth <b>278</b> pass by each other causing the two structures <b>274</b> to nest in a new relative position, the displacement being equal to the length of the teeth <b>278</b>. Each structure <b>274</b>, or only one of the structures <b>274</b>, may increase in thickness along its length, such that continual relative ratcheted displacement creates a greater overall thickness. The increasing thickness of the implant structures <b>274</b> may cause distraction and forward translation in the facet joint. The opposing facet surfaces may be separated and the superior vertebra may be pushed anterior relative to the inferior vertebra. In addition, anchoring teeth <b>280</b> may be provided on the outer surface of both structures <b>274</b> of the implant <b>272</b> to provide acute fixation to the articular surfaces. The implant <b>272</b> may be configured in a number of different shapes including, but not limited to, a wedge, a double wedge, a rectangular box, and &#x201c;v&#x201d;shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A-D</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>282</b>. In this embodiment, a screw like implant <b>282</b> may be inserted between the facet. The insertion of this screw may serve to distract the joint surfaces resulting in a decompression of the nerve root. Additionally, the threads <b>284</b> of the screw may include V-shaped notches <b>286</b> in the threads <b>284</b> spaced throughout the length of the screw creating serrated teeth. As the screw implant <b>282</b> is threaded progressively further anterior, the serrated teeth may cut/bore into the cortical bone of the opposing facet surfaces. The defect in the bone these serrations produce may prevent the implant <b>282</b> from backing out posteriorly or migrating medial/lateral because the threads <b>284</b> are configured with the serrated teeth to allow the implant <b>282</b> to catch or &#x201c;bite&#x201d; in the bone if any posterior withdraw or backing out occurs. Additionally or alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A-C</figref>, the screw threads <b>284</b> may include a leaf spring <b>288</b> to maintain friction of the threads <b>284</b> against the newly cut threads in the bone thereby preventing the screw from backing out.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41A-D</figref> show another embodiment similar to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A-D</figref>. That is, in this embodiment, the implant <b>290</b> may take the form of a screw, but the threads <b>292</b> of the screw may have a T-shaped profile as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41D</figref>. In addition, the flat surface of the T-shaped profile may define a diameter at any given point along the length of the screw. In one embodiment, the diameter may increase over the length of the screw and not be limited to just the tip like a traditional screw. As such, when the implant <b>290</b> is placed, the more it is advanced into the facet joint, the more separation it creates.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A-F</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>294</b>. In this embodiment, the implant <b>294</b> may again take the form of screw. The screw may have a washer or extra broad head <b>296</b> with sharp protrusions <b>298</b> on the distal surface of the head <b>296</b> that engage the superior and inferior lateral mass surfaces as the screw is inserted into the facet joint. The engagement of the sharp protrusions <b>298</b> may occur as a result of both the longitudinal translation of the screw together with the rotational motion causing the sharp protrusions <b>298</b> to cut into the lateral mass surface as the screw is advanced and rotated. As the washer <b>296</b> rotates, the sharp protrusions <b>298</b> roughen the lateral masses and create a fracture environment. This fracture environment causes osteoblastic activity that will lead to bone production and assist in fusion of the joint at the lateral mass. Moreover, the moat created by the rotating and cutting protrusions <b>298</b> may begin to lock the facet surfaces together.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">In the present embodiment, the protrusions <b>298</b> may be tab like and cut relatively deeply into the lateral mass. In addition as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42D-F</figref>, the tabs may position themselves as shown where the superior tab is flared to engage the lateral mass and the inferior tab is wedged into the joint. In this configuration, the tabs may act to further distract the joint beyond that provided by the diameter of the screw portion of the impant. In other embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A-C</figref>, the sharp protrusions <b>300</b> may be sharp prongs or spurs adapted to roughen the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44A-D</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>302</b>. In this emodiment, a facet distraction implant <b>302</b> has a floating collar <b>304</b> for use with a screw type implant. As shown, the collar <b>304</b> may be positioned to pivot about the head <b>306</b> of the screw due to the spherical shaped head <b>306</b> on the screw in a ball and socket fashion. The floating collar <b>304</b> allows the screw implant to accommodate irregular, non-planar surfaces of the lateral mass and may aid in the prevention of reverse threading of the implant <b>302</b> once the screw has been advanced to the proper position within the facet. As shown, the screw may be implanted to provide distraction and forward translation of the joint. The floating collar <b>304</b> may include teeth or spikes <b>308</b> that roughen/decorticate the cortical bone of the superior and inferior lateral masses resulting in the creation of a fracture environment. This may improve the chance of posterior lateral mass facet fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45A-D</figref> show yet another embodiment of a decorticating screw type implant <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A-D</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>312</b>. In this embodiment, a structural implant <b>312</b> is inserted between the opposing surfaces of a facet joint. This implant <b>312</b> may be in the form of a screw as described above or may be a different implant requiring a torque or other force to be applied to anchor the implant <b>312</b> in the facet joint. As shown, when the implant <b>312</b> is inserted increasingly more anterior within the facet, a torque limiting mechanism <b>314</b> within the device may measure the force or torque applied to the system. Once a predermined value of torque or force is achieved, the distal end of the system may detach causing the imlant <b>312</b> to become a permanent distraction implant.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">In the case of a screw implant, the torque limiting mechanism <b>314</b> may be a necked down portion of the device creating a calibrated weakened portion intended to fail when a specified torque is exceeded.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">In this embodiment, the implant <b>312</b> may also include a number of anit migration features to prevent backout. These features may include directional teeth, roughened surfaces, keels, spikes, or other features known in the art. As with other implants, the geometry of the implant may cause distraction of the joint and lead to a more pronounced forward translation of the joint as the opposing facet surfaces separate.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A-B</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>316</b>. In this embodiment, again a screw shaped implant <b>316</b> may be inserted into the facet to distract the facet surfaces and increase foraminal height resulting in a decompression of a symptomatic nerve root. In this embodiment, however, the implant may include two main components. First, the implant <b>316</b> may include a relatively stiff but maleable cone-shaped screw structure <b>318</b> with aggressive threads for biting into the opposing surfaces of the facet joint. These threads may have a number of variations for preventing movement of the implant after it is implanted. Second, the implant may include an inner core support member <b>320</b>. The core support member <b>320</b> may be in place when the implant <b>316</b> is placed to assist in maintaining the shape of the screw structure <b>318</b>. After placement, the core support member <b>320</b> may be removed. The maleability of the screw structure <b>318</b> may allow it to collapse slightly once the implant <b>316</b> is properly positioned and inserted. The collapsing of the screw structure <b>318</b> would change the alignment of the threads and prevent reverse threading that could lead to posterior migration.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Yet another embodiment is show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48A-C</figref>. In this embodiment, a superior <b>324</b> and an inferior <b>326</b> screw may be used to create an implant <b>322</b>. The two screws <b>324</b>, <b>326</b> may have communicative threaded serrations that work in opposition to one another. As such, when the inferior screw <b>326</b> is rotated, the threads may interact with the superior screw <b>324</b> causing it to rotate in the opposite direction. Moreover, the threads on the inferior screw <b>326</b> and superior screw <b>324</b> are such that opposite direction rotation draws both screws <b>324</b>, <b>326</b> in to the facet joint. As the screws <b>324</b>, <b>326</b> enter the joint, the facet surfaces are distracted apart from one another and the threads of the screw bite into the facet surfaces. The opposing rotation of the two screws <b>324</b>, <b>326</b> may also assist in preventing back out of the implant or reverse threading/unscrewing. It is noted that several configurations may be used to create the opposite rotation of the screws. In one embodiment, a housing may be placed over each screw allowing the screws to freely rotate relative to the housing, but securing the screws adjacent to one another. In this embodiment, the opposite rotation may occur due to the threads engaging with one another as described above or the screw heads may have gear teeth for engaging one another and causing opposite rotation. In another embodiment, the screws may have gears on them positioned within the housing to engage one another and cause opposite direction rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>328</b>. In this embodiment, a translating system including a vertical plate <b>330</b> and a bumper <b>332</b> may be included. The superior aspect <b>334</b> of the bumper <b>332</b> may have a rounded concave surface for opposing the lateral mass of a superior vertebra. The translating system may be secured by anchoring a screw <b>336</b> to the lateral mass of an inferior vertebrae. The screw <b>336</b> may act as the foundation for a bumper system intended to push a superior vertebra forward (anterior) creating translation of the superior vertebra relative the inferior vertebra. This forward translation may create an increase in foraminal area and results in a decompression of the nerve root. The implant <b>328</b> may be configured to maintian permanent forward translation in order to prevent foraminal narrowing and nerve root compression. In addition, the implant <b>328</b> may provide rigid resistance when the superior vertebra exerts posterior translation vectors because it is anchored by the inferior lateral mass screw. The prevention of this posterior translation may keep the segment in a state of forward translation and preserve the associated increase in foraminal area.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50A-B</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>338</b>. In this embodiment, a wedge shaped or triangular implant <b>338</b> may be inserted between the face surfaces. The angled/pointed portion <b>340</b> with two acute line segments may allow the implant <b>338</b> to enter into the flat facet joint when sufficient force is applied. As the implant <b>338</b> is inserted progressivley more anterior, the distraction of the opposing facet surfaces may increase. This separation results in an increase of foraminal height and decompresses the symptomatic nerve root.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">The surfaces of this implant <b>338</b> may include teeth, spikes, cleats, surfacace roughening, and/or keels <b>342</b> to help prevent migration or backout. In another configuration of this emobdiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51A-B</figref>, the wedge shaped or triangular implant <b>338</b> may be anchored in position by one or two (one shown in FIG.) lateral mass screws/nails <b>344</b> that would connect the superior &#x26; inferior aspects of the implant <b>338</b> to the corresponding superior &#x26; inferior lateral masses of the affected segment.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52A-C</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>346</b>. In this embodiment, a distraction/translation system may include an anterior hook <b>348</b> and a posterior hook <b>350</b> joined by a threaded bolt <b>352</b>. The anterior hook <b>348</b> may be placed over the anterior aspect of the inferior facet and the posterior hook <b>350</b> may be positioned posterior to the superior facet. The anterior hook <b>348</b> may have a C-shaped profile with a lip for engaging the anterior aspect of the inferior facet. The posterior hook <b>350</b> may have a S-shaped profile with a lip for engaging the posterior aspect of the superior facet. The threaded bolt <b>352</b> may be positioned through the facet joint and may threadably engage a posterior leg <b>354</b> of the anterior hook <b>348</b> and an anterior leg <b>356</b> of the posterior hook <b>350</b> as shown. As the bolt <b>352</b> is tightened and the hooks <b>348</b>, <b>350</b> are drawn together, they create anterior translation of the superior vertebra relative to the inferior vertebra. This translation may result in increased foraminal area and nerve root decompression. The translation is maintained through the permanent placement of the hooks and bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53A-C</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>358</b>. In this embodiment, an insert <b>360</b> may be placed in the facet joint between two opposing facet surfaces. The geometry of the implant <b>358</b> could take a number of shapes including, but not limited to, rectangular, concical, triangular, or trapezoidal shape. Once the implant <b>358</b> is properly positioned, it may then be rotated some degree of rotation. This rotation may result in an increased height of the implant and cause facet surface separation and thus increased foraminal area and decompression of the symptomatic nerve root. In another configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53C</figref>, the rotated implant <b>358</b> may have outer tabs <b>362</b> that are capable of receiving a bone screw, nail, or pin that can be anchored in the superior and inferior lateral masses. These tabs <b>362</b> and anchors may assist in the prevention of implant migration leading to a reduction in the foraminal area.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54A-C</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>364</b>. In this embodiment, an implant <b>364</b> may take the form of a collapsible diamond shape <b>366</b> with an adjustment bolt <b>368</b> abutting a first corner <b>371</b> and threaded through an opposing corner <b>370</b> of the shape. The other corners <b>372</b> may include pads <b>374</b> for positioning against opposing articular faces of a facet joint. The implant <b>364</b> may be placed into the facet joint in a collapsed position and the adjustment bolt <b>368</b> may then be actuated to draw the opposing corners <b>371</b>, <b>372</b> of the shape together thereby expanding the shape and pressing the pads <b>374</b> against the articular faces. As the shape expands, additional facet distraction is achieved resulting in an increased foraminal opening. This implant <b>364</b> may be provided in a number of geometries or materials to provide directional distraction where, for example, more distraction occurs near the posterior edge of the facet relative to the anterior edge of the facet. Additionally, the surface of the pad <b>374</b> may include teeth or keels to enable bone purchase in the facet.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55A-C</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>376</b>. In this embodiment, the implant <b>376</b> may take the form of an expandable hinged structure with an upper member <b>378</b> and a lower member <b>379</b> connected at their distal ends <b>380</b> by a hinge <b>382</b>. The implant <b>376</b> may be placed between the facet surfaces in a collapsed state. The posterior aspect of the implant <b>376</b> may include a receiving slot that is able to receive a screw, bolt, or other activation system. Engaging this slot with an activator would cause the implant <b>376</b> to expand on its hinge <b>382</b> creating distraction and translation of the joint. For example, the activator may be a wedge, a turnable flat tool, a tapered screw, or any other device that may be inserted into the receiving slot to forcibly expand the upper <b>378</b> and lower <b>379</b> members. As shown, the hinge <b>382</b> may also include a brace member <b>384</b> for maintaining the poserior halves of the hinge in a separated position. The brace member <b>384</b> may be spring loaded or otherwise engaged with the hinge halves <b>378</b>, <b>379</b> such that when expanded the brace <b>384</b> moves into position to support the open position of the hinge <b>382</b>. In some embodiments, the upper <b>378</b> and lower <b>379</b> member of the implant <b>376</b> may have teeth, cleats, or keels <b>386</b> to engage the cortical bone of the opposing facet surfaces. These mechanisms would provide fixation of the implant <b>376</b> to the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56A-C</figref> include another embodiment of an implant <b>388</b>. In this embodiment, a collapsed and flattened structure <b>390</b> may be placed between the opposing surfaces of the facet joint. The posterior aspect <b>392</b> of the structure <b>390</b> may be configured to be capable of receiving a screw, bolt, or some other inserted component <b>394</b>. Upon insertion of the screw, bolt, etc. <b>394</b>, the structure may begin to expand. This expansion and separation may be enabled by a hinge <b>396</b> at the anterior aspects of the structure <b>390</b>. As the structure <b>390</b> expands, sharp directional teeth, cleats, or keels <b>398</b> on the opposing (superior &#x26; inferior) surfaces of the structure may become anchored in the cortical bone of the opposing facet surfaces. These teeth, cleats, or keels <b>398</b> may engage the face surfaces and provide acute fixation of the structure within the facet joint. Together with the these teeth, cleats, or keels <b>398</b>, or as an alternative to them, as shown, the proximal end of the implant <b>388</b> may also include flanges <b>400</b> that overlap the lateral mass of the facet joint. These flanges <b>400</b> may include holes <b>402</b> for anchoring the implant <b>388</b> to the superior and inferior facet masses, or to only one of the masses. In a related emodiment, the superior and inferior surfaces may have open ports <b>404</b> that enable the screw threads to exit the structure and gain purchase in the opposing facet surfaces. The distraction and separation of the joint may increase foraminal area and reduce the symptoms associated with nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>406</b>. In this embodiment, the implant <b>406</b> may resemble a screw and wall anchor. The wall anchor portion <b>408</b> may be generally cylindrically shaped and include two half sections <b>410</b> separated by a slot or it may include a multitude of longitudinally extending sections <b>410</b>. These sections <b>410</b> may be connected together at the tip <b>412</b> as shown or they may be connected together at the proximal end <b>414</b> of the implant <b>406</b> and at the tip <b>412</b> and may include several connections along the length of the implant <b>406</b>. The implant <b>406</b> may have a sharp, triangular or conical tip <b>412</b> that allows for access into the flattened facet joint. Once the implant <b>406</b> is inserted into the facet surface, a screw, bolt, or other insertion component <b>416</b> may be inserted into the implant <b>406</b>. As this component <b>416</b> is advanced the sections <b>410</b> may expand creating additional separation of the joint and allowiong for measured distraction of the space. The sections <b>410</b> of the wall anchor portion <b>408</b> may include sharp directional teeth, cleats, or keels <b>418</b> that engage the cortical bone of the opposing facet surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 58A-B</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>420</b>. In this embodiment, a tool <b>422</b> may be used to apply a force to the superior vertebra of a motion segment. This forward translation would result in an increase in foraminal area and reduced nerve root decompression. Following the forward translation of the motion segment, an angled screw <b>424</b> would be placed through the superior facet surface, facet capsule, and inferior facet surface. This screw <b>424</b> would provide temporary immobilization of the joint which leads to fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59A-B</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>426</b>. In this embodiment, a collapsed, triangular shaped implant is inserted into the facet. The implant <b>426</b> may include a central shaft <b>428</b> and two or more springing leaves <b>430</b>. The leaves <b>430</b> may be connected to the distal end of the shaft <b>428</b> and may extend proximally along the shaft <b>428</b>. The leaves <b>430</b> may be connected at the distal end so as to be biased in a direction to form an arrow shape. The leaves <b>430</b> may be held in the compressed state by an insertion &#x26; delivery tool <b>432</b>. The delivery tool's compression of the implant <b>426</b> prevents the superior and inferior surfaces of the implant <b>426</b> from springing open to a distracted position. Once the compressed implant <b>426</b> is positioned correctly, the delivery tool <b>432</b> may be removed. Removing the tools causes the leaves <b>430</b> to open/expand causing distraction and separation of the facet joint thus resulting in increased foraminal area and reduced nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60A-B</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>434</b>. This concept has at least three embodiments. The first embodiment consists of a direction facet joint screw <b>436</b> that is advanced through an inferior facet until it makes contact with the opposing superior facet. Once the screw <b>436</b> makes contact with superior facet surface, the energy applied to advance the screw <b>436</b> results in distraction and separation of the joint due to bearing of the screw tip <b>438</b> on the underside of the superior articular surface. In one variation of this embodiment, the hole for the screw in the inferior facet may be pre-drilled. When the screw is installed and encounters the superior facet, the screw may bite into the superior facet as it forces the fact upward and distracts the joint. Alternatively, in this emboidment, the screw may have a blunt tip <b>438</b> to distract the joint without biting into the superior facet.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">In the second embodiment, as shown, a directional facet screw <b>436</b> may be advanced through the inferior facet surface until it engages with a facet spacer/plate <b>440</b> that is inserted in between the facet surfaces within the facet capsule. As the screw <b>436</b> makes contact with the facet spacer/plate <b>440</b>, the flat surface of the spacer/plate <b>440</b> may push up against the opposing superior facet surface causes distraction and forward translation. This separation of the facet surfaces results in increased foraminal area and reduced nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">In a third embodiment, the spacer/plate <b>440</b> may have a shape to allow the screw <b>436</b> to pass through a first end and the other end to be placed in the facet joint. In this embodiment, the C-shaped spacer <b>440</b> may be positioned in the joint, thereby slightly distracting the joint. The screw may then penetrate a first end of the spacer <b>440</b> thereby anchoring the spacer <b>440</b> in the joint. The screw may then be advanced through the inferior facet surface until it engages with the spacer/plate <b>440</b>. As the screw <b>436</b> makes contact with the facet spacer/plate <b>440</b>, the flat surface of the spacer/plate <b>440</b> may push up against the opposing superior facet surface causes distraction and forward translation. In some embodiments, the screw may penetrate the spacer and aid in fixing the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 61A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>442</b>. In this embodiment, bracket type structures <b>444</b> may be attached to the superior and inferior lateral masses. The bracket type structures <b>444</b> may enable the attachment of a single bolt <b>446</b>. The bolt <b>446</b> may be configured to create a distraction energy. That is, it may be connected to the inferior bracket <b>444</b> to allow rotation but not relative translation. In contrast, the bolt may threadably engage the superior bracket <b>444</b>. As such, when the bolt <b>446</b> is &#x201c;unscrewed&#x201d; it may function to push the inferior and superior brackets <b>444</b> apart.

As with the bracket above, the bolt <b>456</b> may be configured to create distraction energy. That is, it may be connected to one of the superior or inferior bracket <b>450</b> so as to allow rotation but not relative translation. The other bracket <b>450</b> may threadably engage the bolt <b>456</b>.

In this embodiment, a triangular shaped implant <b>458</b> including a bent plate and a filler wedge may be inserted in the facet joint. As the triangular implant <b>458</b> is inserted progressively more anterior, the joint may be distracted to an optimal level. Once the desired distraction is achieved, an anchoring screw <b>460</b> may be inserted through the implant <b>458</b> and into the inferior lateral mass. The superior aspect of the implant <b>458</b> may include a metal flap <b>462</b> with teeth, spikes, or cleats <b>464</b>. This maleable flap <b>462</b> may be contoured to the superior lateral mass and anchored using its teeth, spikes, or cleats <b>464</b>. The metal flap <b>462</b> and inferior screw <b>460</b> may provide permanent fixation of the triangular implant <b>458</b> to enable permanent distraction of the facet and immobilization of the joint facilitating permanent fusion of the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 64A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>466</b>.

The two external (superior and inferior) plates <b>472</b> may be attached to the lateral masses of a motion segment and may be anchored using screws. The initiating plate <b>470</b> may then be inserted in the gap <b>471</b> between the external plates <b>472</b> to initiate opening of the plates <b>472</b> and the joint and allow for further insertion of the anchoring plug <b>468</b>. Following the insertion of this initiating plate <b>470</b> and turning or manipulating the plate <b>470</b> to open the external plates <b>472</b>, the central anchoring plug <b>468</b> may then be advanced into the gap <b>471</b> between the external plates <b>472</b> causing expansion of the plates and distraction and separation of the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 65A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>474</b>.

The delivery system <b>478</b> may be placed in a facet joint. Once inserted within the facet, the nitinol hooks <b>476</b> may be activated via temperature, force, or other activation means causing them to assume their original (pre-flattened) shape and hook into the opposing facet surfaces. As the hooks <b>476</b> engage the cortical bone of the facet surfaces, they distract the joint. This separation results in increased foraminal area and reduced nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>480</b>.

In this embodiment, a panel anchor implant <b>488</b> may be placed within the facet joint. The implant <b>488</b> may include a bolt <b>490</b> and collapsible nut <b>492</b> that is rotationally free from the bolt <b>490</b> near the head of the bolt <b>490</b> and threadably engaged with the bolt <b>490</b> near the end opposite the head. As such, when the bolt <b>490</b> is advanced, the distal end of the nut <b>492</b> is squeezed toward the proximal end of the nut <b>492</b> and the nut <b>492</b> may collapse with an accordion effect. As shown, the compression of the nut <b>492</b> results in a taller structure that applies a distraction force to the opposing facet surfaces. This distraction leads to increased foraminal area and reduced nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">In similar fashion, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 68A-C</figref> may collapse causing distraction of the joint. In lieu of the nut <b>492</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 67A-C</figref>, this embodiment, shows a flat plate <b>494</b> that collapses into an accordion shape.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 69A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>496</b>. In this embodiment, an implant <b>496</b> is placed within the facet joint. The implant could have a number of shapes and sizes but, in this embodiment, has a tension wire <b>498</b> that surrounds the implant <b>496</b> and is pulled taught during implantation. Once the implant <b>496</b> is properly positioned, the wire's tension is released. The release of this tension causes the wire <b>498</b> to return to a preset expanded shape and height that causes the implant <b>496</b> to expand. The expansion of the implant <b>496</b> as the wire returns to its preset, and larger profile, shape causes separation of the facet joint. This distraciton results in increased foraminal area and reduced nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 70A-C</figref>, an implant <b>500</b> with an outer housing <b>502</b> and an internal spring <b>504</b> may be positioned in the facet joint with the wire spring <b>504</b> in a tensioned or elongated position. Once properly positioned, the tension on the spring <b>504</b> may be released thus collapsing the spring <b>504</b> and expanding the associated housing <b>502</b> of the implant <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 71A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>506</b>. In this embodiment screw type implant <b>506</b> may be provided and may also include an arm type locking mechanism <b>508</b>. The locking mechanism <b>508</b> may extend from all sides of the head of the screw as shown and may be biased in a distal direction. As the screw advances, the locking mechanism <b>508</b> may anchor in the lateral mass of a vertebra. The biased position of the arm <b>508</b> pressing against the lateral mass may provide a force biasing the implant <b>506</b> against the advancing direction. However, this may cause constant friction between any newly cut threads in the surfaces of the facet joint thereby preventing unscrewing or back out of the implant. In addition, teeth <b>509</b> may be included on the arms <b>508</b> and may bite into the lateral mass further preventing backing out of the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 72A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>510</b>. In this embodiment, two wedge shape opposing structures <b>512</b> are shown separated by a sloping plane <b>514</b>. The structures <b>512</b> may have a predetermined relative position, or a series of predetermined relative positions, where a bolt or screw <b>516</b> may be advanced at an angle as shown through one of the structures <b>512</b> and into a predrilled hole of the other <b>512</b> to maintain their relative position. Alternatively, the relative positions may not predetermined and a self-drilling screw <b>516</b> may be used. In either case, the implant <b>510</b> may be positioned in the facet joint in minimal profile position and then the two structures <b>512</b> may be slid relative to each other along the sloping plane <b>514</b> to expand the implant <b>510</b> and thus the facet joint. Once the desired position is achieved, the bolt, pin, screw, or other fastenter <b>516</b> may be inserted to maintain the relative position of the structures <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 73A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>518</b>. In this embodiment, an implant <b>518</b> is configured to be inserted in a collapsed state. In its non collapsed state, it has a vertical cylindrical profile with side cutouts <b>520</b>. When the implant is compressed, the side cutouts <b>520</b> allow the wall panels <b>522</b> to bend out as the height of the cylindrical implant <b>518</b> is reduced. These wall panels <b>522</b> create an anchor shape that can enage bone structures. This implant <b>518</b> may be placed within the facet join in its flattened, compressed profile. Once it is positioned correctly, a distraction energy may be applied to the implant <b>518</b> to cause it to expand or decompress. This decompression causes the implant <b>518</b> to attempt to return to its vertical cylindrical shape. The implant <b>518</b> may be made from a resilient elastic material such as nitinol, stainless steel, or other known materials. As the implant <b>518</b> becomes more cylindrical, it pushes against the opposing facet surfaces. This force causes distraction of the facet joint and results in increase foraminal area and reduced nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 74A-C</figref>, the implant <b>518</b> may be positioned on its side and the distraction energy may cause the implant <b>518</b> to collapse from its cylindrical shape and expand laterally to distract the facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 75A-B</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>524</b>. In this embodiment, a delivery tool <b>526</b> is inserted within the facet joint. The distal tip <b>528</b> of the delivery tool <b>526</b> is shaped to distract the joint. Once the tool <b>526</b> is inserted into the facet joint and the desired amount of distraction is achieved, the distal tip <b>528</b> (part that is in the facet joint) may be detached from the delivery tool <b>526</b>. In one configuration of this embodiment, the detachable tip <b>528</b> would have teeth, cleats, spikes, or keels <b>530</b> to prevent it from migrating within the joint once it is detached. In another configuration of this embodiment, the implant <b>524</b> may be anchored in the facet joint by inserting a screw <b>532</b> through the superior facet, the implant, and the inferior facet. In both configurations, the detachable tip <b>526</b> (implant) may provide permanent distraction of the joint resulting in increased foraminal area and reduced nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 76A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>534</b>. In this embodiment, the implant <b>534</b> may include a housing <b>536</b> with a central gear <b>538</b> turnable by an allen type head <b>540</b> or other known attachment for turning, such as any known screwdriver heads. Adjacent the central gear <b>538</b> on each side, the implant <b>534</b> may include two plates <b>542</b> slidable in the housing <b>536</b> in a direction tangential to the gear surface. The plates <b>542</b> may include teeth <b>544</b> engaging the central gear <b>538</b> such that when the gear <b>538</b> turns, the plates <b>542</b> slide tangentially to the gear <b>538</b> and extend beyond an outer surface of the housing <b>536</b>. As such, the implant <b>534</b> may be positioned in a facet joint as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76A</figref>. Once positioned, the gear <b>538</b> may be turned thus extending the plates <b>542</b> in opposite directions and distracting the facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 77A-C</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>546</b>. In this embodiment a triangular shaped implant <b>546</b> in the form of a bent plate <b>548</b> may be wedged into the facet causing distraction and separation of the joint. On one side of the triangular distraction structure <b>548</b> is a bracket <b>550</b> with a screw <b>552</b>. The screw <b>552</b> may be inserted into the lateral mass to provide anchoring of the facet distraction implant <b>546</b>. The other side of the triangular distraction structure <b>548</b> may include teeth or other features <b>554</b> for biting into the assocatiated lateral mass. The implant <b>546</b> would provide permanent distraction of the joint resulting in increase foraminal area and reduced nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 78A-C</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>556</b>. In this embodiment, the implant <b>556</b> may have a tapered shape that is taller at the posterior aspect relative to the anterior aspect. The implant could be tapped in, malleted in, screwed in with threads, or pushed in with hand pressure. Once the implant <b>556</b> is positioned correctly, the head <b>558</b> of the implant <b>556</b> (posterior aspect) may be configured to have sharp teeth, spikes, or cleats that can be pushed into the cortical bone of the superior and inferior lateral masses of a motion segment. These flaps <b>558</b> could be hinged on the posterior aspect of the implant <b>556</b> to allow the flaps <b>558</b> to be pushed anterior enough to match the irregular contours of the lateral mass. The implant <b>556</b> would provide permanent distraction of the joint resulting in increase foraminal area and reduced nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 79A-C</figref> show another embodiment of an implant <b>560</b>. In this embodiment, the implant <b>560</b> includes a single rotatable cone <b>562</b> with a shoulder shaped ledge <b>564</b> defining a cam surface <b>566</b>, the distance between the ledge and the bottom of the implant defining a shoulder height. The shoulder height may vary gradually from low to high and back to low along the circumferential perimeter of the cone <b>562</b>. In use, the implant <b>560</b> may be initially positioned such that the shoulder portion with the low ledge height enters the facet joint. Once in position, the implant <b>560</b> may be rotated to cause the higher ledge height to enter the joint thereby distracting the posterior portion of the joint by causing the superior articular face to ride upward along the cam surface <b>566</b>. The implant <b>560</b> may then be secured with a screw <b>568</b> extending along the longitudinal axis of the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 80A-D</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>570</b>. In this emobiment, an implant <b>570</b> may include a housing <b>572</b> with penetrations <b>574</b> adapted for ejection of retracted spikes <b>576</b>. Within the housing <b>572</b>, a wire <b>578</b> may be routed between the spikes <b>576</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80D</figref>. The implant <b>570</b> may be inserted into the facet joint while the wire <b>578</b> is relaxed and the spikes <b>576</b> are contained within the folds/curves in the collapsed wire <b>578</b>. Once the implant <b>570</b> is positioned correctly, the wire <b>578</b> may be pulled taught causing the spikes <b>576</b> to displace outwardly, extending out of the housing <b>572</b> and engaging the opposing facet surfaces with a force. This force may create distraction and separation of the joint, while the pointed tips of the spikes <b>576</b> would penetrate the surface of the facet joint and provide acute fixation preventing migration of the implant <b>570</b>. The implant <b>570</b> would provide permanent distraction of the joint resulting in increase foraminal area and reduced nerve root compression.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 81A-C</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>580</b>. In this embodiment, an implant <b>580</b> may include a housing <b>582</b> with a cavity <b>584</b> and penetrations <b>586</b> on lateral surfaces extending from the cavity <b>584</b> through the wall of the housing <b>582</b>, the penetrations <b>586</b> adapted for ejection of retracted spikes <b>588</b>. Within the housing <b>582</b>, a threaded piston <b>590</b> may be positioned at a distal end and may be adapted for displacement through the cavity <b>584</b> in the proximal direction. The piston <b>590</b> may have a torpedo shaped distal end <b>592</b> and may engage the a beveled inner surface <b>594</b> of the retracted spikes <b>588</b>. The implant <b>580</b> may be positioned within a facet joint and when properly postioned, the piston <b>590</b> may be advanced via a turning tool, the torpedo shaped distal end <b>592</b> of the piston <b>590</b> thus engaging the beveled end <b>594</b> of the spikes <b>588</b> and advancing them laterally relative to the implant <b>580</b> out of the housing <b>582</b> with a force and into the face of the facets. This force may create distraction and separation of the joint, while the pointed tips of the spikes <b>588</b> would penetrate the surface of the facet joint and provide acute fixation preventing migration of the implant <b>580</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 82A-F</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>596</b>. In this embodiment, the implant <b>596</b> may include two parallel equal length side bars <b>598</b> with pivoting struts <b>600</b> positioned on a pin <b>602</b> between the bars <b>598</b> at each end. The pivoting struts <b>600</b> may include textured surfaces <b>604</b> on each end and the struts <b>600</b> may be pinned to the side bars <b>598</b> through one end. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82F</figref>, the struts <b>600</b> may have length so as to allow them to be pivoted to lie parallel to one another in the plane of the side bars <b>598</b>. In this position, the implant <b>596</b> may be positioned in the facet joint as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82A</figref> or anterior to the facet joint as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82D</figref>. Once properly positioned, the struts <b>600</b> of the implant <b>596</b> may be rotated so as to be approximately perpendicular to parallel side bars <b>598</b> thus separating an inferior vertebra from a inferior vertebra. It is noted that the generally stout shape of the struts <b>600</b> with relatively broad textured ends <b>604</b> may facilitate stability preventing the implant <b>596</b> from racking back to the parallel condition.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">Another variation of this embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 83A-B</figref>, where a series of varying height struts <b>600</b> are positioned along a shaft. The entire implant may be placed within a facet joint on its side and then a single ninety degree turn may position the implant and distract the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 84A-B</figref> show yet another embodiment of an implant <b>606</b>. In this embodiment, two rotatable cams <b>608</b> may be positioned in a facet joint. It is noted that the cams may have a relatively low profile and the proportions in the FIGS. may be exaggerated for purposes of showing the concept. Once placed in the joint, a distraction/rotation energy may be applied to the cams causing them to rotate open to reveal two circular halves of the cam implant. As one half of the implant rotates superiorly, it may push the superior vertebra upward creating an increase in foraminal area and nerve root decompression.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">In another embodiment, a kit is provided. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 85 and 86</figref>, the kit may include a delivery device <b>610</b>, a chisel <b>612</b>, several internal and external decorticators <b>614</b>, <b>616</b>, <b>618</b>, and a driver assembly <b>620</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 87 and 88</figref>, the chisel head <b>622</b> and shaft <b>624</b> may be provided in two pieces that may be combined with a press fit. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref>, the delivery device <b>610</b> may be provided in two pieces combinable with a press fit, the first piece being a tubular shaft and fork piece <b>626</b> and the second piece being a receiving assembly piece <b>628</b>. As show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 90-93</figref>, the driver assembly <b>620</b> may be provided in several pieces including the internal actuator and the implant shaft/arms/handle portion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</figref> shows the shaft/arms/handle portion comprising two pieces, the first piece being a shaft with arms <b>630</b> and the second piece being the handle <b>632</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 91 and 92</figref> show the internal actuator including a tip <b>634</b>, a shaft portion <b>636</b>, an adapter <b>638</b>, a pin <b>640</b>, and a distractor knob <b>642</b>. In addition to the elements shown, one or several implants may be provided as well as an injector as previously described. Several traditional instruments for use in accessing the surgical site and closing the surgical site may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 94-116</figref>, another embodiment of a tool <b>800</b> is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 94-98</figref> show a chisel <b>808</b>, a delivery device <b>804</b>, a decorticator <b>806</b>, a driver assembly <b>842</b>, an internal actuator <b>852</b>, and an injector <b>902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</figref>, the delivery device <b>804</b> may include a receiving assembly <b>810</b> at a proximal end, anchoring forks <b>812</b> at a distal end, and a generally tubular shaft <b>814</b> defining a longitudinal axis and extending between the receiving assembly <b>810</b> and the anchoring forks <b>812</b>. The tubular shaft <b>814</b> may have an annular shaped cross-section with an inner radius and an outer radius, where the difference between the two radii defines a thickness of the tubular shaft <b>814</b>. Some of the features of the delivery device <b>804</b> will now be described and additional features of the delivery device <b>804</b> may include those features shown and described with respect to delivery device <b>104</b>. For example, the delivery device <b>804</b> may include two anchoring forks <b>812</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">The receiving assembly <b>810</b> of the delivery device <b>804</b> may have a generally rectangular outer surface defining a generally solid volume with a bore <b>811</b> there through. The bore <b>811</b> may be positioned proximal to and in alignment with the tubular shaft <b>814</b> and may have an inner radius matching that of the tubular shaft <b>814</b> allowing for a smooth transition of devices from the receiving assembly into the tubular shaft. The receiving assembly <b>810</b> may include a seating cavity <b>813</b> at its proximal end for receiving and seating of other devices such as the driver assembly <b>842</b> or the injector <b>902</b>. The seating cavity <b>813</b> may be defined by an outer shell <b>815</b> that is substantially flush with the outer surface of the receiving assembly <b>810</b>. The shell <b>815</b> may include protrusions or recesses <b>817</b> on its inner surface, the protrusions or recesses <b>817</b> corresponding to protrusions or recesses on other devices. As such, these protrusions or recesses <b>817</b> may provide for a detent relationship between the delivery device <b>804</b> and other devices. The rectangular outer surface of the receiving assembly <b>810</b> may have a long side and a short side. The long side may be oriented parallel to a line connecting the forks <b>812</b> in turn aligning the seating cavity <b>813</b> with the forks <b>812</b>. As such, devices used with the delivery device <b>804</b> may be properly aligned relative to the forks <b>812</b> by positioning and seating them in the seating cavity <b>813</b>. Additionally shown on the outer surface of the receiving assembly <b>810</b> is a decorticator release button <b>819</b>. As shown, the button <b>819</b> may include slots on either side creating a cantilevered tab condition for the button <b>819</b>. As such, the button <b>819</b> may deflect about its proximal end when depressed. The button <b>819</b> may also include recesses or bumps on its surface for gripping. The button <b>819</b> may extend beyond the distal end of the receiving assembly <b>810</b> and may include an upwardly extending ridge <b>821</b>. The ridge <b>821</b> may be shaped and adapted to engage the decorticator <b>806</b> as described in greater detail below. There may be one button <b>819</b>, or two buttons <b>819</b>, one on each face of the receiving assembly <b>810</b>. Any number of buttons <b>819</b> may be included, for example in the case of a varying shaped receiving assembly, <b>810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref>, the chisel <b>808</b> may have a generally cylindrical cross-section forming a shaft <b>828</b>. The shaft <b>828</b> may have a radius substantially equal to the inner radius of the tubular shaft <b>814</b> portion of the delivery device <b>804</b> allowing for slidable insertion of the chisel <b>808</b> within the delivery device <b>804</b>. Alternatively, the radius of the shaft <b>828</b> may be smaller than the inner radius of the tubular shaft <b>814</b> providing for more play and adjustability of the chisel <b>808</b> and delivery device <b>804</b> relative to one another. The chisel <b>808</b> may include a single or doubly chamfered tip <b>830</b> at a distal end or may have a coped distal end. The chisel <b>808</b> may include a head or, in contrast to the chisel <b>108</b> described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the chisel <b>808</b> may not include a head as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref>. The chisel <b>808</b> may have an overall length slightly larger than the delivery device <b>804</b> so as to allow the chisel to be manipulated by its proximal end when sleeved within the delivery device <b>804</b>. Additional features of the chisel <b>808</b> may include those features shown and described with respect to chisel <b>108</b>. For example, similar to the chisel shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the chisel <b>808</b> may also include a longitudinally extending lumen <b>131</b>. A more detailed view of the chisel <b>808</b> and its chamfered tip <b>830</b> may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94A</figref>. As shown, the chisel <b>808</b> may include a circumferential bevel at its proximal end opposite the chamfered tip <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">In comparison to the use described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> above, it is noted that the chisel <b>808</b> may allow the option of inserting the chisel <b>808</b> prior to the delivery device <b>804</b> and sleeving the delivery device <b>804</b> over the chisel <b>808</b>. This is in contrast to the chisel <b>108</b>, with the head <b>132</b>, where the head <b>132</b> prevents the delivery device <b>104</b> from being sleeved over the chisel <b>108</b>. As such, the facet joint may be distracted by the chisel <b>808</b> initially allowing for smoother insertion of the delivery device <b>804</b>. Upon placement and proper positioning of the delivery device <b>804</b>, the chisel <b>808</b> may then be removed. Those of skill in the art will understand and appreciate that a chisel with a removable head may also be provided and may allow for either order of insertion of the delivery device <b>804</b> and chisel <b>808</b> and the removable head, once replaced, may then be used to more readily manipulate and properly position the chisel <b>808</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336">In some embodiments, the forks <b>812</b> at the distal end of the delivery device <b>804</b> may have a bull nose tip as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95A</figref>. This is in contrast to the relatively sharp tip shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> with respect to forks <b>112</b>. The use of a chisel <b>808</b> without a handle, which may allow for insertion of the chisel <b>808</b> prior to the delivery device <b>804</b>, may, in turn, allow for this bull nose tip because the facet joint may be distracted prior to insertion of the delivery device <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</figref>, the decorticator <b>806</b> may have a tubular shaft portion <b>834</b>, an abrasive distal end <b>836</b>, and a handle <b>838</b> at a proximal end. The tubular shaft <b>834</b> may have an inner radius substantially equal to the outer radius of the tubular shaft <b>814</b> of the delivery device <b>804</b> and may allow for sliding movement of the decorticator <b>806</b> along the length of the delivery device <b>804</b> and rotationally around the delivery device <b>804</b>. In some embodiments, the inner radius of the tubular shaft <b>834</b> may be slightly or substantially larger than the outer radius of the tubular shaft <b>814</b> of the delivery device allowing for more freedom of movement of the decorticator <b>806</b>. The abrasive distal end <b>836</b> may include serrated teeth as shown, or may include a more flat annular surface with a gritty surface. The handle <b>838</b> may include a generally cylindrically shaped knob with a gripping surface along its peripheral edge. The handle <b>838</b> may also include a cavity on its proximal face for receiving a distal end of the decorticator release button <b>819</b>. The cavity may thus create an inner cylindrical surface opposite the gripping surface of the handle <b>838</b>. The inner cylindrical surface may be beveled or may include a groove for receiving the tip of the ridge <b>821</b> extending upwardly from the release button <b>819</b>. As such, where the release button <b>819</b> is in its natural state, the ridge <b>821</b> may project into the groove or opposed to the beveled surface of the handle <b>838</b> preventing the decorticator from being advanced distally. Where the release button <b>819</b> is depressed, the ridge may be removed from the groove or beveled surface allowing the decorticator to advance freely. Additional features of the decorticator <b>806</b> may include those features shown and described with respect to decorticator <b>106</b>. For example, the decorticator <b>806</b> may alternatively be separate from the delivery device <b>804</b> and may be slidably inserted within the delivery device <b>804</b> similar to that shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 99-101</figref>, the delivery device <b>804</b> and a driver assembly <b>842</b> are shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</figref>, the driver assembly <b>842</b> includes a handle <b>844</b>, an implant shaft <b>846</b>, and implant holding arms <b>848</b>. The driver assembly <b>842</b> shown is holding an implant <b>154</b>. The handle <b>844</b> of the driver assembly <b>842</b> may have an outer surface defining a generally rectangular volume with a bore <b>843</b> there through. The bore <b>843</b> may have an inner diameter substantially equal to the inner diameter of the implant shaft <b>846</b> allowing for a smooth transition of devices passing through the driver assembly <b>842</b>. The handle <b>844</b> may have a necked down portion <b>845</b> at its distal end. The necked down portion <b>845</b> may have protrusions or recesses <b>847</b> on its outer surface corresponding to respective protrusions or recesses <b>817</b> on the inner surface of the shell <b>815</b> of the receiving assembly <b>810</b> on the delivery device <b>804</b>. As such, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 100 and 101</figref>, the driver assembly <b>842</b> may be sleevably positioned within the delivery device <b>804</b> to deliver an implant <b>154</b>/<b>854</b> to the facet joint. When fully advanced as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</figref>, the handle <b>844</b> may be seated securely in the seating cavity <b>813</b> of the receiving assembly <b>810</b> and anchored with a detent relationship. Additional features of the driver assembly <b>842</b> may include those features shown and described with respect to driver assembly <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">A more detailed view of the implant holding arms <b>848</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99A</figref>. As shown, the implant holding arms <b>848</b> may include a chamfered tip. Additional features of the arms <b>848</b> may include features similar to those shown and described with respect to arms <b>148</b> in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. For example, the inside surface of the arms <b>848</b> may include a longitudinal ridge <b>862</b> extending the length of the arms <b>848</b>. The arms <b>848</b> may also include a bull nose engagement feature <b>858</b> extending transverse to the longitudinal axis of the implant shaft <b>846</b> along the inside face of the arm <b>848</b>. Where the arms <b>848</b> are engaged with and holding the implant <b>154</b>/<b>854</b>, the longitudinal ridges <b>862</b> of each arm <b>848</b> may be positioned between upper and lower planar members of the implant <b>154</b>/<b>854</b> and the bull nose engagement features <b>858</b> may be positioned in the U-shaped receiving feature slots on the lateral edges of the implant <b>154</b>/<b>854</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">In contrast to the driver assembly <b>142</b> described above, in the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 102-105</figref>, the internal actuator <b>852</b> may be a separate device from the driver assembly <b>842</b>. That is, while the internal actuator <b>852</b> may still function by passing longitudinally through the driver assembly <b>842</b>, the internal actuator <b>852</b> may be a separate device with its own handle <b>853</b>. The internal actuator <b>852</b> may include a longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> and an internal rod <b>857</b>. The longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> may be cylindrically shaped with an annular cross-section. The shaft <b>855</b> may have an outer diameter substantially the same as or smaller than the inner diameter of the implant shaft <b>846</b> of the driver assembly <b>842</b>. The shaft <b>855</b> may extend from the handle <b>853</b> proximally to a distal end. The internal rod <b>857</b> may be positioned within the shaft <b>855</b> and also may extend from the handle <b>853</b> to a distal end. The internal rod <b>857</b> may include an engagement feature <b>859</b> at its distal end for engaging and holding the implant distractor <b>850</b>. This engagement feature <b>859</b> may be any shape and provide for any engagement known in the art from a hex, allen, phillips, star, square, sleeve, or other connection capable of transmitting longitudinal and/or rotational forces from the internal rod <b>857</b> to the implant distractor <b>850</b>. As shown, in one embodiment, the engagement feature <b>859</b> includes a collet type device that is described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109</figref> below. As shown, the internal rod <b>857</b> may sleevably receive the implant distractor <b>850</b>. The internal rod <b>857</b> may be sleevably positioned within the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b>, such that when the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> is in an advanced position over the end of the internal rod <b>857</b>, the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> causes a clamping force of the collet to restrain the implant distractor <b>850</b> against being dislodged from the collet. Each of the shaft <b>855</b> and the internal rod <b>857</b> may engage the handle <b>853</b> at their respective proximal ends. The handle <b>853</b> may be used to retract the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> along the length of the internal rod <b>857</b> thereby exposing the collet and reducing the clamping force. As such, when the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> is in a retracted position, an implant distractor may be inserted into and/or removed from the collet.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 104 and 105</figref>, the handle <b>853</b> may be a cylindrical/spherical handle or a T-type handle. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>, the cylindrical/spherical handle may include an outer cylindrical portion <b>861</b> capped at a proximal end by a first spherical portion <b>863</b>, the first outer cylindrical portion <b>861</b> being open at a distal end. The handle <b>853</b> may also include an inner cylindrical portion <b>865</b> capped at a distal end by a second spherical portion <b>867</b>, the inner cylindrical portion <b>865</b> being open at a proximal end. As shown, the proximal open end of the outer cylindrical portion <b>861</b> may be positioned opposing the distal open end of the inner cylindrical portion <b>865</b> and the inner cylindrical portion <b>865</b> may sleevably slide within the outer cylindrical portion <b>861</b>. The handle <b>853</b> may further include a collar <b>869</b> integral with the second spherical portion <b>867</b>, positioned concentrically to each of the outer and inner cylindrical portions <b>861</b>, <b>865</b> and extending distally away from the second spherical portion <b>865</b>. Those of skill in the art will understand and appreciate that the collar <b>869</b> could also extend in a proximal direction. In either case, the shaft <b>855</b> of the internal actuator <b>852</b> may be connected to the distal end of the collar <b>869</b> and extend distally there from. The internal rod <b>857</b> of the internal actuator <b>852</b> passing proximally through the shaft may sleevably penetrate the collar <b>869</b> and the second spherical portion <b>867</b>, extend through the handle <b>853</b> to the inner/distal surface of the first spherical portion <b>863</b>, and be coupled thereto. In addition, the first and second spherical portions <b>863</b>, <b>867</b> may have a biasing mechanism <b>871</b> positioned between them in the form of a spring, balloon, or other force inducing device. Those of skill in the art will understand and appreciate that the spherical portions <b>863</b>, <b>867</b> could be flat, concave, or otherwise shaped and are not limited to spherical shaped caps.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">In use, as understood by a review of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 103 and 104</figref>, a user may insert the internal actuator <b>852</b> through the driver assembly <b>842</b>, which is positioned and seated in the delivery device <b>804</b>. The internal actuator <b>852</b> may be used to advance and position the implant distractor <b>850</b> for advancement into the implant. Once properly positioned, the internal actuator <b>852</b> may be rotated via the handle <b>853</b> to advance the implant distractor <b>850</b>. In the cases of other implant distractors, the handle <b>853</b> may be otherwise manipulated to advance the implant distractor. Once the implant distractor is advanced and the implant is distracted, a user may compress the first and second spherical portions <b>863</b>, <b>867</b> toward one another against the force of the biasing mechanism <b>871</b> (e.g. by squeezing the handle with their hand). The inner cylindrical portion <b>865</b> of the handle <b>853</b> may retract relative to the outer cylindrical portion <b>861</b> causing the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> also to retract relative to the to the outer cylindrical portion <b>861</b>. This retracting motion relative to the internal rod <b>857</b> may cause the distal end of the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> to be retracted and expose the collet on the distal end of the internal rod <b>857</b>. As such, the clamping force of the collet on the implant distractor <b>850</b> may be reduced allowing for removal of the internal actuator <b>852</b>, while leaving the implant distractor <b>850</b> behine and in place in the implant. It is noted that the shaft portion <b>855</b> of the implant distractor <b>852</b> may include a keyway for engagement with the inner surface of the implant shaft <b>846</b> of the driver assembly <b>842</b>. As such, the shaft <b>855</b> of the internal actuator <b>852</b> may be prevented from rotating relative to the internal rod <b>857</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105</figref>, the T-type handle may have a cylindrical, rectangular, square, or other transverse cross-section, with a longitudinal axis extending generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the internal rod <b>857</b> and shaft <b>855</b> and forming a T-shape. The longitudinal cross-section of the handle <b>853</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105</figref>, may include a proximal portion <b>873</b> and a distal portion <b>875</b> connected at one end and separated by a gap <b>877</b>. The proximal portion <b>873</b> may be a relatively thick portion and the distal portion <b>875</b> may be relative thin. As such, the handle <b>853</b> may be squeezable and may provide a biasing force which works to maintain the gap <b>877</b> between the distal and proximal portions <b>873</b>, <b>875</b>. The handle <b>853</b> may also include a generally cylindrical or conical collar <b>879</b> positioned near the middle of the handle <b>853</b> along its longitudinal length. The collar <b>879</b> may be positioned parallel to and concentrically with the internal rod <b>857</b>. The shaft portion <b>855</b> of the internal actuator <b>852</b> may extend distally from the distal end of the collar <b>879</b>. The internal rod <b>857</b> may sleevably penetrate the collar <b>879</b> and the distal portion <b>875</b> of the handle <b>853</b> and may further be coupled to the proximal portion <b>873</b> of the handle <b>853</b> in a cylindrical bore <b>881</b>. A stop may be provided to prevent the internal rod <b>857</b> from passing proximally through the proximal portion <b>873</b> of the handle <b>853</b>. This may be in the form of a cap on the proximal portion <b>873</b> of the handle <b>853</b> covering the bore <b>881</b>, or the bore <b>881</b> may not pass all the way through the proximal portion <b>873</b> of the handle <b>853</b>. Alternatively, the internal rod <b>857</b> may be secured within the bore.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">In this embodiment, as understood by a review of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 103 and 105</figref>, the internal actuator <b>852</b> may be inserted through the driver assembly <b>842</b> and the implant distractor <b>850</b> may be advanced in the same or similar fashion as that described with respect to the internal actuator <b>852</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>. When the internal actuator is ready for removal, a user may compress the proximal <b>873</b> and distal <b>875</b> portions of the handle <b>853</b> toward one another against the biasing force by squeezing the handle <b>853</b>. The distal portion <b>875</b> of the handle <b>853</b> may retract relative to the proximal portion <b>873</b> causing the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> also to retract relative to the proximal portion <b>873</b>. This retracting motion of the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> relative to the internal rod <b>857</b> may cause the distal end of the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> to be retracted and expose the collet on the distal end of the internal rod <b>857</b>. As such, the clamping force of the collet on the implant distractor <b>850</b> may be reduced allowing for removal of the internal actuator <b>852</b>, while leaving the implant distractor <b>850</b> behind and in place in the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">Still another embodiment of a handle <b>853</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 106-108</figref>. In this embodiment, a gripping mass <b>883</b> with a knob <b>885</b> is shown. A knob <b>885</b> is positioned on the proximal end of the internal rod <b>857</b> via a bore <b>887</b>. The knob <b>885</b> may be affixed against relative rotation with the internal rod <b>857</b>. The gripping mass <b>883</b> may include a generally rectangular mass spaced from the knob <b>885</b> along the internal rod <b>857</b> and including a bore <b>889</b> for the internal rod <b>857</b> to pass there through. The bore <b>889</b> may sleevably receive the internal rod <b>857</b>. The gripping mass <b>883</b> and the internal rod <b>857</b> may form the shape of a T and the gripping mass <b>883</b> may be affixed to the proximal end of the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b>. The gripping mass <b>883</b> may be held apart from the knob <b>885</b> along the internal rod <b>857</b> by a biasing mechanism <b>891</b> in the form of a spring, balloon, or other known device.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">The implant distractor <b>852</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 106 and 107</figref> may be inserted through the driver assembly similar to that shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref> above. The implant distractor may be rotated or otherwise manipulated to advance the implant distractor <b>850</b>. Once the implant distractor is positioned, a user may grip the gripping mass <b>883</b> with their fingers and allow the knob <b>885</b> to settle into the palm of their hand. The user may then squeeze the knob <b>885</b> toward the gripping mass <b>883</b> depressing the biasing mechanism <b>891</b> between the two and retracting the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> along the internal rod <b>857</b> and causing the distal end of the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> to be retracted and expose the collet on the distal end of the internal rod <b>857</b>. As such, the clamping force of the collet on the implant distractor <b>850</b> may be reduced allowing for removal of the internal actuator <b>852</b>, while leaving the implant distractor <b>850</b> behind and in place in the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 108</figref>, the engagement feature <b>859</b> at the distal end of the internal rod <b>857</b> may take the form of a collet <b>893</b> for holding the implant distractor <b>850</b>. The collet <b>893</b> may be affixed to the distal end of the internal rod <b>857</b> and may be adapted to hold the implant distractor <b>850</b>. Those of skill in the art will understand and appreciate that the collet <b>893</b> may be permanently affixed to the distal end of the internal rod <b>857</b> or may be interchangeably coupled thereto. Those of skill will further understand that several collet and chuck arrangements are known in the tool industry for receiving bits or other devices, which are within the scope of the invention. As shown, the collet <b>893</b> is extending slightly out of the distal end of the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> and is thus in position to receive an implant distractor or is in position to allow removal of the internal actuator <b>852</b> after placement of the implant distractor <b>850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">The collet <b>893</b>, positioned on the distal end of the internal rod <b>857</b> and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 108</figref>, may be seen more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109</figref>. In some embodiments as shown, the collet <b>893</b> may include a generally cylindrical body member <b>895</b> with four receiving fingers <b>897</b> equally spaced around a bore <b>899</b>. The body member <b>895</b> may be the internal rod <b>857</b> or may be a separate piece which is affixed to the end of the internal rod <b>857</b>. Each of the fingers <b>897</b> may extend distally from the body member <b>895</b> and be separated by slots <b>901</b>. The fingers <b>897</b> may extend laterally across approximately one quarter of a cylinder wall and may have constant thickness as they extend from the body <b>895</b>. Near the distal end of the fingers <b>897</b>, the outer surface of each finger <b>897</b> may be tapered up to define a thicker finger thickness and then tapered back down at the very distal end. As such, when the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> is advanced over the collet <b>893</b>, the tapered outer surface causes the fingers <b>897</b> to deflect inward creating a clamping force on the implant distractor positioned within the collet. Those of skill in the art will understand and appreciate that the collet may include as few as two fingers <b>897</b> and may include any number of fingers. The bore <b>899</b> defined by the fingers <b>897</b> may extend into the cylindrical body <b>895</b> a specified distance. At the transition <b>903</b> between the body <b>895</b> and fingers <b>897</b>, which location is defined by the depth of the slots <b>901</b>, the transition <b>903</b> defines a neck where a wider body portion <b>895</b> necks down to the finger portion <b>897</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 110</figref>, a cross-section of the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> is shown. As shown, the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b> may include an internal bore <b>905</b> at its distal end for receiving the internal rod <b>857</b> and the collet <b>893</b>. The internal bore <b>905</b> may be the same or similar to the bore extending the length of the longitudinal shaft <b>855</b>. The distal end of the bore <b>905</b> may include an outwardly beveled edge for riding along the beveled outer surface of the collet <b>893</b> when the longitudinal shaft is advanced and creates a clamping force on the collet. <b>893</b></p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 111-113</figref> an implant distractor <b>850</b> is shown. The implant distractor <b>850</b> may be a generally narrow element having a cylindrical body <b>907</b> which tapers to a point at a distal end. At a proximal end <b>864</b>, the implant distractor <b>850</b> may have a square cross-section and may include a circumferential groove <b>909</b> positioned just proximal to the distal end of the implant distractor <b>850</b>. This groove <b>909</b> may correspond to a protrusion or spring ball on the inner surface of the engagement feature <b>859</b> of the internal actuator <b>852</b> forming a detent connection between the engagement feature <b>859</b> and the implant distractor <b>850</b>. Alternatively or additionally, where a collet <b>893</b> is used the groove <b>909</b> may engage a feature inside the collet <b>893</b> so as to prevent the implant distractor <b>850</b> from inadvertently dislodging from the collet <b>893</b>. The square proximal end <b>864</b> may be isolated from the cylindrical body <b>907</b> by an annular stop ring <b>911</b>. The annular stop ring <b>911</b> may have an outer radius similar to the inner radius of the driver assembly <b>842</b>. This stop ring <b>911</b> may allow for sliding movement of the implant distractor <b>850</b> through the implant shaft <b>846</b> of the driver assembly <b>842</b>. The stop ring <b>911</b> may prevent over advancement of the implant distractor <b>850</b> by creating an abutting relationship between the distal face of the stop ring and the proximal edge of the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 112 and 113</figref>, the implant distractor <b>850</b> may include a generally continuous coil-shaped thread feature <b>866</b>. The thread feature <b>866</b> may have an abrupt proximal end <b>913</b> just distal to the annular stop ring <b>911</b> and may continue to the distal end of the implant distractor <b>850</b>. The thread feature <b>866</b> may gradually terminate at the distal end of the implant distractor <b>850</b> by gradually minimizing its cross-sectional profile. This may occur over several turns or in some embodiments, this transition may occur within a 180 degree turn. In other embodiments, this transition occurs between a 90 degree and a 180 degree turn. While the thread feature <b>866</b> is generally continuous, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 112</figref>, the thread feature <b>866</b> may be interrupted by at least one cross-cut <b>915</b> at one or more locations along the threaded feature <b>866</b>. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 112</figref>, a single cross-cut <b>915</b> may be positioned just proximal to the distal end. This cross-cut <b>915</b> may be positioned approximately 180 degrees out of phase from the abrupt proximal end <b>913</b> of the thread feature <b>866</b>. Both the cross-cut <b>915</b> and the abrupt proximal end <b>913</b> may provide for interlocking engagement of the implant distractor <b>850</b> with the implant <b>154</b>/<b>854</b> and thus prevent backing out of the implant distractor <b>850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 114-116</figref>, an injector <b>902</b> and delivery device <b>804</b> are shown.

The longitudinal delivery shaft <b>917</b> may have any cross-section and may have a cross-sectional size adapted to fit within the delivery device <b>804</b>. The longitudinal shaft <b>917</b> may have an opening <b>927</b> on its distal end for directing bone paste toward the lateral mass portion of a facet joint.

As shown, the seating feature <b>919</b> may include a necked down portion on its distal end which may be received by the shell portion <b>815</b> of the receiving assembly <b>810</b>. As with the driver assembly <b>842</b>, the seating feature <b>919</b> of the injector <b>902</b> may include protrusions or recesses <b>929</b> corresponding to protrusions or recesses <b>817</b> on the inner surface of the shell <b>815</b> allowing for a detent relationship for securing the injector <b>902</b> to the delivery device <b>804</b>. The seating feature <b>919</b> may have an orientation perpendicular to the orientation of the openings <b>927</b> at the distal end of the shaft <b>917</b> such that once in position, the openings <b>927</b> may direct bone paste or other material perpendicular to the facet joint surface along the spine and adjacent to the facet joint. The gripping feature <b>921</b> may be any shape and may be affixed to the proximal end of the shaft <b>917</b>. This feature <b>921</b> may include a gripping profile on its distal face for receiving 1, 2, or any number of fingers on one or either side of the shaft <b>917</b>. The gripping feature <b>921</b> may allow the user to grasp the injector <b>902</b> and squeeze the plunger handle <b>925</b> toward the gripping feature <b>921</b> thus advancing the internal piston and ejecting the bone paste or other material.</p>

<p id="p-0355" num="0354">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 117-120</figref>, another embodiment of an implant <b>854</b> is shown. The implant <b>854</b> may include upper <b>868</b> and lower <b>870</b> members. The members <b>868</b>, <b>870</b> may be generally planar and may also be generally rectangular. Each of the upper <b>868</b> and lower <b>870</b> members may include a proximal edge <b>872</b>, a distal edge <b>874</b>, and a pair of parallel lateral edges <b>876</b> extending longitudinally between the distal edges <b>874</b> and the proximal edges <b>872</b>. In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 117-120</figref>, the distal edges <b>874</b> of the members <b>868</b>, <b>870</b> may each include interlocking scissor features <b>931</b>. As shown, a portion of the member near the distal edge <b>874</b> of each member may be radiused and bend in the direction of the opposing member. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 118 and 119</figref>, an interlocking slot <b>933</b> may be provided extending laterally halfway across the member just proximal to the distal edge <b>874</b> and within the radiused bend portion of the member. In one embodiment, the width of the slot <b>933</b> may be generally similar in width to the distance from the distal edge <b>874</b> to the slot <b>933</b>. The slot <b>933</b> in the upper member <b>868</b> and lower member <b>870</b> may be positioned on the same side such that when one of the members is inverted, the slots may engage one another as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 120</figref>. The upper and lower members <b>868</b>, <b>870</b> may be welded together along an upper seam <b>935</b>, lower seam <b>937</b>, and/or a front seam <b>939</b>. Once interlocked, the planar members <b>868</b>, <b>870</b> may be biased by the connection at their distal edges <b>874</b> to be generally parallel to each other, the inner faces <b>878</b> of the planar members <b>868</b>, <b>870</b> facing each other in an opposed fashion and abutting or nearly abutting each other. It is noted that, while the interlocking slot <b>933</b> is shown extending anatomically laterally from the anatomical medial side of the upper member <b>868</b> and extending anatomically medially from the anatomical lateral side of the lower member <b>870</b>, the orientation of this slot may be reversed. This reversed orientation may provide resistance to shearing of the upper <b>868</b> and lower <b>870</b> members relative to one another upon receiving the implant distractor. That is, as the implant distractor is advanced into the implant <b>854</b>, it may be rotating in a clockwise fashion. When engaging the implant <b>854</b>, this rotation may have a tendency to cause the upper member <b>868</b> to shift laterally and to cause the lower member to shift medially. The reversed orientation may resist this shifting.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">Additional features of the implant <b>854</b> may include those features shown and described with respect to implant <b>154</b>. For example, a guide feature <b>884</b> may be included as shown. As an additional example, threaded slots <b>888</b> may also be included in each planar member <b>868</b>, <b>870</b> for receiving the coil-shaped thread feature <b>866</b> on the implant distractor <b>850</b>. In the present embodiment, one of the threaded slots <b>888</b> on one of the members <b>868</b>, <b>870</b> may be a truncated threaded slot <b>941</b> for engaging the cross-cut thread <b>915</b> or the abrupt proximal end <b>913</b> of the coil-shaped thread feature <b>866</b> and preventing unscrewing or backing out of the implant distractor <b>850</b> once advanced and positioned. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 118 and 119</figref>, each member <b>868</b>, <b>870</b> may have one truncated threaded slot <b>941</b> for engaging either a cross-cut thread <b>915</b> or the abrupt proximal end <b>913</b> of the thread feature <b>866</b>. As such, the implant distractor <b>850</b> may be held in place and prevented from backing out by both the upper and lower member <b>868</b>, <b>870</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">Those of skill in the art will understand and appreciate that the implant embodiments depicted herein may be made of several types of biocompatible materials including stainless steel, titanium, ceramics, nitinol, polymers, and other materials known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 121-128</figref>, another embodiment of a tool <b>1000</b> is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 121</figref> shows a chisel <b>1008</b>, a delivery device <b>1004</b>, a decorticator <b>1006</b>, a driver assembly <b>1042</b>, an internal actuator <b>1052</b>, an internal rod <b>1057</b> for the internal actuator <b>1052</b>, an injector <b>1102</b>, and a gripping tool <b>1001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 122</figref>, the chisel <b>1008</b> may have a generally cylindrical cross-section forming a shaft <b>1028</b>. The shaft <b>1028</b> may have a radius substantially equal to the inner radius of the tubular shaft portion <b>1014</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 123</figref>) allowing for slidable insertion of the chisel <b>1008</b> within the delivery device <b>1004</b>. Alternatively, the radius of the shaft <b>1028</b> may be smaller than the inner radius of the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> providing for more play and adjustability of the chisel <b>1008</b> and delivery device <b>1004</b> relative to one another. In some embodiments the shaft <b>1028</b> may have a radius ranging from approximately 1 mm to approximately 8 mm. In other embodiments, the shaft <b>1028</b> may have a radius of approximately 4 mm. The chisel <b>1008</b> may include a single or doubly chamfered tip <b>1030</b> at a distal end or may have a coped distal end or a combination of coping and chamfering. The tip <b>1030</b> may include a roughened surface on one or more sides to aid in anchoring or docking the chisel in the facet joint. Additionally, this roughened surface may allow for roughening or decorticating the inner surfaces of the facet joint. The tip <b>1030</b> may have a length <b>1037</b> adapted to extend substantially across the facet joint. As such, the length <b>1037</b> may be any length corresponding to the distance across a given facet joint. In one embodiment, the length <b>1037</b> may fall within a range from approximately 5 mm to approximately 35 mm long. In another embodiment, the length may fall within a range from approximately 10 mm to approximately 30 mm. In yet another embodiment, the length may fall within a range from approximately 14 mm to approximately 29 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">The chisel <b>1008</b> may include a head or, in contrast to the chisel <b>108</b> described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the chisel <b>1008</b> may not include a head as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 122</figref>. The chisel <b>1008</b> may have an overall length slightly larger than the delivery device <b>1004</b> so as to allow the chisel <b>1008</b> to be manipulated by its proximal end when sleeved within the delivery device <b>1004</b>. The chisel <b>1008</b> may have a coped proximal end <b>1033</b> as shown. The cope <b>1033</b> may occur on one or more sides of the chisel <b>1008</b> and may allow for easier grasping of the chisel <b>1008</b> with other tools. For example, a slap hammer may be used to grasp the chisel <b>1008</b> and hammer back on the chisel <b>1008</b> during removal. Additionally, a hemostat may be used to grasp, manipulate, or otherwise distance the surgeon's hand and/or body from the proximal end of the chisel <b>1008</b> to facilitate taking of x-rays. Further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 122</figref> is a horizontal bore <b>1035</b> for receiving a shaft portion of the gripping tool <b>1001</b>. As such, the gripping tool <b>1001</b>, may be inserted into the horizontal bore <b>1035</b> in the proximal end of the chisel <b>1008</b> forming a T-shaped grip that may be used to manipulate the chisel <b>1008</b> and/or remove the chisel <b>1008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">Additional features of the chisel <b>1008</b> may include features of the other chisels shown and described herein. For example, similar to the chisel shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the chisel <b>1008</b> may also include a longitudinally extending lumen. In this embodiment, the chisel <b>1008</b> may allow for insertion of a scope or flushing fluids as discussed above. Also, the chisel <b>1008</b> may allow for diagnostic processes. That is, the chisel <b>1008</b> may be positioned in a facet joint and a diagnostic balloon catheter may be inserted through the lumen of the chisel <b>1008</b> to distract the joint. Feedback from a consciously sedated patient may allow a provider to obtain information relating to symptom relief. As such, one or more joints may be reviewed diagnostically and thus may allow for treatment of one or several problematic joints with confidence that the proper joints are being treated. An exemplary diagnostic balloon catheter and method suitable for this application is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/110,548, entitled Cervical Distraction Method, filed on Apr. 28, 2008, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">In comparison to the use described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> above, it is noted that the chisel <b>1008</b> may allow the option of inserting the chisel <b>1008</b> prior to the delivery device <b>1004</b> and sleeving the delivery device <b>1004</b> over the chisel <b>1008</b>. This is in contrast to the chisel <b>108</b>, with the head <b>132</b>, where the head <b>132</b> may prevent the delivery device <b>104</b> from being sleeved over the chisel <b>108</b>. As such, the facet joint may be distracted by the chisel <b>1008</b> by inserting the chisel <b>1008</b> and tapping, hammering, or otherwise advancing the chisel <b>1008</b> into the facet joint. Once in place, the delivery device <b>1004</b> may be inserted. Upon placement and proper positioning of the delivery device <b>1004</b>, the chisel <b>1008</b> may then be removed. In another embodiment, a chisel with a removable head may also be provided and may allow for either order of insertion of the delivery device <b>1004</b> and chisel <b>1008</b>. In the case of inserting the chisel <b>1008</b> first, the removable head may initially be removed from the chisel <b>1008</b>. Once replaced, the removable head may then be used to more readily manipulate and properly position the chisel <b>1008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">In some embodiments, the forks <b>1012</b> at the distal end of the delivery device <b>1004</b> may have a bull nose tip as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 123</figref>. This is in contrast to the relatively sharp tip shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. The use of a chisel <b>1008</b> without a handle, which may allow for insertion of the chisel <b>1008</b> prior to the delivery device <b>1004</b>, may, in turn, allow for this bull nose tip because the facet joint may be distracted prior to insertion of the delivery device <b>1004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">In still further embodiments, the chisel <b>1008</b> may be radiolucent. That is, the chisel may be made of plastic or other material not reflected by an x-ray. This may allow for lateral fluoroscopy to more readily show the position of a chisel, delivery device, or other device in a contra lateral facet joint without obstructing the view.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 123</figref>, the delivery device <b>1004</b> may include a receiving assembly <b>1010</b> at a proximal end, anchoring forks <b>1012</b> at a distal end, and a generally tubular shaft <b>1014</b> defining a longitudinal axis and extending between the receiving assembly <b>1010</b> and the anchoring forks <b>1012</b>. The tubular shaft <b>1014</b> may have an annularly shaped cross-section with an inner radius and an outer radius, where the difference between the two radii defines a thickness of the tubular shaft <b>1014</b>. The delivery device may and all of the associated elements may be any size and may be adapted for the particular anatomy being addressed. In some embodiments, the outer radius of the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> may range from approximately 2 mm to approximately 8 mm. In some embodiments, the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> may have an outer radius of approximately 5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">Some of the features of the delivery device <b>1004</b> will now be described and additional features of the delivery device <b>1004</b> may include features of other delivery devices shown and described herein, such as, for example, the anchoring forks <b>1012</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">The receiving assembly <b>1010</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 123 and 123A</figref>, may have a generally smooth contoured outer surface that transitions from a generally rectangular cross-section at a proximal end to a narrower and generally circular cross-section at a distal end, the receiving assembly defining a volume with a bore <b>1011</b> extending there through. The bore <b>1011</b> may be positioned proximal to and in alignment with the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> and may have an inner radius matching that of the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> allowing for a smooth transition of devices from the receiving assembly <b>1010</b> into the tubular shaft <b>1014</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 123A</figref>, the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> may engage the receiving assembly <b>1010</b> with a dove tail connection <b>1017</b> around the periphery of the proximal end of the tubular shaft <b>1014</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 123A</figref> is a tapered entrance <b>1019</b> to the bore <b>1011</b> at its proximal end to facilitate ease of entry of other devices. The receiving assembly <b>1010</b> may include one or more seating cavities <b>1013</b> opening in a proximal direction for receiving and seating of other devices such as the driver assembly <b>1042</b> or the injector <b>1102</b>. These seating cavities <b>1013</b> may be defined by an outer shell <b>1015</b> that is substantially flush with the outer surface of the receiving assembly <b>1010</b>. The seating cavities <b>1013</b> may be positioned radially adjacent to the bore <b>1011</b>. In the present embodiment, two seating cavities are shown adjacent to the bore <b>1011</b> and on opposite sides of the bore <b>1011</b>. While not shown, the shell <b>1015</b> may include protrusions or recesses on its inner surface, the protrusions or recesses corresponding to protrusions or recesses on other devices. As such, these protrusions or recesses may provide for a detent relationship between the delivery device <b>1004</b> and other devices. Alternatively or in addition to the protrusions or recesses, the seating cavities <b>1013</b> may have an inner surface that tapers such that the cross-section of the cavity <b>1013</b> also tapers from a relatively broad cross-section at its proximal end to a relatively narrow cross-section at its distal end. As such, these seating cavities <b>1013</b> may provide for a friction fit between the receiving assembly <b>1010</b> and another device, where the other device may have a male portion with a shape corresponding to the shape of the seating cavity <b>1013</b>. The cross-sectional shape of the cavities <b>1013</b> may include a relatively trapezoidal shape with a concave base as shown, the base bordering along the perimeter of the bore <b>1011</b>. Any cross-sectional shape including square, rectangular, triangular, circular, or a more undefined random shape may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">The generally rectangular cross-section of the proximal portion of the receiving assembly <b>1010</b> may have a long side and a short side. The long side may be oriented parallel to a line connecting the forks <b>1012</b> in turn aligning the seating cavities <b>1013</b> with the forks <b>1012</b>. As such, devices used with the delivery device <b>1004</b> may be properly aligned relative to the forks <b>1012</b> by positioning and seating them in the seating cavities <b>1013</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">Just distal to the receiving assembly <b>1010</b>, a circumferential groove <b>1021</b> is shown on the tubular shaft <b>1014</b>. The groove <b>1021</b> may be adapted to aid in securing the decorticator (not shown), further described below. Alternatively, the groove <b>1021</b> may be adapted for gripping by a hemostat or other tool. For example, a hemostat may be used to hold the delivery device <b>1004</b> where the delivery device <b>1004</b> is being held in position for an x-ray and the practitioner or other user may be attempting to distance their hand from the x-ray field.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 123</figref> are the forks <b>1012</b>. These forks <b>1012</b> may be adapted to anchor the delivery device <b>1004</b> in the facet joint. As such, similar to the chisel <b>1008</b>, the forks <b>1012</b> may include a roughened or toothed surface. Additionally, the distal ends of the forks <b>1012</b> may be beveled to aid in advancing the tool through tissues and avoid snags. Moreover, the length <b>1023</b> of the forks <b>1012</b> may be adapted to extend substantially across the facet joint. As such, in one embodiment, the length <b>1023</b> of the forks <b>1012</b> may range from approximately 5 mm to approximately 35 mm. In another embodiment, the length <b>1023</b> may range from approximately 10 mm to approximately 30 mm. In still another embodiment, the length <b>1023</b> may range from approximately 14 mm to approximately 29 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref>, the decorticator <b>1006</b> may have a tubular shaft portion <b>1034</b>, an abrasive distal end <b>1036</b>, and a handle <b>1038</b> at a proximal end. The tubular shaft <b>1034</b> may have an inner radius substantially equal to the outer radius of the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b> and may allow for sliding movement of the decorticator <b>1006</b> along the length of the delivery device <b>1004</b> and rotationally around the delivery device <b>1004</b>. In some embodiments, the inner radius of the tubular shaft <b>1034</b> may be slightly or substantially larger than the outer radius of the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b> allowing for more freedom of movement of the decorticator <b>1006</b>. In some embodiments, the outer radius of the decorticator may range from approximately 2 mm to approximately 10 mm. In another embodiment, the decorticator may have an outer radius of approximately 6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">The abrasive distal end <b>1036</b> of the decorticator <b>1006</b> may include serrated teeth <b>1037</b> as shown, or may include a more flat annular surface with a gritty surface. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref>, the distal end of the tubular shaft portion <b>1034</b> is chamfered and the serrated teeth <b>1037</b> are located on the distal most end of the chamfered end allowing for a more directed and controllable decorticating process. As such, the decorticator <b>1006</b> shown is well suited for the intra facet process reflected by many of the embodiments described herein. That is, the human anatomy of the cervical spine may be such that the lateral mass of the facet joints are not perpendicular to the surface of the facet joint. Additionally, to properly place the forks <b>1012</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b> within the joint, the delivery device <b>1004</b> may be positioned substantially parallel to articular surfaces of the facet joint. As such, the delivery device <b>1004</b> may not be positioned perpendicular to the lateral masses of the facet joints and may actually be directed with a downward slope as it extends in the distal direction. Where the decorticator <b>1006</b> has an non-chamfered annular end, depending on anatomy, the decorticator <b>1006</b> may be able to be placed in contact with the superior lateral mass, but may be unable to reach or contact the inferior lateral mass. In the present embodiment, the chamfered end of the tubular shaft portion <b>1034</b> will allow the distal tip of the chamfered end to reach and decorticate the inferior lateral mass. This chamfered distal end may define an angle to the longitudinal axis. In some embodiments this angle may range from approximately 10 degrees to approximately 80 degrees. In other embodiments, this angle may range from approximately 30 degrees to approximately 60 degrees. In other embodiments, this angle may be approximately 45 degrees. Additionally, the teeth <b>1037</b> may be relatively large as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref>, or they may relatively small. Moreover, the teeth <b>1037</b> may extend along the full perimeter surface of the chamfered end rather being positioned solely at the tip of the chamfered end.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">Additionally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref> is a beveled edge <b>1039</b> along the periphery of the chamfered end. That is, along the ovular shape created by the chamfered tubular shaft portion <b>1034</b>, the edge is beveled. As such, when the delivery device <b>1004</b> is inserted into the patient and/or when the decorticator <b>1006</b> is advanced along the delivery device <b>1004</b>, the beveled edge <b>1039</b> may assist in avoiding tissue snags and the decorticator <b>1006</b> may be placed in contact with the lateral mass of the facet joints in a much smoother process and may avoid damage to neighboring tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373">The handle <b>1038</b> of the decorticator <b>1006</b> may include a generally cylindrically shaped knob with a gripping surface along its peripheral edge and may sleevably receive the tubular shaft portion <b>1034</b>. The handle <b>1038</b> may also include radially extending bores <b>1041</b> adapted to receive the gripping tool <b>1001</b>. The bores <b>1041</b> may extend from the outer surface of the handle radially inward and end at the outer surface of the tubular shaft portion <b>1034</b>. As such, one or several gripping tools <b>1001</b> may be inserted into any one or several of the bores <b>1041</b> in the handle <b>1038</b> and may provide for better control and a higher amount of torsional leverage when decorticating the lateral masses of the facet joint. Additionally, the gripping tool <b>1001</b> extending laterally from the handle <b>1038</b> may allow for malleting in the longitudinal direction of the decorticator <b>1006</b>. That is, the gripping tool <b>1001</b> may be inserted into the bore <b>1041</b> and the decorticator <b>1006</b> may be advanced to contact the lateral mass of the facet joint. A mallet may be used to strike the side of the gripping tool <b>1001</b> to cause forceful decortication of the lateral mass. The decorticator may then be retracted, rotated to a new radial position, advanced, and struck again for additional decortication. In some embodiments, the handle <b>1038</b> may be shaped relatively oblong so as to provide a mass of material that extends laterally away from the longitudinal axis of the decorticator <b>1006</b>. In this embodiment, the bore <b>1041</b> may not be a radial bore <b>1041</b>, but may be offset from the passing through the center point of the decorticator <b>1006</b> a distance equal to or greater than a radius of the tubular shaft portion <b>1034</b>. As such, the bore may pass all the way through the handle without encountering the tubular shaft <b>1034</b>. Accordingly, the gripping tool may be inserted into the bore <b>1041</b> and extended all the way through the handle <b>1038</b>, allowing for additional ability to grip and/or mallet the gripping tool <b>1001</b> and manipulate the decorticator <b>1006</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">In still another embodiment, the bores <b>1041</b> may be positioned on the distal face of the handle <b>1038</b>. In this embodiment, the bores may receive the gripping tool <b>1001</b>, the tool being oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the decorticator <b>1006</b> and allowing for malleting the proximal end of the gripping tool <b>1001</b> to decorticate the lateral mass. In still another embodiment a series of gripping tools <b>1001</b> may be inserted into a series of bores <b>1041</b> positioned on the distal face of the handle <b>1038</b>, each available to be used for malleting or manipulating the decorticator <b>1006</b>. In still another embodiment, a single malleting tool (not shown) may be included, which has a series of longitudinally extending rods each receivable by a series of bores <b>1041</b> on the distal face of the handle <b>1038</b>. At a positioned proximal to the receiving assembly <b>1010</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b>, the series of rods may converge to a centrally positioned malleting surface. As such, this malleting surface may be used to mallet the decorticator <b>1006</b> allowing for the force of the mallet to be positioned along the longitudinal axis of the decorticator.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">Additionally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref> is a radially extending threaded bore <b>1047</b> adapted to receive a corresponding threaded set screw. This threaded bore <b>1047</b> may extend from the outer surface of the handle <b>1038</b> radially inward through the wall of the tubular shaft portion <b>1034</b> allowing access to the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b>. The set screw may be advanced through the handle <b>1038</b> to engage the delivery device <b>1004</b> and prevent the decorticator <b>1006</b> from advancing or twisting inadvertently. As mentioned and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 123</figref>, the delivery device <b>1004</b> may include a groove <b>1021</b> on the outside surface of the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> for receiving the tip of the set screw or otherwise creating a catch point for the decorticator. As such, when the decorticator <b>1006</b> is in its fully retracted and most proximal position, the threaded bore <b>1047</b> and set screw may align with the groove <b>1021</b> in the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> and thus hold the decorticator <b>1006</b> in its most proximal position. The set screw may be a thumbscrew-type with a head that includes longitudinally extending ribs around its periphery for purposes of gripping the screw. Alternatively the head may be a wing nut type head for ease of setting and unsetting of the screw. In still another embodiment, the decorticator may have a relatively snug friction fit at the proximal end that engages the groove <b>1021</b> when retracted. In still another embodiment, the tubular shaft portion <b>1034</b> of the decorticator may include a protruding rib on its inside surface adapted to engage the groove <b>1021</b> on the tubular shaft <b>1014</b>. A key slot <b>1049</b> extending transversely across the threaded bore <b>1047</b> may also be provided. Additional features of the decorticator <b>1006</b> may include features of other decorticators shown and described herein. For example, the decorticator <b>1006</b> may alternatively be separate from the delivery device <b>1004</b> and may be slidably inserted within the delivery device <b>1004</b> similar to that shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 125</figref>, the driver assembly <b>1042</b> is shown. As shown, the driver assembly <b>1042</b> includes a handle <b>1044</b>, an implant shaft <b>1046</b>, and implant holding arms <b>1048</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">The implant shaft <b>1046</b> may have an outer radius substantially equal to the inner radius of the tubular shaft portion <b>1014</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 123</figref>) allowing for slidable insertion of the driver assembly <b>1042</b> within the delivery device <b>1004</b>. Alternatively, the outer radius of the implant shaft <b>1046</b> may be smaller than the inner radius of the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> providing for more play and adjustability of the driver assembly <b>1042</b> and delivery device <b>1004</b> relative to one another. In some embodiments the implant shaft <b>1046</b> may have a radius ranging from approximately 1 mm to approximately 8 mm. In other embodiments, the implant shaft <b>1046</b> may have a radius of approximately 4 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">The handle <b>1044</b> of the driver assembly <b>1042</b> may have an outer surface defining a volume with a bore <b>1043</b> extending there through. The bore <b>1043</b> may have an inner diameter substantially equal to the inner diameter of the implant shaft <b>1046</b> allowing for a smooth transition of devices passing through the driver assembly <b>1042</b>. The handle <b>1044</b> may have a generally rectangular shape at its distal end corresponding to the proximal end of the receiving assembly <b>1010</b>. The handle <b>1044</b> may include gripping slots <b>1051</b> near its distal end to aid users with gloves in securely holding the driver assembly <b>1042</b>. Additionally, these slots <b>1051</b> may aid a user in hold the assembly <b>1042</b> with a hemostat or other gripping device. Additionally, the handle <b>1044</b> may have a necked down portion <b>1045</b> at its distal end in the form of one or more projections. In one embodiment, the necked down portion <b>1045</b> may have protrusions or recesses (not shown) on its outer surface corresponding to respective protrusions or recesses on the inner surface of the shell <b>1015</b> of the receiving assembly <b>1010</b> on the delivery device <b>1004</b>. As such, the driver assembly <b>1042</b> may be sleevably positioned within the delivery device <b>1004</b> to deliver an implant to the facet joint. When fully advanced, similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</figref>, the handle <b>1044</b> may be seated securely in the seating cavity <b>1013</b> of the receiving assembly <b>1010</b>. Where protrusions are included on the necked down portion <b>1045</b> and recesses are included on the inner surface of the shell <b>1015</b>, the handle may be anchored with a detent relationship. The projections of the necked down portion <b>1045</b> of the handle <b>1044</b> may correspond to the seating cavities <b>1013</b> of the receiving assembly. Additionally, these projections may taper as they extend distally to provide a friction type fit into the seating cavities <b>1013</b> of the receiving assembly <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">The seating relationship provided by necked down portion <b>1045</b> of the driver assembly <b>1042</b> and the receiving assembly <b>1010</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b> may allow the user to control the placement of the implant in both a longitudinal and a rotational direction. That is, once the anchoring forks <b>1012</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b> are properly placed in the facet joint, proper placement of the driver assembly <b>1042</b> may then be ensured by aligning and seating the handle <b>1044</b> of the driver assembly <b>1042</b> in the receiving assembly <b>1010</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b>. Thus, the seating relationship may prevent the driver assembly <b>1042</b> from being inserted too far and may also allow the driver assembly <b>1042</b> to be aligned with the delivery device <b>1004</b> rotationally to ensure proper rotational orientation of the implant. Additional features of the driver assembly <b>1042</b> may include those features shown and described with respect to driver assembly <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0380">The implant holding arms <b>1048</b> may include features similar to other arms shown and described herein. For example, the inside surface of the arms <b>1048</b> may include a longitudinal ridge <b>1062</b> extending the length of the arms <b>1048</b>. The arms <b>1048</b> may also include a bull nose engagement feature <b>1058</b> extending transverse to the longitudinal axis of the implant shaft along the inside face of the arm <b>1048</b>. Where the arms <b>1048</b> are engaged with and holding the implant, the longitudinal ridges <b>1062</b> of each arm <b>1048</b> may be positioned between upper and lower planar members of the implant and the bull nose engagement features <b>1058</b> may be positioned in the U-shaped receiving feature slots on the lateral edges of the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">In contrast to the driver assembly <b>142</b> and consistent with the driver assembly <b>842</b>, each described above, in the present embodiment, the internal actuator <b>1052</b> may be a separate device from the driver assembly <b>1042</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 126</figref>, the internal actuator <b>1052</b> may include a longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> a handle <b>1053</b>, and an internal rod <b>1057</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 126-126B</figref>). The longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> may be cylindrically shaped with an annular cross-section. The shaft <b>1055</b> may have an outer diameter substantially the same as or smaller than the inner diameter of the implant shaft <b>1046</b> of the driver assembly <b>1042</b>. The shaft <b>1055</b> may extend from the handle <b>1053</b> proximally to a distal end. The internal actuator <b>1052</b> may be used in conjunction with the internal rod <b>1057</b> positioned within the shaft <b>1055</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">The internal rod <b>1057</b>, shown separately in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 127</figref>, may be positioned within the shaft <b>1055</b> and may extend from the handle <b>1053</b> to the distal end of the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b>. The internal rod <b>1057</b> may include an engagement feature <b>1059</b> at its distal end for engaging and holding the implant distractor. This engagement feature <b>1059</b> may be any shape and provide for any engagement known in the art from a hex, allen, phillips, star, square, sleeve, or other connection capable of transmitting longitudinal and/or rotational forces from the internal rod <b>1057</b> to the implant distractor. In one embodiment, the engagement feature <b>1059</b> includes a collet type device that is described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 127A</figref> below.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">The internal rod <b>1057</b> may sleevably receive the implant distractor. The internal rod <b>1057</b> may be sleevably positioned within the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b>, such that when the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> is in an advanced position over the end of the internal rod <b>1057</b>, the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> causes a clamping force of the collet to restrain the implant distractor against being dislodged from the collet. Each of the shaft <b>1055</b> and the internal rod <b>1057</b> may engage the handle <b>1053</b> at their respective proximal ends and be affixed there to. The shaft <b>1055</b> may be securely affixed to the handle <b>1053</b> such that rotational and longitudinal motion of the handle <b>1053</b> imparts the same motion on the shaft <b>1055</b>. In contrast, the internal rod <b>1057</b> may be slidably affixed to the handle <b>1053</b> such that rotational motion of the handle <b>1053</b> imparts the same motion on the internal rod <b>1057</b>, but longitudinal motion of the handle <b>1053</b> is isolated from the internal rod <b>1057</b> via a biasing mechanism. As such, the handle <b>1053</b> may be used to retract the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> along the length of the internal rod <b>1057</b> thereby exposing the collet and reducing the clamping force on the implant distractor, but when the handle <b>1053</b> is rotated, both the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> and internal rod <b>1057</b> rotate with the handle <b>1053</b>. When the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> is in a retracted position, an implant distractor may be inserted into and/or removed from the collet due to the reduced clamping force.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 126A and 126B</figref>, the handle <b>1053</b> may be a generally cylindrical shape with a cone shaped distal end and a relatively flat proximal end. As shown, the proximal end of the handle <b>1053</b> may include a circumferential ridge <b>1051</b> projecting proximally and extending along the periphery of the cylindrical shape. The inner face of the ridge may be braced by a plurality of radially spaced ribs <b>1061</b>. The center of the proximal end may include a button <b>1063</b> covered by a flexible membrane <b>1065</b>, the proximal end of the button <b>1063</b> being recessed slightly from the circumferential ridge <b>1051</b>, which protects the button <b>1063</b> against inadvertent triggering when the handle <b>1053</b> is being used to twist or turn the implant distractor. As such, the handle <b>1053</b> shown may reduce the chance that the implant distractor will become dislodged or released from the engagement feature <b>1059</b> of the internal actuator <b>1052</b> prior to being fully advanced and fully distracting the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">As shown in the cross-section of the handle <b>1053</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 126B</figref>, the button may be held in position by an internal spring <b>1067</b> or other biasing mechanism or device and may also include longitudinal keyways allowing for relative longitudinal motion of the button relative to the handle <b>1053</b>, but preventing relative rotational motion. In use, the implant distractor may be placed in the engagement feature <b>1059</b> at the distal end of the internal rod <b>1057</b> and the internal rod <b>1057</b> may be in position inside the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b>. As mentioned above, in the embodiment, shown, when the internal rod <b>1057</b> has a collet type engagement feature <b>1059</b>, the retraction of the internal rod <b>1057</b> within the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> may cause a circumferential clamping force from the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> onto the engagement feature <b>1059</b> of the internal rod <b>1057</b>, thereby securing the implant distractor in the engagement feature <b>1059</b> of the internal rod <b>1057</b>. Once assembled, the internal actuator <b>1052</b> may be inserted and advanced through the driver assembly <b>1042</b> positioning the implant distractor just proximal to the implant being held by the implant holder arms of the driver assembly. The handle <b>1053</b> may then be rotated to cause the implant distractor to advance into the implant thereby distracting the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">Once the implant distractor is fully advanced, the handle <b>1053</b> may be grasped and the button may be pressed, while pulling on the cone shaped portion of the handle <b>1053</b>, which may counteract the biasing force of the spring <b>1067</b> or other biasing mechanism and cause relative longitudinal motion between the internal rod <b>1057</b> and the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b>. Accordingly, the distal end of the internal rod <b>1057</b> may extend beyond the distal end of the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> and the clamping force on the engagement feature <b>1059</b> may be removed allowing the internal actuator <b>1052</b> to be removed leaving the implant distractor behind.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 127 and 127A</figref>, the engagement feature <b>1059</b> at the distal end of the internal rod <b>1057</b> may take the form of a collet <b>1093</b> for holding the implant distractor. The collet <b>1093</b> may be affixed to the distal end of the internal rod <b>1057</b> and may be adapted to hold the implant distractor. The collet <b>1093</b> may be permanently affixed to the distal end of the internal rod <b>1057</b> or may be interchangeably coupled thereto. Several collet and chuck arrangements are known in the tool industry for receiving bits or other devices and are within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">The collet <b>1093</b> may include any or all of the features of other collets shown and described herein. For example, the collet <b>1093</b> may include a generally cylindrical body member <b>1095</b> with four receiving fingers <b>1097</b> equally spaced around a bore <b>1099</b>. The collet <b>1093</b> may include as few as two fingers <b>1097</b> and may include any number of fingers <b>1097</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">In still another embodiment, a second internal actuator may be provided. This second internal actuator may include a handle securely affixed to a shaft and an engagement feature securely affixed to a distal end of the shaft. The engagement feature may correspond to the shape of the proximal end of the implant distractor. In one embodiment, this shape is a female square shape corresponding to a square shaped proximal end of the implant distractor. This engagement feature may include any shape known in the art as mentioned with respect to the engagement feature <b>1059</b> discussed above. This second internal actuator may be used to advance the implant distractor. For example, the second internal actuator may be used if the internal actuator <b>1052</b> were to lose its grip on the implant distractor. That is, if the collet loses its grip for any reason including deformation of the fingers of the collet or due to malfunction of the internal actuator <b>1052</b> for any reason, the second internal actuator may be used. The second internal actuator may be passed down the tubular shaft <b>1046</b> of the driver assembly <b>1042</b> to engage the proximal end of the implant distractor. The engagement feature on the distal end of the second internal actuator may be brought into engagement with the proximal end of the implant distractor and the second implant distractor may be used to rotate or otherwise advance the implant distractor thereby distracting the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 128</figref>, an injector <b>1102</b> is shown.

<p id="p-0398" num="0397">In use, the dilator set of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 129-135B</figref> may be used to dilate tissues to access a facet joint. That is, once an incision is made, the dilator rod <b>1202</b> may be advanced alone or over a guidewire through the tissues of the back up to and/or into the facet joint. Once the rod <b>1202</b> is in position, the small sleeve <b>1204</b>A may be advanced over the rod <b>1202</b> from the proximal end of the rod <b>1202</b> and may be advanced along the full length of the rod <b>1202</b>. The longer length of the rod <b>1202</b> may allow the rod <b>1202</b> to extend out of the proximal end of the small sleeve <b>1204</b>A such that control of both elements of the dilator set are maintained.

The handle <b>2032</b> can also include a malleting head <b>2031</b> for advancing the chisel <b>2008</b> via malleting.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 140-141</figref>, one embodiment of the malleting head <b>2031</b> is shown. The malleting head <b>2031</b> can include a cylindrical shaft portion <b>2051</b> and a flattened circular head portion <b>2053</b>. The cylindrical shaft portion <b>2051</b> can be sized for sleevable insertion into the proximal face of the handle <b>2032</b>. Additionally, the cylindrical shaft portion <b>2051</b> can include a key slot <b>2055</b> extending longitudinally along its length. The key slot <b>2055</b> can be adapted to receive a longitudinal rib on an inner surface of a bore extending through the handle <b>2032</b>. Accordingly, the malleting head <b>2031</b> can be prevented from twisting relative to the handle <b>2032</b> once assembled. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 141</figref> the malleting head <b>2031</b> can include a flattened surface on the inner surface of the cylindrical shaft portion <b>2051</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 142</figref> the proximal end of the shaft portion <b>2028</b> of the chisel <b>2008</b> can include a corresponding flattened portion. Accordingly, once assembled, the shaft portion <b>2028</b> of the chisel <b>2008</b> can be prevented from twisting relative to the malleting head <b>2031</b>. The malleting head <b>2031</b> can also include a counter bored hold extending into the circular head portion <b>2053</b> and the proximal end of the shaft portion <b>2028</b> of the chisel <b>2008</b> can include a corresponding pilot hole. Accordingly, once assembled, a screw can be inserted in the proximal end of malleting head <b>2031</b> and can extend into the proximal end of the shaft portion <b>2028</b> of the chisel <b>2008</b> thereby securing the two portions to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 139A-139C</figref>, the proximal end of the shaft portion <b>2028</b> of the chisel <b>2008</b> can extend through the distal face of the chisel handle <b>2032</b>. The distal end of the malleting head <b>2031</b> can extend through the proximal face of the chisel handle <b>2032</b> until the bottom face of the circular head abuts the proximal surface of the handle <b>2032</b>. The proximal end of the shaft portion <b>2028</b> can be sleevably positioned within the cylindrical shaft portion <b>2051</b> of the malleting head <b>2031</b> and a screw can secure the malleting head <b>2031</b> to the shaft portion <b>2028</b> of the chisel <b>2008</b>. In alternative embodiments, the shaft portion <b>2028</b> can be integral with the malleting head such that the two portions of the chisel are monolithic. It is noted, in the embodiment described, that once assembled, the malleting head <b>2031</b> can extend beyond the base of the slot cavity of the handle <b>2032</b>. The malleting head <b>2031</b>, being positioned on the proximal face of the handle <b>2032</b> and being directly attached to the shaft portion, can provide for forces from malleting the head <b>2031</b> of the chisel <b>2008</b> to transfer directly down the shaft portion <b>2028</b> of the chisel. Moreover, the distal end of the malleting head <b>2031</b>, extending slightly beyond the base of the slot cavity, can allow the malleting head <b>2031</b> to directly abut the malleting anvil <b>2041</b> of the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> when the chisel <b>2008</b> is inserted into the deliver device <b>2004</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 144</figref>. As such, when the malleting head <b>2031</b> of the chisel <b>2008</b> is struck, any advancing force of the chisel <b>2008</b> relative to the delivery device <b>2004</b> can be resisted by the interaction between the malleting head <b>2031</b> and the malleting anvil <b>2041</b> thereby preventing relative advancing motion between the chisel <b>2008</b> and the delivery device <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 145 and 149</figref>, the distal end of the chisel <b>2008</b> is shown extending slightly beyond the distal tip of the delivery device <b>2004</b>. In some embodiments, the distal end of the chisel <b>2008</b> can be flush with the distal tip of the delivery device <b>2004</b> or it can extend up to approximately 6 mm beyond the end of the delivery device <b>2004</b>. In the embodiment shown, the distal end of the chisel <b>2008</b> extends approximately 2 mm beyond the end of the delivery device <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 149</figref>, the surfaces of the tip <b>2030</b> of the chisel can include a series of ridges <b>2033</b>. The ridges <b>2033</b> can be relatively sharp and can aid the user in roughening or decorticating the facet surfaces as the chisel <b>2008</b> is inserted and removed from a facet joint. The ridges <b>2033</b> can include a pattern adapted to maintain the chisel's position in a facet joint. In some embodiments, the ridges <b>2033</b> can include a sloping distal face and a relatively vertical (e.g., perpendicular to axis of chisel <b>2008</b>) proximal face. As the chisel <b>2008</b> is advanced, the surfaces in contact with the chisel <b>2008</b> may ride up along the sloping distal face until the chisel <b>2008</b> is positioned. The relatively sharp apex of the ridges <b>2033</b> formed by the sloping distal face and relatively vertical proximal face can function to hold the chisel in place. Moreover, the ridges <b>2033</b> can be arranged in a surface pattern suitable for holding the chisel <b>2008</b> in place. In one embodiment, the ridges <b>2033</b> can include a chevron pattern as shown. Patterns such as straight rows, diagonal rows, wavy rows, or other alternative patterns can be included.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 143</figref>, the distal end of the chisel can include a positioning opening <b>2059</b>. The positioning opening <b>2059</b> can extend transversely through the chisel <b>2008</b> and can be positioned near the proximal portion of the tip <b>2030</b> of the chisel <b>2008</b>. This opening <b>2059</b> can function to allow for longitudinal positioning of the chisel <b>2008</b> through lateral fluoroscopy. That is, the opening <b>2059</b> can be visible during lateral fluoroscopy due to the absence of material and the chisel <b>2008</b> can be advanced into a facet joint until the opening <b>2059</b> is at, near, or slightly beyond the posterior edge of the facet joint. It is noted that the position of the opening <b>2059</b> can be such that it aligns with a corresponding opening <b>2015</b> in the forks <b>2012</b> of the delivery device <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 138</figref>, the handle <b>2032</b> can include connection features <b>2043</b> on the necked down portion of the handle <b>2032</b>. The connection features <b>2043</b> can create a detent relationship between the handle <b>2032</b> and the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> of the delivery device <b>2004</b> such that the two elements can resist separation without some force being applied. The detent relationship can be created by protrusions as shown, which engage a lip around the proximal end of the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> or a recess on the inner surface of the receiving assembly <b>2010</b>. Alternatively, the detent relationship can be created by recesses for receiving protrusions positioned on the inner surface of the receiving assembly <b>2010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 139A-C</figref>, <b>159</b>, and <b>155</b>A-B, the connection feature <b>2043</b> can also take the form of a latch type feature. For example, the feature <b>2043</b> can be wedge shaped and adapted to engage a corresponding ledge on the inside of the receiving assembly <b>2010</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 155B</figref>. The connection feature <b>2043</b> can be positioned on a deflectable lateral side of the handle <b>2032</b> and the deflectable lateral side can include a push button for disengaging the connection feature <b>2043</b>. When the chisel <b>2008</b> is advanced into the delivery device <b>2004</b>, the deflectable lateral side of the handle <b>2032</b> can deflect to allow the connection feature <b>2043</b> to clear the opposing and corresponding ledge on the inside of the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> allowing the handle <b>2032</b> to snap into place in the receiving assembly <b>2010</b>. To remove the chisel <b>2008</b>, the push button can be depressed to clear the connection feature <b>2043</b> from the corresponding ledge and the chisel <b>2008</b> can then be removed. It is noted that a similar connection can be used on any of the handles or seating features described herein; particularly handles or seating features adapted to engage the receiving assembly <b>2010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">In this embodiment, the chisel <b>2008</b> may be engaged with the delivery device <b>2004</b> via a connection between the handle <b>2032</b> and the receiving assembly <b>2010</b>. In this embodiment, both the chisel <b>2008</b> and the delivery device <b>2004</b> may be introduced into the facet joint at the same time allowing for a one-step process of initially entering the facet joint rather than initially entering the joint with the chisel <b>1008</b> and then passing the delivery device <b>1004</b> over the chisel <b>1008</b> as with the tool <b>1000</b>. Once the chisel <b>2008</b> and the deliver device <b>2004</b> are properly positioned, the chisel <b>2008</b> may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 136</figref>, the tool <b>2000</b> can also include a place holding chisel <b>2009</b>. The place holding chisel <b>2009</b> can have a square cross-section adapted to be inserted into the delivery device <b>2004</b>. The diagonal dimension of the cross-section can be at least slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the delivery device <b>2004</b>. Alternatively, other cross-sections can be provided and can be adapted for insertion in the delivery device <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">The place holding chisel <b>2009</b> can be a radiolucent chisel and as such can be made from a radiolucent material such as plastic, PEEK, or a polyetherimide material such as, for example, Ultem&#xae;. Other radiolucent materials can be used. The place holding chisel <b>2009</b> may include a positioning marker <b>2011</b> adapted to assist the user in properly positioning the place holding chisel <b>2009</b>. The positioning marker <b>2011</b> can include a guide line, a mark, or another surface indication on the surface of the chisel <b>2009</b> for alignment with a portion of the delivery device <b>2004</b>. In one embodiment, as shown, the positioning marker <b>2011</b> can be in the form of a double triangle separated by an alignment line. The double triangles can be positioned to form an alignment line on the place holding chisel <b>2009</b> such that when the alignment line is aligned with the proximal end of the delivery device <b>2004</b> (e.g., the proximal face of the receiving assembly <b>2010</b>), the distal end of the chisel <b>2009</b> is properly positioned to extend slightly out the end of the delivery device <b>2004</b>. Additionally, where the alignment line is not aligned with the distal end of the delivery device <b>2004</b>, the triangles can function as arrows indicating which direction to move the chisel <b>2009</b>. That is, the triangle closest to the distal face of the receiving assembly, may indicate which direction to move the chisel <b>2009</b>. As also shown, the proximal end of the chisel <b>2009</b> can include a hole extending transversely there through. The hole can adapted to receive a transverse rod or shaft extending into the hole and/or through the hole. The rod or shaft and the chisel <b>2009</b> can form a T-grip or L-shaped grip for use in pulling on the chisel <b>2009</b> for removal.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 149</figref>, the distal tip of the place holding chisel <b>2009</b> can include a tip the same or similar to the chisel <b>2008</b>. For example, the chisel <b>2009</b> can include a coped and/or chamferred tip <b>2035</b> similar to chamferred tip <b>2030</b>. Additionally, the chisel <b>2009</b> can include ridges <b>2037</b> arranged in a pattern similar to that shown and described with respect to chisel <b>2008</b>. Additionally, the chisel <b>2009</b> can include a radiopaque portion <b>2039</b> adapted to allow recognition of the chisel's location while avoiding occlusion of the lateral view. The radiopaque portion <b>2039</b> can include a straight, round, square, or other shaped piece of material positioned near the distal end of the chisel <b>2009</b> for locating the distal end. As shown, the radiopaque portion <b>2039</b> can be embedded in the surface of the distal tip of the chisel <b>2009</b> to cause the location of the distal tip to be ascertainable from lateral fluoroscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">In use, the place holding chisel <b>2009</b> can be used as a place holder without occluding the lateral view of a chisel and delivery assembly positioned in a contralateral facet joint. That is, upon placement of the chisel <b>2008</b> and the delivery device <b>2004</b> in a first facet joint, the chisel <b>2008</b> may be removed and replaced with the place holding chisel <b>2009</b> where the forks <b>2012</b> of the delivery device <b>2004</b> maintain the position of the tool <b>2000</b>. The delivery device <b>2004</b> may also be removed and reassembled with the chisel <b>2008</b> once the place holding chisel <b>2009</b> is properly positioned. The delivery device <b>2004</b> and chisel <b>2008</b> may then be inserted into the contralateral facet joint or second joint. By replacing the chisel <b>2008</b> in the first joint with the place holding chisel <b>2009</b>, the location of the chisel <b>2008</b> and delivery device <b>2004</b> in the second joint may be more readily ascertainable using lateral fluoroscopy. That is, if a radiopaque chisel or delivery device was left in place in the first joint, the fluoroscopic view of the contralateral facet joint would be relatively occluded. Upon placing the delivery device <b>2004</b> properly in the second facet joint, the procedure above may continue. Upon completing treatment of the second facet joint, the delivery device <b>2004</b> may be sleeved over the place holding chisel <b>2009</b> still positioned in and holding the place in the first facet joint and the first facet joint may then be treated with the above procedure. It is noted that initial placement of the deliver device <b>2004</b> can be conducted with the place holding chisel <b>2009</b> rather than the chisel <b>2008</b> to avoid having to replace the chisel <b>2008</b>. Additional features of the chisel <b>2008</b> may include features of the other chisels shown and described herein. For example, an internal lumen may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 137 and 144</figref>, a delivery device <b>2004</b> is shown. The delivery device <b>2004</b> may include features the same as or similar to previously disclosed delivery devices. For example, the delivery device <b>2004</b> can include a receiving assembly <b>2010</b> at a proximal end and a pair of anchoring forks <b>2012</b> at a distal end with a generally tubular shaft <b>2014</b> extending there between. The delivery device <b>2004</b> can also include a malleting anvil <b>2041</b>. The malleting anvil <b>2041</b> can include a raised surface positioned on the proximal face of the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> adapted for contact with the distal end of the malleting head <b>2031</b> on the chisel <b>2008</b>, as described above, or on the driver assembly <b>2042</b>. As such, malleting on the proximal end of the chisel <b>2008</b> or the driver assembly <b>2042</b> can cause longitudinal forces along the length of the respective tool piece. These longitudinal forces can be transferred, at least partially, through the contact between the malleting head <b>2031</b> and the malleting anvil <b>2041</b>. Accordingly, relative motion between the respective tool piece and the delivery device <b>2004</b> can be prevented. As such, for example, the necked down portion <b>2045</b> of the driver assembly, can be prevented from wedging inside the receiving assembly and getting lodged or stuck therein. Moreover, at the distal end of the delivery device <b>2004</b>, the relative position of the distal end of the chisel <b>2008</b> or the driver assembly <b>2042</b> relative to the distal end of the delivery device <b>2004</b> can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 145 and 149</figref>, a distal tip of the delivery device <b>2004</b> is shown. As shown, the distal tip of the delivery device <b>2004</b> can include anchoring forks <b>2012</b>. As shown, and previously described, the forks <b>2012</b> can include teeth or ridges along their surface for decorticating the interior surface of the facet and for temporarily anchoring the delivery device <b>2004</b> therein. In this embodiment, the teeth or ridges can extend along and across the coped portion of the tubular shaft <b>2014</b> of the delivery device <b>2004</b>. This coped portion can be tapered to avoid hanging up on the lateral mass of the facet joint. That is, as the forks <b>1012</b> are inserted into the joint the outward sloping portion of the distal end of the delivery device <b>2004</b> can approach the lateral mass of the joint. Where the coped portion slopes too abruptly, the contact between the sloped surface and the lateral mass can limit how far the forks <b>2012</b> can be advanced into the joint. In some embodiments, the coped portion of the distal end of the delivery device <b>2004</b> can include a taper angle <b>2013</b> ranging from approximately 5&#xb0; to approximately 45&#xb0;. Preferably, the taper angle <b>2013</b> is approximately 7&#xb0; to approximately 15&#xb0;. The taper angle can be adjusted to accommodate several different types and/or areas of the anatomy and can thus also include angles outside the mentioned ranges. For example, use of the device in the lumbar region of the spine may involve the use of different angles.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 145 and 149</figref>, along the lateral side of the tubular shaft portion <b>2014</b> near the proximal end of the forks <b>2012</b>, the tubular shaft portion <b>2014</b> can include an alignment hole <b>2015</b>. This alignment hole <b>2015</b> can align with the positioning opening <b>2059</b> in the chisel <b>2008</b> and can be used with lateral fluoroscopy for properly advancing the delivery device <b>2004</b> and/or the chisel <b>2008</b>. As discussed with respect to the chisel <b>2008</b>, the delivery device <b>2004</b> can be advanced until the alignment hole <b>2015</b> is just outside, at, or just inside the posterior edge of the facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0415">In addition to the alignment hole <b>2015</b>, near the intersection of the forks <b>2012</b> and the tubular shaft portion <b>2014</b>, a bump or bull nose <b>2049</b> can be provided to further assist with properly placing the delivery device <b>2004</b>. The bump <b>2049</b> can be in alignment with the alignment hole <b>2015</b> and can serve a similar purpose as the alignment hole. Thus, the bump or bull nose <b>2049</b> can function to assist the user in properly advancing the delivery device <b>2004</b> where the alignment hole <b>2015</b> is blocked, or not provided, or in addition to the alignment hole <b>2015</b>. The bump <b>2049</b> can accentuate the location of the proximal end of the forks <b>2012</b> and the bumps position relative to the posterior edge of the facet joint can indicate to the user whether the forks <b>2012</b> are properly positioned. In some embodiments, the bump can also function to secure the forks <b>2012</b> in the facet joint. That is, as the delivery device <b>2004</b> is advanced into the joint, the bump or bull nose <b>2049</b> can be advanced just beyond the posterior edge of the articular surface of the facet joint. This articular surface can be relatively concave and the shape of the bump or bull nose <b>2049</b> can function to hook itself just inside the perimeter of the concave surface and resist withdrawal of the delivery device <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0416">The generally rectangular cross-section of the proximal portion of the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> may have a long side and a short side. The long side may be oriented perpendicular to a line connecting the forks <b>2012</b>. This may be in contrast to the previously described embodiments, where the long side was shown parallel to a line connecting the forks <b>2012</b>. In some embodiments, particularly where two contralateral facet joints are being treated, the shown orientation can assist in avoiding interference of adjacent handles. That is, the shown orientation can allow the forks of the delivery device <b>2004</b> to be inserted into the facet joint and the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> can maintain a vertical orientation relative to the patient allowing the nearby joint to be treated without interference with the receiving assembly <b>2010</b>. In the present tool assembly <b>2000</b>, the tool pieces adapted for insertion into the deliver device <b>2004</b> can also have a handle portion such as, for example, handle <b>2032</b> and/or <b>2044</b> that is oriented perpendicular to the chisel distal tip or the holding arms <b>2048</b> respectively. As such, devices used with the delivery device <b>2004</b> may be properly aligned relative to the forks <b>2012</b> by positioning and seating them in the seating cavities <b>2013</b> of the receiving assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 146</figref>, a decorticator <b>2006</b> is shown. The decorticator <b>2006</b> shown can include a malleting element <b>2038</b> at its proximal end and a series of decorticating teeth <b>2037</b> on a distal end. The malleting element <b>2038</b> and the teeth <b>2037</b> can be connected by a generally U-shaped and relatively thin longitudinally extending member <b>2034</b>. The malleting element <b>2038</b> can include a relatively thick generally U-shaped member. As shown, the malleting element <b>2038</b> and the longitudinal member <b>2034</b> can be aligned and adapted to receive a tube from the lateral side. That is, for example, the decorticator <b>2006</b> can be applied to the delivery device <b>2004</b> from the side rather than being sleeved over the delivery device as shown in previous embodiments. The malleting element <b>2038</b> can be used for forcibly advancing the decorticator <b>2006</b>. Accordingly, the malleting element can be a relatively thick element adapted to absorb and distribute a malleting force to the longitudinal member <b>2034</b>. The teeth <b>2037</b> can be the same or similar to the decorticating teeth previously described, such as, for example, the serrated teeth <b>1037</b>. The teeth <b>2038</b> can be positioned along all or a portion of the half annular shape formed by the distal end of the U-shaped longitudinal member <b>2034</b>. As with the decorticator <b>1006</b>, the present decorticator <b>2006</b> can include a chamferred distal end allowing for acute decortication by the teeth <b>2037</b> without interfering with adjacent or surrounding structures. For example, decorticator <b>2006</b> can allow for access to the inferior lateral mass without interference from the superior lateral mass of a facet joint due to the chamferred distal end and also due to the u-shape. The decorticator can include features that are the same or similar to the decorticators previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418">The malleting element <b>2038</b> can be used with a malleting tool <b>2001</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 136 and 150</figref>. As shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 136</figref>, the malleting tool <b>2001</b> can include a longitudinally shaped shaft with a U-shaped decorticator interface <b>2005</b> at one end and a chamferred tip <b>2003</b> at the other end. The decorticator interface <b>2005</b> can be adapted for positioning around the delivery device <b>2004</b> in a position just proximal to the malleting element <b>2038</b> of the decorticator. The u-shape of the decorticator interface <b>2005</b> may allow the malleting tool <b>2001</b> to be placed in position from the side of the delivery device and selectively used as required to forcibly advance the decorticator <b>2006</b>. The chamferred end of the tool <b>2001</b> can be held in position while the user mallets near the decorticator interface end causing the interface <b>2005</b> to contact the malleting element <b>2038</b> on the decorticator. The decorticator <b>2006</b> may then be retracted, rotated to a new radial position, advanced, and struck again for additional decortication. The tool <b>2001</b> may rotate with the decorticator <b>2006</b> or it may remain in a position convenient for malleting. In addition to malleting, the malleting tool <b>2001</b> can be used to assist in separating several tools. That is, in some cases, the handles of a given tool piece, for example, the handle <b>2032</b> of the chisel <b>2006</b> can be difficult to separate from the receiving assembly <b>2010</b>. As mentioned, the malleting tool can include a chamferred tip <b>2003</b>. The chamferred tip can be used to wedge between a given handle and the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> to assist in separating the devices.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 147 and 148</figref>, a driver assembly <b>2042</b> is shown. As shown, the driver assembly <b>2042</b> includes a handle <b>2044</b>, an implant shaft <b>2046</b>, implant holding arms <b>2048</b>, and an integrated internal actuator <b>2052</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">The handle <b>2044</b> of the driver assembly <b>2042</b> may include features the same or similar to previously described handles. In particular, the handle <b>2042</b> can include features the same or similar to the driver assembly handle <b>1042</b>. In the present embodiment, the handle can also include a slot cavity, similar to the chisel <b>2008</b>, for receiving and interfacing with the malleting anvil <b>2041</b> on the proximal end of the receiving assembly. Where the driver assembly <b>2042</b> is sleevably positioned within the delivery device <b>2004</b>, the necked down portions <b>2045</b> of the handle <b>2044</b> can be received into the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> and the slot cavity can be positioned around the malleting anvil <b>2041</b> on the proximal face of the receiving assembly. Similar to the chisel <b>2008</b>, the slot cavity on the handle <b>2044</b> can include a bearing surface <b>2047</b> for interfacing with the malleting anvil <b>2041</b>. In addition, the handle <b>2044</b> can include a malleting bar <b>2043</b> extending distally from a first side of the body of the handle, laterally across the width of the body of the handle, and then proximally to a second side of the handle. The malleting bar <b>2043</b> may allow for malleting of the driver assembly <b>2042</b> and the interaction of the bearing surface with the malleting anvil can function to prevent relative longitudinal motion between the driver assembly <b>2042</b> and the delivery device <b>2004</b> when malleting the driver assembly. Additionally, as described with respect to the chisel <b>2008</b>, the handle <b>2044</b> can include connection features <b>2043</b> providing for a detent relationship with the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> or the latch type connections can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">The integrated internal actuator <b>2052</b> can include features the same or similar to the internal actuator <b>1052</b>. In the present embodiment, the actuator can be integrated into the driver assembly <b>2042</b> and can be securably and pivotally positioned therein. For example, when compared to the internal actuator <b>852</b> and/or <b>1052</b>, the tubular shaft <b>855</b>/<b>1055</b> can be omitted and an internal rod <b>2057</b>, the same or similar to rods <b>857</b> and <b>1057</b>, can be positioned within the implant shaft <b>2046</b> of the driver assembly. As mentioned with respect to internal actuator <b>152</b>, the distal tip of the internal actuator can include flat screwdriver types, phillips head types, square drives, etc. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 148</figref>, the distal tip of the internal actuator <b>2052</b> can be a flat screwdriver type tip.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">The handle <b>2053</b> can be pivotally secured to the handle <b>2044</b> of the driver assembly <b>2042</b> allowing for pivotal motion of the handle <b>2053</b> relative to the implant shaft <b>2046</b> causing rotation of the internal rod <b>2057</b>. As shown, the handle <b>2053</b> can be positioned just proximal to the body of the handle <b>2044</b> and the malleting bar <b>2043</b> can extend around its perimeter. A gap may be provided between the malleting bar <b>2043</b> and the handle <b>2053</b> to avoid interference with the rotation of the handle <b>2053</b> and to avoid transferring malleting force through the internal actuator. The handle <b>2053</b> can be adapted to advance as it is turned and can further be adapted to properly advance the implant distractor <b>2050</b>. That is, the clearance provided within the handle <b>2044</b> can be such that a particular advancing distance of the handle <b>2053</b> will cause the handle <b>2053</b> to interact with or abut the handle <b>2044</b> preventing over-advancing the internal rod <b>2057</b> and the implant distractor <b>2050</b>. This allows the advancement of the implant distractor <b>2050</b> and the associated distraction of the joint with the implant to be reproducible and consistent. In one embodiment, the implant distractor <b>2050</b> is advanced to a point where a cross-cut of a thread feature on the implant distractor <b>2050</b> engages a truncated slot on the implant. In one embodiment, the implant distractor <b>2050</b> can be started in the implant by 1&#xbd; turns prior to insertion of the driver assembly <b>2042</b> in the delivery device <b>2004</b> where the leading portion of the thread feature on the implant distractor <b>2050</b> is engaged in the leading slot on the implant. The turning of the handle <b>2053</b> can then advance the implant distractor <b>2050</b> the remaining distance relative to the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">The implant holding arms <b>2048</b>, shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 149</figref> may include features similar to other arms shown and described herein. For example, an engagement feature <b>2058</b> similar to the bull nose engagement feature <b>1058</b> may be provided. In the present embodiment, the engagement feature <b>2058</b> can include a raised portion on the surface of the holding arms <b>2048</b> that can be adapted to be positioned in the U-shaped receiving feature slots on the lateral edges of the implant. The present embodiment can be contrasted with the arms <b>1048</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 125</figref>. As shown, the arms <b>2048</b> are adapted to be positioned within the implant and do not extend along side the implant. This can allow for a narrower transverse dimension and an overall smaller system. The arms <b>2048</b> can include steps as the arms transition from the implant shaft <b>2046</b> of the driver assembly to the arms <b>2048</b>. The step can be adapted to accommodate the thickness of one of the upper and/or lower members of the implant such that, when placed thereon, an outer surface of the implant can be relatively flush with the upper level of the step.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">The interaction of the driver assembly <b>2042</b> with the deliver device <b>2004</b> can function to properly position the implant. That is, both the alignment hole <b>2015</b> and the bump or bull nose <b>2049</b> can function to properly position the delivery device <b>2004</b> as described above. The driver assembly <b>2042</b> can include a length and handle engagement adapted to position the implant between the forks <b>2012</b> of the delivery device <b>2004</b> by fully inserting the driver assembly <b>2042</b> in the delivery device and engaging the connection features. Accordingly, the driver assembly <b>2042</b> can allow the implant to be positioned anterior to the alignment hole <b>2015</b> and/or the bumps <b>2049</b> of the delivery device <b>2004</b> and thus can be used to properly position the implant. This engagement of the handle of the driver assembly <b>2042</b> with the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> of the delivery device <b>2004</b> can simplify the delivery process. That is, once the delivery device <b>2004</b> is properly positioned, the mechanical engagement of the several pieces of the tool <b>2000</b> can control the proper position of the implant thereby simplifying and expediting the delivery and implantation process. The user can rely on the position of the delivery device <b>2004</b> for placement of the implant thereby minimizing time and/or adjustments to ensure that the implant is properly positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">Turning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 136 and 137</figref>, several views of an injector <b>2102</b> are shown. The injector <b>2102</b> may include features the same or similar to the injectors previously described. In particular, the injector <b>2102</b> can include features the same or similar to the injector <b>1102</b>. In the present embodiment, the injector seating feature <b>2119</b> can include connection features <b>2043</b> the same or similar to those described on the necked down portion of the handles of the chisel <b>2006</b> and the driver assembly <b>2042</b>. In addition, the seating feature <b>2119</b> of the injector <b>2102</b> can include a slot cavity for positioning around and receiving the malleting anvil on the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> of the delivery device <b>2004</b>. The plunger <b>2123</b> of the injector <b>2102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 151</figref>, can include a handle <b>2125</b>, a shaft <b>2127</b>, and a seal <b>2129</b>. The plunger <b>2123</b> can be advanced through the injector <b>2102</b> to eject bone paste or other materials into and/or around the facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426">It is noted that when comparing tool <b>1000</b> to tool <b>2000</b> at least two differences include the handle <b>2032</b> on the chisel <b>2008</b> and the integration of the internal actuator <b>2052</b> with the driver assembly <b>2042</b>. With respect to the chisel difference, the tool <b>2000</b> can be adapted for a one-step facet joint access process. That is, rather than first advancing the chisel <b>1006</b> and then sleeving the delivery device <b>1004</b> over the chisel, both the chisel <b>2008</b> and the deliver device <b>2004</b> can be advanced into the facet joint at the same time. With respect to the driver assembly difference, the tool <b>2000</b> can be adapted for a smaller diameter than the tool <b>1000</b>. That is, in integrating the driver assembly <b>2042</b> with the internal actuator <b>1052</b>, one of the concentric tubes, namely the tubular shaft <b>1055</b>, has been omitted. Additionally, the implant holding arms <b>2048</b> can be adapted to hold the implant from behind rather than from the sides. That is, the arms <b>2048</b> can pass within the implant and remain within the width defined by the implant. This allows the driver assembly <b>2042</b> to have a smaller size than the driver assembly <b>1042</b> and also allows the delivery device <b>2004</b> to have a smaller size than the delivery device <b>1004</b>. Accordingly, the driver assembly <b>2042</b> can have a radius of approximately 1 mm to approximately 5 mm. In a preferred embodiment, the driver assembly can have a radius of approximately 3 mm. Additionally, the delivery device <b>2004</b> can have a radius of approximately 1.5 mm to approximately 6 mm. Preferably the delivery device <b>2004</b> can have a radius of approximately 4 mm. In one embodiment, the delivery device <b>2004</b> can have a radius of approximately 5 mm for a majority of its length and can have a radius of 4 mm near the forks <b>2012</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 149</figref>, the outer surface of the delivery device <b>2004</b> can neck down at or near the alignment hole. This necked down portion can be by way of squaring off the outside surface of the forks such that the outside surface of the forks is not radiused like the outer surface of the shaft portion of the delivery device <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0427">Referring to FIGS. <b>152</b> and <b>153</b>A-C, an implant distractor <b>2050</b> is shown. The implant distractor <b>2050</b> can include features the same as or similar to the features of the implant distractor <b>850</b>. For example, the implant distractor <b>2050</b> can include a continuous coil-shaped thread feature <b>2066</b>. Additionally, the thread feature <b>2066</b> may be interrupted by at least one cross-cut <b>2115</b> at one or more locations along the threaded feature <b>2066</b>. In one embodiment, as shown, a single cross-cut <b>2115</b> may be positioned just proximal to the distal end. This cross-cut <b>2115</b> may be positioned approximately 180 degrees out of phase from the abrupt proximal end <b>2113</b> of the thread feature <b>866</b>. Both the cross-cut <b>2115</b> and the abrupt proximal end <b>2113</b> may provide for interlocking engagement of the implant distractor <b>2050</b> with the implant <b>154</b>/<b>854</b> and thus prevent backing out of the implant distractor <b>2050</b>. As shown, the implant distractor <b>2050</b> can include a slotted proximal end <b>2064</b> adapted to receive a flat screwdriver type distal end of the internal actuator <b>2052</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 148</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0428">The implant distractor <b>2050</b> can include a generally elongate cylindrical body <b>2107</b> adapted to be advanced between the upper and lower members of the implant causing them to distract. The distal tip of the cylindrical body <b>2107</b> can be tapered to accommodate initial engagement with the implant and the remaining portion of the cylindrical body <b>2107</b> can be generally elongate with parallel extending edges. Accordingly, a relatively uniform outward force can be induced by the implant distractor <b>2050</b> as it advances through the implant <b>2054</b>. It is noted that other distractors other than those with thread features can be included and can include alternative advancing mechanisms or can be forcibly advanced.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0429">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 156</figref>, an implant <b>2054</b> is shown. The implant may include features that are the same as or similar to the implants <b>154</b> and/or <b>854</b> described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-24</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 117-120</figref> respectively. The implant <b>2054</b> can be made from a variety of materials including stainless steel, tungsten, titanium, PEEK, and nitinol. Other suitable materials can be used. The material can be a malleable material and the combination of the material properties and the thickness can be adapted to allow the implant to conform to the shaped of the implant distractor and/or the articular surfaces of the facet joint. For example, the thickness of the upper and lower members <b>2068</b>, <b>2070</b> can range from approximately 0.05 mm to approximately 2 mm. In a preferred embodiment, the thickness can be approximately 0.38 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0430">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 157-162</figref>, several perspective views of an implant <b>2054</b> are shown. It is noted that the delivery tool has been omitted for clarity and the method/order of insertion of the implant and the distractor may be different from that depicted here. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 157</figref>, the implant <b>2054</b> is shown prior to insertion into a facet joint. The implant can include upper and lower planar members similar to that described with respect to implants <b>154</b> and <b>854</b>. The planar members can be generally parallel to one another. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 158</figref>, the implant <b>2054</b> can be inserted into a facet joint. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 159</figref>, an implant distractor can be advanced between the relatively planar members forcing the members apart and against the opposing surfaces of the facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0431">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 160A-C</figref>, the force of the distractor within the implant <b>2054</b> can cause the teeth of the implant to gain purchase in the facet joint surface and can further cause distraction of the joint. The relatively malleable nature of the implant <b>2054</b> can cause the implant <b>2054</b> to conform to the shape of either the implant distractor or the articular surfaces of the facet joint, or both, while still distracting the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0432">In the embodiment shown, the generally elongate implant distractor can be positioned generally centered across the width of the upper and lower members of the implant. Additionally as shown, the teeth of the implant can be positioned along the lateral edges of the implant. In this embodiment, as the implant distractor is advanced into the implant, the spreading force of the implant distractor can force the teeth of the implant into the opposing facet surfaces causing them to gain purchase therein as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 160A</figref>. The teeth can engage the bone substantially. In some embodiments, the teeth can be completely seated in the facet surfaces such that the upper and/or lower members abut the surface of the facet joint. The thread feature of the implant distractor can also engage the facet surfaces as it protrudes through the slots in the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0433">The separation force of the implant distractor can act near the center of the upper and lower members between the teeth of the implant. This spreading force can be counteracted by the naturally resistive force of the articular surfaces of the facet. In this embodiment, this naturally resistive force can act on the engaged teeth of the implant. The concurrent spreading force and opposing resistive force can thus function to form or bend the implant around the axis of the elongate implant distractor forcing it to generally conform to the shape of the implant distractor, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 160B</figref>. This forming can allow the center portion of the upper and lower member to more closely approach the articular surfaces of the facet joint rather than being held off from the articular surface by any remaining height of the teeth. Accordingly, the threaded slots in the upper and lower member can allow the thread feature of the implant distractor to project through and further engage the articular surfaces of the facet. It is also noted that to the extent the articular surface of the facet joint is concave across its lateral width, the forming of the implant can be emphasized. This is because the edges of the articular surface can continue to force the lateral edges of the implant around the implant distractor.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">In some embodiments, the implant distractor can be generally straight with a tapered tip or it can include a tapered tip transitioning into a relatively barrel-shaped mid section followed by a tapered trailing end. In either case, and as shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 160A</figref>, the outward forces of the implant distractor in conjunction with the compressive forces of the articular surfaces of the facet can cause the implant to conform to the shape of the implant in this direction also creating an generally elliptically shaped implant. Accordingly, and as shown by review of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 160A and 160B</figref>, the planar members of the implant <b>2054</b> can take on a doubly curved shaped corresponding to the shaped of implant and resembling the concave shape of the articular surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 161A and 161B</figref> show additional views of the implant <b>2054</b> reflecting a similar conforming transition between opposed planar members of the implant <b>2054</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 161A</figref>, and opposed doubly curved members of the implant <b>2054</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 161B</figref>. In these views, the facet joint has been omitted for clarity. As can be seen from a review of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 161B</figref>, the upper member of the implant <b>2054</b> can be concave and can form about the longitudinal axis of the elongate distractor. Additionally, as can be seen by viewing the longitudinal seam between the upper and lower member, the upper member and lower member can also form a relatively elliptical shape about an axis perpendicular thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0436">It is noted that alternative implant distractors can be used depending on the shape of the implant desired. For example, a broader implant distractor can be provided for broader joints to broaden the longitudinal cross-section of the implant and better distribute the compressive forces. The anterior to posterior profile of the implant distractor can be adjusted to reflect the shape of the articular surfaces of a particular joint thereby allowing the implant to do the same. Implant distractors that provide a relatively uniform expansive pressure to separate the upper and lower members can also be provided to cause the implant to more uniformly conform to the shape of the articular surfaces of a particular joint. These distractors can include fluid type distractors or other relatively uniform pressure devices.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0437">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 162</figref>, a mechanically tested implant is shown exhibiting the conforming properties described. That is, the implant has conformed under compressive pressure to reflect the shape of the implant distractor and/or the contour of the opposing surfaces of a facet joint. The implant exhibits a formed shaped around the longitudinal axis and an axis transverse thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0438">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 163-170</figref>, the dimensions of a particular embodiment of the tool are shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 163</figref> includes exemplary dimensions of an implant. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 164</figref> includes exemplary dimensions of a delivery device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 165</figref> includes exemplary dimensions of an implant distractor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 166</figref> includes exemplary dimensions of a chisel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 167</figref> includes exemplary dimensions of a place holding chisel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 168</figref> includes exemplary dimensions of a driver assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 169</figref> includes exemplary dimensions of a decorticator. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 170</figref> includes exemplary dimensions of a malleting tool. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 163-170</figref> reflect dimensions of just one example of an embodiment of a tool.

<p id="p-0440" num="0439">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 171-174</figref>, an additional embodiment of a chisel <b>2209</b> is shown. The chisel <b>2209</b> can be adapted to facilitate easier initial access of the facet joint. The chisel <b>2209</b> can include features the same or similar to previously disclosed chisels, for example, chisel <b>2008</b> and/or chisel <b>2009</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 171</figref>, the chisel <b>2209</b> can include a distal portion <b>2211</b> and a proximal portion <b>2213</b>. The combined length of the distal portion <b>2211</b> and the proximal portion <b>2213</b> can form the overall length of the chisel <b>2209</b>. The overall length of the chisel <b>2209</b> can be the same or similar to the length of the chisel <b>2009</b>. As such, when the distal tip of the chisel is in place in a facet joint within, for example, a delivery device <b>2004</b>, the distal end of the chisel <b>2209</b> can extend out of the distal end of the delivery device <b>2004</b> to allow for manipulation of the chisel <b>2209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 172</figref>, a close-up view of the distal portion <b>2211</b> of the chisel <b>2209</b> is shown. The distal portion <b>2211</b> can include a chamfered tip <b>2230</b> similar to the previously disclosed chamfered tips. However, the chamfered tip shown includes ridges <b>2037</b> on one face of the tip <b>2230</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 172</figref> and not on the opposing face as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 173</figref>. In some embodiments, ridges <b>2037</b> can be included on each face or may be omitted altogether. Where the ridges <b>2037</b> are omitted on one or both faces, resistance experienced by a user attempting to access a facet joint with the tip of the chisel <b>2209</b> may be minimized. However, the ability to decorticate the facet surfaces may also be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 172</figref>, the distal portion <b>2211</b> of the chisel <b>2209</b> can be a generally elongate and cylindrically shaped member with a longitudinal bore <b>2215</b> extending there through. The cylindrical cross-section of the distal portion <b>2211</b> can have a radius ranging from approximately 1 mm to approximately 6 mm. In other embodiments, the radius can range from approximately 3 mm to approximately 5 mm. In one embodiment, the radius can be approximately 4 mm. The bore <b>2215</b> can be sized and adapted to receive and pass through a needle. In some embodiments, the needle can be approximately a 12 GA to approximately a 28 GA needle. In other embodiments, the needle can be a gauge somewhere in between 12 to 28 or a gauge beyond 12 to 28. In one embodiment, the needle may be a 22 GA needle.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442">The bore <b>2215</b> can be generally centered in the circular cross-section of the distal portion <b>2211</b> and can extend from the transition between the proximal portion <b>2213</b> and the distal portion <b>2211</b> to the distal tip of the chisel <b>2209</b>. The bore can extend through the chamfered tip <b>2230</b> creating a notch <b>2217</b> in the chamfered tip <b>2230</b> at its distal edge. The bore <b>2215</b> can be exposed to the environment surrounding the chisel <b>2209</b> via a plurality of holes <b>2219</b> and/or a slot <b>2221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">The distal portion <b>2211</b> can have a length adapted to accommodate standard length needles. That is, the distal portion <b>2211</b> can have a length adapted to accommodate a 5&#x2033;, an 8&#x2033;, or a 10&#x2033; standard length surgical needle for example. In these embodiments, the distal portion <b>2211</b> of the chisel <b>2209</b> can have a length such that when the needle is inserted into the bore <b>2215</b> from the proximal end and the needle hub provided on the needle abuts the transition between the distal portion <b>2211</b> and the proximal portion <b>2213</b>, the distal tip of the needle can extend between approximately, 5 mm to approximately 35 mm beyond the distal tip of the chisel <b>2209</b>. In some embodiments, the length of the distal portion <b>2211</b> is such that a standard length needle can extend between approximately 15 mm to approximately 25 mm beyond the distal tip of the chisel <b>2209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 174</figref>, the proximal portion <b>2213</b> is shown. The proximal portion <b>2213</b> of the chisel <b>2209</b> can extend from the distal portion <b>2211</b> and be adapted for manipulating the distal tip of the chisel <b>2209</b>. The proximal portion <b>2213</b> can have a length adapted to extend from a delivery device <b>2004</b> when a delivery device is inserted over the chisel <b>2209</b>. In the present embodiment, the proximal portion <b>2213</b> includes a semi-circular cross-section and is generally solid. The cross-sectional shape can define an arcuate surface and a generally flat surface of the proximal portion <b>2213</b>. The arcuate portion can be a continuation of an arcuate &#xbd; of the distal portion <b>2211</b> and the flat portion can extend from the transition at approximately the mid-depth of the distal portion <b>2211</b> proximally to the proximal end of the chisel <b>2209</b>. The proximal portion <b>2213</b> can be hollow and/or can include alternatively shaped cross-sections. As shown, the proximal portion <b>2213</b>, near the transition to the distal portion <b>2211</b>, can include an entry feature <b>2223</b> adapted to receive a needle and facilitate advancing the needle into and through the bore <b>2215</b> of the distal portion. The entry feature <b>2223</b> can be centered on the proximal portion <b>2213</b> in alignment with the bore <b>2215</b> and can be in the form of a groove or trough in the flat surface of the proximal portion <b>2213</b>. The entry feature <b>2223</b> can extend from the transition proximally away from the transition and along the flat surface.</p>

Pursuant to the disclosure in that application, the access system may include one or more cannulas made of steel, titanium, or plastic. The initial facet joint access cannula may have a sharp spatula tip on the distal end. The spatula tip may have a flat configuration to enable access into the flat facet joint. Once the spatula tip achieves access into the flatly oriented facet joint, subsequent stylets and working instruments may be passed down this access channel to complete a distraction procedure. Alternatively the dilation set <b>1200</b> may be used. Alternatively, one or a plurality of the chisel and delivery devices described above may be used to access the joint. The distraction procedure may then begin.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0447">More particularly, initially, an incision may be made in the patients back. Tools known in the art may be used to create this incision and the dilator set <b>1200</b> may be used to open an access path through the tissues of the back as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0448">In the case of a tool <b>1000</b>, once an access path is created, the chisel <b>1008</b> described above may be advanced through the incision and the distal tip <b>1030</b> may be positioned adjacent the target facet joint. It is noted that chisel <b>1008</b> with an interior lumen may allow for visualization to be provided by including a scope within the chisel <b>1008</b>. Additionally, an incision in the facet joint capsule may be made prior to beginning the procedure, and thus prior to insertion of the chisel <b>1008</b>. Once the distal tip of the chisel <b>1008</b> is properly positioned adjacent the facet joint, the chisel <b>1008</b> may be inserted into the facet joint. The chisel <b>1008</b> may be used to decorticate the articular surfaces of the facet joint by manipulating the chisel <b>1008</b> within the joint. This may include tapping the chisel with a device such as a hammer, mallet, or other instrument to advance the distal tip <b>1030</b> of the chisel <b>1008</b> and may also include moving the proximal end of the chisel laterally from side to side, up and down, or rotationally, to decorticate the joint. The chisel <b>1008</b> may then be tapped into place anteriorly such that it extends substantially through the joint. Fluoroscopy from one or more directions may be used to verify the location of the chisel.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0449">The delivery device <b>1004</b> may be slidably advanced over the chisel <b>1008</b> and the forks <b>1012</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b> may be advanced into the facet joint. Additional fluoroscopy from one or more directions may be used to verify proper placement of the delivery device <b>1004</b> and forks <b>1012</b>. The chisel <b>1008</b> may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0450">An implant may be placed in the driver assembly <b>1042</b> and the implant and driver assembly <b>1042</b> may be slidably advanced through the delivery device <b>1004</b>. The forks <b>1012</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b> may be holding the facet joint slightly distracted. As such, the implant, in its relatively flat and parallel position, may slide relatively easily into the facet joint. To the extent that it does not, the proximal end of the driver assembly <b>1042</b> may be tapped to properly advance and position the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0451">The button on the handle <b>1053</b> of the internal actuator <b>1052</b> may be pressed to expose the engagement feature <b>1059</b> at the distal end of the internal rod <b>1057</b> of the internal actuator <b>1052</b> and the implant distractor may be placed therein. The button may be released causing at least the proximal end of the implant distractor and the engagement feature <b>1059</b> to be retracted within the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> of the internal actuator <b>1052</b> thereby causing a clamping force on the engagement feature <b>1059</b> and securing the implant distractor.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">The internal actuator <b>1052</b> may then be inserted into the proximal end of the driver assembly <b>1042</b> and advanced to a point just proximal to the implant. Once properly positioned, the handle <b>1053</b> may be rotated or otherwise actuated to advance the implant distractor into the implant thereby distracting implant and the facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0453">The button on the handle <b>1053</b> may be pressed again to expose the engagement feature <b>1059</b> at the distal end of the internal rod <b>1057</b> from the longitudinal shaft <b>1055</b> thereby reducing the clamping force of the engagement feature on the implant distractor and allowing for removal of the internal acuator, while the implant distractor is threadably engaged with the implant. Additionally, the distraction of the implant may cause the upper and lower members of the implant to clear the engagement features <b>1058</b> of the holder arms <b>1048</b> thus allowing the driver assembly <b>1042</b> to be freely removed from the delivery device <b>1004</b> leaving the implant and the implant distractor behind.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0454">The injector <b>1102</b> may be advanced through the delivery device <b>1004</b> and positioned adjacent to the facet joint. The handle <b>1025</b> of the plunger <b>1023</b> may be depressed thus advancing the plunger <b>1023</b> and ejecting the bone paste or other anchoring material. The injector <b>1102</b> may be removed. The delivery device <b>1004</b> may also be removed and the incision may be closed. The above procedure may be conducted to treat one or both contralateral facet joints.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455">An implant may additionally or alternatively be delivered with the tool <b>2000</b>. As discussed with respect the chisel <b>2008</b>, the delivery device <b>2004</b> and the chisel <b>2008</b> can be inserted in a one step process. That is, after the incision is made and the tissues of the back are properly dilated, the chisel <b>2008</b> and delivery device <b>2004</b> can be advanced into the facet joint. Once properly positioned, the chisel <b>2008</b> can be removed from the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> by prying it free with the malleting tool <b>2001</b> or using available push buttons. The removal of the chisel <b>2008</b> can prepare the tool <b>2000</b> for insertion of the driver assembly <b>2042</b>. Where contralateral facet joints are being treated, the placing holding chisel <b>2009</b> can be placed down the shaft of the delivery device <b>2004</b> and the delivery device <b>2004</b> can be removed. The delivery device <b>2004</b> and the chisel <b>2008</b> can then be inserted in the contralateral joint and once properly positioned, the chisel <b>2008</b> can be removed to prepare for insertion of the driver assembly <b>2042</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0456">In some embodiments, the chisel <b>2209</b> can be used to initially establish the location of the joint and the proper trajectory of the tool. In this embodiment, the chisel <b>2209</b> can be inserted toward a facet joint and be advanced to the lateral mass of the facet joint. This can be done prior to insertion of the tool as mentioned above. A needle can be inserted through the chisel <b>2209</b> and extended out the end of the chisel <b>2209</b>. The surrounding lateral mass can be probed with the needle to determine the location of the facet joint and the position and trajectory of the chisel <b>2209</b> can be adjusted until the needle enters the facet joint. Additionally, using lateral fluoroscopy, the needle can be used to determine if the trajectory of the entry is aligned with the slope of the facet joint. That is, if the needle enters the joint, but bends as it continues into and across the joint, the trajectory may not be aligned with the slope of the joint. The chisel trajectory can thus be adjusted, which may include adjusting the bodily entry point.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0457">When the proper trajectory and location are established, the chisel <b>2209</b> can be advanced over the needle and into the joint. To transition back to the tool <b>2000</b>, a series of dilation tubes can be used. That is, as mentioned, in one embodiment, the chisel <b>2209</b> can have a cross-section radius of 4 mm. A 5 mm radius tube can be advanced over the chisel <b>2209</b> and a 6 mm radius tube can be advanced over the 5 mm radius tube and the 5 mm radius tube can then be removed, leaving the 6 mm radius tube sleevably positioned over the 4 mm radius chisel <b>2209</b>. Dilations tubes similar to those described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 129-135</figref> can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0458">The one-step tool <b>2000</b> can thus be used by removing the chisel <b>2008</b> from the delivery device <b>2004</b> and the delivery device <b>2004</b> can be sleevably advanced over the chisel <b>2209</b> and within the 6 mm radius dilation tube and the forks <b>2012</b> can be advanced into the facet joint. The 6 mm radius dilation tube can be removed and the chisel <b>2209</b> can also be removed. To the extent decortication is desired, the chisel <b>2008</b> or <b>2009</b> can be inserted through the delivery device <b>2004</b> and the joint can be decorticated. Where contralateral joints are being addressed, the place holding chisel <b>2009</b> can be inserted in the joint to maintain the access to the joint without occluding fluoroscopic view of the contralateral joint.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0459">An implant, for example implant <b>2054</b>, can be positioned on the distal end of the driver assembly <b>2042</b> and the U-shaped receiving feature slots on the lateral sides of the implant can be positioned over the engagement features <b>2058</b>. It is noted that, when in position, the width of the driver assembly <b>2042</b> can be the same or similar to the width of the implant. This is in contrast to that, which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, for example, with driver assembly <b>142</b>. The upper and lower surfaces of the implant can be biased toward a parallel position and, as such, when placed over the distal end of the driver assembly <b>2042</b>, may provide a slight clamping force on the distal end of the driver assembly <b>2042</b>. In addition, an implant distractor such as, for example distractor <b>2050</b>, can be advanced slightly into the proximal end of the implant causing the continuous thread feature <b>2066</b> to engage the threaded slots of the implant and further secure the implant to the driver assembly. Moreover, this initial starting of the implant distractor <b>2050</b> in the implant <b>2054</b> can help avoid mis-threading of the distractor <b>2050</b>. In one embodiment, the implant distractor can be advance, for example, 2 turns into the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0460">Having placed the implant on the distal end of the driver assembly <b>2042</b>, the driver assembly <b>2042</b> and the implant can be advanced through the delivery device <b>2004</b> and the implant can be positioned in the facet joint. Rotation of the handle <b>2053</b> can cause rotation of the internal rod <b>2057</b> thereby causing rotation of the implant distractor <b>2050</b>. Accordingly, the thread feature <b>2066</b> can cause the implant distractor <b>2050</b> to advance relative to the implant <b>2054</b> thereby distracting the implant <b>2054</b> and, in turn, also distracting the facet joint. It is noted that distraction of the implant <b>2054</b> can cause the implant to be free from the engagement features <b>2058</b> on the distal end of the driver assembly <b>2042</b> and as such, once distracted, the driver assembly <b>2042</b> can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0461">In another embodiment, a tool <b>3000</b> may include some or all of the elements described with respect to tool <b>1000</b>. However, rather than combining the driver assembly <b>1042</b> and the internal actuator <b>1052</b>, as with tool <b>2000</b>, in this embodiment, the driver assembly <b>1042</b> may be omitted. In this embodiment of a tool <b>3000</b>, delivery of the implant may be conducted with the internal actuator <b>1052</b>. That is, the implant distractor may be initially partially engaged with or &#x201c;started&#x201d; in the implant sufficiently to hold the two together. This engagement may be due to the implant being biased to keep the upper and lower members in a parallel position thus creating a threaded and frictional resistance to separation of the implant and the implant distractor. Additionally or alternatively, this engagement may be due to engagement of a cross-cut thread on the implant distractor being engaged with a truncated threaded slot of the implant. Once the implant distractor is started in the implant, the implant distractor may be engaged with the engagement feature on the internal actuator <b>1052</b> thus stringing the internal actuator <b>1052</b>, the implant distractor, and the implant together. The internal actuator <b>1052</b> together with the implant distractor and the implant may then be advanced down the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b> in lieu of the driver assembly <b>1042</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0462">In this embodiment, the omission of the driver assembly <b>1042</b> may allow for smaller sized shafts of several devices similar to tool <b>2000</b>. In one embodiment, the outer radius of the tubular shaft <b>1014</b> of the delivery device <b>1004</b> may be approximately 4 mm and the outer radius of the decorticator may be approximately 5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0463">In still another embodiment, the several handles/seating features (e.g., <b>1044</b>, <b>2044</b>, <b>1119</b>) may include a slot opening on their distal end for use in separating the handles from the receiving assembly <b>1010</b>. That is, when the handles are engaged with the receiving assembly and the projections are seated in the seating cavities, the frictional/suctional fit of the handles in the receiving assembly may be difficult to separate. Accordingly, a slot opening on the distal end of the handles may be provided, which may provide for accessing the joint between the handles and the receiving assembly with a separation device which may assist in working the elements apart via prying, scissor action, or other known methods. Alternatively or additionally, the frictional engagement of the several handles in the receiving assembly may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0464">The delivery system disclosed herein is advantageous for at least the following reasons. First, the system facilitates delivery of an implant to a facet joint via a minimally invasive or percutaneous procedure, reducing the risk, surgical time and recovery time associated with the implantation of the implant in the facet joint. Accordingly, many of the dimensional characteristics associated with the delivery system, its components, and the implant are advantageous in that they facilitate or make possible the minimally invasive or percutaneous procedures described herein. Second, the system facilitates the implant being delivered while the patient is capable of providing verbal feedback as to the impact of the implant relative to symptoms being felt by the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0465">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 175-177</figref>, an implant is shown positioned between vertebral bodies of the lumbar spine and adapted for an interbody fusion. While the majority of this application has addressed the use of implants placed in one or more facet joints, the implants and delivery devices herein described can also be used in other joints of the spine. As shown, for example, the implant can be used where a disc has deteriorated and/or been removed from a spinal joint between vertebral bodies. In the case of a discectomy type procedure, the implants can be used after the disc has been removed to secure two adjacent vertebral bodies and maintain their separation. The currently described delivery tools and implants are not limited to use in the cervical or lumbar spine and further are not limited to facet joints or joints between vertebral bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0466">Discectomy type procedures are often performed from one of three different access points. In one procedure, the spinal column is approached from the posterior. In another procedure, the spinal column is approached anteriorly and in another, from the lateral side of the patient. Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 175</figref>, an implant procedure is shown where a posterior approach has been used. That is, where the discectomy is performed from the posterior, the implant can be delivered from the posterior as well. Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 176</figref>, an implant procedure is shown where a lateral approach has been used and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 177</figref>, shows the implant where an anterior approach has been used. It is noted that the implant can be delivered from any position and the delivery approach does not have to be consistent with the discectomy approach. That is, for example, if the discectomy is performed anteriorly, the implant delivery may be done anteriorly as well, but could also be performed posteriorly or laterally. However, it may be advantageous to use the same delivery approach as the discectomy for purposes of minimizing incisions.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0467">In any of the above approaches, the procedure to place an implant between vertebral bodies can be the same or similar to the procedure to place the implants in a facet joint. For example, the chisel <b>2008</b> and delivery device <b>2004</b> of tool <b>2000</b>, for example, can be advanced into the joint between vertebral bodies. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 175-177</figref>, this can be completed from one of several directions. The teeth of the chisel <b>2008</b> can be used to decorticate the joint as desired. Once properly positioned and decorticated, the chisel <b>2008</b> can be removed from the receiving assembly <b>2010</b> by prying it free with the malleting tool <b>2001</b> or using available push buttons. The removal of the chisel <b>2008</b> can prepare the tool <b>2000</b> for insertion of the driver assembly <b>2042</b>. Fluorscopy can be used to verify proper placement of the delivery device <b>2004</b> to ensure proper placement of an implant.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0468">An implant, for example implant <b>2054</b>, can be positioned on the distal end of the driver assembly <b>2042</b>. The U-shaped receiving feature slots on the lateral sides of the implant <b>2054</b> can be positioned over the engagement features <b>2058</b> and an implant distractor <b>2050</b> can be advanced slightly into the proximal end of the implant <b>2054</b>, for example, 2 turns into the implant. The driver assembly <b>2042</b> and the implant <b>2054</b> can be advanced through the delivery device <b>2004</b> and the implant <b>2054</b> can be positioned in the joint between the vertebral bodies. Rotation of the handle <b>2053</b> can cause rotation of the internal rod <b>2057</b> thereby causing rotation of the implant distractor <b>2050</b>. Accordingly, the thread feature <b>2066</b> can cause the implant distractor <b>2050</b> to advance relative to the implant <b>2054</b> thereby distracting the implant <b>2054</b> and, in turn, also distracting the joint between the vertebral bodies. It is noted that distraction of the implant <b>2054</b> can cause the implant to be free from the engagement features <b>2058</b> on the distal end of the driver assembly <b>2042</b> and as such, once distracted, the driver assembly <b>2042</b> can be removed. A similar procedure can be performed to place a second implant <b>2054</b>. While this procedure has been described with regard to tool <b>2000</b> and implant <b>2054</b>, any of the described tools and implants described can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0469">Some additional methods of use are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 178-185</figref>.

Inserting the delivery device can include inserting a chisel through the delivery device and tapping on the proximal end of the chisel to advance the chisel and the delivery device into the facet joint. Actuating the driver assembly can include turning a distractor knob on the driver assembly thereby rotating an internal actuator and advancing an implant distractor. The method can also include inserting an injector in the delivery device and delivering a bone paste to the implantation site. (<b>4008</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0471">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 179</figref>, in one embodiment, a method of distracting a facet joint of the spine can include dilating a path to a facet joint using a dilator set (<b>4010</b>), inserting a chisel into the facet joint (<b>4012</b>), advancing a delivery device over the chisel and inserting forks of the delivery device into the facet joint (<b>4014</b>), removing the chisel from the joint (<b>4016</b>), inserting a driver assembly with an implant into the delivery device, seating the driver assembly in the delivery device thereby positioning the implant between the forks of the delivery device and in the facet joint (<b>4018</b>), inserting an internal actuator into the driver assembly and advancing an implant distractor into the implant thereby distracting the implant (<b>4020</b>), actuating a button on the internal actuator thereby releasing a grip on the implant distractor and removing the internal actuator and the driver assembly (<b>4022</b>), and inserting an injector and injecting a flowable material into or around the facet joint (<b>4024</b>). In some embodiments, advancing the implant distractor can include turning a handle on the internal actuator thereby rotating an internal rod and threadably advancing an implant distractor.</p>
