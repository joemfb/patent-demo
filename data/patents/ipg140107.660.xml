<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A gas turbine engine oil system has an air-oil separator for removing air from an air/oil mixture. A breather tube is connected to an exhaust of the air-oil separator for receiving hot air removed from the air/oil mixture in the air-oil separator. The gas turbine engine oil separator exhaust is directed in a cooled oil collector to cause the oil mist remaining in the air at the exit from the engine air-oil separator to condensate. The oil condensate is returned back into the engine oil system.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The application relates generally to gas turbine engines and, more particularly, to turbine oil systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gas turbine engine oil systems ingest air in the bearing cavities, and thus a breather (also know as an air-oil separator) is provided to remove air from oil. The breather is vented to allow the air to escape. One problem is that oil mist and vapour remains in the vented air. Venting thus results in some oil loss. The oil loss can stain the engine or nacelle, pollute the environment and require larger oil reserve onboard engine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, there is a need to provide an improved gas turbine engine oil system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, there is provided a gas turbine engine oil system comprising an air-oil separator for removing air from an air/oil mixture, a breather tube connected to an exhaust of the air-oil separator for receiving hot air removed from the air/oil mixture in the air-oil separator, the hot air still carrying oil aerosol and vapour, an oil collector having an outer surface exposed to a coolant flow and an inner surface defining a cooled chamber, the breather tube extending upwardly into the cooled chamber of the oil collector, the oil collector having an internal volume for collecting oil condensate separated from the hot air discharged in the cooled chamber during engine running, the breather tube having multiple perforations distributed at different axial position along a distal end portion thereof to cause a two-way fluid exchange between the hot air inside the breather tube and cooler air in the cooled chamber outside the breather tube, an exhaust window defined in said oil collector for venting the air from the cooled chamber, and a drain in said oil collector for returning the oil condensate collected during engine running in the internal volume of the oil collector back into an engine gear box at engine shut down when air flow through the breather tube ceases.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a second aspect, there is provided a gas turbine engine oil system comprising a breather tube connected in fluid flow communication with a gas outlet of an air-oil separator, the breather tube receiving a flow of hot air separated from the oil in the air-oil separator, and an oil collector disposed downstream of the air-oil separator for recuperating at least a portion of the oil remaining in the flow of hot air vented from the air-oil separator, the oil collector comprising a cooled enclosure mounted about a delivery end portion of the breather tube in a coolant flow passage, the coolant flowing over the cooled enclosure causing the oil carried by the hot air flowing through an outlet of the breather tube to condensate in the cooled enclosure, the cooled enclosure having an oil drain and a gas exhaust.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a third aspect, there is provided a method of recuperating oil from a stream of hot air separated from an air/oil mixture in an air-oil separator of a gas turbine engine oil system, the method comprising: a) directing the stream of hot air from the air-oil separator to a secondary oil collector, b) cooling the hot air in the secondary oil collector to cause oil vapour contained in the hot air to condensate, and c) returning the oil condensate to the gas turbine engine oil system.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a turbofan gas turbine engine <b>10</b> of a type preferably provided for use in subsonic flight, generally comprising in serial flow communication a fan <b>12</b> through which ambient air is propelled, a multistage compressor <b>14</b> for pressurizing the air, a combustor <b>16</b> in which the compressed air is mixed with fuel and ignited for generating an annular stream of hot combustion gases, and a turbine section <b>18</b> for extracting energy from the combustion gases. The gas turbine engine includes a nacelle or outer casing <b>20</b> surrounding an inner casing <b>22</b> enclosing the core engine. The nacelle <b>20</b> is spaced from the inner casing <b>22</b> providing an annular bypass passage <b>24</b> for flow of air from the fan <b>12</b> to the exhaust of the engine, as depicted by arrows <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An accessory gear box (AGB) <b>28</b> driven by the high pressure rotor of the engine <b>10</b> provides drive for the engine accessories (not shown). The AGB <b>28</b> also provides a sump area for the engine bearing and gear scavenge oil to de-aerate. The AGB breather may comprises an air-oil separator <b>30</b> coupled to the gear box <b>28</b> to effectively remove the air from the oil before the de-aerated oil be returned back to the engine. For instance, the air-oil separator <b>30</b> could be of a centrifugal type. The separator <b>30</b> has an exhaust connected to a breather tube <b>32</b> for receiving a continuous breather flow containing the hot air removed from the engine oil during engine operation, as depicted by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This flow of hot air contains oil aerosols and oil vapour. As will be seen hereinafter, the oil aerosols and vapour present in the air-oil separator exhaust flow can be recuperated by cooling the separator exhaust flow in an air cooled oil collector <b>36</b> installed on the AGB breather line and returning the oil condensate back to the engine oil system at engine shutdown, thereby minimizing oil losses and preventing the release of oil mist into the environment. The oil collector <b>36</b> may be aerodynamically integrated in a trailing edge portion of an existing service strut <b>38</b> extending radially through the bypass passage <b>24</b> of the engine <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, the oil collector <b>36</b> comprises an oil reservoir or internal chamber <b>40</b> bounded by the opposed sidewalls <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the strut <b>38</b>, a forwardly facing internal partition <b>44</b>, and top and bottom walls <b>46</b>,<b>48</b> respectively corresponding to the radially inner and radially outer flow boundaries of the bypass passage <b>24</b>. The chamber <b>40</b> is cooled by the air flowing through the bypass passage <b>24</b> over the airfoil outer surface of the strut <b>38</b> (i.e. along sidewalls <b>43</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>). By positioning the oil collector in the bypass passage <b>24</b>, it is possible to benefit from the large amount of air flow in the bypass passage <b>24</b> to maintain the walls <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the chamber <b>40</b> at a cold temperature relative to the exhaust flow of the oil separator <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The breather tube <b>32</b> extends from the air-oil separator <b>30</b> vertically upwardly into the cooled chamber <b>40</b> of the oil collector <b>36</b>. A plurality of perforations or holes <b>50</b> may be defined in the upper end portion of the breather tube <b>32</b> to generate a two-way fluid exchange between the inside and the outside of the tube, due to the increasing static pressure along the tube <b>32</b> up to the discharge pressure at the top open end of the tube. Such a two-way fluid exchange enhances the separation of condensed oil particles and the heat transfer to the cooled walls <b>42</b><i>a, </i><b>42</b><i>b </i>of the oil collector <b>36</b>. The holes <b>50</b> may be provided in vertically spaced-apart rows defined in a forwardly facing half portion of the vertical section of the tube <b>32</b>. Various numbers of rows and holes per row can be provided. According to one embodiment, the total surface area of the holes <b>50</b> is twice the cross-sectional area (A<sub>tube</sub>=&#x3c0; D/4) of the tube passage. Also the top open end of the tube <b>32</b> is spaced from the top wall <b>46</b> of the chamber <b>40</b> by a distance positive but less than &#xbc; the inner diameter (D) of the tube <b>32</b>. Still according to a particular embodiment, the cross-sectional area of the tube passage (A<sub>tube</sub>) is approximately equal to the distance (L) between the lowermost row of holes <b>50</b> and the top open end of the tube <b>32</b> multiplied by the total [i.e. both sides summed up] gap (G) between the tube <b>32</b> and the sidewalls <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the oil collector <b>36</b> is provided with an exhaust window <b>52</b> facing in a downstream direction relative to the flow of air <b>26</b> in the bypass passage <b>24</b>. The exhaust window <b>52</b> may be provided in the form of a vertically elongated opening defined in the trailing edge of the service strut <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The window <b>52</b> opens to the bypass passage <b>24</b> to discharge the air separated from the oil in chamber <b>40</b> into the bypass flow <b>26</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, baffles or weir plates <b>54</b> may be provided inside the chamber <b>40</b> to prevent the oil condensate from flowing outwardly of the oil collector <b>36</b> through the exhaust window <b>52</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a drain <b>53</b> is provided for returning the oil condensate collected during engine operation in the chamber <b>40</b> back into the AGB <b>28</b> at engine shutdown. The drain <b>53</b> may be provided in the form of a small hole defined in the lower end of the vertical portion of the breather tube inside the chamber <b>40</b>. The continuous hot air flow through the breather tube <b>32</b> during engine operation prevents the separated liquid oil from being returned continuously into the AGB against the hot air flow exiting the AGB <b>28</b>. The oil liquid is thus collected in the chamber <b>40</b> and returned into the AGB via the breather tube <b>32</b> at engine shutdown (i.e. when the breather air flow ceases). However, it is understood that a separate drain could be provided to evacuate the oil collected in the chamber <b>40</b> independently of the breather tube <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, vortex generators <b>56</b> may be provided on the exterior of the strut <b>38</b> adjacent the lower and upper corners of the window <b>52</b> to provide a quadruple lensing effect on the air flowing over the trailing edge of the strut, thereby providing for a better blending of the air coming from the oil collector <b>36</b> into the air bypass stream <b>26</b>. As highlighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the upper vortex pair induces a downdraft onto the air flow discharged from window <b>52</b>, thus precluding the air flow to attach to the inner bypass duct wall. Likewise, the lower vortex pair induces an updraft precluding the air flow to attach to the outer bypass duct wall. Considering the four vortexes from another perspective, i.e. left pair and right pair, they generate lateral drafts which favour mixing of the air flow with the engine bypass air flow in a direction that does not intersect with a solid wall too soon. The inertia of heavier oil particles, if such particles escape the collector, determines the particle to travel as far as possible from the cores of the four vortexes thus being lensed in a narrow stream following the general engine bypass flow. The vortex generators <b>56</b> allow managing the breather exhaust wake to substantially avoid oil streaking in the bypass passage <b>24</b>. The vortex generators <b>56</b> may be provided in the form of triangular wing-like projections. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the vortex generators <b>56</b> are set at an angle &#x3b8; of about 10 degrees to the horizontal. As can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the vortex generators <b>56</b> project laterally outwardly beyond the maximum strut thickness by a distance (M), wherein M&#x3e;0.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In operation, the engine fan bypass flow stream <b>26</b> cools down the exterior of the oil collector <b>36</b>. The hot air exiting the engine oil separator <b>30</b> carrying oil aerosols and vapour is subject to cooling as the flow progresses through the vertical section of the breather tube <b>32</b> in the cooled internal chamber <b>40</b> of the collector <b>36</b>. As depicted by arrows <b>59</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, cooler air and oil mist is ingested through the first lower rows of holes <b>50</b> and mixes with the tube hot main stream <b>61</b> due to local static pressure. As depicted by arrows <b>63</b>, subsequent upper rows of holes <b>50</b> release progressively the hot air and oil mix into the air cooled chamber <b>40</b>. The progressive reduction in the main stream flow rate reduces velocity and increases the static pressure of the main stream <b>61</b> until the remaining flow is discharged at the upper open end of the tube <b>32</b>. The perforations or holes <b>50</b> are oriented away from the collector exhaust window <b>52</b> in order to force complex flow pattern in the chamber <b>40</b>. The complex flow pattern in the collector <b>36</b> increases the cooling of the collector content by convection over the cold walls of the collector, i.e. the wall of the service strut <b>38</b>. The cooling induces the condensation of the oil vapour on the existing oil aerosol, which result in larger droplets more likely to precipitate. The oil droplets will collect on the collector inner surface and flow gravitationally to the collector bottom. At engine shutdown, the oil collected during engine running (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) drains by gravity through the drain hole <b>53</b> of the vertical section of the breather tube <b>32</b> back into the engine oil separator <b>30</b>. The oil accumulated in the oil separator <b>30</b> is centrifuged back into the engine <b>10</b> during the following engine start. The blending of the oil collector <b>36</b> within the general aerodynamic shape of the service strut <b>38</b> minimizes impact on the overall strut drag. The vortex generators <b>56</b> control the spreading of the remaining oil aerosol as it exits the collector <b>36</b> through the exhaust window <b>52</b> and also reduce the service strut drag by reattaching the boundary layer on the strut trailing edge.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The provision of an oil collector on the engine breather line contributes to reduce pollution. It reduces the loss of the oil volatile phase, which reduces the rate at which the oil viscosity increases with the usage. It may also contribute to reduce the engine oil reserve, thus, the engine oil tank weight. It can also reduce the cost of maintenance by reducing the oil consumption and increasing the servicing periods.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The above description is meant to be exemplary only, and one skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made to the embodiments described without departing from the scope of the invention disclosed. For example, the oil collector could be positioned at other locations in the engine. A vertical section of the tube <b>32</b> could be provided with a diffuser. The oil collector could be integrated to other parts of the engine. Additional baffles may be utilized to reduce the flow of accumulated oil to the exhaust window during flight in turbulent atmosphere causing negative vertical acceleration applied to the engine. Still other modifications which fall within the scope of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art, in light of a review of this disclosure, and such modifications are intended to fall within the appended claims.</p>
