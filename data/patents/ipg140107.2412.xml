<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. National Phase under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 of International Application PCT/JP2006/300017, filed Jan. 5, 2006, which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-002537, filed Jan. 7, 2005. The International Application was published under PCT Article 21(2) in a language other than English.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system, and more particularly, to a method for starting-up a SOFC system equipped with a reformer for reforming raw material for producing hydrogen such as a hydrocarbon fuel to produce a reformed gas containing hydrogen, and an SOFC which uses the reformed gas as a fuel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an SOFC, to generate electricity by the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen, a gas rich in hydrogen is fed to an anode of the SOFC. There is known an SOFC system including a reformer for reforming raw material for producing hydrogen such as a hydrocarbon fuel to produce hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reforming type includes partial oxidation reforming (POX), auto-thermal reforming (ATR) and steam reforming (SR). For example, taking up methane as an example of the raw material for producing hydrogen, in the steam reforming, methane is decomposed to produce hydrogen by the reaction represented by CH<sub>4</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2192;CO+3H<sub>2</sub>, and in the partial oxidation reforming, methane is decomposed to produce hydrogen by the reaction represented by CH<sub>4</sub>+1/2O<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;CO+2H<sub>2</sub>. In the auto-thermal reforming, both of these reactions take place.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the steam reforming, compared to the other reforming, a hydrogen concentration in a reformed gas produced is higher, and when it is applied to an SOFC system, higher electric generation efficiency is achieved. Since it has such advantage, an SOFC system including a steam reformer and an SOFC which uses the reformed gas produced by the steam reformer as a fuel has been developed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such an SOFC system is described, for example, in Patent Document 1.

</ul>
</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">However, the steam reforming reaction involves comparatively large heat absorption, and the reaction does not substantially take place unless at a comparatively high temperature. Therefore, at the starting-up, the steam reformer, especially a catalytic layer thereof is heated to a high temperature of, for example, about 600&#xb0; C. Further, the SOFC, at the starting-up, is heated to a high temperature of, for example, about 800&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">As described above, it is necessary to heat the SOFC system equipped with the steam reformer to a comparatively high temperature, and it is required to start-up the SOFC system efficiently in a short time.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide a method for starting-up a reformer efficiently in a short time without losing the advantage of the steam reforming that a comparatively high hydrogen concentration in a reformed gas can be achieved, and further starting-up an SOFC system efficiently in a short time.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">The present invention provides a method for starting-up a solid oxide fuel cell system which includes a reformer having a reforming catalyst, for reforming raw material for producing hydrogen to produce a reformed gas containing hydrogen, and a solid oxide fuel cell which uses the reformed gas as a fuel, wherein</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Raw Material for Producing Hydrogen</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0057">For the raw material for producing hydrogen, it is possible to use a material, as appropriate, selected from substances from which reformed gas containing hydrogen can be produced by the partial oxidation reforming method or the auto-thermal reforming method, and by the steam reforming method. For example, a compound of which molecule has carbon and hydrogen therein, such as hydrocarbons, alcohols and ethers, may be used. As a preferable example which may be inexpensively available for industrial use or consumer use, there may be methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, city gas, LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), gasoline and kerosene. Among them, kerosene is preferable, because it may be easily available for industrial use and consumer use, and easily handled.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Reformer</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0058">In the present invention, a catalyst having partial oxidation reforming function and a catalyst having steam reforming function are used as a reforming catalyst. A partial oxidation reforming catalyst having partial oxidation reforming function and substantially not having steam reforming function, and a steam reforming catalyst having steam reforming function and substantially not having partial oxidation reforming function may be used as the reforming catalyst. Alternatively, only an auto-thermal reforming catalyst having both of partial oxidation reforming function and steam reforming function may be used as the reforming catalyst described above.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0059">A reformer includes a reforming reaction part having the reforming catalyst and a vessel allowing a gas to flow for heating the reforming reaction part externally. For example, a reformer may be used which includes a reforming reaction tube having a reforming catalyst layer formed therein by filling the reforming catalyst as the reforming reaction part, and a vessel for containing this reaction tube therein. Further, the reformer may be configured in a manner that the reaction tube runs through the vessel. Further, a reformer may be configured in a manner that a combustor is provided inside of the reformer and outside of the reforming reaction part, and the reforming reaction part is heated by a combustion gas of this combustor. Alternatively, when a gas for heating can be fed from outside of the reformer, it is not necessary to provide such a combustor.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0060">The reformer is connected to a line for feeding a gas containing oxygen such as air, raw material for producing hydrogen and steam to the reforming catalyst, each of them separately, or mixed with each other as appropriate. Further, the reformer is connected to a line for feeding the reformed gas to an anode of the SOFC.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0061">For example, a reforming catalyst layer may be formed by filling a front part (upstream side) of the inside of the reforming reaction tube with the partial oxidation reforming catalyst, and filling a rear part (downstream side) thereof with the steam reforming catalyst. Alternatively, a reforming catalyst layer may be formed by filling the front part of the reaction tube with the auto-thermal reforming catalyst, and filling the rear part with the steam reforming catalyst. Further, a reforming catalyst layer may be formed by filling the inside of the reaction tube only with the auto-thermal reforming catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0062">In configurations as described above, a single reformer may be basically used, but the reformer is not necessarily required to be single, and a plurality of reformers having a different type of reforming catalyst from each other may be used. For example, a reformer (partial oxidation reformer) having a reforming catalyst layer composed of the partial oxidation reforming catalyst and a reformer (steam reformer) having a reforming catalyst layer composed of the steam reforming catalyst may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0063">As the partial oxidation reforming catalyst, the steam reforming catalyst and the auto-thermal reforming catalyst, a known catalyst may be used, respectively. As an example of the partial oxidation reforming catalyst, there may be a platinum-based catalyst, as an example of the steam reforming catalyst, a ruthenium-based catalyst and a nickel-based catalyst, and as the auto-thermal reforming catalyst, a rhodium-based catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0064">A temperature at which the partial oxidation reforming reaction can proceed is, for example, in the range of at least 200&#xb0; C. and at most 1000&#xb0; C., and a temperature at which the steam reforming reaction can proceed is, for example, in the range of at least 400&#xb0; C. and at most 1000&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0065">Now, in relation to each of the steam reforming and the auto-thermal reforming, conditions for normal operation will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0066">A reaction temperature of the steam reforming is, for example, in the range from 450&#xb0; C. to 900&#xb0; C., preferably from 500&#xb0; C. to 850&#xb0; C., and more preferably from 550&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C. An amount of steam introduced into a reaction system is defined as a ratio of the number of moles of water molecule to the number of moles of carbon atom included in the raw material for producing hydrogen (steam/carbon ratio). This value is preferably in the range from 0.5 to 10, more preferably from 1 to 7, and still more preferably from 2 to 5. When the raw material for producing hydrogen is liquid, a space velocity (LHSV) is expressed by A/B, where A (L/h) is a flow rate when the raw material for producing hydrogen is in a liquid state, and B (L) is a volume of the catalytic layer, and this value is preferably set to be in the range from 0.05 to 20 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, more preferably from 0.1 to 10 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and still more preferably from 0.2 to 5 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0067">In the auto-thermal reforming, besides steam, a gas containing oxygen is added to raw material. For the gas containing oxygen, pure oxygen may be used, but air is preferable because of easy availability. The gas containing oxygen may be added to balance the heat-absorbing reaction involved in the steam reforming reaction, and to generate heat in an amount sufficient to maintain temperatures of the reforming catalyst layer and the SOFC or to increase their temperatures. An amount of addition of the gas containing oxygen is preferably in the range from 0.05 to 1, more preferably from 0.1 to 0.75, and still more preferably from 0.2 to 0.6, as a ratio of the number of moles of oxygen molecule to the number of moles of carbon atom contained in the raw material for producing hydrogen (oxygen/carbon ratio). A reaction temperature of the auto-thermal reforming reaction is set to be, for example, in the range from 450&#xb0; C. to 900&#xb0; C., preferably from 500&#xb0; C. to 850&#xb0; C., and more preferably from 550&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C. When the raw material for producing hydrogen is liquid, a space velocity (LHSV) is selected to be in the range preferably from 0.1 to 30, more preferably from 0.5 to 20, and still more preferably from 1 to 10. An amount of steam introduced into the reaction system, as the steam/carbon ratio, is in the range preferably from 0.3 to 10, more preferably from 0.5 to 5, and still more preferably from 1 to 3.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">SOFC</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0068">An SOFC selected from known SOFCs may be used as appropriate. It may be tubular or planer.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0069">A temperature at which the SOFC can generate electricity is, for example, in the range of at least 500&#xb0; C. and at most 1200&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Components for SOFC System</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0070">A known component for an SOFC system including a reformer may be properly provided, as required. For a specific example, there may be a desulfurizer for reducing a sulfur concentration in the raw material for producing hydrogen, a vaporizer for vaporizing raw material for producing hydrogen when the material is liquid, means for feeding a gas containing oxygen such as air to the cathode of the SOFC, a steam generator for generating steam to humidify a gas fed to the reformer or the SOFC, a cooling system for cooling various devices such as the SOFC, pressurizing means for pressurizing various fluids such as a pump, a compressor and a blower, flow adjustment means or flow path blocking/switching means for adjusting a flow rate of a fluid or blocking/switching a fluid flow such as a valve, a heat exchanger for heat exchange and heat recovery, a vaporizer for vaporizing liquid, a condenser for condensing a gas, heating/heat-retaining means for externally heating various devices by steam etc., storage means for storing various fluids, an air system and an electric system for instrumentation, a signal system for control, a control device and an electric system for outputting and powering.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Starting-Up Method</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Step a) or i)</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0071">According to the present invention, first, a step a) or i) is carried out in which the temperature of the catalyst having partial oxidation reforming function is increased, by combustion heat or electricity, to a temperature at which the partial oxidation reforming reaction can proceed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0072">For the catalyst having partial oxidation reforming function, a partial oxidation reforming catalyst or an auto-thermal reforming catalyst may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0073">The combustion heat may be obtained by burning a combustible material in a combustor as appropriate. For example, the combustible material may be burned as appropriate, in the combustor to heat a catalyst by heat exchange with the combustion gas produced. To heat the catalyst with electricity, for example, an electric heater may be used. The reaction tube having the catalyst therein may be equipped with an electric heater, and the heater may be powered. Alternatively, when electric current can flow in the catalyst as a metal supported catalyst, the catalyst may be heated by powering the catalyst itself. These heating methods may be properly used together.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0074">Further, as required, the temperature of a water vaporizer or a vaporizer for vaporizing raw material for producing hydrogen may be increased by combustion heat or electricity to generate steam or vaporize the raw material for producing hydrogen.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Step b)</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0075">After the step a), a step b) may be carried out in which the partial oxidation reforming reaction takes place, so that the temperature of the catalyst having steam reforming function is increased by heat generated from the partial oxidation reforming reaction, and the temperature of the solid oxide fuel cell is increased by feeding the reformed gas to the anode of the solid oxide fuel cell.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0076">The steam reforming reaction may proceed along with the partial oxidation reforming reaction. That is, in this step, the partial oxidation reforming may be performed or the auto-thermal reforming may be conducted. Because the catalyst is heated by reaction heat in this step, in case of the auto-thermal reforming, the heat generated due to the partial oxidation reforming reaction is controlled to exceed the heat absorbed by the steam reforming reaction, and therefore, heat is generated in total. For the catalyst having steam reforming function, a steam reforming catalyst or an auto-thermal reforming catalyst may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0077">For example, when a front part of the inside of a reforming reaction tube is filled with the partial oxidation reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst), and a rear part thereof is filled with the steam reforming catalyst, the partial oxidation reforming reaction (it may be also the auto-thermal reforming reaction involving the steam reforming reaction) is caused to proceed in the partial oxidation reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst) and the reformed gas produced thereby is brought into contact with the steam reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst), whereby, the temperature of the steam reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst) can be increased. When, for the catalyst having partial oxidation reforming function and the catalyst having steam reforming function, only the auto-thermal reforming catalyst is used, then, heat is generated due to the partial oxidation reforming reaction in the auto-thermal reforming catalytic layer, and the heat can increase the temperature of the auto-thermal reforming catalytic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0078">Further, when a partial oxidation reformer and a steam reformer are used separately, the partial oxidation reformer may perform the partial oxidation reforming and the reformed gas which is at a comparatively high temperature by heat generated due to the partial oxidation reforming reaction may be fed to the steam reformer to heat the steam reforming catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0079">For performing the partial oxidation reforming (or the auto-thermal reforming), to the partial oxidation reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst), raw material for producing hydrogen and a gas containing oxygen are fed. For the auto-thermal reforming, steam is also fed to the reforming catalyst. Further, even for the partial oxidation reforming, as desired, steam may be fed to the reforming catalyst</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0080">In any case, the reformed gas which is obtained from the reformer and which is at a comparatively high temperature owing to the heat generated by the partial oxidation reforming reaction is fed to an anode of the SOFC to increase the temperature of the SOFC.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Step c)</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0081">If step b) described above is performed, a reformed gas is discharged from the anode of the SOFC. Therefore, preferably, the step b) is performed, and at the same time, the step c) may be performed in which the reformed gas discharged from the anode of the solid oxide fuel cell is burned, and with this combustion heat, the catalyst having steam reforming function (the steam reforming catalyst or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst) is heated. Using this combustion heat, also, the gas containing oxygen used for this combustion may be pre-heated, the SOFC may be heated, the raw material for producing hydrogen may be pre-heated or vaporized, and steam may be produced. Using the combustion heat described above, the steam reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst) may be heated and the gas brought into contact with the steam reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst) may be fed to the anode of the SOFC, and thereby, the combustion heat described above may indirectly heat the SOFC.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0082">In step c), a gas containing oxygen such as air may be fed to the cathode of the SOFC, and the reformed gas which passed through the anode and the gas containing oxygen which passed through the cathode may be reacted with each other to burn.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0083">For this burning, a combustor capable of burning a reformed gas may be used as appropriate. This combustor may be provided in a vessel for containing the SOFC or in the reformer.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Step ii)</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0084">Step ii) also may be performed, instead of the steps b) and c), in which the partial oxidation reforming reaction takes place, the temperature of the catalyst having steam reforming function is increased by heat generated due to the partial oxidation reforming reaction, the reformed gas is burned, and the temperature of the solid oxide fuel cell is increased by feeding the combustion gas to the cathode of the solid oxide fuel cell, and at the same time, the catalyst having steam reforming function is heated using the combustion gas produced from combustion of the reformed gas.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Step d) or iii)</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0085">According to the present invention, step d) or iii) is carried out for reducing the proportion of the partial oxidation reforming reaction or stopping the partial oxidation reforming reaction to perform the steam reforming, after the catalyst having steam reforming function is heated to a temperature at which the steam reforming reaction can proceed. If the proportion of the partial oxidation reforming reaction is reduced or set to be zero, the steam reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst) is kept to be heated with the combustion gas produced from combustion of the reformed gas in the step c) or the step ii) described above. By reducing the proportion of the partial oxidation reforming reaction, or preferably stopping the partial oxidation reforming reaction to perform the steam reforming, by the time when the starting-up operation is completed, a hydrogen concentration in the reformed gas can be increased to be comparatively high. For this, an amount of the gas containing oxygen such as air supplied to the reforming catalyst is reduced or set to be zero, that is, a ratio of O<sub>2</sub>/C (oxygen/carbon ratio) may be reduced, for example, to be smaller than 1 or to be zero from the range from about 1 to about 6, and an amount of steam supplied may be increased, that is, a ratio of S/C (steam/carbon ratio) may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0086">When the partial oxidation reformer and the steam reformer are used separately, the raw material for producing hydrogen etc. is fed to the partial oxidation reformer in step b) or ii), and the reformed gas produced by the partial oxidation reformer is fed to the steam reformer, then, in step d) or iii), the raw material for producing hydrogen etc. may not be fed to the partial oxidation reformer and may be fed to the steam reformer. That is, in step d), by switching a gas flow channel, usage of the partial oxidation reformer can be stopped. When the front part of the reaction tube is filled with the partial oxidation reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst), and the rear part thereof is filled with the steam reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst), then, by stopping supply of the gas containing oxygen to the reaction tube and starting or continuing with supply of steam, the partial oxidation reforming can be stopped and the steam reforming can be performed.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Step e) or iv)</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0087">Step e) or iv) may be carried out in which the solid oxide fuel cell generates electricity, so that the temperature of the fuel cell is increased by the cell reaction heat, after the fuel cell is heated to a temperature at which the fuel cell can generate electricity. This step is preferably performed because the SOFC can be further heated.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0088">Electric power generated at this step may be outputted to a power system when the SOFC is connected to the power system. Alternatively, the power may be used as power for auxiliary devices such as a pump, blower etc. in the fuel cell system.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0089">The partial oxidation reforming (or the auto-thermal reforming) can be started at a comparatively low temperature, and further, the reforming catalyst is directly heated due to the partial oxidation reforming reaction. Therefore, the temperature of the reforming catalyst can be increased efficiently in a short time. Further, after completion of the increase of the temperature, the steam reforming can be conducted solely, or if the partial oxidation reforming reaction is involved, the proportion of it can be reduced, and therefore, the hydrogen concentration in the reformed gas can be relatively high. Also, because the reformer is heated rapidly, and by heating the SOFC using the reformed gas of a high temperature obtained from the reformer, the SOFC can be also heated rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0090">At the beginning of step b) or ii), the temperature of the partial oxidation reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst), from the viewpoint of accelerating the partial oxidation reforming reaction, is set to be preferably not smaller than 200&#xb0; C., more preferably not smaller than 250&#xb0; C., and still more preferably not smaller than 300&#xb0; C. Further, the temperature, from the viewpoint of endurance of the catalyst or the vessel, is preferably not greater than 1000&#xb0; C., more preferably not greater than 900&#xb0; C., and still more preferably not greater than 800&#xb0; C. This is because the temperature is set to a temperature at which the partial oxidation reforming catalyst or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst can start the reaction of oxidizing the raw material for producing hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0091">A temperature of the raw material for producing hydrogen or the gas containing raw material for producing hydrogen fed to the reformer and a temperature at the inlet part of the catalytic layer of the reformer are set to be preferably not greater than 700&#xb0; C., in order to suppress thermal decomposition of the raw material for producing hydrogen. Further, the temperature is preferably not smaller than a temperature at which water and the raw material for producing hydrogen vaporize.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0092">For the gas containing oxygen, pure oxygen may be used, but air is preferably used because of easy availability.</p>

In addition, although the steam is not necessary to perform the partial oxidation reforming reaction, from the viewpoint of preventing carbon deposition on piping etc., it is preferable that the steam is mixed, even if only the partial oxidation reforming is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0107">Further, because kerosene, which is a liquid fuel, is used here for the raw material for producing hydrogen, the kerosene vaporizer is provided.

<p id="p-0088" num="0108">In the reforming reaction tube, the partial oxidation reforming reaction (the auto-thermal reforming reaction, if the steam reforming reaction is involved) takes place, because oxygen is present.

In this SOFC system, a region <b>2</b><i>b </i>of an SOFC works only as a header which collects the cathode off gas, and the anode off gas, and the cathode off gas are fed to the inside of a vessel <b>10</b><i>b </i>of a reformer (outside of a reforming reaction tube) and burned there, and further, an air preheater <b>4</b> is provided there. A region <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the region <b>2</b><i>b </i>are divided from each other by a partition plate <b>103</b> through which a gas can not pass.

In this SOFC system, a reformer <b>10</b>, a kerosene vaporizer <b>21</b> and a water vaporizer <b>20</b> are provided in a region <b>2</b><i>b </i>of a vessel containing an SOFC. In this configuration, because the vessel <b>2</b> containing the SOFC is used as a vessel of the reformer, the reformer can be formed of only a reforming reaction part such as a reforming reaction tube. Here, a reformer configured similarly to the reforming reaction tube of the example 1 is used. Further, a combustion gas produced in a start-up combustor <b>22</b> is directed to the region <b>2</b><i>b</i>, and by this combustion gas, it is possible to increase the temperatures of the reformer, the kerosene vaporizer and the water vaporizer. Except these points, this system is similar to the system shown in the example 1. Also for the starting-up operation, except that the temperatures of the reformer, the kerosene vaporizer and the water vaporizer in the region <b>2</b><i>b </i>are increased by the combustion gas of the start-up combustor, it can be carried out similarly to the example 1.</p>
<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 4</heading>
<p id="p-0099" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates still another example of an SOFC system to which the starting-up method of the present invention is applicable. In this SOFC system, the inside of a tubular SOFC <b>101</b> is an anode and the outside is a cathode. The inside of a vessel <b>2</b> is divided into a region <b>2</b><i>a </i>(works as a header for anode off gas) and a region <b>2</b><i>b </i>(cathode gas chamber) by a partition plate <b>103</b> through which gas can not pass. In the region <b>2</b><i>b </i>(cathode gas chamber), a reformer <b>10</b>, a start-up water vaporizer <b>120</b><i>a </i>and a start-up kerosene vaporizer <b>121</b><i>a </i>are provided. Further, outside of the vessel <b>2</b> containing an SOFC, a start-up combustor <b>22</b> is provided, and the combustion gas produced by the combustor <b>22</b> can be directed to the region <b>2</b><i>b </i>to heat the reformer, the start-up water vaporizer and the start-up kerosene vaporizer. Further, separately from the start-up combustor <b>22</b>, a combustor <b>122</b> for normal operation is provided, and with the combustion gas produced by this combustor, a water vaporizer <b>120</b><i>b </i>for normal operation and a kerosene vaporizer <b>121</b><i>b </i>for normal operation can be heated. The reformer <b>10</b> is configured similarly to the example 3.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0120">First, kerosene and air are fed to the start-up combustor <b>22</b> and burned. The combustion gas produced is fed to the region <b>2</b><i>b </i>to increase the temperatures of the start-up water vaporizer <b>120</b><i>a</i>, the start-up kerosene vaporizer <b>121</b><i>a</i>, the reformer <b>10</b> and the SOFC <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0121">When each of the reformer, the start-up water vaporizer and the start-up kerosene vaporizer is heated to a predetermined temperature, a partial oxidation reforming catalyst (or an auto-thermal reforming catalyst) is heated to a temperature at which the partial oxidation reforming reaction can proceed, and steam generation and kerosene vaporization become enabled to take place, then, the steam, the vaporized kerosene and oxygen are fed to the reformer, and the partial oxidation reforming reaction (or the auto-thermal reforming reaction, if the steam reforming reaction is involved) is performed. The reformed gas produced by this reformer is fed to the anode of the SOFC <b>101</b> through a reformed gas feed pipe <b>105</b> to increase the temperature of the SOFC. The reformed gas discharged from the anode to the region <b>2</b><i>a </i>is fed to the start-up combustor <b>22</b> as a fuel. At this time, supply of kerosene to the start-up combustor <b>22</b> may be stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0122">When the SOFC is heated to a temperature at which electric generation can be conducted, the reformed gas discharged from the region <b>2</b><i>a </i>is fed to the combustor <b>122</b> for normal operation, rather than to the start-up combustor <b>22</b>. Further, to the region <b>2</b><i>b</i>, air is fed. Accordingly, an oxygen concentration in the region <b>2</b><i>b </i>(cathode chamber) can be set to be equivalent to that of air. Air can be preheated as appropriate. According to these operations, the reformed gas is burned in the combustor <b>122</b> for normal operation, and using heat of its combustion gas, water is vaporized in the water vaporizer <b>120</b><i>b </i>for normal operation and kerosene is vaporized in the kerosene vaporizer <b>121</b><i>b </i>for normal operation, and then, the steam, the vaporized kerosene and air are fed to the reformer to perform the partial oxidation reforming (or the auto-thermal reforming), and the reformed gas is fed to the anode of the SOFC. To the cathode, air is fed. At this stage, it is possible to start power generation at the SOFC, thereby, to accelerate the temperature increase using together SOFC's own heat which is generated due to electric generation.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0123">After the temperature of the steam reforming catalyst is heated to a temperature at which the steam reforming can be performed, an amount of air supplied to the reformer for the partial oxidation reforming reaction is reduced or this supply of air is stopped, and a heat source required for reforming is shifted from oxidation reaction heat of kerosene to external heating (heating due to heat generated by the combustor <b>22</b> or <b>122</b>), so that the steam reforming reaction is performed. According to this, the hydrogen concentration in the reformed gas can be increased, and as a result, electric generation efficiency of the SOFC can be enhanced. In addition, heat required for the steam reforming reaction can be supplied mainly by the thermal radiation from the SOFC. In this case, the reformer <b>10</b> is preferably disposed at a place where the thermal radiation of the SOFC easily reaches.</p>
<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<p id="p-0104" num="0124">In the example 4, after the partial oxidation reforming catalyst (or the auto-thermal reforming catalyst) is heated to a temperature at which the partial oxidation reforming reaction can proceed, and steam generation and kerosene vaporization become enabled to take place, then, the partial oxidation reforming reaction (the auto-thermal reforming reaction, if the steam reforming reaction is involved) is performed and the reformed gas is fed to the anode of the SOFC <b>101</b> through the reformed gas feed pipe <b>105</b> to increase the temperature of the SOFC.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0125">In the example 5, instead of feeding the reformed gas to the anode of the SOFC, the reformed gas is fed to the start-up combustor <b>22</b> as a fuel, using a line shown by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and then, the reformed gas is burned and the combustion gas produced is fed to the region <b>2</b><i>b </i>(cathode gas chamber) to heat the SOFC. Using combustion heat generated from combustion of the reformed gas, the start-up water vaporizer, the start-up kerosene vaporizer and the reformer can be also heated together. At the stage of feeding the reformed gas to the start-up combustor, supply of kerosene to the start-up combustor may be stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0126">In this case, to the anode of the SOFC, the reformed gas is not fed. Therefore, when the SOFC generates electricity, the reformed gas is fed to the anode. For example, when the SOFC is heated to a temperature at which it can generate electricity, the use of the line shown by the dotted line is stopped, and the reformed gas is fed from the reformer <b>10</b> to the anode via the reformed gas feed pipe <b>105</b>. The reformed gas discharged from the anode to the region <b>2</b><i>a </i>can be fed to the combustor <b>122</b> for normal operation. Further, to the region <b>2</b><i>b</i>, preheated air is fed as appropriate. Accordingly, the SOFC is enabled to generate electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0127">Except the described above, the SOFC system can be started similarly to the example 4.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0128">In addition, when the combustion gas is fed to the cathode as in the example 4 and the example 5, from the viewpoint of preventing degradation of the cathode in a reducing atmosphere, it is preferable to manage the combustion gas so that the oxygen concentration in the combustion gas is set to a desired concentration. The oxygen concentration in the combustion gas is governed by the air ratio. As the air ratio is lower (near 1), a higher temperature combustion gas can be produced, and so, the lower air ratio is preferable from the viewpoint of a shorter start-up time. However, as the air ratio is higher, the oxygen concentration is higher, and the higher air ratio is advantageous because of chemical stability of a cathode member. From the viewpoint of this, the oxygen concentration in the combustion gas fed to the cathode is preferably not smaller than 1% (dry mole basis), more preferably not smaller than 3% (dry mole basis), and still more preferably not smaller 5% (dry mole basis).</p>
