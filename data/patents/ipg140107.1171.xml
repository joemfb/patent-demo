<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure generally relates to guideway systems, and more particularly, to a guideway switching mechanism for a guideway system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A guideway system generally refers to a type of transportation system in which automated transport vehicles are guided along predetermined paths using a guideway made of structurally rigid materials including metal and/or concrete. While typical railway systems use a pair of elongated steel rails that are spaced apart a specified distance from one another and configured to guide its associated transport vehicles using flange-shaped wheels, guideway systems utilize a single elongated guideway for guidance of its associated transport vehicles. The guideway provides guidance of the automated transport vehicle along specified paths and may include running surfaces for support of the wheels of the automated transport vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to one embodiment, a guideway switching mechanism includes an elongated section of flexible guideway coupled to a switch plate. The flexible guideway has a first end that may be coupled to a first elongated guideway and a second end that may be selectively coupled to one of a multiple quantity of alternative guideways. The switch plate provides selective coupling of the flexible guideway to multiple alternative guideways by movement through an arcuate path such that the automated transport vehicle may selectively move from the first elongated guideway to either of the alternative guideways.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some embodiments of the disclosure may provide numerous technical advantages. Some embodiments may benefit from some, none, or all of these advantages. For example, according to one embodiment, flexible guideway may provide motive force the automated transport vehicle while moving through the guideway switching mechanism. This may be due, at least in part to the properties of the guideway that remain essentially continuous throughout the guideway switching mechanism. For linear induction motors, therefore, that generate motive force using the guideway, the automated transport vehicle may remain under power while transitioning through the guideway switching mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other technical advantages may be readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Guideway systems incorporating a single elongated guideway may provide certain advantages over railway systems having multiple rails. For example, guideways may be used in conjunction with linear induction motors to provide a motive force for movement of transport vehicles along the guideway. Switching of the transport vehicle among multiple guideways or paths is not easily accomplished, however, due to their obstruction of the wheels of transport vehicle when extending in a path that is different from the chosen path of the transport vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one embodiment of a guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b> that may provide a solution to this problem and other problems. Guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b> generally includes an elongated section of flexible guideway <b>12</b> having one end <b>14</b><i>a </i>that is coupled to a first elongated guideway <b>16</b> and a second end <b>14</b><i>b </i>coupled to a switch plate <b>18</b>. According to the teachings of the present disclosure, flexible guideway <b>12</b> may bend along a generally horizontal arc <b>20</b> to selectively couple flexible guideway <b>12</b> to one of three alternative guideways <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, or <b>22</b><i>c </i>such that automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> may selectively move from first guideway <b>16</b> to either of the three alternative guideways <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, or <b>22</b><i>c</i>. In the particular embodiment shown, three alternative guideways <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and <b>22</b><i>c </i>are shown; however, guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b> may be configured to switch flexible guideway <b>12</b> among any quantity of alternative guideways <b>22</b> such as two, four, or more alternative guideways <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> may be any type of vehicle suitable for movement along first guideway <b>16</b>, alternative guideways <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and <b>22</b><i>c</i>, and flexible guideway <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, motive force for movement of automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> may be provided by a linear induction motor (not specifically shown) in which first guideway <b>16</b>, alternative guideways <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and <b>22</b><i>c</i>, and flexible guideway <b>12</b> serves as a stator portion of the linear induction motor. Certain embodiments of the present disclosure may provide an advantage in that the flexible guideway <b>12</b> may continue to provide motive force for automated transport vehicle while transitioning through the guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b> may be implemented such that automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> diverges from one first guideway <b>16</b> to one of multiple alternative guideways <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, or <b>22</b><i>c</i>. In another embodiment, guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b> may be implemented such that the automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> merges from multiple alternative guideways <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and <b>22</b><i>c </i>into a single first guideway <b>16</b>. That is, the switching function of the guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b> may be reversed to provide a merging operation from among a plurality of alternative guideways <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and <b>22</b><i>c </i>as opposed to diverging from a single first guideway <b>16</b> to multiple alternative guideways <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and <b>22</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2C</figref> show side elevational, top, and front elevational views, respectively, of guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b>, which is formed in this embodiment, on a pre-fabricated support substrate <b>30</b>. Pre-fabricated support substrate <b>30</b> may be made of any suitable material having sufficient strength for supporting the weight of a loaded automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> and support lateral forces through flexible guideway <b>12</b> for changing the direction of the automated transport vehicle <b>24</b>. In one embodiment, support substrate <b>30</b> is made of concrete and may include various types of reinforcement material, such as wire mesh or rebar.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;pre-fabrication&#x201d; may be referred to, in this disclosure, as the act of creating support substrate <b>30</b> at one location, and subsequently installing and using the created support substrate <b>30</b> at a different location. In one embodiment, guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b> may be fabricated in multiple sub-sections <b>32</b><i>a </i>through <b>32</b><i>f </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Each of these sub-sections <b>32</b><i>a </i>through <b>32</b><i>f </i>may be individually transported and subsequently assembled at a desired location of use. In one example, guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b> may be approximately twenty feet wide at it widest point and approximately 180 feet long. This guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b> may therefore, have six sub-sections <b>32</b><i>a </i>through <b>32</b><i>f </i>that are each approximately 30 feet long.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Bending of flexible guideway <b>12</b> may be provided by a switch plate <b>18</b>. Switch plate <b>18</b> is disposed in a generally arc-shaped cavity <b>34</b> that allows the switch plate <b>18</b> to freely move in a generally lateral arcuate path. An actuator <b>36</b> may be provided for movement of the switch plate <b>18</b>. The actuator <b>36</b> may be any suitable type, such as a hydraulic piston, a servo mechanism, or an electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The length of travel of the switch plate <b>18</b> may be based upon the quantity of alternative guideways <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and <b>22</b><i>c </i>implemented and the breadth of the wheels of automated transport vehicle <b>24</b>. For example, to provide for clearance between the wheels of automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> and an adjacent alternative guideway <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, or <b>22</b><i>c</i>, each alternative guideway <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and <b>22</b><i>c </i>may be placed at least half the wheel breadth of automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> apart.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The speed at which the actuator <b>36</b> is operable to alternatively couple alternative guideways <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and <b>22</b><i>c </i>may be directly proportional to the rate at which automated transport vehicles <b>24</b> move through guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, actuator <b>36</b> moves switch plate <b>18</b> at a speed of approximately 10 feet-per-second such that automated transport vehicles <b>24</b> moving at approximately 90 feet-per-second may be properly guided to their desired alternative guideway <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, or <b>22</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, support substrate <b>30</b> has an upper surface <b>38</b> with a convex shape. The convex shape of upper surface <b>38</b> may provide a banking angle or acclivity for automated transport vehicles <b>24</b> that are diverted from a straight trajectory due to bending of flexible guideway <b>12</b>. In the present embodiment shown for example, diverting automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> to either alternative guideway <b>22</b><i>a </i>or <b>22</b><i>c </i>may be provided by bending flexible guideway <b>12</b>. In this case, movement of automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> along flexible guideway <b>12</b> may impart lateral forces on automated guideway vehicle <b>24</b> due to centripetal momentum of automated transport vehicle <b>24</b>. Banking provided by the convex shape of upper surface <b>38</b> in this case may reduce centripetal forces that may in turn, reduce the lateral force placed on flexible guideway <b>12</b> when automated transport vehicle is diverted onto guideway <b>22</b><i>a </i>or <b>22</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a partial diagram view of an alternative embodiment of a flexible guideway <b>40</b> that may be used with the guideway switching mechanism <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Whereas flexible guideway <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 2C</figref> has a lateral flexibility that may be distributed uniformly from its first end <b>14</b><i>a </i>to its second end <b>14</b><i>b</i>, flexible guideway <b>40</b> has a plurality of rigid sub-sections <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>that are hingedly coupled together at relatively equally spaced apart intervals from its first end to second end. In the particular illustration shown, only two sub-sections <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>are shown; however, it should be understood that flexible guideway <b>40</b> may have any quantity of sub-sections <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>that are hingedly coupled together at regularly spaced intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Lateral bending of rigid sub-sections <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>relative to one another may be provided by articulation along a joint <b>44</b>. A multiple quantity of joints <b>44</b> configured on flexible guideway <b>40</b> allows it to bend along an arc for selectively coupling second end <b>14</b><i>b </i>to either of alternative guideways <b>22</b>. The stiffness of joint <b>44</b> may also be controlled from a relatively low stiffness to allow bending to a relatively high stiffness for guiding automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> along its selected path.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Selective stiffness of joint <b>44</b> may be provided by any suitable approach. In the particular embodiment shown, two pistons <b>46</b> are included that are coupled at either end to adjacent sub-sections <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b</i>. Pistons <b>46</b> have a length L that varies proportionally with articulation of joints <b>44</b> and have an adjustable stiffness. The stiffness of pistons <b>46</b> generally refers to their level of resistance to a change in its length L. Thus, by controlling the stiffness of pistons <b>46</b>, the relative stiffness of joint <b>44</b> is effectively controlled. In the particular embodiment shown, two pistons <b>46</b> are used to control the stiffness of joint <b>44</b>; however, any quantity of pistons <b>46</b>, such as one piston, or three or more pistons may be used to control the stiffness and thus lateral articulation of their associated joint <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, pistons <b>46</b> may be filled with a magneto rheological fluid to control its stiffness. A magneto rheological fluid is a substance having a viscosity that varies according to an applied magnetic field. Typical magneto rheological fluids include ferro-magnetic particles that are suspended in a carrier fluid, such as mineral oil, synthetic oil, water, or glycol, and may include one or more emulsifying agents that maintain suspension of these ferro-magnetic particles in the carrier fluid. Pistons <b>46</b> may operate, therefore, in the presence of a magnetic field to control the stiffness of pistons <b>46</b> and thus, the stiffness of joint <b>44</b> to which they are coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to guideway switching system <b>10</b> without departing from the scope of the disclosure. The components of guideway switching system <b>10</b> may be integrated or separated. For example, flexible guideway <b>12</b> may be integrally formed with switch plate <b>18</b> such that actuator <b>36</b> is directly coupled to flexible guideway <b>12</b>. Moreover, the operations of guideway switching system <b>10</b> may be performed by more, fewer, or other components. For example, support substrate <b>30</b> may include other structural features not specifically described to support the weight of automated transport vehicle <b>24</b> and/or maintain flexible guideway <b>40</b> in proper alignment with first elongated guideway <b>16</b> and alternative guideways <b>22</b>. Additionally, operations of actuator <b>36</b> and/or pistons <b>46</b> may be controlled by a suitable controller that may include, for example, logic comprising software, hardware, and/or other suitable forms of logic. As used in this document, &#x201c;each&#x201d; refers to each member of a set or each member of a subset of a set. Additionally, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale.</p>
