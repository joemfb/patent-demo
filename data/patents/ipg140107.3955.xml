<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Various embodiments disclosed herein are directed to modifying visual perception. More particularly, various embodiments employ lighting techniques to modify the appearance of a subject, such as a person, place or thing. Additionally, lighting techniques in combination with real time modification features may be applied to electronically captured imagery. Additionally, lighting placement and positioning techniques may be further incorporated to modify and/or enhance the appearance of a targeted subject.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Various lighting techniques may be used to affect the physical appearance of a targeted subject or location. In particular, a combination of key light and fill light may be used to modify the appearance of the subject (e.g., the person, place or thing). Generally, key light is used to highlight and/or shape the form and dimension of a subject. In comparison, fill light is typically used to &#x201c;fill in&#x201d; the shadows caused by the main light (or the key light). Typically, the fill light is softer and less intense than the key light. However, in some situations a key light and fill light of equal intensity may be applied to create a particular enhanced cosmetic effect. The application of key and fill light in combination may produce the illusion of light emanating from within a center point, as opposed to the appearance that light is being applied to a person, place or thing. Additionally, in order to produce the illusion of light emanating from within, various factors such as ratios of key and fill light, placement of key and fill light, and relationship of positioned key and fill light to each may be manipulated to enhance the illusion.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The system and method for modifying visual perception may be applied and utilized in a variety of formats and features.

The above listed GAMCOLOR&#xae; number references represent color temperatures and hues of the actual light that may be replicated in one embodiment of the camera <b>10</b>. The camera <b>10</b> may employ filters and/or lighting to modify the coloring. Optionally, the camera <b>10</b> may capture an image, and then a microprocessor may perform a color adjustment to captured image. Additionally, in another optional embodiment, polarizing filters may also be used to add contrast and shape to the light.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The lighting system <b>12</b> also includes a light source <b>54</b>. In one embodiment, the light source <b>54</b> includes a plurality of light-emitting diodes <b>56</b> (LEDs) positioned in a circular path. Other examples of light sources may include, but are not limited to incandescent light bulbs, arc lamps, gas discharge lamps, neon lamps, flood lamps, modern photographic flashes, lasers, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), sulfur lamps, and any other known light sources.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The camera <b>10</b> may be used to capture images of target subjects. In one embodiment, the camera <b>10</b> has a defined minimum and maximum target distance in order to capture optimal quality images. Optionally, in one embodiment, the optimal distance for the camera <b>10</b> to capture an image of an object/target is between one foot and seven feet. The camera <b>10</b> further includes a system for automatically modifying captured images. In one embodiment, under the control of a user, the camera <b>10</b> &#x201c;takes a picture&#x201d; or captures an image. The captured image is modified automatically. Optionally, in one embodiment, the captured image is automatically modified in real time. The term &#x201c;real time&#x201d; is used to mean occurring immediately. More particularly, the camera captures the images and responds immediately to enhance and modify the image immediately. Typically, real time can refer to events simulated by a computer at the same speed that they would occur in real life.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one embodiment, the captured image, also referred to as the &#x201c;non-manipulated capture&#x201d; is examined and analyzed by the automatic modification process. The automatic modification process evaluates the non-manipulated capture and automatically adjusts various features of the image. Additionally, the automatic modification process applies an automatic overall adjustment to the entire non-manipulated capture. Further, in one example, the automatic modification process may include one or more of the following adjustments: adjusting the exposure, adjusting highlight levels, adjusting midtone levels, adjusting lowlight levels, adjusting color temperature, adjusting tint, adjusting contrast, adjusting color saturation, sharpening the detail in the highlights, diffusing the midtones, compressing the image, and elongating the image.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process adjusts the exposure level to define shadow detail such as detail in dark hair. In one example embodiment, the automatic exposure adjustment includes increasing the exposure levels between approximately 5% and approximately 25% of the non-manipulated capture.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process adjusts the highlight levels to brighten the lightest areas in the captured image, such as the shine on the skin of a person. In one example embodiment, the automatic highlight level adjustment includes increasing the highlight levels between approximately 5% to approximately 10% of the non-manipulated capture.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process adjusts the midtone levels to brighten &#x201c;middle tone&#x201d; areas such as skin tone. In one example embodiment, the automatic midtone level adjustment includes increasing the midtone levels between approximately 5% to approximately 10% of the non-manipulated capture.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process adjusts the lowlight levels to darken the deepest areas of exposure such as the dark pupil of the eye. In one example embodiment, the automatic lowlight level adjustment includes decreasing the lowlight levels between approximately 5% to approximately 10% of the non-manipulated capture.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process adjusts the color temperature to create a golden color quality. For example, the color temperature may be adjusted to create the effect of warming the skin tone with golden hues. In one example embodiment, the automatic color temperature adjustment includes increasing the yellow tones between approximately 50% to approximately 150% of the non-manipulated capture, and thereby decreasing the blue tones between approximately 50% to approximately 150% of the non-manipulated capture. Optionally, in an alternate embodiment, the automatic color temperature adjustment is performed in combination with an adjustment of the tint.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process adjusts the tint to decrease red tones and increase green tones. Optionally, the automatic tint adjustment may be performed in combination with the color temperature adjustment to produce a golden color quality in a picture. In one example embodiment, the automatic tint adjustment includes decreasing the red tones (and thereby increasing the green tones) between approximately 5% to approximately 10% of the non-manipulated capture.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process adjusts the contrast of the overall image. The contrast controls the differential between light and dark tones. In one example embodiment, the automatic contrast adjustment includes increasing the contrast between approximately 50% to approximately 150% of the non-manipulated capture. Optionally, the automatic contrast adjustment may be performed in combination with an adjustment of the color saturation and/or an automatic diffusion modification in order to produce a more colorful and vivid picture.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process adjusts the color saturation of an image. The color saturation controls the amount of color in an image. Generally, as saturation increases, colors tend to take on a kind of neon look. As saturation decreases, colors tend to approach a gray. In one example embodiment, the automatic color saturation adjustment includes increasing the color saturation between approximately 50% to approximately 150% of the non-manipulated capture. Optionally, the automatic color saturation adjustment may be performed in combination with a contrast adjustment and/or an automatic diffusion modification in order to produce a more colorful and vivid picture.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process includes an automatic diffusion modification which softens the midtone areas, such as the skin. In one example, diffusing the midtones produces the effect of smoothing and softening the appearance of skin texture. In one example embodiment, the automatic diffusion modification diffuses midtones between approximately 5% to approximately 100% of the non-manipulated capture. Optionally, in an alternate embodiment, midtone diffusion is performed in combination with a contrast adjustment and/or color saturation adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process includes automatic highlight sharpening which sharpens the detail in the brightest of the highlight areas. In other words, the appearance of extra sharpness is added only to the brightest parts of the exposure, such as highlights and light reflections in the eyes and teeth. In one example embodiment, the highlight sharpening is increased between approximately 5% to approximately 10% of the non-manipulated capture.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process includes an image compression function. For example, the image may be compressed, or squeezed, horizontally (or in one example, compressed along the x-axis) so that people or objects in the resulting compressed image appear slimmer. In one example embodiment, the image is compressed between approximately 5% to approximately 10% of the non-manipulated capture.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment, the automatic modification process includes an image extension function. For example, the image may be elongated, or extended, vertically (or in one example, elongated along the y-axis) so that people or objects in the image appear stretched or elongated, thus appearing taller. In one example embodiment, the image is extended between approximately 5% to approximately 10% of the non-manipulated capture.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the automatic modification process may include additional automatic features. For example, in one embodiment, the hue may be automatically modified. Alternately, in another example embodiment, the luminance, or brightness of color, may be automatically modified. Additionally, in an optional embodiment, the image reflectivity may also be automatically modified. In another optional embodiment, the transparency parameter may be automatically modified.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Additionally, in one embodiment, the automatic modification process may be configured to achieve a particular visual look or appearance. In one example embodiment, the camera <b>10</b> is may be used to capture close-up shots and/or wide-shots, and the camera <b>10</b> may be configured to automatically modify the captured images to obtain a particular look. Generally, a close-up shot closely frames an object, such as a human figure, such that only the portion of the person from the waist or chest up is included in the frame. Additionally, the close-up shot may include just the face of a person. A wide-shot (also called a long shot) typically shows the entire object or human figure and is usually intended to place it in some relation to its surroundings. In one example embodiment, the camera <b>10</b> is used to capture a close-up shot of an image such that the resulting captured image is automatically modified and appears to have a peach-golden look. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the &#x201c;peach-golden look&#x201d; is illustrated below by way of example only and not by way of limitation. In one example, the camera <b>10</b> captures a close-up shot and the automatic modification process automatically increases the exposure level of the captured image by approximately 10%, increases the highlight levels of the captured image by approximately 7%, increases the midtone levels of the captured image by approximately 7%, decreases the lowlight levels of the captured image by approximately 7%, adjusts the color temperature by increasing the yellow tones (and thereby decreasing the blue tones) by approximately 75%, adjusts the tint by decreasing the red tones (and thereby increasing the green tones) by approximately 7%, increases the contrast by approximately 75%, increases the color saturation by approximately 75%, diffuses the midtones by approximately 50%, increases the highlight sharpening by approximately 7%, compresses the image by approximately 5%, and extends the image by approximately 5%.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring back to the camera <b>10</b>, once a &#x201c;picture is taken,&#x201d; the resulting image shown on the display screen <b>22</b> is an enhanced image, or modified, as it has been automatically modified by one or more of the features described above.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one example, the camera <b>10</b> is used to capture portrait-style photographs of a person. Typically, the camera <b>10</b> captures images of a person or persons. Additionally, the camera captures images of a person in a close range distance from the camera. In one embodiment, the optimal distance of the person from the camera is between approximately one and approximately seven feet. However, in an alternate embodiment, the range may be greater.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Once the user is ready to take a picture, the user aims the camera <b>10</b> at the subject and &#x201c;snaps&#x201d; the shot. In one example, the camera <b>10</b> is a classic &#x201c;point and shoot&#x201d; digital camera. Optionally, the camera <b>10</b> may be a DSLR (digital single lens reflex) camera. Optionally, in an alternate embodiment the camera <b>10</b> also includes video capability and may capture video images as well as still images. Alternately, in an optional embodiment, the camera <b>10</b> is a video camera. Further, the lighting system <b>12</b> generally acts as a constant light source when capturing video. Additionally, in an optional embodiment, the camera <b>10</b> may also include audio capability and may capture images as well as audio recordings. Optionally, the camera <b>10</b> may capture video images and audio recordings. Further, the camera <b>10</b> also includes a playback feature for displaying captured video.

Subsequently, a speaker <b>32</b> is an outlet for transmitting the recorded sound back to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Once the user has taken a picture, the captured image is then automatically modified in real time and displayed on the display screen <b>22</b> of the camera <b>10</b>. As described above, the real time modifications may include squeezing or compressing the image so that the subject in the image appears slimmer. The real time modification may also include stretching or elongating the image so that the subject in the image appears taller. Further, as described in detail above, other automatic, real time modifications may include automatically manipulating the image so that the mid-tones are diffused (particularly in skin tone areas where the subject is a human), the highlights are sharpened and gold tones may be added. Optionally, in another embodiment, peach golden tones may be added. Additionally, the image may be manipulated by automatically altering brightness levels, contrast and/or the color temperature. The manipulation of the captured image is done automatically in real time so that the captured image presented on the camera display <b>22</b> is presented in a modified format and does not require any further input, choices, selections, or decisions from the user. The camera <b>10</b> may work in conjunction with a post production system (not shown) that allows for further modification of the captured images. In one embodiment, the post production system includes a software application for use on a computer to be used in combination with the camera <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Additionally, in an optional embodiment, the camera <b>10</b> further includes an automatic audio modification feature that allows the camera <b>10</b> to automatically modify the captured audio data.

The equalizer correctly balances high, mid and low ranges areas of the captured audio recording and amplifies midrange for greater clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The filter automatically reduces ambient noise to allow for the cleanest possible voice recording. Additionally, in captured voice recordings, the filter softens hard consonants such as &#x201c;ch&#x201d; or &#x201c;k&#x201d; sounds and adds crispness to sibilant sounds such as &#x201c;s&#x201d;, &#x201c;es&#x201d;, or &#x201c;is&#x201d; at the end of words.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The automatic audio leveler automatically adjusts voice recording and broadcast levels. More particularly, the automatic leveler adjust the voice recording by reacting to the user's voice and to the volume changes as the user moves closer or further from the microphone. In one embodiment, the optimal distance of the user from the microphone is from approximately one to approximately seven feet.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In one embodiment, the camera <b>10</b> is configured for use as a portrait style camera to capture pictures of people at close range (e.g. 1 to 7 feet).

In one embodiment, the automatic modification feature includes a microprocessor (not shown) embedded in the camera <b>10</b>. The microprocessor analyzes the received images, and facilitates the process for modifying and adjusting the images as needed, in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Alternately, in an optional embodiment, the camera <b>10</b> further includes a sensor (not shown) operatively connected to the microprocessor. The sensor reads the skin type of a person or persons about to be photographed. In one example embodiment, the sensor is configured to detect and sense particular qualities of skin from a target image. In particular, the sensor may detect skin coloring, skin type or other skin features and then use the information to adjust the coloring of the lighting system <b>12</b> to emit a light that is favorable and flattering to the targeted image. Optionally, in an alternate embodiment, a microprocessor (not shown) is operatively connected to the sensor. The microprocessor performs digital color enhancements to the non-manipulated capture as a direct result of skin data received from the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In an alternate embodiment, the camera <b>10</b> may be used to take pictures of non-human subjects. The camera <b>10</b> provides an automatic modification feature that produces visually modified photographs. The camera <b>10</b> may be used to take pictures of pets, scenic images, interiors, objects and any other subjects.</p>

Further, in one embodiment, the lighting system <b>112</b> is a constant light source. Optionally, in an alternate embodiment, the lighting system <b>112</b> is a flash light source. Alternately, in an optional embodiment, the lighting system <b>112</b> is configured to act as either a constant light source or a flash light source.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Additionally, in an optional embodiment, the video display <b>122</b> is a high definition video screen display. The combined lighting system <b>112</b> and video display <b>122</b> may attach to a stand and base combination. Additionally, the video camera mirror system <b>110</b> is configured to appear as a mirror to a user. More particularly, the video display <b>122</b> mimics a mirror and provides a simulated reflection of the targeted subject. For example, when a user is positioned in front of the video mirror <b>110</b>, an embedded camera captures the user's image as video and presents the captured video images on the display screen <b>122</b>, thus simulating a mirror's reflection. A processing means (not shown) operatively connected to the video camera mirror system <b>110</b> automatically modifies the captured video images in real time and presents the modified video to the user on the video display <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In one embodiment, a processor evaluates the captured video images and automatically adjusts various features of the video. For example, the automatic modification process may include one or more of the following adjustments to the captured video: adjusting the exposure, adjusting highlight levels, adjusting midtone levels, adjusting lowlight levels, adjusting color temperature, adjusting tint, adjusting contrast, adjusting color saturation, sharpening the detail in the highlights, diffusing the midtones, compressing video images, and elongating video images. The example automatic adjustments were described in great detail above in the camera embodiment and may be applied in a similar fashion to the video camera mirror system <b>110</b>. The video camera mirror system <b>110</b> may capture still images and the processor may automatically adjust the still image. Additionally, the video camera mirror system <b>110</b> may also capture moving images (or video images) and the processor may automatically adjust the moving images, or video images, in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The video camera mirror system <b>110</b> may also capture and record audio. Additionally, the video camera mirror system <b>110</b> may also include an automatic audio modification feature that automatically modifies captured audio data. The automatic audio modification feature may include an equalizer, audio leveler and filter, similar to that described in the camera <b>10</b> embodiments above.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Additionally, the lighting system <b>112</b> may also include screens (not shown) and/or filters (not shown) to further manipulate lighting effects. For example, the color of the resulting emitted light may be manipulated by using particular screens and/or filters. In one embodiment, a series of color correction filters corresponding to a range of colors similar to PANTONE&#xae; colors 472C, 723C, 1485C, and 1555C may be used to control and warm the light. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the PANTONE&#xae; color reference system is frequently used to specify color by designers and printers. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other filters of other colors may be used to control the light. For example filters that replicate the effect of GAMPRODUCT, INC&#xae; colors 325(Bastard Amber), 328 (Tan Tone), 360 (Amber Blush), and 380 (Golden Tan) may also be used.
