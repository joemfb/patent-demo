<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to devices powered by energy generated by impacts and, more particularly, to emergency distress signal and position indication broadcasting devices and methods.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Every year, numerous people get lost in the forests and mountains while climbing or hiking or are lost at sea or while engaged in other land or water sports activities, or when they are otherwise lost due to running out of gas while traveling in remote areas by car or motorcycle, or get stuck in mud or the like or due to mechanical failure, or due to plane crash, and for a number of other reasons. To these numbers, one must also add the number of people who get injured during hiking, skiing or other similar activities, and/or run out of food and/or water and become unable to move to safety on their own. Furthermore, many elderly people can become incapacitated or otherwise injured and incapable of calling for help or medical assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In short, every year, a large number of people find themselves in situations in which they require help for one of the aforementioned or similar reasons. Currently, there are very few devices that are available for those in one of the aforementioned emergency situations to contact authorities or others for help. Among the devices that are currently available are cell phones, which run on battery power and therefore can run out of power, and in most of the above situations would usually be out of reception areas of the phone company. Another currently available device could be a GPS based position indicator and navigation device that could be used by the person to find the way to safety. However, GPS systems are powered by battery and would be useful only if the person is still capable of continuing his/her travel. In addition, GPS signal is not always available, particularly if the traveler is in a mountainous area. Chemical batteries run out and cannot therefore be relied on for emergency situations. Other electrical power sources such as solar cells and mechanical generators such as rotary hand operated dynamo generators may in general be used. However, large solar cell areas are needed to generate enough power, and they could only generate power during the day and under the sun. Dynamo generators and the like are relatively large and heavy and not suitable for hiking and sport activities and can get damaged during accidents and falls, making them unsuitable for many of the other aforementioned emergency situations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A need therefore exists for methods and means that could be used by a person or persons in one or more of the aforementioned emergency situations or the like to inform authorities or someone who could alert help. To be useful in most situations, such methods and devices should have one or more of the following features: relatively small and lightweight; rugged and capable of withstanding impact and abuse; easy to use even in a highly distressed situations, preferably requiring just a few simple operations to send the appropriate distress signal; battery free; capable of transmitting distress signals, preferably with certain embedded position and/or other relevant information, over relatively long distances, preferably of tens of miles or more; capable of transmitting distress signals from mountainous areas, even from areas deep in the forest and/or from within caves and other similar areas, and have the signal received at the monitoring stations and capable of powering the signal transmitting device without requiring strenuous efforts.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An objective of the present invention is to provide methods and related devices for transmitting an emergency distress signal and for the monitoring devices (stations) to receive such distress signals that would allow them to be led to and/or locate the person or persons in distress, where the distress signal can be capable of reaching relatively far distances, such as tens of miles.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the devices disclosed herein, the distress signal is of a radio frequency nature. The method allows the development of lightweight, small and rugged battery-less devices that are capable of transmitting distress signals from mountainous areas, mountainous areas covered with snow, rain environments or even a rain forest or cave, over the water, and many other locations that a user may find himself/herself. In many of such situations, a radio frequency (RF) transmitter would face numerous obstacles such as reflections, absorption or the natural attenuation of a propagated radio frequency signals as a function of distance. As a result, an RF transmitter would require a considerable amount of power to ensure that a transmitted distress signal could be received at the aforementioned expected distances, such as up to several tens of miles. In the devices disclosed herein, this problem is overcome with the transmission of very high power by very short duration pulses. Methods of incorporating intelligence in the transmitted pulses that would provide additional information to the rescuers that would facilitate their search and/or indicate the conditions of the person(s) in distress and the site are also disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The high power requirement eliminates the possibility of using batteries of typical sizes that can be easily carried by people, particularly considering the size and weight constraints of the present application. In addition, even for the transmission of short but high power pulses, batteries are not appropriate since their rate of discharge is limited and there may not be any means for recharging. One can obviously consider using batteries to charge capacitors and thereby increase the rate of discharge to the desired level. However, in such a scenario, the battery operated transmitter will have a very limited operational lifetime. This would mean that if the person in distress is not found while the batteries are still operational, the person would loose his/her chance of transmitting any more distress signals. It is therefore essential that the electrical power be provided by means that do not rely on chemical or other types of stored energy.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the devices disclosed herein, the electrical energy is produced by the user of the device. The power source operates based on mechanical impact. The user can then generate electrical energy by impacting the device onto some relatively hard surfaces and generate large enough charges to power the transmitter and allow it to send at least one high power pulse as previously described. The user can then repeat transmission as many times as is necessary and for hours and even days. In addition, the present devices can produce electrical energy and store the energy in one or more capacitors. The stored electrical energy can then be used to produce short but high power radio frequency signals (pulses) that could reach tens or even a few hundreds of miles to allow rescue teams to locate the lost individuals.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The various embodiments of the devices disclosed herein can be constructed by two primary components; an impact-based electrical energy generator power source; and a propagation device capable of producing high-power radio frequency (RF) pulses at one or more frequencies. The resulting battery-less emergency distress signal and position indication devices are then configured and equipped with various other hardware and software to achieve embodiments with different capabilities that could aid the rescuers in locating the person or persons in distress and to inform the rescuers of additional information that would help the rescue mission.

The device <b>10</b> comprises an impact based electrical energy generator component <b>11</b> and a transmitter component <b>12</b> with an associated antenna <b>13</b>. The device <b>10</b> is operated by a person in distress by impacting it, preferably to a hard surface such as a large rock or hard ground one or more times. The impact action causes the electrical energy generator <b>11</b> to generate electrical energy, which is preferably used to charge at least one capacitor. The stored electrical energy in the capacitors is then used to power the transmitter <b>12</b> to transmit short duration and high power radio frequency (RF) pulses from the antenna <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The main components of the power supply <b>11</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the power supply <b>11</b> consists of one or more impact based electrical energy generators <b>20</b> (in the schematic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> only one such impact based generator is shown for simplicity). The electrical energy is produced by an impact force <b>21</b> imparted on the generator <b>20</b>. When more than one generator <b>20</b> is used, the impact force is preferably applied to an intermediate relatively rigid element <b>22</b> to distribute the impact to more than one generator at a time. The impact based generators <b>20</b> are constructed as one of the types of impact and vibration based generators described in co-pending patent application Ser. No. 11/447,788 filed on Jun. 6, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,777,396, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. The generators <b>20</b> can use piezoelectric stacks as described in the aforementioned patent application or magnets and a coil to convert mechanical energy to electrical energy. The use of piezoelectric stack elements allows the generator <b>20</b> to be made smaller and lighter. It is appreciated by those familiar with the art that impact type of torque or bending moments may also be used to initialize electrical energy generation by the generators <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The power supply <b>11</b> also contains at least one capacitor <b>23</b>, preferably a so-called super-capacitor type of capacitor, in which the electrical energy generated by the generators <b>20</b> is stored. In the schematic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> only one capacitor <b>23</b> is shown for the sake of simplicity. An electronics component <b>24</b> is used to regulate the generated (mainly AC) voltage and charge the capacitors <b>23</b>. The design, operation and construction of such voltage regulation and capacitor charging electronics are well known in the art. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wires <b>25</b> or other conductors/substrate(s) are used to provide the generated electrical energy by the generator <b>20</b> to the regulation and charger electronics <b>24</b> and to connect the same to the capacitors <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The configuration of the RF pulse transmitter <b>12</b> utilizing the electrical energy stored in the capacitors of the power supply <b>11</b> is well known in the art. The antenna <b>13</b> can be conventionally configured as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, the antenna <b>13</b> can also be mounted inside the battery-less emergency distress signal and position indication broadcasting device <b>10</b> packaging if a portion of the packaging is constructed with RF transparent materials such as plastics. In which case, the antenna <b>13</b> is preferably surface mounted inside the packaging wall to make the system more shock and vibration resistant. Alternatively, the antenna <b>13</b> may be designed to be deployed from inside the packaged system <b>10</b> or unwound as a wire antenna from a storage region on the surface of the package. The latter wire type of antenna <b>13</b> is preferable when longer antenna lengths are desired to allow transmission of the longer wavelength RF signals that could reach farther distances.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The packaging of the battery-less emergency distress signal and position indication broadcasting device <b>10</b> must obviously be such that the device could withstand the impact forces <b>21</b> as well and other shock and impact forces and abuse that could be expected of such a device. In addition, enough sealing of the interior components, particularly around the impact element <b>22</b>, can be provided to make the device water and moisture resistance. It is noted that different methods of shock and impact proving electronics and other components in a packaging, e.g., by using shock and impact mounts or potting materials, are well known in the art. Methods of hermetically sealing different packaging are also well known in the art and are not described in this disclosure. The impact element (panel or plate) <b>22</b> can be attached to the packaging housing via resilient bellow type of material to keep the interior of the package sealed while the transmission of the impact force and vibration of the generator mass-spring elements is minimally impeded.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another embodiment and as previously indicated, the battery-less emergency distress signal and position indication broadcasting device <b>10</b> can be constructed with a power supply <b>10</b> that includes a number of storage banks (capacitors or the like) that are electronically gated to each operate a different transmission frequency. The distress signal pulse that is transmitted may then include a number of frequencies to establish a multiplexed composite signal that can contain information about location of the transmitting device. The distress signal may be time compressed to make it possible to be transmitted with a short duration pulse. A transmitter specific code is preferably included in the distress signal to identify which transmitter (particularly if the monitoring station is receiving more than one distress signal at the time) the signal has originated from.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A front view of a packaged battery-less emergency distress signal and position indication broadcasting device <b>10</b> is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The impact plate <b>22</b> with the preferred resilient bellow type of material sealing <b>30</b> to keep the interior of the package sealed without impeding the transmission of impact force <b>21</b> and vibration is shown. Also shown are a number of buttons <b>31</b> (preferably touch buttons) and, a microphone <b>32</b>, a speaker <b>33</b> and a display <b>34</b> with which different embodiments of the present invention may be equipped. Some of the buttons <b>31</b> may be two or more position switches. When a microphone <b>32</b> is present, the device <b>10</b> is equipped with means (preferably solid state memory) to record a relatively short message and transmit the same in the distress signal. The device may also be equipped with pre-recorded messages for use, particularly when the user has difficulty speaking messages or speak in the language commonly known by the monitoring station personnel. Similarly, when the device is equipped with a speaker, appropriate means are included in the device <b>10</b> electronics to play the incoming message.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, the buttons and switches <b>31</b> may be used to encode information such as various medical conditions, immediate medicine needs, the food and/water conditions, the condition of the person or persons in distress, other immediate needs for survival, etc. In one embodiment, one or more of the buttons and/or switches are specifically set to indicate certain conditions such as certain medical conditions or emergency needs.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In yet another embodiment, the user can record a short message and broadcast a multiplexed signal with the time compressed voice information.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In yet another embodiment, the no-battery emergency distress signal and position indication broadcasting device <b>10</b> is equipped with a GPS receiver device <b>14</b> and the multiplexed signal would then be composed to contain the GPS device indicated position information. It is noted that GPS receivers require relatively small power to operate and can therefore be powered by a fraction of the power that the transmitter portion of the device would require to send the aforementioned signal pulses. The GPS receivers are also very light and small and would therefore add a negligible amount of weight to the total device weight. Thus, the GPS receiver would provide position data to the transmitter and the distress signal may contain such position data.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A multiplexed signal being transmitted can contain a combination of two or more of the aforementioned information.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In yet another embodiment, the battery-less emergency distress signal and position indication broadcasting device <b>10</b> can be equipped with an RF receiver. The monitoring station can then send messages that are coded to the aforementioned device specific code. The received messages can then be received, played on the speaker <b>33</b> or displayed on the display <b>34</b> or recorded for repeated displaying or listening by the person or persons in distress. It is noted that such receivers require relatively small power to operate and can therefore be powered by a fraction of the power that the transmitter portion of the device would require to send the aforementioned signal pulses. The receivers are also very light and small and would therefore add a negligible amount of weight to the total device weight.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In yet another embodiment, the no-battery emergency distress signal and position indication broadcasting device <b>10</b> can broadcast back a signal (e.g., a pulse) transmitted from the monitoring station. The monitoring station can then determine its distance to the transmitting device <b>10</b> using well known techniques. Then the distance information from at least two monitoring stations positioned in different locations could be used to determine the position of the transmitter device, thereby the person or persons in distress, using well known triangulation techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In yet another embodiment, the no-battery emergency distress signal and position indication broadcasting device <b>10</b> can transmit the aforementioned RF pulses, while the receiver at the monitoring station scans the horizon for the direction of a peak signal. As a result, a single monitoring station can determine the location of the device <b>10</b> by determining its distance to the device and the direction pointing to the device <b>10</b>. The process of determining the aforementioned direction becomes significantly more effective and accurate if the transmitted signal from the device <b>10</b> is polarized.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The physical configuration of the device <b>10</b> can take many forms, such as a small lightweight handheld unit, a key chain fob, or integrated into other equipment that does not ordinarily experience impact forces. The housing of the device <b>10</b> can take the form of many shapes, such as tubular, as shown in co-pending patent application Ser. No. 11/447,788 filed on Jun. 6, 2006, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the device <b>10</b> is integrated into the heel <b>42</b> of the sole <b>41</b> of a boot <b>40</b>. In such a configuration, the impact element (panel or plate) <b>22</b> can be mounted flush with a surface of the heel <b>42</b> such that the impact force <b>21</b> can be applied thereto by kicking the heel of the boot against a hard surface, such as the ground, a rock or a tree. Alternatively or in addition, the impact element can be mounted near the front sole of the shoe. The antenna <b>13</b> can be mounted as discussed above, or can be mounted on a body <b>44</b> of the boot or along the sole <b>41</b>. However, inadvertent application of the impact force to the impact element <b>22</b> would be less likely with the impact element <b>22</b> in the heel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In all embodiments, a processor can control and/or coordinate the functions with regard to each of the elements/features described above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown an embodiment of a power supply <b>50</b> using an impact (or other impulsive motion) to provide power to transmit the distress signal. The current/voltage from the power supply <b>50</b> can use energy harvesting electronics and/or electrical energy storage device(s) as are well known in the art. The power supply can comprise an impact power producing element, such as at least one mass-spring unit <b>52</b>, with at least one relatively rigid mass <b>54</b> and at least one transition element, such as one or more spring elements <b>56</b>. Although described with regard to an impact, the power supply <b>50</b> can also function with the application of other impulsive motions, such as shaking When the user impacts the impact surface <b>22</b> on a relatively rigid surface, the mass <b>54</b> is accelerated in the direction of arrow <b>58</b> during the duration of the impact.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Following the impact, the mass-spring unit <b>52</b> will begin to vibrate. The spring element(s) <b>56</b> will then exert a varying force on the piezoelectric elements <b>60</b> positioned on at least one end of the spring elements <b>56</b>, which in turn generate a varying charge with a certain voltage that is harvested by the harvesting and storage electronics and made available to power the RF pulse transmitter <b>12</b> or other powered element associated with the device/shoe. As is known in the art, the piezoelectric elements can be made in stacked form, which are widely available commercially, for low voltage applications. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the mass <b>54</b> can be positioned in between two spring elements <b>56</b>, each of which can exert a varying force on a corresponding piezoelectric element <b>60</b> positioned at two ends of the power supply <b>50</b>. The piezoelectric elements <b>60</b> can be electrically connected to the storage electronics or directly to the RF pulse transmitter <b>12</b> through appropriate wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The mass <b>54</b> can be an integral part of the spring element(s) <b>56</b> such as by constructing the entire mass-spring unit <b>52</b> with a single spring wire helically wound with at least one compressed coil section, which acts as the relatively rigid mass <b>54</b> of the mass-spring unit <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Other configurations/variations of the mass-spring unit are possible, such as those described in co-pending patent application Ser. No. 11/447,788 filed on Jun. 6, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,777,396, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">While there has been shown and described what is considered to be preferred embodiments of the invention, it will, of course, be understood that various modifications and changes in form or detail could readily be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is therefore intended that the invention be not limited to the exact forms described and illustrated, but should be constructed to cover all modifications that may fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
