<p id="p-0016" num="0015">While the invention is subject to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and the accompanying detailed description. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description are not intended to limit the invention to the particular embodiments. This disclosure is instead intended to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">IV. DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">One or more embodiments of the invention are described below. It should be noted that these and any other embodiments are exemplary and are intended to be illustrative of the invention rather than limiting. While the invention is widely applicable to different types of systems, it is impossible to include all of the possible embodiments and contexts of the invention in this disclosure. The functionality of various circuits, devices or components described herein may be implemented as hardware (including discrete components, integrated circuits and systems-on-a-chip), firmware (including application specific integrated circuits and programmable chips), software or a combination thereof, depending on the application requirements. Upon reading this disclosure, many alternative embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The following terminology may be useful in understanding the present disclosure. It is to be understood that the terminology described herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">System&#x2014;One or more interdependent elements, components, modules, or devices that co-operate to perform one or more predefined functions.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Configuration&#x2014;Describes a set up of elements, components, modules, devices, and/or a system, and refers to a process for setting, defining, or selecting hardware and/or software properties, parameters, or attributes associated with the elements, components, modules, devices, and/or the system. For example, a power converter may be configured to provide a 12 VDC output.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, digitally controlled power converters provide desired electrical power to loads such as a computer system or an electronic device, each having its own specification in terms of voltage, current, frequency, phase, quality, and other electrical parameters. A power converter (which may also be referred to as a power supply, a power regulator, a voltage regulator, a power conditioner, etc.) may typically refer to an electrical device that receives an input power signal having a first set of electrical properties and converts the signal to an output power signal having a second set of electrical properties. A direct current (DC) to DC (DC/DC) power converter is a power conversion device having both input and output signals that are DC. A digital controller such as a pulse width modulator (PWM) may be included in a digitally controlled power converter to control the output voltage at a desired set point by adjusting a duty cycle of an input voltage. Any changes in the power conversion inputs or outputs are adjusted by the digital controller to maintain the output voltage at the desired set point. Transient factors such as rapid changes in the load or input/output bus voltages may occur within a short period of time, and may cause the output voltage to increase or decrease rapidly beyond desired limits within the short time interval, thereby potentially causing harm to the load, the power converter or both. The specific time interval configured for the transient condition may be application and technology dependent and may typically vary from several microseconds to a few milliseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the digital controller used in the digitally controlled power converter may be configured to have sufficient compute power and bandwidth to process signals associated with the transient condition. That is, the digital processor which may be configured to perform multiple tasks such as monitoring of voltages and currents, communications tasks, monitoring of temperatures, and others during a normal mode of operation is configured to be able to respond in a fast enough manner to make a difference during the transient condition and thereby maintain the output voltage at the desired set point. To reduce costs, reduce power requirement, reduce area, and improve efficiency, the same digital processor is utilized to process (or control) signals associated with the normal operating mode as well as signals associated with the transient power condition in order to maintain the output voltage at the desired set point.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, a solution for detecting rapid changes in the output voltage of an improved power converter may deploy an analog circuit working in combination with a digital processor based controller. Specifically, the analog circuit may be configured to detect a rapid change in output voltage and send a signal to the processor in the controller that a large transient power change has occurred. An output current may not be measurable. However, increases in output current may be derived by measuring the output voltage at an output capacitor of the power converter. The improved combined analog/digital circuit has an extended bandwidth compared to the bandwidth of the traditional digital controller alone. The extended bandwidth enables the combined circuit to detect whether a slew rate of the output voltage exceeds a threshold value and trigger an interrupt signal to the digital processor in response to the transient power condition. The interrupt enables the digital processor to reallocate processing tasks by suspending lower priority tasks and effectively elevating processing tasks associated with the transient power condition. The digital processor is configured to scan the output voltage at a faster rate, e.g., 10&#xd7; normal, to capture the changes occurring within a short period of time. Based on the scanned value of the output voltage at the faster scan rate, the digital processor may simply turn a pulse on or off (e.g., execute on/off or binary control) to control the output voltage at the desired set point. The duration of this pulse may depend on the slew rate of the output capacitor and circuit operating conditions. For example, the duration may be dependent on the duty cycle or load at the time of the load change, and consequent capacitor slew rate event.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the analog circuit may be configured as a bandpass filter that allows signals indicative of the output voltage and having a frequency range adjacent to that of the controller to pass through, thereby extending a bandwidth of the improved combined circuit. In some applications two or more bandpass filters may be used to obtain desired bandwidth extension. One or more comparator circuits may be used to generate the interrupt signal sent to the processor if it is determined that a slew rate of the output voltage exceeds a reference threshold value. In some embodiments, two types of interrupt signals may be generated by two comparators to differentiate between a positive slew rate (e.g., when load is suddenly dropped and output voltage increases) and a negative slew rate (e.g., when load is suddenly increased and output voltage decreases).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the interrupt may cause the processor to suspend normal operation of the digital closed loop control, enable fast scan of the output voltage and enable binary control of the output voltage. The improved technique may allow loop gain factors to be increased significantly (e.g., from 5 in normal mode to 75 in transient mode) without a loss in loop stability and without causing the output voltage to exceed set point by more than desired range.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the power conversion system <b>100</b> is configured to provide configurable power to a load <b>190</b> coupled between an output terminal <b>192</b> and a reference terminal <b>194</b> such as ground. The power conversion system <b>100</b> includes a power converter input circuit <b>110</b> coupled to receive an input signal across an input terminal <b>112</b> and the reference terminal <b>194</b>, an optional transformer <b>120</b> having a primary side that is coupled to receive an output of the power converter input circuit <b>110</b> and a secondary side coupled to a power converter output circuit <b>130</b>, a filter circuit <b>140</b> coupled to receive an input from the power converter output circuit <b>130</b> and provide a power output parameter <b>198</b> (configured to be one of voltage, current, phase, and frequency measurement) at the output terminal <b>192</b>, a detector circuit <b>150</b> coupled to the output terminal <b>192</b>, and a controller <b>160</b> coupled to receive an input from the detector circuit <b>150</b> and generate a control signal <b>162</b> provided to the power converter input circuit <b>110</b> for controlling the power output parameter <b>198</b>. In some embodiments, another control signal <b>164</b> may be provided to the power converter output circuit <b>130</b> for controlling the power output parameter <b>198</b>. In some embodiments, the control signals <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> may be the same. It is understood that although the power conversion system <b>100</b> is shown to include an optional transformer <b>120</b>, the power conversion system may be configured to exclude the optional transformer <b>120</b>, e.g., in DC/DC converter applications that are not transformer isolated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the power conversion system <b>100</b> is configured to operate in one of multiple operating modes (or states) including a first mode, e.g., normal mode, and a second mode, e.g., transient power mode. The multiple operating modes may also include a diagnostic mode, test mode, startup/shutdown mode, and others. When operating in the normal mode the controller <b>160</b> scans or samples the power output parameter <b>198</b> at a first frequency, e.g., 10 kilohertz, and performs closed loop digital control, e.g., PID control, by modulating a pulse width of the control signal <b>162</b> to maintain the power output parameter <b>198</b> at the desired set point. When operating in the transient power mode the controller <b>160</b> scans or samples the power output parameter <b>198</b> at a second frequency, e.g., 100 kilohertz, and performs binary digital control, e.g., on/off control, by asserting or deasserting the control signal <b>162</b> to maintain the power output parameter <b>198</b> at the desired set point. Thus, the second frequency may be configured to be sufficient (e.g., as defined by Nyquist criteria) to scan the values of the power output parameter <b>198</b> during the transient power condition, e.g., it may be configured to be 10&#xd7; greater than the first frequency. A bandwidth of the power conversion system <b>100</b> operating in the normal mode may be limited due to a lower value of the first frequency, e.g., 10 kilohertz. This bandwidth may be insufficient to sample signals at the second frequency that may be required to process transient power condition signals. Switching to the transient switching mode may automatically extend the bandwidth of the power conversion system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the power specifications for some loads may require that the power output parameter <b>198</b> (such as the output voltage) be maintained within X% of a specified value and be independent of the operating mode of the power conversion system <b>100</b>. For example, a manufacturer of a hybrid transportation vehicle (having an electric drive powered by one or more 12V rechargeable batteries) may require that the controller <b>160</b> is able to maintain the power output parameter <b>198</b> at 12 VDC or within 10% of its nominal value during normal and transient power condition. A transient power condition may be defined to occur when a power parameter changes by more than X% over a predefined short time period, e.g., when there is a 10% to 100% change in output current over a 100 microsecond time interval as a ramp function. It is understood that the particular values for X and the predefined short time period selected to define the transient power condition may depend on the application and the technology. Thus, the specific time interval for the transient condition may typically vary from several microseconds to few milliseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the controller <b>160</b> may be configured to perform tasks such as communications with other devices via a controller area network (CAN) bus (a well known communication standard used in the automotive/transportation industry) and monitoring of heat sink temperature in addition to performing sampling and control functions. The controller <b>160</b> may be configured to switch from operating in the normal mode to the transient mode in response to the detector circuit <b>150</b> detecting the transient power condition. The switching of the modes enables the controller <b>160</b> to allocate additional processing (or controller) resources to handle the transient power condition compared to the resources allocated to handle events in the normal mode. For example, the lower priority tasks such as communications and temperature monitoring may be suspended during the transient power condition. Therefore, by utilizing the same controller <b>160</b> to process inputs and outputs during the normal mode as well as the transient mode (thereby providing the control), the requirement for allocating separate dedicated devices to handle various modes is eliminated, thereby reducing costs, reducing power requirement, reducing silicon area requirement, and improving converter efficiency. Additional details of the controller <b>160</b> and the detector circuit <b>150</b> are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the detector circuit <b>150</b> may be configured to include one or more bandpass filters coupled to one or more comparators depending on the application and bandwidth requirements. In the depicted embodiment, the detector circuit <b>150</b> includes a first bandpass filter <b>210</b> coupled in parallel with a second bandpass filter <b>220</b>. Each one of the first bandpass filter <b>210</b> and the second bandpass filter <b>220</b> is coupled to the output terminal <b>192</b> to receive a signal indicative of the power output parameter <b>198</b>. The first bandpass filter <b>210</b> may be configured to pass a signal having a frequency between a configurable first frequency range <b>212</b> and the second bandpass filter <b>220</b> may be configured to pass a signal having a frequency between a configurable second frequency range <b>222</b>, the configurable second frequency range <b>222</b> being disposed adjacent to the configurable first frequency range <b>212</b> (e.g., share one or more overlapping frequencies which lie towards the upper limit of the first frequency range <b>212</b> and the lower limit of the second frequency range <b>222</b>). It is understood that at least one bandpass filter is desired to be included in the detector circuit <b>150</b>. A specific number of bandpass filters included in the detector circuit <b>150</b> may depend upon factors such as analog component value selection limitations, the bandwidth requirements to handle the transient condition and others. A center frequency and bandwidth calculation may be performed for each bandpass filter to ensure the controller <b>160</b> and the detector circuit <b>150</b> combined provide the overall bandwidth for handling the transient power condition.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, each of the output the first bandpass filter <b>210</b> and the second bandpass filter <b>220</b> may be combined with a Vref <b>234</b> input (used as a set point) in a summation node <b>230</b> to generate an output <b>232</b> provided to a first comparator <b>240</b> and a second comparator <b>250</b>. The Vref <b>234</b> input may be generated as a scaled and averaged value of the power output parameter <b>198</b> provided by the controller <b>160</b>. In addition, the Vref <b>234</b> input may be generated using digital circuit, analog circuit or a combination thereof. The detector circuit <b>150</b> may include a current estimator circuit <b>260</b> coupled to the output terminal <b>192</b> to receive the signal indicative of the power output parameter <b>198</b> for estimating an output current <b>262</b>. The current estimator circuit <b>260</b> may be included a scaling and averaging function to derive the output current from the power output parameter <b>198</b>. The scaled and averaged value of the output current <b>262</b> is provided to the controller <b>160</b>. The controller <b>160</b> may perform an analog-to-digital conversion (A/D) on the scaled and averaged value of the output current <b>262</b> for use in controlling the power output parameter <b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is understood that at least one comparator is desired to be included in the detector circuit <b>150</b>. A specific number of comparators included in the detector circuit <b>150</b> may depend upon factors such as degrees of control desired. For example, in the depicted embodiment, two comparators may be included to determine a positive or negative slope of the power output parameter <b>198</b>. That is, determine whether the change in load current is positive or negative.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the first comparator <b>240</b> compares a first reference value <b>242</b> to the output <b>232</b> of the summation node <b>230</b> to determine whether a first interrupt <b>244</b> is asserted or deasserted, the assertion of the first interrupt <b>244</b> being indicative of the transient power condition. Thus, the first reference value <b>242</b> is configurable as the threshold value to generate the first interrupt <b>244</b>. In an embodiment, a slew rate (may be positive or negative) of the output <b>232</b>, which is indicative of a slew rate of the power output parameter <b>198</b>, may be compared to a threshold to determine the transient power condition and assert the first interrupt <b>244</b>. Similarly, if configured the second comparator <b>250</b> compares a second reference value <b>252</b> to the output <b>232</b> of the summation node <b>230</b> to determine whether a second interrupt <b>254</b> is asserted or deasserted, the assertion of the second interrupt <b>254</b> being indicative of the transient power condition. Thus, the second reference value <b>252</b> is configurable as the threshold value to generate the second interrupt <b>254</b>. In an embodiment, a slew rate (may be positive or negative) of the output <b>232</b>, which is indicative of a slew rate of the power output parameter <b>198</b>, may be compared to a threshold to determine the transient power condition and assert the second interrupt <b>254</b>. The first reference value <b>242</b> and the second reference value <b>252</b> may be averaged based on a pulse width modulator output value (e.g., based on control signals <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>) provided by the controller <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the controller <b>160</b> includes a processor <b>270</b> configured to execute one or more logic instructions to perform control of the power conversion system <b>100</b>. The processor <b>270</b>, which may be configured to operate in the normal, transient condition mode, and others, may be coupled to the following inputs and outputs to perform the control functions: the output current <b>262</b> received from the current estimator circuit <b>260</b> as an input, the first interrupt <b>244</b> and the second interrupt <b>254</b> as inputs, the control signals <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> as an output (e.g., PWM output) to control a pulse width of the input signal received across terminal <b>112</b> and terminal <b>194</b>. The control signals <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> may also be used to derive the first reference value <b>242</b> and the second reference value <b>252</b> for the comparators <b>240</b> and <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the processor <b>270</b> while operating in the normal mode may receive at least one interrupt signal in response to the transient power condition detected by the detector circuit <b>160</b>, e.g., by the detector circuit <b>160</b> asserting one of the first interrupt <b>244</b> or the second interrupt <b>254</b>. In response to the interrupt, the processor <b>270</b> is switched to operate in the transient power mode from the normal mode, thereby enabling the processor <b>270</b> to allocate greater processing resources to process the power output parameter <b>198</b> associated with the transient power condition compared to resources allocated by the processor <b>270</b> operating in the normal mode to process the power output parameter <b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, another interrupt (may be received via the same signal path as the first interrupt <b>244</b> or the second interrupt <b>254</b>) is received by the processor <b>270</b> indicative of an absence of the transient power condition. For example, when the value of the power output parameter <b>198</b> returns to a threshold limit (e.g., 0.5 volts) compared to the set point value then it may be determined that the transient power condition does not exist. In response to receiving this interrupt, the processor <b>270</b> is switched to operate in the normal mode from the transient power mode. To facilitate a smooth transfer between the modes, the processor <b>270</b> adjusts the proportional gain value (e.g., 75 to 5) so that the value of the power output parameter <b>198</b> does not experience a discontinuity. In addition, the reduction in gain may be desired to maintain stability when normal operating mode is reasserted and the sampling frequency is decreased from 100 kHz to 10 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the allocation of greater processing resources by the process <b>270</b> may include the following: modifying a frequency of processing the power output parameter <b>198</b> from the first frequency to a second frequency, suspending the execution of non-critical tasks (or tasks having lower priority compared to a threshold) such as communications and temperature monitoring tasks, and suspending execution of digital closed loop control, e.g., PID control by linear adjustment of PWM. The processor <b>270</b> determines whether an interrupt received is the first interrupt <b>244</b> or the second interrupt <b>254</b> and adjusts the control signals <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> in a binary manner to a logic high or logic low accordingly. That is, the control signals <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> may be asserted or deasserted in a non-linear manner at each scan (occurring at the second frequency). The control signals <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> may be asserted or deasserted until another interrupt is received by the processor <b>270</b> indicative of an absence of the transient power condition. In some embodiments, the elements <b>240</b>, <b>254</b> may be duplicated for improved performance during a transient. In addition, the duplicated circuitry for generating the interrupt signals may be used in conjunction with elements <b>240</b>, <b>254</b> for improved transient performance.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described herein, a traditional digitally controlled power converter may not include a processor that switches from a second operating mode to a first operating mode in response to receiving an interrupt signal that is indicative of a transient power condition. A transient power condition occurs in the traditional digitally controlled power converter at time t<b>0</b> <b>312</b> when a load current (illustrated by graph <b>310</b>) jumps from about 12 amperes to about 112 amperes within a fraction of a millisecond (e.g., 100 microseconds).

The inductor current (illustrated by graph <b>320</b>) overshoots to about 140 amperes as the traditional digitally controlled power converter attempts to supply the required increase within several milliseconds at time t<b>3</b> <b>340</b>. The output voltage (illustrated by graph <b>330</b>) drops by more than 30% (e.g., from a set point of 12 volts to about 8 volts at time t<b>2</b> <b>332</b>. After an initial overshoot to above 13 volts, the traditional digitally controlled power converter attempts to stabilize the output voltage to 12 volts within several milliseconds.

The controller <b>160</b> asserts the control signals <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> twice (illustrated by 2 PWM on/off pulses <b>352</b>) to increase the power output parameter <b>198</b> in response to the detector circuit <b>160</b> determining that the power output parameter <b>198</b> is less than the set point of 12 volts, the decrease in voltage caused by the sudden jump in load current to 112 amperes.
