The contact wiring <b>77</b> may be separately formed from the source electrode <b>71</b>, and a separate wiring may be formed to connect the contact wiring <b>77</b> and the source electrode <b>71</b> so that a bias voltage applied to the source electrode <b>71</b> may be applied to the body contact region using the separate wiring. Furthermore, without formation of the contact wiring <b>77</b>, the source electrode <b>71</b> may be directly contacted to the body contact region <b>37</b> through the contact <b>67</b>, and the voltage is applied to the body contact region <b>37</b> from the source electrode <b>71</b>.</p>

A fabrication method of the thin film transistor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, is described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After forming a buffer layer <b>20</b> on an insulating substrate <b>10</b> and depositing an amorphous silicon film on the buffer layer <b>20</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the deposited amorphous silicon film is crystallized into a polysilicon film using an ordinary crystallization method, and the polysilicon film is patterned to form an island shaped active layer <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Subsequently, a first photosensitive film (not illustrated on drawing) is formed so that only a portion of the active layer <b>30</b>, on which the body contact region <b>37</b> is to be formed, is exposed. The body contact region <b>37</b> is formed by ion implanting high concentration impurities of a first conductivity type into the exposed portion of the active layer, using the first photosensitive film as a mask. The body contact region <b>37</b> is formed in such a way that one side surface of the body contact region <b>37</b> is contacted with the channel region <b>35</b>, and the body contact region <b>37</b> is separated from the source/drain regions <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> by the channel region <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, a gate insulation film <b>40</b> is formed on the substrate, and a conductive material such as a metallic material is deposited on the gate insulation film <b>40</b> and patterned to form a gate electrode <b>50</b>. A second photosensitive film (not illustrated on drawing) is formed on a portion of the gate insulation film <b>40</b> corresponding to the body contact region <b>37</b>, and the source/drain regions <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> are formed by ion implanting impurities of a second conductivity type, different from the first conductivity type of the body contact region <b>37</b>, into the active layer <b>30</b> using the gate electrode <b>50</b> and the second photosensitive film as a mask.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Contacts <b>61</b>, <b>63</b>, and <b>67</b>, exposing the source/drain regions <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> and the body contact region <b>37</b>, respectively, are formed by etching an interlayer insulation film <b>60</b> and the gate insulation film <b>40</b> after depositing the interlayer insulation film <b>60</b> on the substrate. Subsequently, the source/drain electrodes <b>71</b> and <b>73</b>, respectively connected to the source/drain regions <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> through the contacts <b>61</b> and <b>63</b>, are formed. The contact wiring <b>77</b>, which is directly connected to one of the source/drain electrodes <b>71</b> and <b>73</b>, and electrically connected to the body contact region <b>37</b> through contact <b>67</b>, is formed, by depositing a conductive material such as a metallic material on the substrate, and then patterning the deposited conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment of the present invention, the body contact region <b>37</b> functions as a bias supply layer which discharges hot carriers generated in the channel layer <b>35</b> by applying a certain voltage to the channel layer <b>35</b>. Therefore, the structure of the active layer <b>30</b> and the position in the active layer <b>30</b> at which the body contact region <b>37</b> is formed are not limited to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Therefore, many structures are possible in which the body contact region <b>37</b> is formed on active layer <b>30</b> so that the body contact region <b>37</b> is contacted with the channel layer <b>35</b>, and is separated from the source/drain regions <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>, so as to discharge undesired hot carriers generated in the channel layer <b>35</b> at the drain side by applying a certain voltage to the channel layer <b>35</b> through the body contact region <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although the source/drain regions <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> are formed after forming the body contact region <b>37</b> in this embodiment of the present invention, the body contact region <b>37</b> can also be formed after forming the source/drain regions <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>. This is accomplished by forming the first photosensitive film on the gate insulation film <b>40</b> so that only a portion of the gate insulation film <b>40</b> corresponding to the body contact region <b>37</b> is exposed and ion implanting impurities of the first conductivity type into the active layer <b>30</b> using the first photosensitive film as a mask after forming the source/drain regions <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> of the second conductivity type using the second photosensitive film and the gate electrode <b>50</b> as a mask.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, the source/drain regions <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> can be applied to a thin film transistor having an LDD structure of a high concentration impurity region and a low concentration impurity region, although it is described in the embodiment of the present invention discussed above that the body contact region <b>37</b> is formed on a thin film transistor in which the source/drain regions <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> are comprised of high concentration impurity regions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The hot carriers generated at the interface between the drain region <b>33</b> and the channel region <b>35</b> by a lateral electric field of the drain region <b>33</b> during operation of the thin film transistor having the foregoing structure are drawn through the body contact region <b>37</b>, so that a kink effect can be prevented by preventing the hot carriers from moving to the source region <b>31</b>.</p>
