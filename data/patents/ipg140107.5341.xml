<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a map information processing apparatus, a map update information storage medium, a map update information data structure, a map update information creating system, and a map information updating system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A prior art system, such as a navigation apparatus, that provides the user with map information for the user's convenience is known. Such a prior art system needs to revise map information at fixed intervals according to changes in roads with respect to time, and always needs to provide the user with the latest map information. To this end, there has been provided an apparatus for updating map information based on difference information about road maps (see patent reference 1, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This prior art apparatus for updating map information based on difference information about road maps receives difference map information containing update data from a map transmitting means, such as a map data supply server, and stores the difference map information as received map information. The prior art apparatus then compares the received map information with previous map information, and determines which portion of the previous map information is to be updated and then extracts the determined portion as inherent difference map information. The prior art apparatus creates and outputs new map information by applying the inherent difference map information to the previous map information. Thus, since the prior art apparatus for updating map information based on difference information about road maps, which is the receiving side, can flexibly select data which should be applied to the previous map information, the map transmitting means, which is the transmitting side, need not grasp the update condition of the terminal equipment correctly. Since the prior art apparatus does not have to carryout fine control of the version of the difference map information, the structure of the prior art apparatus can be simplified.

    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">[Patent reference 1] Japanese patent application publication (TOKKAI) No. 2002-296042</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">The technique disclosed by above-mentioned patent reference 1 has the following problems when further upgrading the map information which has been upgraded once according to changes in the map information which have occurred after the previous upgrading. In accordance with the prior art technique, the map transmitting means transmits changes in the map information which have occurred until now after a past time to the prior art apparatus for updating map information based on difference information about road maps at once. The prior art apparatus then compares all the received changes in the map information with map information being held thereby so as to extract a difference between all the received changes and the currently-held map information from all the received changes, and then combines the extracted information and the currently-held map information so as to update the currently-held map information.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">When updating the currently-held map information, the prior art apparatus for updating map information based on difference information about road maps performs comparison between all the received changes in the map information and the map information being held thereby for each of components, such as roads and buildings. When performing comparison for each component included in the received change information, the prior art apparatus determines whether the component in question is the same as one of all components of the currently-held map information based on the lasting attributes of all the components of the currently-held map information. The lasting attributes of each component include a road shape, a road name, a route number, a VICS (Vehicle Information and Communication System) link number, names of intersecting roads, intersection names, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">However, there is no guarantee that these attributes are lasting, and therefore it can be predicted that the comparison between all the received changes in the map information and the map information being held by the prior art apparatus becomes difficult. A further problem is that it takes much time for the prior art apparatus to perform the comparison between all the received changes in the map information and the map information being held thereby.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">The present invention is made in order to solve the above-mentioned problems, and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a map information processing apparatus, a map update information storage medium, a map update information data structure, a map update information creating system, and a map information updating system which can revise map information surely and quickly.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0045">The preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing the structure of a map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 1 of the present invention. This map information updating system is roughly divided into a map update information creating system and a car navigation apparatus <b>2</b>. The car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> is equivalent to a map information processing apparatus in accordance with the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each arrow that connects between two components of the map information updating system indicates a data flow, and the flows of control signals are not illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047">The map update information creating system <b>1</b> can be constructed of a computer system, for example. Every time when the map information is revised, the map update information creating system <b>1</b> creates map update information used for updating yet-to-be-revised map information and records the map update information in a DVD-ROM <b>8</b>. The details of this map update information creating system <b>1</b> will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">A vehicle speed sensor <b>3</b>, an angular velocity sensor <b>4</b>, a GPS receiving antenna <b>5</b>, a display device <b>6</b>, and an input device <b>7</b> are connected to the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">The vehicle speed sensor <b>3</b> detects the speed of a vehicle in which the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> concerned is mounted, and then sends speed information indicating the speed of the vehicle to the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b>. The angular velocity sensor <b>4</b> detects the direction in which the vehicle, in which the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> concerned is mounted, is traveling, and sends direction information indicating the direction to the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b>. The GPS receiving antenna <b>5</b> receives position information from GPS satellites, and sends it to the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b>. The vehicle speed sensor <b>3</b>, the angular velocity sensor <b>4</b>, and the GPS receiving antenna <b>5</b> are used in order to detect the current position of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">The display device <b>6</b> is constructed of an LCD, for example, and displays information received from the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b>. A map and various messages can be displayed on the display device <b>6</b>. The input device <b>7</b> is used in order for the user to provide various instructions to the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b>. For example, the user uses the input device <b>7</b> in order to input a desired map area to be displayed on the display device <b>6</b>, and a start point and an end point when the user desires to cause the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> to determine an optimal route between the start point and the end point.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">The DVD-ROM <b>8</b> can be inserted and detached into and from the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b>. The DVD-ROM <b>8</b> corresponds to a map update information storage medium and a map update information storage means in accordance with the present invention. One or more pieces of map update information can be stored in this DVD-ROM <b>8</b>. Every time when the map information is revised, map update information is created and is comprised of a variation between the yet-to-be-revised map information and the revised map information (which will be mentioned later in detail). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, three pieces of map update information: map update information <b>30</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.0 to 1.1, map update information <b>31</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.1 to 1.2, and map update information <b>32</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.2 to 1.3 are stored in the DVD-ROM <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">The car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> is provided with an on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b>, a route computation unit <b>11</b>, a display control unit <b>12</b>, an input receiving unit <b>13</b>, a position determination unit <b>14</b>, a hard disk (HDD) <b>15</b>, a hard disk (HDD) access unit <b>16</b>, a temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, a DVD-ROM drive <b>18</b>, a map update information selection unit <b>19</b>, and a map information updating unit <b>20</b>. The on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b>, the route computation unit <b>11</b>, the display control unit <b>12</b>, the input receiving unit <b>13</b>, the position determination unit <b>14</b>, the hard disk access unit <b>16</b>, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b>, and the map information updating unit <b>20</b> are implemented by processes performed by a microcomputer not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">The on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> carries out computations for displaying a map image on the display device <b>6</b> based on the map information (e.g., the one of version 1.1) which the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> retrieves from the hard disk <b>15</b> by way of the hard disk access unit <b>16</b>. The displayed map area is specified by the current position information determined by the position determination unit <b>14</b>, and is specified by the user's input information about the desired map area which is received by the input receiving unit <b>13</b>. Computation results acquired by the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> are sent to the display control unit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">The route computation unit <b>11</b> determines an optimal route from the current position or the indicating start position to the indicated destination based on the map information (e.g., the one of version 1.1) which the route computation unit <b>11</b> retrieves from the hard disk <b>15</b> by way of the hard disk access unit <b>16</b>, the current position information which the route computation unit <b>11</b> also retrieves from the position determination unit <b>14</b>, and information indicating the start point and the end point of the route which the route computation unit <b>11</b> also retrieves from the input device <b>7</b> by way of the input receiving unit <b>13</b>. Information indicating the optimal route determined by the route computation unit <b>11</b> is then sent to the display control unit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">The display control unit <b>12</b> creates either an image signal for displaying a map image which is based on the computation results sent from the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or an image signal for displaying the optimal route which is based on the information indicating the optimal route sent from the route computation unit <b>11</b> on an on-screen map, and then sends the image signal to the display device <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">The input receiving unit <b>13</b> sends the information indicating the on-screen map area inputted from the input device <b>7</b> to the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b>, as mentioned above, and also sends the information indicating the start point and the end point of the route which are inputted from the input device <b>7</b> to the route computation unit <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">The position determination unit <b>14</b> detects the current position of the vehicle in which the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> concerned is mounted based on the speed information from the vehicle speed sensor <b>3</b>, the direction information from the angular velocity sensor <b>4</b>, and the position information from the GPS receiving antenna <b>5</b>. The current position information indicating the current position of the vehicle detected by the position determination unit <b>14</b> is then sent to both the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> and the route computation unit <b>11</b>, as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">The hard disk <b>15</b> corresponds to a map information storage unit and an updated map information storage unit in accordance with the present invention. The updated map information (e.g., the one of version 1.3 in the illustrated example) created by map information revision (or upgrading), as well as the map information (e.g., the one of version 1.1 in the illustrated example) which had been pre-installed at the time of purchase, are stored in the hard disk <b>15</b>. The details of this revising processing will be mentioned later.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">The hard disk access unit <b>16</b> reads the map information <b>21</b> from the hard disk <b>15</b>, and performs a control process of writing the updated map information <b>22</b> in the hard disk <b>15</b>. Concretely, the hard disk access unit <b>16</b> sends the map information <b>21</b> which it reads from the hard disk <b>15</b> to the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, and also writes the updated map information <b>22</b> which is created on the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> in the hard disk <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">The temporary storage memory <b>17</b> is used as a work memory when the map information updating unit <b>20</b> updates the map information stored in the hard disk <b>15</b> according to one or more pieces of map update information selected and retrieved by the map update information selection unit <b>19</b>. Therefore, this temporary storage memory <b>17</b> can be accessed by the hard disk access unit <b>16</b>, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b>, and the map information updating unit <b>20</b>. The temporary storage memory <b>17</b> is also used as a work memory when the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> and the route computation unit <b>11</b> work.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">The DVD-ROM drive <b>18</b> reads one or more pieces of map update information stored in the inserted DVD-ROM <b>8</b>, and sends it to the map update information selection unit <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">The map update information selection unit <b>19</b> selects and retrieves a piece of map update information required for updating the map information <b>21</b> stored in the hard disk <b>15</b> from among the one or more pieces of map update information read from the DVD-ROM <b>8</b> inserted into the DVD-ROM drive <b>18</b>, and sends the retrieved piece of map update information to the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, since the map information <b>21</b> stored in the hard disk <b>15</b> is the one of version 1.1, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> selects and retrieves both the map update information <b>31</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.1 to 1.2 and the map update information <b>32</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.2 to 1.3, and sends them to the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">The map information updating unit <b>20</b> performs a process of updating the map information <b>21</b> which is read from the hard disk <b>15</b> by way of the hard disk access unit <b>16</b> and is temporarily stored into the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> according to the map update information which is selected and retrieved by the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> and is temporarily stored into the primary storage memory <b>17</b>. The map information on which the updating process is performed on the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> is sent to the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> and the route computation unit <b>11</b>. The updated map information is also saved in the hard disk <b>15</b> by way of the hard disk access unit <b>16</b>, as updated map information <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">Next, the operation of the car navigation apparatus which has the structure as mentioned above and which constitutes the map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 1 of the present invention will be explained with reference to a flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">Hereafter, it is assumed that the map information updating system performs an updating process on the map information <b>21</b> of version 1.1 stored in the hard disk <b>15</b> of the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> by using the DVD-ROM <b>8</b> in which the map update information <b>30</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.0 to 1.1, the map update information <b>31</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.1 to 1.2, and the map update information <b>32</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.2 to 1.3 are recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">Initially, the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> is placed in a state in which it is waiting for a request for retrieval of map information (in step ST<b>10</b>), and checks to see whether either the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or the route computation unit <b>11</b> has made a request for retrieval of map information (in step ST<b>11</b>). When determining that no request for retrieval of map information has been made, the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> returns to step ST<b>10</b> in which it is placed in the request waiting state in which it is waiting for a request for retrieval of map information again.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">When, in step ST<b>11</b>, determining that a request for retrieval of map information has been made while repeating those steps ST<b>10</b> and ST<b>11</b>, the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> reads map information corresponding to the request (in step ST<b>12</b>). In other words, the hard disk access unit <b>16</b> reads map information about a map area, which is specified by the request for retrieval of map information, from the map information <b>21</b> of version 1.1 stored in the hard disk <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">The map information read in step ST<b>12</b> is then stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> (in step ST<b>13</b>). The version of the map information is then determined (in step ST<b>14</b>). In this case, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> determines the version of the map information stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> as &#x201c;1.1&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069">The map update information selection unit <b>19</b> then performs a process of selecting one or more pieces of map update information (in steps ST<b>15</b> to ST<b>19</b>). In this map update information selection processing, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> checks to see whether there is any yet-to-be-checked map update information (in step ST<b>15</b>). Concretely, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> reads a piece of map update information stored in the DVD-ROM <b>8</b>, and then checks to see whether or not it is yet to be checked, that is, whether processes of steps ST<b>16</b> and later have been performed on the read piece of map update information. Therefore, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> initially determines that all pieces of map update information stored in the DVD-ROM <b>8</b> are yet to be checked.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">When, in step ST<b>15</b>, determining that there is one or more pieces of yet-to-be-checked map update information, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> selects and retrieves one of the one or more pieces of yet-to-be-checked map update information (in step ST<b>16</b>). The map update information selection unit <b>19</b> then checks to see whether or not the version of target map information to which the selected map update information is to be applied to update the target map information is earlier than the version of the map information <b>21</b> to be updated (in step ST<b>17</b>). When then determining that the version of target map information to which the selected map update information is to be applied is earlier than the version of the map information <b>21</b> to be updated, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> returns to step ST<b>15</b> because there is no necessity to update the map information <b>21</b> by using the selected map update information.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">On the other hand, when, in step ST<b>17</b>, determining that the version of target map information to which the selected map update information is to be applied is not earlier than the version of the map information <b>21</b> to be updated, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> checks to see whether the map update information selected in step ST<b>16</b> includes map update information about the requested map area specified by the map information retrieval request (in step ST<b>18</b>). When determining that the selected map update information includes no map update information about the requested map area, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> returns to step ST<b>15</b> in which it repeatedly performs the above-mentioned processing.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">On the other hand, when, in step ST<b>18</b>, determining that the selected map update information includes map update information about the requested map area specified by the map information retrieval request, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> stores the map update information about the requested map area in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> (in step ST<b>19</b>). After that, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> returns to step ST<b>15</b> in which it repeatedly performs the above-mentioned processing. When, in step ST<b>15</b>, determining that there is no more yet-to-be-checked map update information, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> selects and retrieves both the map update information <b>31</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.1 to 1.2 and the map update information <b>32</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.2 to 1.3, and then stores them in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">After, in step ST<b>15</b>, determining that there is no more yet-to-be-checked map update information, the map information updating unit <b>20</b> checks to see whether any yet-to-be-applied map update information is stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> (in step ST<b>20</b>). When determining that one or more pieces of yet-to-be-applied map update information are stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, the map information updating unit <b>20</b> selects the map update information that can be applied to the earliest version of target map information from the one or more pieces of yet-to-be-applied map update information (in step ST<b>21</b>). The map information updating unit <b>20</b> then updates the map information <b>21</b> by using the selected map update information (in step ST<b>22</b>). After that, the map information updating unit <b>20</b> returns to step ST<b>20</b> in which it repeatedly performs the above-mentioned processing. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, by repeatedly performing the above-mentioned steps ST<b>20</b> to ST<b>22</b>, the map information updating unit <b>20</b> applies the map update information <b>31</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.1 to 1.2 to the map information <b>21</b>, and, after that, applies the map update information <b>32</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.2 to 1.3 to the updated map information to which the map update information <b>31</b> has been applied so as to create updated map information <b>22</b> of version 1.3.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">When, in step ST<b>20</b>, determining that no more yet-to-be-applied map update information is stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, the map information updating unit <b>20</b> checks to see whether map update information has been applied to the map information <b>21</b> at least once (in step ST<b>23</b>). When determining that map update information has been applied to the map information <b>21</b> at least once, the car navigation apparatus stores the updated map information <b>22</b> in the hard disk <b>15</b> (in step ST<b>24</b>). In other words, the hard disk access unit <b>16</b> reads the updated map information <b>22</b> from the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, and then stores it in the hard disk <b>15</b>. After that, the updated map information <b>22</b> is sent to the source of the request for retrieval of map information (in step ST<b>25</b>). In other words, the car navigation apparatus reads the updated map information <b>22</b> from the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, and then sends it to either the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or the route computation unit <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">In contrast, when, in step ST<b>23</b>, determining that no map update information has been applied to the map information <b>21</b>, the car navigation apparatus sends the map information <b>21</b> stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> to the source of the request for retrieval of map information (in step ST<b>26</b>). In other words, the car navigation apparatus sends the map information <b>21</b> stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> to either the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or the route computation unit <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">As previously explained, the map information updating system in accordance with this embodiment 1 can apply one or more pieces of map update information which were created every time when map information was revised and which are pre-recorded in one DVD-ROM to the car navigation apparatus. Therefore, the map information updating system can easily carry out management of the version of the map information stored therein. The map information updating system can also revise the map information surely and quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">In accordance with this embodiment, one or more pieces of map update information are pre-stored in the DVD-ROM and are applied to the car navigation apparatus as needed. Instead of the DVD-ROM, a storage media, such as a small hard disk or a memory card, can be used to store the one or more pieces of map update information which can be applied to the car navigation apparatus. As an alternative, the car navigation apparatus can acquire the one or more pieces of map update information via broadcasting or via a communication link.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">In accordance with this embodiment, the map information and the updated map information are stored in the same hard disk, as previously mentioned. As an alternative, they can be stored in different storage media, respectively. In addition, the map information can be stored in a storage media, such as a DVD-ROM, rather than the hard disk.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">A map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 2 of the present invention is so constructed as to update map information by inserting map update information into the map information.

<p id="p-0087" num="0087">A map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 3 of the present invention is so constructed as to, in response to a request for retrieval of map information, update the map information as needed by adding a part of map update information to the end of the map information as an update record group, storing another part of the map update information, as a reference table, in a temporary storage memory, and by sending the map information, to which the update record group is added, and the reference table back to the source of the request.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">The map information updating system in accordance with this embodiment 3 has the same structure as that of above-mentioned embodiment 1. Hereafter, a method of updating map information which a map information updating unit <b>20</b> of the map information updating system employs will be explained mainly, by taking a case where the map information is updated from version 1.1 to version 1.3 as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are diagrams each showing a road network that represents a map. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows a map of version 1.1, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows a map of version 1.2. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, each mark O represents a node showing an intersection or the like, each line segment between two nodes represents a link showing a road between two nodes, and Ni (i=0, 1, 2, . . . ) represents a node number. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> show that a node N<b>5</b> and a link which connects this node N<b>5</b> and a node N<b>3</b> are added when the map information is revised from version 1.1 to version 1.2.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, each of the road networks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> can be represented by a node record group which is a set of node records each representing a node, a link record group which is a set of link records each representing a link, and a cost record group which is a set of cost records each representing a cost at which vehicles travel a corresponding link. Marks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref> have the same meanings as those used in above-mentioned embodiment 2 (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">In accordance with this embodiment 3, the map update information is constructed of the update record group and the reference table. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the update record group includes a node record group, a link record group, and a cost record group which are targets to be updated, and is added to the end of the map information (version 1.2) that is the target to be updated.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0092">The reference table includes records each of which includes a type of data to be updated or added, a type of updating, a target record number indicating the location of the data to be updated or a location where the data is to be added, and an update record number indicating a record containing the contents of the data, each of the records corresponding to one record of the update record group, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. This reference table corresponds to elements at the first through third columns of the map update information in accordance with embodiment 2 shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, and the update record group corresponds to the contents of the data at the fourth column of the map update information in accordance with embodiment 2 shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0093">In a car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> that can handle map update information having the above-mentioned structure, when a piece of map update information selected and retrieved by a map update information selection unit <b>19</b> is stored in a temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, a map information updating unit <b>20</b> adds data at the fourth column of the selected map update information, as an update record group, to the end of the map information of version 1.2 which is the target to be updated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. The map information updating unit <b>20</b> then creates a reference table based on data at the first through third columns of the selected map update information, and stores the reference table in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">When receiving a request for retrieval of map information from either an on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or a route computation unit <b>11</b>, the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> sends the map information to which the update record group shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is added and the reference table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, which are stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, as updated map information, to either the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or the route computation unit <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0095">The on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or the route computation unit <b>11</b> interprets the map information sent thereto while referring to the reference table. For example, based on the update record number #<b>3</b> of the reference table, the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or the route computation unit <b>11</b> adds the update record #<b>3</b> of the update record group to the end of the link record #<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0096">As previously explained, the map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 3 of the present invention need not process existing map information based on map update information, and only has to divide the map update information into an update record group and a reference table, adds the update record group to the end of the existing map information, and stores the map information to which the update record group is added and the reference table in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>. Therefore, the processing performed by the map information updating unit <b>20</b> can be simplified.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment 4</heading>
<p id="p-0097" num="0097">In a map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 4 of the present invention, map update information includes both difference information, which contains variations in map information, and replacement information, which is map information of the latest version. The map information updating system in accordance with this embodiment 4 has the same structure as that of above-mentioned embodiment 1. A method of updating map information will be explained mainly.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram schematically showing the process of updating map information. In this example, in a car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> in which map information of version 1.1 is pre-installed in a hard disk <b>15</b>, the map information is updated to version 1.3.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0099">The map information of version 1.1 stored in the hard disk <b>15</b> includes data A, B, C, and D. Map update information which is stored in a DVD-ROM <b>8</b> and is provided for the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> is used for updating the map information of version 1.1 or later to version 1.3, and includes map update information <b>30</b> which is difference information used for updating data A and B of the map information of version 1.0 to version 1.1, map update information <b>31</b> which is difference information used for updating data A and B of the map information of version 1.1 to version 1.2, map update information <b>32</b> which is difference information used for updating data A and B of the map information of version 1.2 to version 1.3, and replacement information which is data C of version 1.3 and replacement information which is data D of version 1.3. Each replacement information includes information which is not appropriate to be updated using difference information (e.g., color information, voice recognition information, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0100">When the DVD-ROM <b>8</b> is inserted into a DVD-ROM drive <b>18</b> of the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b>, a map update information selection unit <b>19</b> selects and retrieves all the pieces of replacement information from the map update information stored in the DVD-ROM <b>8</b>, and sends them to a temporary storage memory <b>17</b> (in step S<b>1</b>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, since the two pieces of replacement information correspond to the data C and D, respectively, a map information updating unit <b>20</b> replaces the data C and D included in the map information of version 1.1 with the two pieces of replacement information of version 1.3 stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0101">As for the data A and B which are to be updated using difference information, by using the method explained in above-mentioned embodiments 1, 2, and 3, the map information updating unit <b>20</b> applies both the map update information <b>31</b> which is the difference information used for updating the map information of version 1.1 to the one of version 1.2 and the map update information <b>32</b> which is the difference information used for updating the map information of version 1.2 to the one of version 1.3 to the data A and B included in the map information of version 1.1 one by one so as to create the data A and B of version 1.3.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0102">After the two pieces of map update information stored in the DVD-ROM <b>8</b> are thus applied to the map information stored in the hard disk <b>15</b>, the contents of the hard disk <b>15</b> are so updated as to have the data A which is updated to version 1.3 using the difference information, the data B which is updated to version 1.3 using the difference information, the data C of version 1.3 which is one piece of replacement information, and the data D of version 1.3 which is one piece of replacement information, as shown on an upper right-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0103">Each of the data A and B which is updated using the difference information includes some data corresponding to an updated map area, while each of the data C and D which is updated using the replacement information is data about the whole of a corresponding map area. Since the data C and D are thus updated using the two pieces of replacement information, respectively, and therefore the previous data C and D of version 1.1 which are yet to be updated become unnecessary, they are deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0104">As previously explained, the map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 4 of the present invention only has to provide, as replacement information, the latest version of map information in order to update existing map information. Therefore, the map information updating system makes it possible for the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> to perform the process of updating the map information with a higher degree of efficiency and also makes it possible to provide map update information for the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> by using the DVD-ROM <b>8</b> with a higher degree of efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0105">In accordance with this embodiment, the existing map information and the updated map information are stored in the same hard disk. As an alternative, the existing map information and the updated map information can be stored in different storage media, respectively.</p>

The map information updating system in accordance with this embodiment differs from that in accordance with above-mentioned embodiment 1 in that map update information <b>33</b> of version 1.4 is stored in a DVD-ROM <b>8</b> and updated map information of version 1.3 is already stored in the hard disk <b>15</b> of the car navigation apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">Assuming that updating of map information is carried out every year, in addition to three pieces of map update information <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>32</b> stored in a previous DVD-ROM that was provided one year ago when the map information was updated to version 1.3, the latest DVD-ROM <b>8</b> that is provided the year after the previous DVD-ROM was provided stores map update information <b>33</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.3 to 1.4 therein.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">In response to a request for retrieval of map information from either an on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or a route computation unit <b>11</b>, the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> in accordance with this embodiment 5 updates the map information as follows.

<p id="p-0112" num="0112">In accordance with this embodiment, one or more pieces of map update information are pre-stored in one DVD-ROM and are applied to the car navigation apparatus as needed. Instead of one DVD-ROM, a storage media, such as a small hard disk or a memory card, can be used to store the one or more pieces of map update information which can be applied to the car navigation apparatus.

<p id="p-0126" num="0126">When, in step ST<b>20</b>, determining that no yet-to-be-applied map update information is stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, the map information updating unit <b>20</b> checks to see whether map update information has been applied to the map information <b>21</b> at least once (in step ST<b>23</b>). When determining that map update information has been applied to the map information <b>21</b> at least once, the car navigation apparatus stores the updated map information <b>22</b> in the hard disk <b>15</b> (in step ST<b>24</b>). In other words, the hard disk access unit <b>16</b> reads the updated map information <b>22</b> from the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, and then stores it in the hard disk <b>15</b>. After that, the updated map information is sent to the source of the request for retrieval of map information (in step ST<b>25</b>). In other words, the car navigation apparatus reads the updated map information <b>22</b> from the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, and then sends it to either the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or the route computation unit <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0127">In contrast, when, in step ST<b>23</b>, determining that no map update information has been applied to the map information <b>21</b>, the car navigation apparatus sends the map information <b>21</b> stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> to the source of the request for retrieval of map information (in step ST<b>26</b>). In other words, the car navigation apparatus sends the map information <b>21</b> stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> to either the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or the route computation unit <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0128">As previously explained, the map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 6 of the present invention carries out map updating processing after storing the contents of a DVD-ROM <b>8</b> in the hard disk <b>15</b>. Therefore, while performing map updating processing, the map information updating system can use the DVD-ROM <b>8</b> for other intended uses, such as playback of music or video. Since the map information updating system can keep all selected pieces of map update information in the hard disk <b>15</b>, when there is a necessity to update the map information, it can save itself from having to read any map update information from the DVD-ROM <b>8</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0129">In accordance with this embodiment, one or more pieces of map update information are pre-stored in one DVD-ROM and are applied to the car navigation apparatus as needed.

<p id="p-0131" num="0131">A map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 7 of the present invention is an improved version of the map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 6, and is so constructed as to, when map information stored in a hard disk of a car navigation apparatus has been already updated and is stored as updated map information, be able to further update the updated map information.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0132">The map information updating system in accordance with this embodiment 7 has the same structure as that of above-mentioned embodiment 1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram showing the structure of the map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 7 of the present invention. The map information updating system in accordance with this embodiment differs from that in accordance with embodiment 6 in that map update information <b>33</b> used for updating map information from version 1.3 to 1.4 is stored in a DVD-ROM <b>8</b> and map information of version 1.1 has already been partially updated to version 1.3 by using map update information and is stored, as updated map information <b>22</b> of version 1.3, in the hard disk <b>15</b> of the car navigation apparatus.</p>

The map update information selection unit <b>19</b> then selects and retrieves one or more pieces of map update information required for updating the map information of the latest one of the determined two versions from all pieces of map update information stored in the DVD-ROM <b>8</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> determines the version of the map information <b>21</b> stored in the hard disk <b>15</b> as version &#x201c;1.1&#x201d;, and also determines the version of the latest one of all pieces of updated map information, which the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> can create by applying map update information stored in the hard disk <b>15</b> to the map information <b>21</b>, as version &#x201c;1.3&#x201d;. Therefore, one or more pieces of map update information required for updating the map information <b>22</b> of the latest version 1.3, which has been selected from the two determined versions &#x201c;1.1&#x201d; and &#x201c;1.3&#x201d;, are selected from the DVD-ROM <b>8</b>. In other words, the map update information <b>33</b> used for updating version 1.3 to 1.4 is selected and retrieved from the DVD-ROM <b>8</b>. The map update information <b>33</b> thus selected and retrieved is stored, via a hard disk access unit <b>16</b>, in the hard disk <b>15</b>. When the above-mentioned processing is completed, the car navigation apparatus performs the same processing as explained in embodiment 6 so as to create updated map information <b>23</b> of version 1.4.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0134">As previously explained, in response to a request for retrieval of map information about a map area included in already-updated map information of version 1.3 which is stored therein, the map information updating system in accordance with this embodiment 7 applies map update information <b>33</b> of version 1.4 to the updated map information of version 1.3 so as to further update the updated map information. Therefore, the number of times which map update information is applied to the existing map information can be reduced. As a result, the map information can be updated more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0135">In accordance with this embodiment, one or more pieces of map update information are pre-stored in one DVD-ROM and are applied to the car navigation apparatus as needed.

<p id="p-0145" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a block diagram showing the structure of the map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 9 of the present invention. In accordance with the map information updating system of this embodiment, there is provided a DVD-ROM <b>8</b> in which a map information updating program, as well as map update information <b>30</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.0 to 1.1, map update information <b>31</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.1 to 1.2, and map update information <b>32</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.2 to 1.3, are recorded. The map information updating system uses the map information updating program when updating the map information using the map update information <b>32</b> used for updating version 1.2 to 1.3 and one or more pieces of map update information which are created after the map update information <b>32</b> has been created.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0146">In addition to the structure of the car navigation apparatus in accordance with embodiment 1 (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> has a map information updating means selection unit <b>40</b> and a map information updating program storage unit <b>41</b>. The map information updating means selection unit <b>40</b> selects either a map information updating unit <b>20</b> or the map information updating program stored in the map information updating program storage unit <b>41</b> in order to update the map information. The map information updating means selection unit <b>40</b> can determine which one of them to select according to one or more pieces of map update information which are to be applied to the map information. The map information updating program storage unit <b>41</b> stores the map information updating program read by a DVD-ROM drive <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0147">Next, the operation of the map information updating system in accordance with embodiment 9 of the present invention, which is constituted as mentioned above, will be explained with reference to a flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>. In the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b>, when the DVD-ROM <b>8</b> is inserted into the DVD-ROM drive <b>18</b>, the DVD-ROM drive <b>18</b> reads the map information updating program from the DVD-ROM <b>8</b>, and then stores it in the map information updating program storage unit <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0148">When the above-mentioned processing is completed, the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> is placed in a state in which it is waiting for a request for retrieval of map information (in step ST<b>10</b>). After that, by performing processes of steps ST<b>11</b> to ST<b>19</b>, a map update information selection unit <b>19</b> selects, retrieves and stores both the map update information <b>31</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.1 to 1.2 and the map update information <b>32</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.2 to 1.3 in a temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, like that of above-mentioned embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0149">After, in step ST<b>15</b>, determining that there is no more yet-to-be-checked map update information, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> checks to see whether any yet-to-be-applied map update information is stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> (in step ST<b>20</b>). When determining that one or more pieces of yet-to-be-applied map update information are stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, the map update information selection unit <b>19</b> selects the map update information that can be applied to the earliest version of map information from the one or more pieces of yet-to-be-applied map update information (in step ST<b>21</b>). The map update information selection unit <b>19</b> then selects a map information updating unit suitable for the selected map update information (in step ST<b>40</b>). To be more specific, when the selected map update information is the map update information <b>31</b> used for updating version 1.1 to 1.2, the map information updating means selection unit <b>40</b> selects the map information updating unit <b>20</b>, whereas when the selected map update information is the map update information <b>31</b> used for updating version 1.2 to 1.3, the map information updating means selection unit <b>40</b> selects the map information updating program <b>34</b> stored in the map information updating program storage unit <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0150">Then, either the selected map information updating unit <b>20</b> or the selected map information updating program <b>34</b> updates the map information by using the selected map update information (in step ST<b>41</b>). After that, the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> returns to step ST<b>20</b> in which it repeatedly performs the above-mentioned processing. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, by repeatedly performing the above-mentioned steps ST<b>20</b> to ST<b>22</b>, the map information updating unit <b>20</b> applies the map update information <b>31</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.1 to 1.2 to the map information <b>21</b>, and, after that, the map information updating program <b>34</b> stored in the map information updating program storage unit <b>41</b> applies the map update information <b>32</b> used for updating the map information from version 1.2 to 1.3 to the updated map information to which the map update information <b>31</b> has been applied so as to create updated map information <b>22</b> of version 1.3.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0151">When, in step ST<b>20</b>, determining that no more yet-to-be-applied map update information is stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, the map information updating means selection unit <b>40</b> checks to see whether map update information has been applied to the map information <b>21</b> at least once (in step ST<b>23</b>). When determining that map update information has been applied to the map information <b>21</b> at least once, the car navigation apparatus stores the updated map information <b>22</b> in the hard disk <b>15</b> (in step ST<b>24</b>). In other words, a hard disk access unit <b>16</b> reads the updated map information <b>22</b> from the temporary storage memory <b>17</b>, and then stores it in the hard disk <b>15</b>.

<p id="p-0152" num="0152">In contrast, when, in step ST<b>23</b>, determining that no map update information has been applied to the map information <b>21</b>, the car navigation apparatus sends the map information <b>21</b> stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> to the source of the request for retrieval of map information (in step ST<b>26</b>). In other words, the car navigation apparatus sends the map information <b>21</b> stored in the temporary storage memory <b>17</b> to either the on-screen map computation unit <b>10</b> or the route computation unit <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0153">As previously explained, the map information updating system in accordance with this embodiment 9 stores a map information updating program, as well as one or more pieces of map update information, in the DVD-ROM <b>8</b>, and the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> in accordance with this embodiment 9 updates map information according to a selected piece of map update information by using either the map information updating unit <b>20</b> or the map information updating program. Therefore, even if the map information updating unit <b>20</b> cannot handle an updating that newly occurs while the map information is repeatedly revised several times, the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> can handle the updating by using the map information updating program stored in the DVD-ROM <b>8</b>. In other words, the car navigation apparatus <b>2</b> can handle any updating which the map information updating unit <b>20</b> cannot handle by using the map information updating program which can be so designed as to handle the updating and is stored in the DVD-ROM <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0154">In accordance with this embodiment 9, the map information updating program storage unit <b>41</b> is provided outside the hard disk <b>15</b>.

<p id="p-0157" num="0157">In accordance with a map information updating system of embodiment 10 of the present invention, there is provided a map update information storage medium, such as a DVD-ROM <b>8</b>, in which a variation between two different versions of map information is recorded as one or more files each including map update information. The map update information storage medium is so constructed as to have a data structure in which the one or more files each having map date information and management information indicating the version of target map information, to which the map update information is to be applied to update the map information, are contained, so that the map information updating system can easily manage the version of map information stored therein.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0158">Hereinafter, the data structure of the map update information storage medium will be explained in detail by taking a DVD-ROM <b>8</b> as an example of the map update information storage medium. In general, the version of the map information can be revised at predetermined intervals, e.g., every year. Hereafter, each predetermined interval is referred to as &#x201c;one updating interval.&#x201d; When a variation between version 1.0 of map information and version 1.4 of map information is represented by some pieces of map update information, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a time period between t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b> can be divided into some portions each of which is one updating interval. In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the time period between t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b> is divided into four continuous updating time intervals a to d. Map update information is created during each of these four updating time intervals into which the time period between t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b> is divided. To be more specific, map update information used for updating version 1.0 to 1.1 is created during the first updating time interval a, map update information used for updating version 1.1 to 1.2 is created during the second updating time interval b, map update information used for updating version 1.2 to 1.3 is created during the third updating time interval c, and map update information used for updating version 1.3 to 1.4 is created during the fourth updating time interval d.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows the data structure of an example of the DVD-ROM <b>8</b> in which three pieces of map update information created by the map information updating system in accordance with this embodiment 10 are stored.
