<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of the Korean Patent Application Nos. 10-2005-0115766, 10-2005-0115767, 10-2005-0115768 and 10-2005-0115769 filed on Nov. 30, 2005, which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a washing machine, and more particularly, to an improvement in the structure of a drive unit included in a drum type washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, drum type washing machines are designed to perform a washing operation by use of a frictional force between a drum and laundry as the drum is rotated by a drive force of a motor transmitted thereto in a state wherein the laundry is received in the drum together with wash water and detergent. The above described washing operation manner has several effects of causing damage to laundry as little as possible while preventing entangling of laundry and also providing excellent washing effects by pounding and rubbing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Now, the configuration of a conventional drum type washing machine will be described in brief with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrating the configuration of the conventional drum type washing machine in longitudinal sectional view, the conventional washing machine comprises a tub <b>2</b> installed in a cabinet <b>1</b> and a drum <b>3</b> rotatably installed in the center of the tub <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The tub <b>2</b> is mounted, at a lower side thereof, with a motor <b>5</b><i>a </i>and in turn, the motor <b>5</b><i>a </i>is connected to a motor pulley <b>18</b> by means of a shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The drum <b>3</b> is mounted, at a rear side thereof, with a drum shaft, and a drum pulley <b>19</b> is mounted on the drum shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The drum pulley <b>19</b> mounted on the drum shaft and the motor pulley <b>18</b> connected to the motor <b>5</b><i>a </i>are connected to each other by means of a belt <b>20</b> as a power transmission element.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The cabinet <b>1</b> is provided, at a front side thereof, with a door <b>21</b>, and a gasket <b>22</b> is provided between the door <b>21</b> and the tub <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A hanging spring <b>23</b> is mounted between an inner ceiling surface of the cabinet <b>1</b> and an outer upper surface of the tub <b>2</b> and adapted to support the tub <b>2</b>. Also, a friction damper <b>24</b> is mounted between an inner bottom surface of the cabinet <b>1</b> and an outer lower surface of the tub <b>2</b> and adapted to alleviate vibration of the tub <b>2</b> caused during a dehydrating operation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the above described conventional washing machine, a drive force of the motor <b>5</b><i>a </i>is transmitted to the drum <b>3</b> by way of the motor pulley <b>18</b>, the drum pulley <b>19</b>, and the belt <b>20</b> connecting the motor pulley <b>18</b> and the drum pulley <b>19</b> to each other. Such an indirect power transmission manner, however, has the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Firstly, since the drive force of the motor <b>5</b><i>a </i>is transmitted to the drum <b>3</b> through the belt <b>20</b> wound on both the motor pulley <b>18</b> and the drum pulley <b>19</b> rather than being directly transmitted to the drum <b>3</b>, there is a high potential loss of energy in the transmission course of the drive force.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Secondly, in the course of transmitting the drive force of the motor <b>5</b><i>a </i>to the drum <b>3</b> through the above described several elements, such as the motor pulley <b>18</b>, the drum pulley <b>19</b>, and the belt <b>20</b>, and the like, there inevitably exists a problem of severe noise as compared to the case where the drive force is directly transmitted to the drum <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thirdly, a necessity for a great number of elements for transmitting the drive force of the motor <b>5</b><i>a </i>to the drum <b>3</b>, such as the motor pulley <b>18</b>, the drum pulley <b>19</b>, the belt <b>20</b>, and the like, consequently, causes a complicated product assembling operation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Fourthly, the above described great number of elements for transmitting the drive force of the motor <b>5</b><i>a </i>to the drum <b>3</b> may result in a proportional increase in the number of potential failure areas, and this has a problem of increasing the generation frequency of failures.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In conclusion, due to the above described power transmission manner in which the drive force of the motor <b>5</b><i>a </i>is indirectly transmitted to the drum <b>3</b> only by way of the motor pulley <b>18</b>, the belt <b>20</b>, and the drum pulley <b>19</b>, the conventional drum type washing machine has problems of a high potentiality of failures and noise generation as well as excessive consumption of energy and seriously, may result in deterioration in washing performance thereof, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">To solve the above described problems, the applicant of the present invention has proposed to use a direct connection type motor in a drive unit of a drum type washing machine, as disclosed in Korean Patent Laid-open Publication No. 10-2001-0037607.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the above published patent invention, there is provided a rotor frame, which is formed by pressing an iron plate and installed to transmit a rotating force of a rotor to a drum directly while performing itself the function of a back yoke having a magnetic path. It could be found that the disclosed rotor frame has a capability of solving the above described problems of the indirect power transmission manner while achieving a simplified structure.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">However, forming the rotor frame by pressing the iron plate has a difficulty, due to characteristics of a press operation, to obtain a required accuracy, more particularly, concentricity, when the thickness of the iron plate exceeds a predetermined value. On the other hand, when the rotor frame is formed by use of an iron plate having a thickness less than the predetermined value, there is a problem in that the rotor frame cannot obtain a required strength and may fluctuate during rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, to provide a passage of magnetic flux, that is to say, a magnetic path for the flow of magnetic flux generated by electric current flowing through coils of a stator, it is essential to provide a back yoke, which is made of a magnetic material and has an appropriate thickness, behind a magnet. Here, it is noted that the thinner the thickness of the back yoke, the lower a saturation point of the magnetic flux. Accordingly, when the rotor frame serving as the back yoke has a small thickness, there is a limit to increase the output of a motor even if the amount of current is increased to obtain a strong output.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Consequently, the attempt to form the rotor frame having the function of the back yoke by use of the iron plate in views of diversification of products reaches a limit due to the above described thickness problem of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Also, due to characteristics of the iron plate, there is a risk in that the rotor frame tends to gather rust on its surface easily. The rust may cause deterioration in the strength of the rotor frame and in the worst case, there is a risk in that rust powder that falls from the rotor frame is attached in an air gap between the magnet and the stator, thereby acting to restrict rotation of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the rotor frame, made of the iron plate, has a difficulty in the implementation of any subsequent process for improving accuracy and other processes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a washing machine that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An object of the present invention is to provide a drum type washing machine in which a drive unit, more particularly, a rotor frame that is adapted to transmit a rotating force of a rotor to a shaft directly, has an improved structure suitable to transmit a drive force of a motor to a drum directly, thereby achieving the effects of reducing the generation potential of noise and failure as well as excessive consumption of energy and of increasing the durability and stability of the washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a washing machine comprising: a tub for receiving wash water therein; a drum rotatably disposed in the tub and adapted to wash laundry received therein; a shaft penetrated through the tub to thereby be connected to the drum, the shaft being adapted to transmit a drive force of a motor to the drum; a stator coupled fixedly to a rear wall portion of the tub while being located on the rear wall portion; and an outer rotor including at least one magnet, an annular back yoke defining a magnetic path, and a rotor frame rotatably disposed at the outside of the stator, wherein the rotor frame of the outer rotor is made of an aluminum material, and comprises a side wall portion for supporting the magnet and the annular back yoke and a rear wall portion for transmitting a rotating force of the rotor to the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the rotor frame is formed by die casting, and the side wall portion and the rear wall portion of the rotor frame are integrally formed with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The back yoke may be press fitted and coupled fixedly inside the side wall portion of the rotor frame. For this, the rotor frame may further comprise a plurality of protrusions arranged inside the rotor frame to be spaced apart from one another by a regular distance in a circumferential direction of the rotor frame, the protrusions also being spaced apart in a radial inward direction from the side wall portion of the rotor frame by a predetermined distance. The protrusions may be integrally formed with the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To achieve a further increase in a coupling strength between the rotor frame and the back yoke, an adhesive may be applied to coupling surfaces of the rotor frame and the back yoke. Of course, the magnet may be attached to an inner surface of the back yoke by use of an adhesive, to be disposed in a circumferential direction of the back yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the present invention, the back yoke may be formed via a variety of methods. For example, the back yoke may be formed by rolling an iron plate, having a smaller thickness than a desired thickness of the back yoke, multiple times, to have a radially multilayered structure. Also, the back yoke may be formed by spirally winding an iron band, having substantially the same width as a desired thickness of the back yoke, from a lowermost layer to an uppermost layer, to have a vertically multilayered structure. Of course, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, although the back yoke may be formed by stacking a plurality of annular iron bands one above another, this may result in excessive loss of material in association with the manufacture of the iron bands.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Meanwhile, the back yoke may be provided, at an outer surface thereof, with at least one radially-formed recess or protrusion, and the side wall portion of the rotor frame may be provided, at an inner surface thereof, with at least one protrusion or recess corresponding to the recess or protrusion of the back yoke, whereby the back yoke is coupled fixedly inside the side wall portion of the rotor frame via engagement between the protrusion and the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, the back yoke may be provided, at an outer surface thereof, with at least one radially-formed recess, and the side wall portion of the rotor frame may be provided, at an inner surface thereof, with at least one protrusion corresponding to the recess of the back yoke, whereby the back yoke is coupled fixedly inside the side wall portion of the rotor frame via engagement between the protrusion and the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Here, the protrusion of the rotor frame may have a smaller height than a height of the side wall portion of the rotor frame. Alternatively, the recess of the back yoke is replaced by a slot perforated in a lower end portion of the back yoke through a thickness of the back yoke so that the protrusion is inserted through the slot.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The back yoke may be provided, at an outer surface thereof, with at least one radially-formed protrusion, and the side wall portion of the rotor frame may be provided, at an inner surface thereof, with at least one recess corresponding to the protrusion of the back yoke, whereby the back yoke is coupled fixedly inside the side wall portion of the rotor frame via engagement between the protrusion and the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Here, the protrusion of the back yoke may extend throughout a height of the back yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The back yoke may be inserted into a mold of the rotor frame during die casting of the rotor frame, to thereby be coupled fixedly inside the side wall portion of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The back yoke may be inserted into the mold after being previously coupled, at an inner surface thereof, with the magnet. In this case, the magnet as well as the back yoke can be coupled fixedly inside the rotor frame with an increased coupling force.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, the back yoke has at least one groove or protuberance formed at an outer surface thereof for increasing a coupling force between the back yoke and the rotor frame. Also, preferably, the groove or protuberance is formed at a middle height portion of the back yoke. This is because the groove or protuberance can prevent scattering of the back yoke, in addition to increase a coupling force between the back yoke and the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The side wall portion of the back yoke may have an upper end extended in a radial inward direction by a predetermined length to cover upper ends of the back yoke and the magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The above described drum type washing machine according to the present invention has the following effects.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Firstly, the washing machine of the present invention has a direct connection motor and thus, has the effect of significantly reducing the generation of noise and failure as well as the loss of power. Also, with the use of a metallic bearing housing, the washing machine of the present invention is applicable to products having a high-temperature drying function, without the risk of thermal deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Secondly, in the washing machine of the present invention, the rotor frame is made of an aluminum material and thus, has no risk of gathering rust thereon. This results in an increase in the durability of the motor. Furthermore, the rotor frame of the present invention has a magnet seating plane for achieving a highly efficient mounting operation of the magnet. Also, with the provision of vent holes having the function of moisture discharge and ventilation, it is possible to prevent overheating of the motor while protecting the motor from invasion of moisture. This consequently has the effect of increasing the reliability of the motor and extending the lifespan of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Thirdly, according to the present invention, the rotor frame is formed by die casting an aluminum material. Accordingly, the rotor frame can be manufactured with a simplified manner while guaranteeing an improved processability required for any subsequent process. Also, forming the rotor frame by use of a light-weight material is efficient to minimize the power loss of the motor due to the inertia force of the rotor frame. In addition, the aluminum rotor frame provides a flexibility to ensure free change in the thickness of the back yoke in views of diversification of products. This enables an increase in the overall thickness of the rotor frame and consequently, the rotor frame is free from unwanted fluctuation during rotation thereof, thus resulting in reduced noise and vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Fourthly, according to the present invention, the back yoke can be secured easily and firmly to the rotor frame with a variety of methods, resulting in an improvement in the reliability and productivity of the washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the washing machine according to the present embodiment comprises a tub <b>2</b> installed in a cabinet <b>1</b> and used to receive wash water therein, a drum <b>3</b> rotatably provided in the tub <b>2</b> and adapted to wash laundry received therein as it is rotated, a shaft <b>4</b> penetrated through the tub <b>2</b> and connected to the drum <b>3</b>, the shaft <b>4</b> being adapted to transmit a drive force of a motor <b>5</b> to the drum <b>3</b>, a stator <b>14</b> having winding portions around which coils are wound, the stator <b>14</b> being coupled fixedly to a rear wall surface <b>200</b> of the tub <b>2</b>, and a rotor <b>13</b> at the outside of the stator <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The outer rotor <b>13</b> includes magnets <b>13</b><i>c</i>, an annular back yoke <b>300</b> defining a magnetic path, and a rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The rotor frame has a side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>and a rear wall portion <b>13</b><i>a</i>. The side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>serves to support the magnets <b>13</b><i>c </i>and the back yoke <b>300</b>, to allow the magnets <b>13</b><i>c </i>and the back yoke <b>300</b> to rotate at the outside of the stator <b>14</b>. The rear wall portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>serves to transmit a rotating force of the magnets <b>13</b><i>c </i>and the back yoke <b>300</b> to the shaft <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Preferably, both the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>and the rear wall portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>are made of an aluminum material, more particularly, an aluminum alloy, and are integrally formed with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It will be appreciated that the rotor frame is preferably formed by a die-casting method that is suitable for mass production.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Meanwhile, in the present embodiment, a supporter <b>17</b> may be interposed between the rear wall surface <b>200</b> of the tub <b>2</b> and the stator <b>14</b>. The supporter <b>17</b> serves to increase a coupling strength between the tub <b>2</b> and the stator <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Also, in the present embodiment, it is preferable that a bearing housing <b>7</b> be provided at the rear wall surface <b>200</b> of the tub <b>2</b> and used to receive bearings therein for rotatably supporting the shaft <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Here, the stator <b>14</b> may be coupled fixedly to the rear wall surface <b>200</b> of the tub <b>2</b> through the bearing housing <b>7</b> and the supporter <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The bearing housing <b>7</b> is preferably made of a metallic material, and more preferably, made of an aluminum material such as an aluminum alloy.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Here, the bearing housing <b>7</b> may be integrally formed with the supporter <b>17</b>, to perform the role of the supporter <b>17</b> additionally. In this case where the bearing housing <b>7</b> is integrally formed with the supporter <b>17</b>, the supporter <b>17</b> is formed via insert injection molding during the injection molding of the tub <b>2</b>. In this case, the supporter <b>17</b> may be configured in such a manner that only a portion thereof, that is to say, a coupling portion for the bearing housing <b>7</b>, may be exposed rearward out of the tub <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Integrally forming the bearing housing <b>7</b> with the supporter <b>17</b> enables the omission of a coupling process of the bearing housing <b>7</b> or supporter <b>17</b>, which has been conventionally performed in an assembling line in the course of securing the stator <b>14</b> to the rear wall surface <b>200</b> of the tub <b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Meanwhile, the metallic bearing housing <b>7</b> is formed, at different positions of an inner circumference thereof, with short-stepped portions <b>8</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the present embodiment, the rotor frame is made of an aluminum material. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the rotor frame, which is extended forward from an edge of the rear wall portion <b>13</b><i>a</i>, is preferably formed, along a circumferential direction thereof, with a ledge having a seating plane <b>130</b> for supporting the magnets <b>13</b><i>c </i>that are attached to an inner surface of the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>over a front portion of the inner surface. Also, preferably, the rear wall portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the rotor frame is centrally formed with a hub <b>132</b>. Here, the hub <b>132</b> has a center through-hole <b>131</b> for allowing a coupling member <b>15</b><i>b</i>, such as a bolt, etc., to pass therethrough in order to couple the rotor <b>13</b> to the shaft <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Of course, it will be appreciated that the magnets <b>13</b><i>c </i>are not essentially intended to be supported on the seating plane <b>130</b>, and in the case of small capacity magnets, they may be coupled to the inner surface of the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>at a position spaced apart upward from the seating plane <b>130</b> by a predetermined height.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the rotor frame is preferably configured in such a manner that the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>is integrally formed with the rear wall portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the rotor frame is formed by die casting an aluminum material.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Around the hub <b>132</b> of the rotor frame are radially formed a plurality of cooling fins <b>133</b>.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Preferably, the cooling fins <b>133</b> are integrally formed with the rotor frame and extend radially from the hub <b>132</b> to the ledge to have a height difference between the hub <b>132</b> and the seating plane <b>130</b> of the ledge. On the basis of the height difference, the cooling fins <b>133</b> can be linearly formed or curved convexly or concavely. With this configuration, the cooling fins <b>133</b> can act to blow air concentratively to specific portions of the stator <b>14</b> having the highest cooling requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates that the cooling fins <b>133</b> are configured to have the highest height at the side of the ledge <b>130</b>, it will be appreciated that, conversely, the cooling fins <b>133</b> may have the highest height at the side of the hub <b>132</b>. Also, it is possible that the cooling fins <b>133</b> are integrally formed with the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>and the rear wall portion <b>13</b><i>a</i>, to serve as ribs continuously connecting the hub <b>132</b> to the ledge, for the sake of reinforcing the overall strength of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the present invention, the rear wall portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the rotor frame has a plurality of vent holes <b>134</b> perforated in regions between the respective adjacent cooling fins <b>133</b>. The vent holes <b>134</b> have the roles of moisture discharge and ventilation.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">With the provision of the cooling fins <b>133</b> and the hub <b>132</b>, the rotor frame of the present invention can achieve a reinforced rigidity. Also, it will be appreciated that the cooling fins <b>133</b> and the hub <b>132</b> can achieve the effect of simplifying the manufacture of the rotor <b>13</b> because they can be formed simultaneously with the forming of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Around the center through-hole <b>131</b>, which is perforated in the hub <b>132</b> of the rotor <b>13</b>, are formed a plurality of coupling holes <b>137</b> and a plurality of positioning holes <b>138</b> by regular distances. The plurality of positioning holes <b>138</b> are located, respectively, between the respective adjacent coupling holes <b>137</b>. The coupling holes <b>137</b> are used to couple a connector <b>16</b> to the rotor <b>13</b>. Here, the connector <b>16</b> is serration-coupled onto the outer circumference of the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b> extended rearward from the rear bearing <b>6</b><i>b </i>at the outside of the bearing housing <b>7</b>. The positioning holes <b>138</b> are used to determine the assembling position of the connector <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The connector <b>16</b> is made of a resin material having a different vibration mode from that of the aluminum rotor frame. Preferably, the connector <b>16</b> may be made of an insulating material and integrally formed with the rotor frame via insert molding. In this case, the coupling holes <b>137</b> and the positioning holes <b>138</b> perform the role of passage holes for allowing a part of the connector <b>16</b> to passage therethrough, in order to increase a coupling force between the connector <b>16</b> and the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Meanwhile, the connector <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, has coupling holes <b>162</b> perforated in an edge region thereof to be distributed along a circumferential direction, to correspond to the coupling holes <b>137</b> formed in the hub <b>132</b> of the rotor <b>13</b>. The connector <b>16</b> also has positioning bosses <b>160</b> integrally formed at positions between the respective adjacent coupling holes <b>162</b>. As the positioning bosses <b>160</b> are inserted into the positioning holes <b>138</b> of the rotor <b>13</b>, the coupling holes <b>137</b> of the rotor <b>13</b> are automatically aligned with the coupling holes <b>162</b> of the connector <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In addition, the connector <b>16</b> has a center hub <b>163</b>, a serration <b>164</b> formed at an inner circumference of the hub <b>163</b> to be engaged with a serration <b>400</b> formed on the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b>, and reinforcing ribs <b>161</b> formed at an outer circumference of the hub <b>163</b> of the connector <b>16</b> for reinforcing the strength of the hub <b>163</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Here, the serration <b>164</b> of the connector <b>16</b> may be formed by insert molding a member, which is made of a metallic material having a high strength and has a serration formed on an inner circumference thereof, during the forming of the connector <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Meanwhile, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, the stator <b>14</b>, which constitutes the motor <b>5</b> along with the rotor <b>13</b>, includes a ring-shaped insulator <b>140</b>, and coils <b>142</b> wound on winding portions <b>141</b> arranged at the outside of the insulator <b>140</b>. In addition, coupling ribs <b>143</b> are integrally formed with the insulator <b>140</b> to be arranged inside the insulator <b>140</b>. The coupling ribs <b>143</b> serve to secure the stator <b>14</b> to the bearing housing <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The stator <b>14</b> further includes a stator core, which consists of the winding portions <b>141</b> around which the coils <b>142</b> are wound, and an annular body portion having a magnetic path. Here, the insulator <b>140</b> serves to insulate the stator core and the coils <b>142</b> from each other. The plurality of winding portions are spaced apart from one another by a predetermined distance in a circumferential direction of the body portion to protrude radially from the body portion.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Here, the stator core may be an annular spiral core having a multilayered structure, which is obtained by spirally winding an iron plate, consisting of the winding portions <b>141</b> and the body portion, from the lowermost layer to the uppermost layer. In this case, differently from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the coupling ribs <b>143</b> for coupling the stator <b>14</b> to the tub <b>2</b> may be formed only at the insulator <b>140</b>. In this case, the insulator <b>140</b> has to be configured to guarantee an appropriate strength thereof. The stator <b>14</b> may be coupled to the tub <b>2</b> through coupling holes <b>144</b> formed in the respective ribs <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Alternatively, the stator core may take the form of an annular sectional core, which is obtained by coupling a plurality of arched stator core sections, each consisting of a plurality of arched stator core pieces stacked one above another in multiple layers, with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the present invention, preferably, the stator <b>14</b> has thirty six poles and the rotor <b>13</b> has forty eight poles. The greater the number of the poles, the easier the positional detection and control of the stator <b>14</b> and the rotor <b>13</b> can be accomplished. Here, the forty eight poles of the rotor <b>13</b> alternately define a north pole and a south pole in such a manner that twelve permanent magnets, each having a total of four poles, are coupled inside the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Hereinafter, the coupling of the rotor frame and the back yoke included in the drum type washing machine according to the present invention will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">First, in the present invention, the back yoke may be formed by stacking annular iron plates, preferably, annular silicon steel plates, which has substantially the same width as a desired radial thickness of the back yoke, one above another.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">To reduce the loss of a material required for the manufacture of the back yoke, alternatively, the back yoke may be formed by spirally winding an iron plate band, which has substantially the same width as a desired thickness of the back yoke, from the lowermost layer to the uppermost layer, to have a multilayered annular structure. That is to say, the back yoke may be manufactured to have the same shape as the above described shape of the spiral core of the stator core.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Alternatively, the back yoke may be formed by rolling an iron plate, which has a thinner thickness than the desired radial thickness of the back yoke, multiple times, to have a multilayered structure in a radial direction. Even by the above described configuration, a reduction in the loss of a material can be expected.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When forming the back yoke by use of a predetermined thickness iron plate to have a multilayered structure as stated above, the back yoke of the present invention has the effect of minimizing the leakage of a magnetic flux and accordingly, is capable of performing the role of an efficient back yoke. This is because the multilayered back yoke can minimize the leakage of a magnetic flux in a direction perpendicular to the generation direction of a magnetic flux.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Meanwhile, the back yoke is made of an iron plate and thus, has a difficulty to be coupled to the aluminum rotor frame by welding. Accordingly, now, a desired method for coupling the iron back yoke to the aluminum rotor frame according to different preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">First, it should be noted that the back yoke and the rotor frame must have a coupling strength sufficient to prevent not only idling rotations of the rotor frame and the back yoke, in consideration of the fact that a rotating force of the back yoke and the magnets has to be transmitted to the shaft through the rotor frame, but also scattering and separation of the back yoke from the rotor frame. In conclusion, the back yoke and the rotor frame must have a highly reliable coupling strength therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In a first embodiment of the present invention, to provide the reliable coupling strength, the back yoke is press fitted inside and secured fixedly to the side wall portion of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Specifically, the rotor frame, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, may comprise a plurality of protrusions <b>400</b>, which are arranged inside the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>to be circumferentially spaced apart from one another by a predetermined distance. The protrusions <b>400</b> are spaced apart in a radial inward direction from the inner circumference of the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>to have a predetermined radial gap with the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b</i>. Thereby, the back yoke <b>300</b> is able to be press fitted and secured fixedly in the radial gap.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Preferably, the back yoke <b>300</b> is formed, at an inner circumference thereof, with recesses <b>401</b> corresponding to the protrusions <b>400</b>, to allow the protrusions <b>400</b> to be inserted into the recesses <b>401</b>. Thereby, the back yoke <b>300</b> can be inserted and coupled inside the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the rotor frame. With the engagement of the protrusions <b>400</b> and the recesses <b>401</b>, consequently, it is possible to efficiently prevent the idling rotations of the rotor frame and the back yoke <b>300</b> during rotation of the rotor <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Preferably, the protrusions <b>400</b> are integrally formed with the rotor frame. More preferably, the protrusions may be formed simultaneously with the die casting of the rotor frame. Also, preferably, the plurality of protrusions are spaced apart from one another by a predetermined distance along a circumferential direction of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates that the protrusions <b>400</b> have the same height as that of the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b</i>, but the present invention is not limited thereto, and the protrusions <b>400</b> may have a smaller height than that of the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Meanwhile, to achieve a further increase in the coupling strength between the back yoke <b>300</b> and the rotor frame, it is preferable that an adhesive is applied to coupling surfaces of the rotor frame and the back yoke when the back yoke is inserted and coupled inside the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the rotor frame. Of course, it will be appreciated that the magnets may be coupled to the inner circumference of the back yoke by use of an adhesive so that they are arranged in a circumferential direction of the back yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Hereinafter, the assembling procedure and operation of the drive unit included in the washing machine according to the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">First, in the washing machine according to the present invention, the tub <b>2</b> is made of a plastic material having a superior heat resistance property. Injection molding the tub <b>2</b> by use of the light-weight material is advantageous to improve the productivity of the washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Also, the bearing housing <b>7</b> as bearing supporting means is made of a metallic material, such as an aluminum alloy, etc. This enables the present invention to be applied to washing machines having a high-temperature drying function, without the risk of thermal deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the present embodiment, the metallic bearing housing <b>7</b> is integrally formed with the tub <b>2</b> as it is insert molded into a hub <b>201</b> formed in the rear wall portion <b>200</b> of the tub <b>2</b> during the injection molding of the plastic tub <b>2</b>. Accordingly, there is no need for assembling the bearing housing <b>7</b> to the rear wall surface <b>200</b> of the tub <b>2</b>, and the overall assembling process of the tub <b>2</b> can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Meanwhile, the rotor <b>13</b> is coupled to the center of the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b> and in turn, the stator <b>14</b> is located inside the rotor <b>13</b>, to constitute the direct connection motor <b>5</b>. The side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the rotor <b>13</b>, which is extended forward from the edge of the rear wall portion <b>13</b><i>a</i>, is formed, in a circumferential direction thereof, with the ledge having the magnet seating plane <b>130</b>. Accordingly, when the magnets <b>13</b><i>c </i>are attached to an inner surface of the rotor <b>13</b>, they can be supported by the seating plane <b>130</b> of the ledge. This has the effect of facilitating the manufacture of the rotor <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Here, the rotor frame is formed by die casting an aluminum material, resulting in a simplified manufacturing process. Also, since the rotor frame has a light-weight as well as an anti-rust function, it is possible to minimize the power loss of the motor due to the inertia force of the rotor frame and to achieve an improvement in processibility for any subsequent process. In addition, it is easy to provide the rotor frame with an additional rigidity reinforcement structure.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Also, by press fitting and coupling the annular back yoke, which is made of an iron plate, to the aluminum rotor frame, it is possible to achieve an increased coupling strength between the back yoke and the rotor frame. In this case, an adhesive may -be additionally used to achieve a further increase in the coupling strength.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Hereinafter, a drum type washing machine according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The present embodiment has approximately the same configuration as that of the above described first embodiment and thus, the description of the same configuration will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">A difference between the present embodiment and the above described first embodiment is a method for coupling the back yoke to the rotor frame. Specifically, in the present embodiment, the back yoke is press fitted and coupled fixedly inside the side wall portion of the rotor frame without the aid of any auxiliary means, but is not essentially intended to be press fitted to the rotor frame. That is to say, the back yoke may be coupled to the rotor frame as protrusions are inserted into their corresponding recesses, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">For this, the rotor frame of the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, has the recesses <b>401</b> formed at an outer surface of the back yoke in a radial direction and the protrusions <b>400</b> formed at an inner surface of the side wall portion of the rotor frame. As the protrusions <b>400</b> are engaged in the recesses <b>401</b>, the back yoke can be coupled fixedly inside the side wall portion of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">With the engagement of the protrusions and the recesses, it is possible to more efficiently prevent idling rotations of the rotor frame and the back yoke during rotation of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Preferably, the protrusions <b>400</b> are integrally formed with the rotor frame to constitute a portion of the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b</i>. More preferably, the protrusions <b>400</b> may be formed simultaneously with the die casting of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The plurality of protrusions <b>400</b> are preferably spaced apart from one another by a predetermined distance along a circumferential direction of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates that the protrusions <b>400</b> have the same height as that of the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b</i>, but the present invention is not limited thereto, and the protrusions <b>400</b> may have a smaller height than that of the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Specifically, the protrusions <b>400</b> may be extended from a surface of the rear wall portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>by a predetermined height smaller than the height of the side wall portion, or may be extended from a surface of the ledge having the seating plane <b>130</b> by a predetermined height smaller than the height of the side wall portion.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Alternatively, the recesses <b>401</b> of the back yoke may be replaced by slots perforated through the thickness of the back yoke. In this case, the protrusions <b>400</b> of the rotor frame are inserted through the slots.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In other words, the back yoke may be perforated, in a lower end portion thereof, with a plurality of slots in such a manner that the slots are spaced apart from one another by a regular distance in a circumferential direction of the back yoke, to allow the protrusions <b>400</b> to be inserted through the slots.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Preferably, the plurality of protrusions are spaced apart from one another by a predetermined distance in a circumferential direction of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">To guarantee an increased coupling strength between the back yoke and the rotor frame, it is preferable that an adhesive be applied to coupling surfaces of the rotor frame and the back yoke when the back yoke is inserted and coupled inside the side wall portion of the rotor frame. Of course, the magnets may be coupled to the back yoke by use of an adhesive so that they are arranged inside the back yoke in a circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Hereinafter, a drum type washing machine according to a third embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The present embodiment has approximately the same configuration as that of the above described second embodiment and thus, the description of the same configuration will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">A difference between the present embodiment and the above described second embodiment is in that the protrusions <b>400</b> are formed at the back yoke and the recesses <b>401</b> are formed at the rotor frame. Accordingly, the back yoke is coupled fixedly to the rotor frame via engagement between the protrusions <b>400</b> and the recesses <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In conclusion, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that an important feature of the present invention is the provision of the protrusions <b>400</b> and the recesses <b>401</b> corresponding to each other. In other words, if the protrusions <b>400</b> are formed at the back yoke, the recesses may be formed at the rotor frame, and conversely, if the protrusions <b>400</b> are formed at the rotor frame, the recesses may be formed at the back yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Hereinafter, a drum type washing machine according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described. The present embodiment may be easily understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The present embodiment has a feature in that the annular back yoke is coupled fixedly inside the side wall portion of the rotor frame as it is inserted into a mold of the rotor frame during the die casting of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">This has the effect of increasing the coupling strength between the back yoke and the rotor frame as a molten metal is solidified similar to an insert injection molding method.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The implementation of the above described method is possible because a fusion point of the rotor frame is lower than that of the back yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">To achieve a further increase in the coupling strength, the back yoke may be formed, at the outer surface thereof, with grooves (not shown) or protuberances (not shown), to provide the back yoke with a stepped outer surface.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Specifically, a plurality of grooves or protuberances may be spaced apart from one another by a predetermined distance in a circumferential direction of the back yoke, and the height of the grooves or protuberances may be equal to the height of the side wall portion of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Of course, the grooves or protuberances may have a height smaller than that of the side wall portion of the rotor frame, and may be positioned at approximately the middle height of the back yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Forming the grooves or protuberances at a middle portion of the back yoke, furthermore, has the effect of completely preventing idling rotation as well as scattering of the back yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Meanwhile, after coupling the back yoke with the magnets, the assembly of the back yoke and the magnets may be inserted into the mold of the rotor frame.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Also, the side wall portion of the rotor frame may be configured in such a manner that an upper end of the side wall portion is extended in a radial inward direction by a predetermined length sufficient to cover upper ends of the back yoke and the magnets. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, specifically, the upper end of the side wall portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>may be configured to be bent in a radial inward direction to cover the back yoke <b>300</b>. Of course, preferably, the upper end of the side wall portion may be extended in a radial inward direction to cover even the magnets located inside the back yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">By providing the upper end of the side wall portion of the rotor frame with the above described configuration, it is possible to efficiently prevent the scattering of the back yoke and the magnets.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations, related to the size, shape, and material of the constituent elements, can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
