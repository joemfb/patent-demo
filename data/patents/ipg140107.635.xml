<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a floor panel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">More particularly, it relates to a floor panel comprising coupling parts at least at two opposite sides, in the form of a male coupling part and a female coupling part, respectively, which allow to connect two of such floor panels to each other at the aforementioned sides by providing one of these floor panels with the pertaining male coupling part, by means of a downward movement, in the female coupling part of the other floor panel, such that thereby at least a locking in horizontal direction is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Couplings allowing to couple two floor panels to each other by joining one floor panel with a downward movement into the other, in practice are subdivided into two kinds, namely a first kind wherein the coupling parts exclusively provide for a horizontal locking, without any presence of a locking in vertical direction, and a second kind wherein a horizontal as well as a vertical locking are provided for.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The couplings of the first kind are also known as so-called &#x201c;drop-in&#x201d; systems. Floor panels equipped with those at two opposite sides are known, amongst others, from CA 991.373 and JP 07-300979. As is evident from these patent documents, such &#x201c;drop-in&#x201d; systems often are only applied at a first pair of opposite sides of the floor panels, whereas then at the second pair of opposite sides, coupling parts are applied which, in the coupled condition of two floor panels, provide for a vertical as well as a horizontal locking and which allow that two of such floor panels can be coupled to each other by means of an angling movement. Floor panels with such a combination of coupling parts offer the advantage that they can be easily installed successively in rows, simply by coupling each new floor panel to be installed to the preceding row of floor panels by means of the angling movement and by providing for, when angling it down, that such floor panel simultaneously also engages in an already installed preceding floor panel of the same row. Thus, the installation of such floor panel only requires an angling and putting-down movement, which is a particularly user-friendly installation technique.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A disadvantage of floor panels with such coupling parts consists in that due to the fact that there is no locking in vertical direction, height differences between the coupled floor panels may arise at the top surface. Thus, for example, such floor panels in a first or last row of a floor covering may turn back upward from their flat position, if they are not held down by a skirting board or the like. Even if such floor panels are provided with a &#x201c;drop-in&#x201d; system at only one pair of sides, while being locked in horizontal as well as vertical directions at their other pair of sides in respect to adjacent floor panels, height differences may occur between adjacent floor panels at the sides coupled by the &#x201c;drop-in&#x201d; system, amongst others, when two adjacent floor panels are loaded differently, or when one floor panel should warp and bend somewhat in respect to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Couplings of said second kind, also named &#x201c;push-lock&#x201d; systems, try to remedy the aforementioned disadvantage by also providing a vertical locking. Such so-called &#x201c;push-lock&#x201d; systems may be divided into two different categories, namely one-piece embodiments and embodiments comprising a separate locking element, which is made as an insert, whether or not fixedly attached to the actual floor panel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One-piece embodiments are known, amongst others, from the patent documents DE 29924454, DE 20008708, DE 20112474, DE 102004001363, DE 102004055951, EP 1.282.752 and EP 1.350.904. The known one-piece embodiments have the disadvantage that they are working relatively stiff and a good joining of two floor panels can not always be guaranteed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments comprising a separate locking element which assists in a vertical and possibly also horizontal locking between two coupled floor panels, are known, amongst others, from the patent documents DE 202007000310, DE 10200401363, DE 102005002297, EP 1.159.497, EP 1.415.056B1, EP 1.818.478, WO 2004/079130, WO 2005/054599, WO 2006/043893, WO 2006/104436, WO 2007/008139, WO 2007/079845 and SE 515324. The use of a separate locking element offers the advantage that the material thereof is independent of the actual floor panel and thus can be chosen in an optimum manner in function of the application. Thereby, such inserts may be made of synthetic material or metal, whereby relatively sturdy, however, still easily movable locking portions can be realized, which, with a minimum contact surface, can take up relatively large forces.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention relates to floor panels which are equipped with a &#x201c;push-lock&#x201d; system of the last-mentioned category, in other words, which comprise a whether or not fixedly attached, however, separately realized insert. The aim of the invention consists in a further optimization of these &#x201c;push-lock&#x201d; systems in floor panels. These improvements substantially consist of seven aspects, which will be discussed in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first five aspects are specifically connected to floor panels of the type:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">which comprises, at least at two opposite sides, coupling parts with which two of such floor panels can be coupled to each other;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">wherein these coupling parts form a horizontally active locking system and a vertically active locking system;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0016">wherein the horizontally active locking system comprises a male part and a female part, which allow that two of such floor panels can be connected to each other at the aforementioned sides by providing one of these floor panels with the pertaining male part, by means of a downward movement, in the female part of the other floor panel;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0017">wherein the vertically active locking system comprises a locking element, which is provided in the form of an insert in one of the sides concerned;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0018">wherein this locking element comprises at least a pivotable lock-up body; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0019">wherein the lock-up body, at one extremity, forms a stop-forming locking portion, which can cooperate with a locking portion of a similar coupled floor panel.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0020">Floor panels of this type are known, amongst others, from the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>-<b>11</b> of the aforementioned EP 1.415.056B1. In these known embodiments, the locking portion realized in the form of an insert consists of a synthetic material strip with an elastically bendable lip, which, during its bending, functions as a pivotable lock-up body. These known embodiments show the advantage that with a relatively simple construction, a so-called &#x201c;push-lock&#x201d; connection can be realized which is active over the entire length of the synthetic material strip. However, practice has shown that this known embodiment is not always functioning smoothly and that tolerances in a realized coupling sometimes are difficult to keep under control.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0021">According to its first five aspects, the present invention aims at floor panels of the aforementioned specific type, which are further improved in respect to the aforementioned known embodiments. Thus, these improvements substantially consist in five aspects, which can be applied separately or in any imaginable combination.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">To this aim, the invention according to a first aspect relates to a floor panel of the above-mentioned specific type, with the characteristic that the pivotable lock-up body, opposite from the extremity forming the locking portion, comprises a support portion, which is rotatable against a support surface pertaining to the floor panel concerned, and more particularly is rotatable in a seat. As the lock-up body is provided with a support portion which is rotatable against a support surface, and more particularly is rotatable in a seat, the rotational movement of the lock-up body is defined better than in the known embodiments, and a more precise coupling can be provided than, for example, in the case of an embodiment according to FIGS. 5-7, 8 and 9-11 of said EP 1.415.056B1. In this known embodiment, the pivotable lock-up body in fact is realized as a prolongation of an attachment portion, whereby the hinge function occurs in the material of the insert, and the precise rotational movement is difficult to predict, which may lead to a less optimum functioning.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023">According to a second independent aspect, the invention relates to a floor panel of the above-mentioned specific type, with the characteristic that the pivotable lock-up body, opposite to the extremity forming the locking portion, comprises a support portion and that the lock-up body, between the locking portion and the support portion, in itself is free from hinge portions and bending sections. As the lock-up body is free from hinge portions and bending sections, possible influences thereof on the shape and length of the lock-up body are excluded and a fixed useful length of the lock-up body can be guaranteed, such that, amongst others, small production tolerances can be maintained, allowing precise couplings. In connection therewith, it is thus preferred that the lock-up body is performed as a rigid element.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0024">According to a third independent aspect, the invention relates to a floor panel of the above-mentioned specific type, with the characteristic that the pivotable lock-up body, opposite to the extremity forming the locking portion, comprises a support portion in the form of a free extremity, which, at least in vertical direction, is positively supported by a support portion pertaining to the floor panel. As the support portion is made as a free extremity, it does not experience influences from adjacent material portions in its support portion, which is beneficial for a smooth hinge motion of the lock-up body. By a free extremity is substantially meant that this simply is made as a protruding leg, without any further parts being attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0025">According to a fourth independent aspect, the invention relates to a floor panel of the above-mentioned specific type, with the characteristic that the lock-up body is rotatable around a rotation point, support point, respectively, and that the locking element comprises a press-on portion engaging at the lock-up body at a distance from the rotation point, support point, respectively. Thereby, it is possible to exert a suitable force with the press-on element against the pivotable lock-up body, even if this press-on element as such is relatively weak.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0026">According to a fifth independent aspect, the invention relates to a floor panel of the above-mentioned specific type, with the characteristic that the vertically active locking system comprises a tensioning system which is formed by a cam surface formed at the extremity of the locking portion of the lock-up body, which cam surface, in coupled condition, provides for a wedge effect against the opposite locking portion of the coupled floor panel. Due to such configuration, the lock-up body, in coupled condition, always will settle well under the locking portion of the other floor panel. Due to small movements occurring when the floor panels are being walked on, the lock-up body, due to the wedge effect, will crawl farther under the locking portion of the other floor panel, whereby an even sturdier coupling is obtained. It is noted that this fifth aspect can be applied for all forms of rotatable locking portions, and thus, for example, also for embodiments, such as known from EP 1.415.056B1.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0027">According to a sixth independent aspect, the invention relates to a floor panel comprising, at least at two opposite sides, coupling parts with which two of such floor panels can be coupled to each other; wherein these coupling parts form a horizontally active locking system and a vertically active locking system; wherein the horizontally active locking system comprises a male part and a female part, which allow to connect two of such floor panels to each other at the aforementioned sides by providing one of these floor panels with the pertaining male part, by means of a downward movement, in the female part of the other floor panel; and wherein the vertically active locking system comprises a locking element, which is provided in the form of an insert in one of the sides concerned; with the characteristic that the locking element consists of a co-extruded synthetic material strip provided in a recess, which strip, viewed in cross-section, is composed of two or more zones consisting of synthetic materials with different features. In other words, there are at least two zones of materials with different material characteristics. However, it is not excluded that certain zones do have the same material characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0028">The use of such co-extruded synthetic material strip offers the advantage that the features can be selected depending on the function which certain parts of such strip have to fulfill. For example, certain parts, which have to exert a pressure force or tension force, can be realized in a rather elastic synthetic material, whereas parts which have to take up forces in an immobile manner, then better consist of a hard synthetic material. Preferably, then also use is made of synthetic materials with different flexibility, elasticity, respectively. Also, flexible synthetic materials may be applied in order to realize movable connections among different parts of the strip. According to still another possibility, by means of the coextrusion zones are realized which can provide for a better sealing, or which offer increased friction resistance. Summarized, it is so that the different synthetic materials are applied in function of the desired movability and/or the desired compressibility and/or the desired sealing effect.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0029">It is clear that the sixth aspect extends to all &#x201c;push lock&#x201d; systems which apply a separate locking element which is provided or is to be provided in a recess in the edge of a floor panel, and is not exclusively restricted to locking elements with a pivotable lock-up body.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0030">According to a seventh independent aspect, the invention relates to a floor panel comprising, at least at two opposite sides, coupling parts with which two of such floor panels can be coupled to each other; wherein these coupling parts form a horizontally active locking system and a vertically active locking system; wherein the horizontally active locking system has a male part and a female part, which allow to connect two of such floor panels to each other at the aforementioned sides by providing one of these floor panels with the pertaining male part, by means of a downward movement, in the female part of the other floor panel; wherein the vertically active locking system comprises a locking element, which is provided in the form of an insert in one of the sides concerned; with the characteristic that the locking element consists of a synthetic material strip provided in a recess, which strip, in the coupled condition of two floor panels, comes into contact with both floor panels and thereby forms a seal, wherein between the upper side of the floor panel and the synthetic material strip also a seal is present at the panel edges. The importance and advantage of this aspect will become clear from the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">It is noted that all forms of combinations of the aforementioned seven aspects are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">Various advantageous dependent characteristics further will be described by means of the embodiments represented in the figures. All these dependent characteristics do not necessarily have to be applied in the mutual combinations as shown in the figures. Each characteristic can be combined as such with one of the independent aspects; such inasmuch as such dependent characteristic is not inconsistent with the characteristics of the respective independent aspect itself.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">It is noted that the present invention preferably is applied for embodiments where the locking element, made as an insert, substantially, and still better exclusively, serves as a locking element assisting in the vertical locking and, thus, not in the horizontal locking. The horizontal locking preferably exclusively is performed by means of parts, such as the aforementioned male part and female part, which are made from the actual panel material, more particularly are mechanically formed therefrom. More particularly, the invention preferably relates to embodiments wherein the insert is produced separately and then is mounted in an edge of an actual floor panel, whether or not in a fixed manner.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">More particularly, it is noted that the invention preferably is applied in embodiments where said locking element provides exclusively for an upward blockage, which means that this blockage prevents that the male part can come loose from the female element in an upward direction, whereas blockages in the other directions, thus, in downward direction and in horizontal direction, are obtained by the design of the panel edges themselves, in other words, by the coupling parts mechanically formed in the material of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0035">Preferably, the invention relates to embodiments wherein at least the lock-up body, and still better even the entire locking element made as an insert, is realized relatively local, which more particularly means that it is only present between a first and a second horizontal level, of which the first horizontal level is situated at a distance beneath the upper side of the coupled floor panels, whereas the second horizontal level is situated lower than the first, however, higher than the lowermost point of the male part. Subsidiary thereto, it is, however, still preferred that said lock-up element extends over a height which is at least 40% and still better at least 50% of the height difference between the upper side of such coupled floor panels and the lowermost point of the male part. Using at least 40%, at least 50%, respectively, of this height in combination with said location between said first and second level offers various advantages. An advantage of embodiments fulfilling this consists in that a good compromise is achieved between sufficient compactness from the point of view of the possibility of a smooth application in the edge of a floor panel and from the point of view of the costs, on the one hand, and sufficient extent in order to optimize construction and shape of the locking element, on the other hand. Still another advantage in respect to the known embodiments of floor panels with a comparable total thickness, however, wherein the height of the lock-up body does not fulfill said ratio of at least 40%, is that, at least in the case of a pivotable lock-up body, a smaller rotation of this lock-up body already results in a relatively large deviation at the free extremity, whereby a good locking can be obtained in a smooth manner. As a consequence thereof, mostly a locked condition can be realized in which the lock-up element is standing relatively upright and extends under an angle with the vertical which is considerably smaller than 45%, whereby the lock-up element offers a particularly solid locking. This also allows working with a lock-up body of which the protruding exterior side is standing relatively upright, whereby this body during coupling can be pushed aside more smoothly by another panel. As the lock-up element in the locked condition is standing very upright, it is also obtained that the contact points of the lock-up body with the connected floor panels are located close to the panel edges, which is beneficial for a good connection.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0036">The present invention relates to embodiments wherein said locking element is integrated in the male part, as well as to embodiments wherein said element is integrated in the female part. In the case of integration in the male part, the locking element preferably is situated in the distal side of this part, although integration in another side is not excluded. In the case of integration in the female part, the locking element preferably is situated at the proximal side, although integration in another side is not excluded.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0037">Preferably, the coupling parts of the floor panels of the invention also are configured such that they can be uncoupled by means of a pivoting movement, irrespectively according to which of the aforementioned aspects they are realized. According to a particular embodiment, the coupling parts further are configured such that coupling by means of an angling movement is possible, too.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038">According to another embodiment, the male and the female part of said floor panels are configured such that said floor panels can be brought into each other at the sides concerned by shifting them towards each other, preferably even such that this is possible by moving them towards each other in a substantially same plane, for example, by shifting a panel towards another over an underlying surface. The locking then preferably takes place by means of a snap-on connection, wherein the hook-shaped part of the female part bends elastically during joining.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0039">According to still another variant, said floor panels are realized such at the sides concerned that, apart from locking by means of a downward movement, also a locking by shifting the floor panels towards each other, as well as a locking and/or unlocking by angling the floor panels in mutual respect is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040">It is noted that the configuration allowing that two floor panels at the same edges can be joined by means of a downward movement, thus, according to the &#x201c;push-lock&#x201d; principle, as well as by a mutual shifting in the same plane, thus, according to the principle of &#x201c;snap action by means of shifting in the same plane&#x201d;, also more generally forms a particularity, without this combination necessarily having to be combined with one of said seven aspects. Due to this, the invention, according to an eighth aspect, thus also relates to a floor panel comprising, at least at two opposite sides, coupling parts with which two of such floor panels can be coupled to each other; wherein these coupling parts form a horizontally active locking system and a vertically active locking system; wherein the horizontally active locking system has a male part and a female part, which allow that two of such floor panels can be connected to each other at said sides by providing one of these floor panels with the pertaining male part, by means of a downward movement, in the female part of the other floor panel; wherein the vertically active locking system comprises a locking element, which is provided in the form of an insert in one of the sides concerned; wherein this locking element comprises a lip-shaped lock-up body; and wherein the lock-up body, at one extremity, forms a stop-forming locking portion, which can cooperate with a locking portion of a similar coupled floor panel; characterized in that the male part and the female part are configured such that two of such floor panels can be joined into each other at the sides concerned by shifting them with the sides concerned towards each other in the same plane. Hereby, the advantage is created that the installation comfort of such floor panels is considerably increased, as connecting by means of the downward movement allows for a rapid assembly, whereas the possibility of coupling together by shifting the floor panels towards each other offers the advantage that they can also be coupled to each other at locations where no downward movement is possible and solely coupling by shifting is possible, such as, for example, in the case that a floor panel partially must be provided underneath an overhanging element, such as a door frame, and from this position still has to be coupled to another floor panel.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">It is clear that the invention also relates to floor panels combining the eighth aspect with one or more of the preceding aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">Floor panels meeting the eighth aspect preferably also show one or more of the following characteristics:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0043">the coupling parts concerned are performed at the aforementioned sides such, that they allow a locking and/or unlocking of two of such floor panels in mutual respect by mutually angling them into each other, out of each other, respectively;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0044">in free condition, the lip-shaped lock-up body protrudes outward in an inclined manner;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0045">the lock-up body is provided in the proximal side of the female part;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0046">the female part and the male part comprise contact surfaces at their distal extremities, said surfaces being performed upwardly inclined in distal direction;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0047">the lip-shaped lock-up body is a pivotable body.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0048">According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the floor panels of the eighth aspect relate to rectangular, either oblong or square, panels, and a pair of opposite sides of said coupling parts is provided according to the eighth effect, whereas the other, second pair of opposite sides comprises coupling parts, which also can provide for a vertical and horizontal locking, of which kind whatsoever, however, which still allow that two of such floor panels can be joined into each other at the last-mentioned sides by substantially shifting them with the sides concerned towards each other in the same plane. This combination of possibilities offers an even higher comfort of installation in difficult situations. According to an additional preferred characteristic, the coupling parts at the second pair of opposite sides also are configured such that they allow angling the floor panels in and out of each other. Examples of such coupling parts are widely known from the state of the art, for example, from FIG. 23 of WO 97/47834.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0049">According to still another particular embodiment, the coupling parts of the eighth aspect are applied at both pairs of sides.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0050">Further, the invention according to a ninth aspect also relates to a floor panel comprising, at least at two opposite sides, coupling parts with which two of such floor panels can be coupled to each other at the respective edges; wherein these coupling parts form a horizontally active locking system and a vertically active locking system; wherein at least one of the locking systems comprises a locking element, which is provided in the form of a separate insert at one of the edges concerned; wherein this locking element comprises at least a movable lock-up body; and wherein the lock-up body, at one extremity, forms a stop-forming locking portion, which can cooperate with a locking portion of a similar coupled floor panel; with the characteristic that the locking element consists of a synthetic material strip which, viewed in cross-section, is composed of at least two zones of materials with different material characteristics. By making use of a separate insert formed of different materials, the advantage is created that the different portions of the insert can be optimized in function of their purpose. So, for example, may the lock-up body be realized relatively rigid in order to be able to adequately withstand occurring forces, whereas one or more other portions, which must provide the movability of the lock-up body, then as such are realized relatively flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0051">Preferably, the floor panel according to the ninth aspect further is characterized in that the lock-up body is attached directly or indirectly to a material part pertaining to the locking element or is made in one piece therewith, which allows an elastic movement of the lock-up body, wherein this material part consists of a material which as such is more flexible and bendable than the material of which the lock-up body basically is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0052">According to still another preferred characteristic, the aforementioned material part is performed as a local hinge part, with the advantage that a very precisely defined pivoting movement is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0053">Herein, it is preferred that said material part forms a connection between the lock-up body and an attachment portion, wherein the lock-up body and the attachment portion consist of material which is less flexible than said material part. In this manner, it is obtained that an adequate locking is created by means of the relatively rigid lock-up body, whereas by means of the relatively rigid attachment portion a stable positioning of the locking element in a recess in the edge of the floor panel concerned is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0054">In a preferred embodiment of the ninth aspect of the invention, the attachment portion consists of an attachment body which, viewed in cross-section, extends in a flat or rather flat direction, which means substantially in the plane of the floor panel, which attachment body is provided in a recess. Such attachment portion allows an adequate attachment, also when the invention is applied in relatively thin floor panels. Another advantage is that by somewhat altering the direction with which this attachment portion is applied in the floor panel, different functioning characteristics can be obtained and the engineer in this manner can provide for an optimization.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0055">Also according to the ninth aspect, the floor panel will be characterized in that the lock-up body can be elastically angled out with an extremity; that the lock-up body, globally seen, forms an angle with the attachment portion; that the lock-up body, with the extremity situated opposite to the extremity which can be angled out, protrudes up to beyond the attachment portion; that said material part makes a connection between said extremity protruding beyond the attachment portion and an adjacent portion of the actual attachment portion; and that at the location where the lock-up body passes along the attachment portion, the distance between the lock-up body and the attachment portion is smaller than the distance from the protruding extremity of the lock-up body to the attachment portion. As will become clear from the further description, this offers various advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0056">In the most preferred embodiment, the locking element of the ninth aspect of the invention is formed by means of coextrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0057">The ninth aspect is particularly useful with floor panels of the type which is characterized in that the horizontally active locking system comprises a male part and a female part, which allow that two of such floor panels can be connected to each other at said sides by providing one of these floor panels with the pertaining male part, by a downward movement, in the female part of the other floor panel, in other words, floor panels of the so-called push-lock type. However, it is noted that the ninth aspect is not restricted to this type of floor panels and in principle can be applied for each type of coupling for floor panels wherein a horizontally active locking system and vertically active locking system are applied, wherein in one or the other way a separate locking system is integrated. So, for example, it is possible to integrate the ninth aspect in strip-shaped locking elements of the type such as known from WO 2006/104436, more particularly <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>c</i>, <b>9</b><i>e </i>and <b>9</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0058">It is clear that the characteristics of the ninth aspect also can be combined with the characteristics from the first eight aspects.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0089">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>, the invention relates to a floor panel <b>1</b> comprising, at least at two opposite sides <b>2</b>-<b>3</b>, coupling parts <b>4</b>-<b>5</b>, with which two of such floor panels <b>1</b> can be coupled to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0090">As becomes clear from the coupled condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, these coupling parts <b>4</b>-<b>5</b> comprise a horizontally active locking system <b>6</b> and a vertically active locking system <b>7</b>. The horizontally active locking system <b>6</b> comprises a male part <b>8</b> and a female part <b>9</b>, which allow to connect two of such floor panels <b>1</b> to each other at the aforementioned sides <b>2</b>-<b>3</b> by providing one of these floor panels <b>1</b> with the pertaining male part <b>8</b>, by means of a downward movement M, in the female part <b>9</b> of the other floor panel, which movement M is illustrated by means of two different positions in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0091">The male part <b>8</b> is formed by a downward-directed extremity of a hook-shaped part <b>10</b>, whereas the female part <b>9</b> consists of a seat formed by means of an upward-directed hook-shaped part <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0092">The vertically active locking system <b>7</b> comprises a locking element <b>12</b>, which, in the form of an insert, is provided in one of the sides concerned, in this case, the side <b>2</b>, more particularly in a recess <b>13</b> provided to this aim. For clarification, the locking element <b>12</b>, or in other words, thus, the insert, is illustrated in separate condition in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As can be seen in this figure, this locking element <b>12</b> preferably is made as a strip. It is clear that this strip preferably extends over the entire or almost entire length of the side <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0093">Preferably, this strip consists of synthetic material, however, the use of other materials to this aim is not excluded. Further, it is preferred that the strip has a continuous cross-section over its entire length, which renders it simple to manufacture. In the case of a synthetic material strip, preferably use is made of PVC.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0094">The enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows in greater detail how the strip is attached in the recess <b>13</b>, which will be discussed further on.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0095">In the represented example, the locking element <b>12</b> is composed at least of a pivotable lock-up body <b>14</b> and a press-on portion <b>15</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the lock-up body <b>14</b> consists of the entire upright part, whereas the press-on portion <b>15</b> is formed by the portion inclinedly directed away.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0096">The extremity <b>16</b> of the lock-up body <b>14</b>, which can be rotated out, functions as a stop-forming locking portion <b>17</b>, which can cooperate with a locking portion <b>18</b> of a similar coupled floor panel <b>1</b>. Herein, the locking portion <b>18</b> preferably is formed by a portion defining a stop-forming surface <b>19</b>, which for this purpose is present in the side <b>3</b> and preferably is mechanically provided in the core of the floor panel <b>1</b>. The functioning of the vertically active locking system can simply be deduced from the figures and relies on the principle that, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, when moving the floor panel concerned downward, the lock-up body <b>14</b> is elastically folded inward by the contact with the edge of the other floor panel, after which, as soon as the floor panels have arrived in the same plane, the lock-up element rotates back outward in order to position itself beneath the locking portion <b>18</b>, such that the coupled condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is created.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0097">In accordance with the first aspect of the invention, the pivotable lock-up body <b>14</b>, opposite from the extremity <b>16</b> forming the locking portion <b>17</b>, comprises a support portion <b>20</b>, which is rotatable against a support surface <b>21</b> pertaining to the floor panel <b>1</b> concerned, and more particularly in a seat <b>22</b>. By the support portion <b>20</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 10</figref> thus the lowermost extremity <b>23</b> of the lock-up body <b>14</b> is meant.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0098">Further, the lock-up body <b>14</b> as such, between the locking portion <b>17</b> and the support portion <b>20</b>, in other words, between its extremities <b>16</b> and <b>23</b>, is free from hinge portions and bending sections, such in accordance with the second aspect of the invention. To this aim, thus, the lock-up body <b>14</b> is made relatively thick and preferably forms a rigid body, which means that the lock-up body <b>14</b> can not undergo noticeable deformations between its extremities when pressures are exerted hereupon, which usually may arise with &#x201c;push-lock&#x201d; couplings.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0099">In accordance with the third aspect of the invention, the support portion <b>20</b> in the represented embodiment is made as a free extremity, which is positively supported at least in vertical direction by a support portion <b>24</b>, more particularly support surface <b>21</b>, pertaining to the floor panel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0100">As can be clearly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>, the support portion <b>20</b> of the lock-up body <b>14</b> preferably even is supported in two directions, at least in a coupled condition of two floor panels <b>1</b>, namely in vertical direction V, in this case, thus, downward, as well as in proximal direction P in respect to the floor panel <b>1</b>, this latter by means of the lateral wall <b>25</b> of the seat <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0101">In the represented example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref>, the floor panel <b>1</b> also comprises a stop-forming part <b>26</b>, which, in a distal direction D in respect to the floor panel <b>1</b>, forms a blockage for the support portion <b>20</b> or, thus, for the extremity <b>23</b> of the lock-up body <b>14</b>. Thereby, a proper seat <b>22</b> can be formed, as a result of which the support portion <b>20</b> is sitting enclosed at three sides. In this manner, the seat can function as a rather precisely defined hinge point.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0102">Generally, it can be stated that the locking element <b>12</b> preferably consists of a strip which is attached in a recess, in the represented example, thus, the recess <b>13</b>, in the floor panel <b>1</b> and that attachment provisions are present therein, retaining the strip in the recess. More particularly, it is preferred that the strip is snap-fitted in the recess and/or is sitting enclosed therein due to the design, which principle also has been applied in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the opening A of the recess is smaller than the largest dimension B of the strip, with the consequence that the latter automatically is retained in the recess <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0103">It is noted that other techniques for attaching or retaining such strip in the recess are possible, for example, by gluing, clamping or the like. A number of advantages are described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0104">As schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the strip or, thus, the locking element <b>12</b> simply can be provided at a floor panel <b>1</b> by pressing it into the recess <b>13</b>, for example, by means of a press-on portion or sliding block <b>27</b>. Due to the exerted pressure, the strip is deformed and fits through opening A, after which it regains its original shape and becomes enclosed in the recess. More particularly, hereby the press-on portion <b>15</b> is bent in the manner as represented, in order to finally bounce into place.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0105">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref> also applies the fourth aspect of the invention, namely in that the lock-up body <b>14</b> is rotatable around a rotation point, support point, respectively, and the press-on portion <b>15</b>, at a distance from the rotation point, and more particularly at a distance D<b>1</b> from the actual support point, engages at the lock-up body <b>14</b>. It is noted that by a &#x201c;point&#x201d;, also a &#x201c;zone&#x201d; can be intended. Thus, a &#x201c;support point&#x201d; also may extend over a &#x201c;zone&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0106">As represented, the press-on portion <b>15</b> preferably consists at least, viewed in cross-section, of a leg adjoining to the rear side of the lock-up body <b>14</b>, which leg, in free condition, extends obliquely in respect to the lock-up body <b>14</b>, such from a location P<b>1</b> situated between the two extremities of the lock-up body. Preferably, this leg also globally extends under an angle A<b>1</b> of less than 70 degrees in respect to the portion <b>28</b> of the lock-up body <b>14</b>, which portion extends from said location P<b>1</b> towards the locking portion <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0107">The press-on portion <b>15</b> preferably consists of an elastic material, and more particularly a material, which as such is more flexible than the material of the lock-up body <b>14</b>. Preferably, this is also synthetic material, and in the most preferred embodiment, the press-on portion <b>15</b> is made in one piece with the lock-up body <b>14</b> by means of coextrusion. In the enlarged views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 9</figref>, the co-extruded materials are represented with different shading.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0108">Generally, it is noted that a locking element <b>12</b> in cross-section can only be of small dimensions, in view of the fact that it must be integrated in the edge of floor panels having in practice a thickness which usually is less than 2 cm and in many cases is even less than 1 cm. Thus, the space then available for the locking element <b>12</b> often only lies in the order of magnitude of 5 millimeters or less. When with such small dimensions different flexibilities must be incorporated into the locking element, the possibilities thus also are limited when one desires to perform this in a traditional manner by working with different thicknesses. By now using coextrusion according to the invention, a broader range of possibilities is created for incorporating different flexibilities, and thus also a different elasticity, depending on the intended effect.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0109">The co-extruded materials may consist of the same or similar basic material and, for example, differ from each other only in that certain components are added to the one material, or certain components are present to a larger extent. In a practical embodiment, the entire strip will consist of PVC, however, the more flexible portion will be formed of PVC to which a larger quantity of plasticizer is added.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0110">Also the location of the transition T between the co-extruded materials is of importance. So, for example, this transition T, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref>, preferably is situated at a distance X from the lock-up body. Thereby, a more rigid guiding portion remains present at the basis of the press-on portion <b>1</b>, which promotes the snap-on effect represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0111">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref>, the press-on portion <b>15</b>, viewed in cross-section, consists of only one leg.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0112">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref>, a tensioning system <b>29</b> is integrated in the vertically active locking system, which tensioning system provides for that a good locking is created when the lock-up body <b>14</b> is angled out. By a tensioning system, here a system is intended which, when angling out the lock-up body <b>14</b>, additionally effects the approach among the locking portions <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0113">As made clear in the larger representations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref> to this aim use is made of a cam surface <b>30</b> formed at the extremity <b>16</b> of the lock-up body <b>14</b>, which cam surface, in coupled condition, provides a wedge effect against the opposite locking portion <b>18</b> of the coupled floor panel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0114">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the cam surface <b>30</b>, which consists at least of an effective contact zone <b>31</b> and possibly an entry zone <b>32</b>, preferably extends over a width B<b>1</b> of at least 60% of the total width B<b>2</b> of the lock-up body <b>14</b>, which allows providing a gradual transition, which promotes a good wedge effect. Indeed, the entry zone <b>32</b> preferably is somewhat steeper than the contact zone <b>31</b> and is intended to provide for that the lock-up body <b>14</b> initially always will get smoothly beneath the surface <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0115">Herein, the cam surface <b>30</b> preferably extends such that, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, according to a direction R, from the most outwardly situated edge <b>33</b> to the most inwardly situated edge <b>34</b>, the cam surface <b>30</b> shows an increasing elevation E, such that the effective length of the lock-up body <b>14</b> increases for the successive points of the cam surface according to the direction R. Herein, the effective length is the distance between the locations where the lock-up body comes into contact at the top and at the bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0116">The cam surface <b>30</b> and the surface <b>19</b> situated opposite thereof preferably are performed such that a displacement of the lock-up body <b>14</b> as a consequence of tolerance differences results in a smaller or no displacement of the contact zone, more particularly the contact point, between both locking portions <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>. Preferably, therein the amount of the displacement of the contact zone or the contact point is less than 50% of the size of the displacement of the cam surface <b>30</b>. This is illustrated in the following by means of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Herein, a first condition with a contact point in position C<b>1</b> is represented in solid line. When, due to settling, the surface <b>19</b> comes to lie somewhat higher, a condition is created such as represented in dashed line, wherein the contact point is displaced from a position C<b>1</b> to C<b>2</b>, and such according to the invention with a displacement V<b>1</b>, which is noticeably smaller than the displacement V<b>2</b> of the lock-up body <b>14</b>. The advantage herein is that at all times, the displacement V<b>2</b> is small, and it can be guaranteed that the contact always takes place within a certain distance D<b>2</b> from the upper edges of the floor panels <b>1</b> and a too far outward rotation, which might lead to a weak connection, is excluded. With tolerance differences, too, the same effect occurs. A first pair of floor panels may come into contact, for example, as represented in solid line, whereas another pair, due to tolerance differences, comes into contact as represented in dashed line. Due to a cam shape according to the invention, it is then prevented that in the second case the contact point C<b>2</b> would be situated too far from the edges of the floor panels.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0117">It is noted that, as represented in the figures, the locking portion <b>17</b> of the lock-up body <b>14</b> preferably is performed in the form of a broadened extremity of the lock-up body <b>14</b>, due to which more space is offered for realizing a desired cam surface <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0118">The inclinations of the cam surface <b>30</b> and the surface <b>19</b> cooperating therewith preferably are realized such that they always define a tangent line L<b>1</b>-L<b>2</b> in their contact zone, contact point C<b>1</b>-C<b>2</b>, respectively, the inclination angles of which with the horizontal, of which solely one is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> by A<b>2</b>, are less than 35 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> show that the contact point C can also be displaced by the selection of the shape of the surface <b>19</b> with which the lock-up body <b>14</b> cooperates in coupled condition. It is noted that in coupled condition the connection line L<b>3</b> between the contact point C, or the middle of the contact zone when the contact is wider than a point, and a point where the lock-up body <b>14</b> is supported, is as vertical as possible, as then, amongst others, horizontal force components, which might force the lock-up body back, remain limited. In this respect, it is also preferred that the distance D<b>3</b>, at which the contact C, the center op the contact zone, respectively, is situated from the plane where the floor panels <b>1</b> fit against each other, is smaller than 1 mm and still better is smaller than 0.8 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0120">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</figref>, the locking element <b>12</b> and the recess <b>13</b> are performed such that this locking element <b>12</b>, in the free, uncoupled condition of the floor panel <b>1</b> concerned, is sitting at least partially with its locking portion <b>17</b> within the recess <b>13</b>. This offers, amongst others, the advantage that the strip, of which this locking element consists, when two floor panels <b>1</b> are joined into each other by means of a downward movement, in principle never can be pulled out of its seat by friction forces or for any other cause, due to which the good functioning might be disturbed.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0121">It is clear that the coupling according to the invention can be applied in combination with any floor panel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the application of the embodiment represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref> in so-called prefabricated parquet, more particularly in so-called &#x201c;engineered wood&#x201d;. In this example, this relates to floor panels <b>1</b> which are constructed from a core <b>38</b> composed of strips <b>35</b>-<b>36</b>-<b>37</b>, a top layer <b>39</b> of wood, as well as a backing layer <b>40</b> of wood. The top layer <b>39</b> consists of wood of a good quality, which functions as a visible decorative layer. The backing layer <b>39</b> may consist of a cheaper kind of wood. The strips <b>35</b> preferably also consist of a cheaper, for example, soft kind of wood. However, it is preferred that at the extremities of the floor panels <b>1</b> strips <b>37</b>-<b>38</b> of a material are applied which is relatively sturdy and suited for providing the desired profile shapes therein, for example, milling them therein. In a practical embodiment, these strips <b>37</b>-<b>38</b> consist of MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard) or HDF (High Density Fiberboard). It is clear that the invention can also be applied in combination with other forms of &#x201c;engineered wood&#x201d;, for example, wherein the core consists of a single continuous MDF/HDF board or of a plywood board.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> represents an application in a laminate floor panel, in this case a so-called DPL (Direct Pressure Laminate), which, in a known manner, consists of a core <b>41</b>, for example, of MDF or HDF, a top layer <b>42</b> on the basis of one or more resin-impregnated layers, for example, a printed decor layer <b>43</b> and a so-called overlay <b>44</b>, as well as a backing layer <b>45</b>, which also consists of one or more resin-impregnated layers, wherein the whole is consolidated under heat and pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0124">Applications in other floor panels <b>1</b> are not excluded.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> represent a particular embodiment, wherein in the side of the floor panel <b>1</b> situated opposite to the lock-up body <b>14</b>, a recess <b>46</b> is provided, wherein, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, in the longitudinal direction of the edges a rod <b>47</b> or the like can be introduced between the floor panels <b>1</b>, in such a manner that the lock-up body <b>14</b> is pushed back and the floor panel concerned can be lifted and thus can be uncoupled.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> represents a variant of the invention, which differs from the above-described embodiment in a number of ways. So, for example, does the pivotable lock-up body <b>14</b>, next to the extremity <b>23</b> along which it is pivotable, comprise a tensioning system <b>48</b>, which in this example, as illustrated in the enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, substantially consists of a cam <b>49</b> realized at said extremity <b>23</b>, which cam, when the lock-up body <b>14</b> is being pivoted outward, also subjects this lock-up body <b>14</b> to an axial displacement V<b>3</b> in the direction of the locking portion <b>17</b>. It is clear that the cam <b>49</b> to this aim must be realized with a suitable elevation, which can be determined by those skilled in art in function of the desired effect. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the elevation is illustrated by the distances D<b>4</b> and D<b>5</b>, wherein D<b>5</b> is larger than D<b>4</b>. The axial displacement V<b>3</b> contributes to that the lock-up body <b>14</b>, during coupling, initially can pivot outward in a smooth manner, however, as soon as it is partially pivoted out, rather quickly is seeking contact with the other floor panel <b>1</b> before it can pivot outward too far.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0127">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, also no distal stop-forming portion is present, as a result of which the locking element can be pressed into the recess <b>13</b> more smoothly. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the lock-up body <b>14</b>, instead of a purely pivoting movement, then possibly also may perform a rolling movement, whereby it possibly distances itself somewhat from the proximal lateral wall <b>25</b>, however, due to settling of the whole when the floor is walked upon, or under the influence of other forces, indeed can take place against this wall again.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0128">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the locking element also is provided with an attachment portion <b>50</b> especially provided for this purpose, which portion in this case is performed as a clamped part. As clearly represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the clamping action herein is obtained by an elastic bending and/or deformation of the attachment portion <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> also shows that the female part <b>9</b> can be performed with a relatively low hook-shaped part <b>10</b> and further may have such a shape that two of such floor panels <b>1</b> can be brought into each other at the respective edges also by sliding them towards each other, whether or not assisted by the fact that the hook-shaped part <b>11</b> possibly is elastically bendable. This manner of joining is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Herein, two possibilities can occur. When the floor panels <b>1</b> are held in the same plane and are moved towards each other in this manner, such as indicated by arrow <b>51</b>, the hook-shaped part <b>11</b> is forced to bend out elastically downward. When the floor panels <b>1</b> have been slid with their upper edges against each other, the lock-up body <b>14</b> automatically comes into the locking position, whereas the bent-out hook-shaped part <b>11</b> also bounces back and comes to sit behind the male part <b>8</b>. When the floor panel <b>1</b> comprising the lock-up body <b>14</b> at its edge to be coupled is freely movable in height, then during joining a movement according to arrow S<b>2</b> will take place, wherein the male part <b>8</b> arcuately slides over the hook-shaped part <b>11</b> in order to finally drop until a locking is obtained. Of course, also combinations of both movements may take place.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0130">As schematically indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> by arrow S<b>3</b>, the represented coupling parts also allow that two of such panels can be coupled and/or uncoupled by an angling movement, such by applying a suitable height of the hook-shaped part <b>11</b> and/or a suitable inclination of the contact surfaces <b>51</b>-<b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0131">It is clear that all characteristics described above by means of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 20</figref> optionally can also be integrated into other embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0132">It is noted that the locking element <b>12</b> according to the invention can be taken up into the sides <b>2</b>-<b>3</b> to be coupled at various locations. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 to 23</figref> represent three embodiments, wherein this element is provided at the female part <b>9</b> instead of the male part <b>8</b>, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> represents an embodiment, wherein the locking element <b>12</b> is provided in the edge region and thus not in the actual seat where the male part fits into the female part.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0133">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows that the press-on portion <b>15</b> also may have a bent or folded-over shape.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> represents that the locking element can also be attached in the recess <b>13</b> by means of glue <b>53</b>, possibly by means of a portion especially provided for this purpose, such as an attachment lip <b>54</b>, which, for example, is in connection with the press-on portion <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0135">It is noted that the locking element <b>12</b>, or, thus, the strip, as such can be provided with one or more elastic bending zones, which either form a connection between the actual press-on portion <b>15</b> and the lock-up body <b>14</b>, or a connection between several portions of the press-on portion <b>15</b>, or still between other portions. Such bending zones allow obtaining the desired mutual movability among the composing parts. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is an example thereof, wherein two flexible bending zones <b>15</b>A are provided, between the attachment lip <b>54</b> and the press-on part <b>15</b> on the one hand and the press-on part <b>15</b> and the lock-up body <b>14</b> on the other hand.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0136">Preferably, such bending zones <b>15</b>A are formed by coextrusion during the manufacture of the locking element <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0137">In general, it is preferred that a locking element according to the invention provides for a stable support in vertical direction, whereas in horizontal direction, thus, in the pivoting direction, a flexible movability is effected. The application of co-extruded parts assists therein.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0138">In the case of rectangular floor panels, either oblong or square, it is clear that coupling parts can also be provided at the second pair of opposite sides, which coupling parts, in coupled condition, preferably also offer a horizontal as well as a vertical locking. These coupling parts at the second pair of sides also can be performed as a &#x201c;push-lock&#x201d; coupling, whether or not in accordance with the present invention. Preferably, however, at the second pair of sides coupling means will be applied allowing a mutual coupling by means of a pivoting movement between two floor panels to be coupled and/or by means of a shifting movement resulting in a snap-on connection. Such coupling parts are widely known from the state of the art and are described, for example, in WO 97/47834.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0139">In the most preferred embodiment, at the second pair of sides <b>55</b>-<b>56</b> coupling parts <b>57</b>-<b>58</b> will be applied allowing at least a connection by means of a pivoting movement, as this allows installing the floor panels, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>, in a simple manner. A new floor panel <b>10</b> to be installed then can be simply angled at its side <b>55</b> into the preceding row of floor panels <b>1</b>A, and such just next to a preceding floor panel <b>1</b>B in the same row. When being angled down, the male part of the new floor panel <b>1</b>C to be installed then automatically engages in the female part of the preceding floor panel <b>1</b>B, without the necessity of performing another operation. In the case of oblong floor panels <b>1</b>, thus, it is preferred that the so-called &#x201c;push-lock&#x201d; connection then is situated at the short sides.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> represents an example of the seventh aspect of the invention. According to this aspect, the locking element <b>12</b> consists of a synthetic material strip provided in a recess <b>13</b>, which strip, in the coupled condition of two floor panels <b>1</b>, comes into contact with both floor panels <b>1</b> and thereby forms a seal, wherein between the upper side <b>59</b> of the floor panel <b>1</b> and the synthetic material strip also a seal <b>60</b>-<b>61</b> is present at the panel edges <b>62</b>-<b>63</b>. The intention herein is that the synthetic material strip is applied as a seal against the infiltration of water and thereby offers at least a barrier which at least decelerates and preferably completely blocks the possible infiltration of water in between the coupling parts <b>4</b>-<b>5</b>, whereas the seal <b>60</b>, <b>61</b>, respectively, at the panel edges is intended for protecting the panel material <b>64</b>, which mostly is based on wood, as such against the penetration of water. Possible water which might infiltrate in between two floor panels <b>1</b> then can not or only with difficulty infiltrate up to beneath the floor panels <b>1</b>, whereby the risk of rotting and mould formation beneath the floor panels <b>1</b> is restricted, whereas this water also can not penetrate into the floor panels <b>1</b> themselves and thus a damage at the floor panels <b>1</b> themselves, for example, by swelling, is excluded. The moisture present above the synthetic material strip can evaporate in due course.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0141">In the represented example, the seal against moisture penetration is formed at one side <b>3</b> by the contact <b>65</b> and at the other side <b>2</b> by one or more of the contacts <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> or <b>68</b>. In order to guarantee a better sealing, the locking element can be provided with one or more sealing material portions <b>69</b>, for example, of a relatively soft synthetic material or rubber, which are present at the location of the contacts <b>65</b>-<b>66</b>-<b>67</b>-<b>68</b> at the locking element <b>12</b>. These sealing material portions can be provided at the synthetic material strip in any manner. In a practical embodiment, this will be performed by means of coextrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0142">The seals <b>60</b>-<b>61</b> at the panel edges <b>62</b>-<b>63</b> may have any form. As represented, they are formed, for example, by an impregnation layer or a covering layer, such as a lacquer or varnish layer. They extend from at the top layer downward, each time at least up to one of the locations where said contacts are realized. According to a not represented variant, such seal also may consist in that the top layer extends up to a location where one of the contacts is realized, for example, by applying a top layer which extends over the upper edges downward.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0143">According to the seventh aspect, it is intended that the top layer also is waterproof. Moreover, it then may consist of any material, such as a laminate, a film, a lacquer layer, a water-repellent or waterproof print, a varnish or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0144">It is clear that in this manner both the infiltration of water as well as the penetration of water into the panel edges is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0145">It is noted that floor panels which are installed in rows, and then in particular oblong floor panels, show the feature that the floor panels will align in the longitudinal direction of the rows and mostly will adjoin well with their sides against each other, whereas at the sides directed perpendicularly to the rows then openings will occur more easily, due to the fact that such floor panels, as a result of production tolerances, often do not have perfectly perpendicularly aligned sides. At the location of such openings, a fast infiltration is possible, and a sealing by means of somewhat elastic coatings on the upper edges of the floor panels mostly is not effective, as the openings are too large to be bridged thereby. Thus, in particular at the location of these sides a sealing principle according to the seventh aspect of the invention will show its benefits. In view of the fact that the sides <b>55</b>-<b>56</b> of the floor panels, which are intended to extend in the longitudinal direction of the rows, due to the automatic alignment, adjoin to each other rather well, the problem of infiltration at these sides is little or not at all present and, if one wishes to provide a sealing at all four sides, it may suffice that at these sides exclusively a coating or impregnation is provided on the panel edges, as indicated by reference numbers <b>71</b>-<b>72</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0146">When, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, use is made of a press-on portion <b>15</b> which is clamped, and which is formed by co-extrusion, then it is preferred that the transition T is situated closer to the lock-up body <b>15</b> than in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. With suitable dimensions in free condition, it may then be obtained that in the mounted condition a force is generated holding the locking element <b>12</b> in permanent contact with the support surface <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> represents a variant, which makes clear that the inventive idea of the use of a co-extruded locking element <b>12</b> in a so-called &#x201c;push-lock&#x201d; system is not restricted to embodiments with a pivotable lock-up body. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the lock-up body <b>14</b> is displaceable and consists of a relatively hard synthetic material, whereas the press-on portion <b>15</b> consists of flexible and elastic synthetic material. Herein, the co-extruded press-on portion <b>15</b> functions as an elastic mass situated behind the lock-up body <b>14</b> in a spring-like fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> represents another variant, which is comparable to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Herein, the difference consists in that the hook-shaped part <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is realized considerably higher than in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, such that the contact surfaces <b>51</b>-<b>52</b> at least partially are situated higher than the support surface <b>21</b> of the lock-up body.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0149"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> represents a preferred variant of an embodiment according to the invention, wherein the locking element <b>12</b> is provided in the proximal side of the female part. In respect to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, this offers an important advantage. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the edge <b>73</b> is made relatively sharp and straight in order to obtain that the lock-up body <b>14</b> in free condition still is seated beneath the edge <b>73</b>. When, during lowering of a floor panel <b>1</b> in a manner as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the sides <b>2</b>-<b>3</b> to be coupled to each other do not perfectly correspond, for example, because the floor panels <b>1</b>B-<b>1</b>C, seen in top view, are overlapping somewhat, for example, as a result of the warping of floor panels in the preceding row, or as a result of un-squareness of the panels, a condition is created as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, wherein then the edge <b>73</b> scrapes along the upper edge <b>74</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, this can easily be counteracted in that the edge <b>73</b> can be performed with an adequate chamfer, as a consequence of which a possible contact between edge <b>73</b> and upper edge <b>74</b> rather results in a sliding movement along each other than in a scraping effect.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0150">Also, in an embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the locking element <b>12</b>, when the right-hand floor panel is moved downward, comes into contact with the sharp upper edge <b>74</b> of the left-hand floor panel, whereby also a scraping effect may be created, which can impede the installation. In contrast, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> does not show this disadvantage, in view of the fact that the rounded underside of the male part then will slide smoothly along the locking element.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> also relates to an embodiment meeting the eighth aspect of the invention mentioned in the introduction, more specifically in that the edges of the floor panels <b>1</b> can be joined into each other by a shifting movement S<b>1</b>.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0158">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, it is also represented that the lock-up body <b>14</b>, and still better the entire locking element <b>12</b> realized as an insert, is made relatively local, by which in particular is meant that it is only present between a first and a second horizontal level, the first horizontal level N<b>1</b> of which is situated at a distance beneath the upper side of the coupled floor panels, whereas the second horizontal level N<b>2</b> is situated lower than the first, however, higher than the lowermost point of the male part. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also shows that said lock-up body <b>14</b> extends over a height H which is at least 40% and still better at least 50% of the height difference between the upper side of such coupled floor panels and the lowermost point of the male part, i.e., D<b>7</b>. It is clear that these characteristics are not limited to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0159">In the case of a pivotable embodiment, wherein one floor panel can be angled into the other or out of it, it is preferred that, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the horizontal distance D<b>6</b>, as measured from the upper edges of the floor panels up to the cooperating point of the contact surfaces <b>51</b>-<b>52</b>, which is situated farthest away from these upper edges, is at least 1.3 times the distance D<b>7</b> between the upper side of the floor panels and the underside of the male part, which allows a smooth angling movement.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0160">In order to allow a smooth angling in and out and/or shifting together, the highest point <b>75</b> preferably is situated at a level N<b>3</b>, which is lower than the lowermost point of the lock-up body <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> represents a particular construction of a press-on portion <b>15</b>, wherein it is clear that this construction also can be applied in other embodiments of floor panels according to the invention. This press-on portion, more particularly the construction thereof, shows the following characteristics:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0162">that the press-on portion <b>15</b>, viewed in cross-section, is realized as a pivot arm, which is supported or held next to one extremity and adjoins at the other extremity, by means of a hinge and/or bending zone <b>76</b>, to the rear side of the lock-up body <b>14</b>;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0163">that said pivot arm has a hinge and/or bending zone <b>76</b>-<b>77</b>, respectively, at both extremities, in this case formed by thinner parts in the material; moreover, the zone <b>77</b> preferably is situated such in respect to an underlying support surface that an upward-directed pivoting movement is possible in a smoother manner than a downward-directed one;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0164">that the press-on portion <b>15</b> is realized as a mechanism which, when the lock-up body is compressed, will provide for that this lock-up body becomes positioned with one extremity against a support surface <b>21</b>; more particularly, a compression K<b>1</b> results in a pivoting movement K<b>2</b>, as a result of which the lock-up element <b>14</b> is pressed upwards according to arrow K<b>3</b> against the support surface <b>21</b>;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0165">that the above-mentioned mechanism consists of a pivot arm connecting, one the one hand, to the rear side of the lock-up body and, on the other hand, is supported by means of a support portion, such as a support collar <b>78</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0166">Finally, it is noted that the floor panels according to the invention in general can be realized such that in coupled condition a so-called &#x201c;pre-tension&#x201d; is created, which means that the floor panels at their coupled sides are pressed towards each other by means of a tension force. Herein, the tension force can be supplied in any manner. For example, it may be generated by the elastic bending of the lip bordering the underside of the female part. Herein, the principle can be applied which is known from WO 97/47834, more particularly from FIG. 23 of said WO 97/47834.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0167">It is also clear that floor panels of the present invention can also be equipped with an anti-creak system, more particularly by application of the principle described in WO 2006/032398.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> shows another embodiment meeting the various aspects and in particular the ninth aspect of the invention. Herein, the lock-up body <b>14</b> and the attachment portion <b>50</b> consist of a relatively rigid material and are connected to each other by coextrusion by means of a material part <b>79</b> made as a hinge part, which material part consists of a more flexible and elastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0169">The lock-up body <b>14</b> globally forms an angle with the attachment portion <b>50</b> and reaches with the extremity functioning as a support portion <b>20</b> up to beyond the actual attachment portion <b>50</b>, in such a manner that at the location <b>80</b>, where the lock-up body <b>14</b> passes along the attachment portion <b>50</b>, the distance between the lock-up body <b>14</b> and the attachment portion <b>50</b> is smaller than the distance from the&#x2014;in this case upwardly protruding&#x2014;extremity of the lock-up body <b>14</b> to the attachment portion <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0170">The material part <b>79</b> is situated between the actual attachment portion <b>50</b> and said protruding beyond it extremity of the lock-up body <b>14</b>. This design has the advantage that the lock-up body <b>14</b>, due to the small material quantity at the location <b>80</b>, can hardly be displaced in respect to the attachment portion <b>50</b>, with the exception of an angling movement, whereas in upward direction sufficient flexible material of the material part <b>79</b> is present in order to hold the lock-up body <b>14</b> in a certain position and to allow the desired elastic movement thereof. Still another advantage is that, when the lock-up body <b>14</b> is angled in, the material on the location <b>80</b> is compressed and the lock-up body <b>14</b> also is pushed upward, as a consequence of which it remains in contact with the support surface <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0171">In mounted condition, the locking element <b>12</b> preferably is supported at least on three locations, on the one hand, at the bottom at the height of the support collar <b>78</b>, at the top by the upper side <b>81</b> of the material part <b>79</b>, as well as at the height of the represented ribs <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> also shows that the attachment portion <b>60</b> is provided substantially flat in the recess <b>13</b>, in other words, that the direction <b>83</b> in which this attachment direction <b>50</b> extends, deviates little or not at all from the plane of the floor panels. By altering this direction <b>83</b>, which a manufacturer of floor panels can do in a simple manner by positioning the recess <b>13</b> somewhat differently, different functioning characteristics in respect to angling the lock-up body in and out can be obtained, such that an optimization is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 to 37</figref> represent another variant of the invention. A number of differences in respect to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> will be discussed in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0174">A first difference consists in that the locking element <b>12</b> in vertical direction is supported in the recess <b>13</b> by means of only three support portions, or at least substantially by only three support portions, one support portion of which is formed by the aforementioned support portion <b>20</b> of the lock-up body <b>14</b>. The other two support portions, <b>84</b> and <b>85</b>, respectively, preferably are situated at the upper side and underside of the actual attachment portion <b>50</b>. More particularly, it is preferred that the support portion <b>84</b> situated at the top is located in respect to the floor panel more proximally than the support portion <b>85</b> situated at the bottom. Still more particularly, it is preferred that the support portion <b>84</b> of the upper side is located at the&#x2014;situated proximally in respect to the floor panel <b>1</b>&#x2014;extremity of the actual attachment portion <b>50</b>, whereas the support portion <b>85</b> is located at the distally situated extremity. A considerable difference from the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> thus is that the material part <b>79</b>, at least in the free condition, does not form a support point. It is clear that one and the same support portion as such may comprise several contact points, for example, if it should have a ribbed surface.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0175">In this embodiment, the locking element <b>12</b> is configured such that in the mounted, however, not impressed condition, namely the one from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, a certain clamping thereof in the recess <b>13</b> is created. This is obtained, for example, by the elastic deformation of the actual body of the attachment portion <b>50</b> from the position represented in dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> to the position represented in solid line, which deformation is achieved during clamping of the locking element <b>12</b> in the recess <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0176">A second difference consists in that the actual attachment portion <b>50</b> is configured and attached in the recess <b>13</b> such, that during joining of two floor panels <b>1</b> a certain movability of the actual attachment portion <b>50</b> is possible. In the represented example, the support portion <b>85</b> to this aim is provided with a guiding surface <b>86</b>, which can cooperate with an inclined guiding surface <b>87</b> at the floor panel, whereby a small displacement <b>88</b> of the attachment portion <b>50</b> is possible, such as will be described in the following by means of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 to 37</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 to 37</figref> represent successive conditions of the locking element <b>12</b> during joining of two floor panels <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> shows the rest position. Due to the tension force in this entity, the support portion <b>85</b> has the tendency to slide downward along the guiding surface <b>8</b> until it reaches the represented position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 36</figref> represent successive conditions, wherein the right-hand panel is angled down and the lock-up body <b>14</b> is pushed aside. Due to the fact that on the location <b>80</b> very little material of the material portion <b>79</b> is present between the lock-up body <b>14</b> and the actual attachment portion <b>50</b>, this latter, starting from a certain moment, is also forced somewhat inward, wherein it moves with its guiding surface <b>86</b> along the guiding surface <b>87</b>, until it reaches a condition, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. Herein, the attachment portion <b>50</b>, so to speak, makes room for the movement of the lock-up body <b>14</b> and thereby performs a more or less rotating displacement <b>88</b>, such, for example, until it comes with its extremity <b>89</b> into contact with the deepest point of the recess <b>13</b>. Hereby is obtained, amongst others, that the support portion <b>20</b> rotates practically exclusively at its place along its highest point and performs little or no rolling movement along the floor panel. Further, the whole may be designed such that the actual attachment portion <b>50</b>, after the locking of the floor panels, also more or less arrives back at its initial location, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. The downward-protruding support portion <b>85</b> thus indeed provides for a blocking function, which determines the normal position of the locking element <b>12</b> in the recess, however, with a certain load in fact will allow an extra movement <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0178">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the locking element <b>12</b> according to the invention may also be configured such that in the most impressed condition, a free space <b>90</b> is created between the support portion <b>20</b> and the wall of the recess <b>13</b>. The proper configuration for this purpose can be determined by tests. An advantage thereof is that during the initial backward movement of the lock-up body <b>14</b>, there is no friction present between the support portion <b>20</b> and the wall of the recess <b>13</b>, which might prevent the smooth pivoting outward of the lock-up body <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0179">As is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> by dashed line <b>91</b>, according to a variant a deformation may be provided in the wall of the recess <b>13</b>, which deformation cooperates with a deformation in the attachment portion <b>50</b>, as a result of which the locking element <b>12</b>, so to speak, can be fixedly attached in the recess <b>13</b> by means of a snap-on connection.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0180">It is clear that the essential characteristics of the embodiments of the FIGS. <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>-<b>37</b> consist in that the locking element <b>12</b>, viewed in cross-section, consists at least of an actual attachment portion <b>50</b>, a lock-up body <b>14</b>, which can perform at least an angling movement, and a material part <b>79</b>, which is present between the attachment portion <b>50</b> and the lock-up body <b>14</b>, which material part consists of a material which is more flexible and elastic than the material of the lock-up body <b>14</b> and which thereby functions at least as a hinge part. From the above, it is clear that all other characteristics described by means of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 to 37</figref> are facultative and that all these facultative characteristics can be mutually combined at random. Herein, the most important preferred characteristic consists in that the attachment portion <b>50</b>, the material part <b>79</b> and the lock-up body <b>40</b> by means of coextrusion are realized as a one-piece strip. Herein, it is preferred that the actual attachment portion <b>50</b> and the lock-up body <b>14</b> are manufactured of one and the same material, whereas the material part <b>79</b> consists of a more flexible material. In principle, the same basic substances can be applied for both materials, however, they may differ from each other by the addition of additives, such as plasticizers. The material of the material part <b>79</b> preferably behaves like a relatively soft rubber, whereas the material of the actual attachment portion <b>50</b> and of the lock-up body <b>40</b> preferably behaves like a classic synthetic material, such as common PVC, and thus, in view of the small dimensions in cross-sections, also behaves in a relatively rigid manner.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0181">It is clear that the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 to 37</figref> also allows that two of such floor panels can be brought into each other at the represented edges not only by means of a downward movement, but also by means of an angling movement or by shifting towards each other. Unlocking may take place, for example, by angling the floor panels out of each other. Also, it is not excluded to provide a recess in this embodiment, analogous to the recess <b>46</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, such that unlocking by means of a rod <b>47</b> is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0182">In general, it is noted that by the characteristic that &#x201c;the support portion, for example, <b>20</b>, is rotatable against a support surface, for example, <b>21</b>&#x201d;, it is intended that there is a contact at least during part of the rotation and that it thus is not excluded that there is no contact for a part of the rotation, as becomes clear from the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, wherein in a certain position indeed a free space <b>90</b> is present. The contact will normally be present indeed from a certain angling-out of the lock-up body.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0183">The fact that such support portion <b>20</b> is rotatable against a support surface <b>21</b>, must be interpreted in the broadest sense. The rotation can provide for a local rotation of the support portion <b>20</b>, as well as a rolling movement along the support surface, as well as a combination of both. Also, it is not excluded that the turning movement is combined with shifting. A local rotation, or &#x201c;pivoting against a support or rotation point&#x201d;, may concern a turning around a point or zone which is, are, respectively, situated in the support surface <b>21</b>, as well as a rotation point or rotation zone at a distance from the support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0184">In the production of floor panels according to the invention, the recess <b>13</b> can be realized in any manner. According to a preferred characteristic, this takes place by means of a milling treatment, which is performed when realizing said female coupling part.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0185">The application of the strip-shaped locking element <b>12</b> in the recess <b>13</b> may also be performed in any manner. In the following, two non-restrictive embodiments of methods for this purpose are described, which can be applied within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0186">According to a first technique, the strip-shaped locking element <b>12</b> systematically is fixedly pressed on in the recess <b>13</b>, preferably is rolled into it. Preferably, this takes place, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, by displacing the floor panels <b>1</b>, which mostly are lying upside down, by means of a conveyor <b>92</b>, supplying thereto a strip <b>93</b> from which the strip-shaped locking elements <b>12</b> have to be cut off, and fixedly pressing on this strip <b>93</b>, the locking elements <b>12</b> cut off therefrom, respectively, in the recesses <b>13</b> of the successive floor panels <b>1</b> by means of a locally installed rotating press-on roll <b>94</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39 to 41</figref> show, how the strip is pressed on in the recess <b>13</b> by means of the press-on roll <b>94</b>, which to this aim can be provided with a profiled surface <b>95</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0187">It is clear that the strip <b>93</b> can be supplied from a stock, for example, a wound stock. Further, a cutting device <b>96</b> is present for separating the locking elements <b>12</b> at a suitable length from the strip <b>93</b>, which device is illustrated schematically only. It is clear that in practice the necessary guiding elements will be present in order to have the strip <b>93</b> and the locking element <b>12</b> follow the correct course, of which the guiding element <b>97</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40 and 41</figref> is an example.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> shows a variant, wherein according to the invention a method is applied wherein a cut to length strip-shaped locking element <b>12</b> over its entire length simultaneously is pressed into the recess <b>13</b>. As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, this preferably is performed by means of a device with a slider or plunger <b>98</b>, with which the locking element <b>12</b> laterally is pushed over its entire length at one go into the recess <b>13</b>. As represented, the device preferably comprises a holder <b>99</b>, in which a space <b>100</b> is defined, in which a locking element <b>12</b> to be applied can be taken up and wherein the plunger <b>98</b> can be shifted. Then, the holder <b>99</b>, together with the plunger <b>98</b> present therein and the locking element <b>12</b> present therein, is positioned opposite to the edge of a floor panel concerned, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, after which, by displacing the plunger <b>98</b> to and fro to the right, the locking element <b>12</b> is brought from the position represented in solid line to this position represented in dashed line, after which it remains in the recess <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> schematically shows how the device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> can be applied in practice. In this example, the floor panels <b>1</b> are displaced along a conveyor <b>92</b>. The holder <b>99</b>, too, can perform various displacements, as will become clear from the function sequence described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0190">Initially, the holder <b>99</b> is situated in a position <b>101</b>. First, a strip <b>93</b> is supplied to the holder, which strip is provided in the space <b>100</b>. As represented, this may be realized, for example, by displacing the holder <b>99</b> along a press-on roll <b>103</b> with which the strip <b>93</b>, which is supplied from a not represented stock, is directed into the space <b>100</b> of the holder <b>99</b>, as illustrated for the position <b>102</b> of the holder <b>99</b>. The length necessary for forming the locking element <b>12</b> is then cut off by means of the schematically represented cutting device <b>104</b>. In the meantime, a floor panel has arrived in a position <b>105</b>. Subsequently, the holder <b>99</b> can follow the movement of a passing floor panel <b>1</b>, as a result of which they come into positions <b>106</b> and <b>107</b>, respectively. During this movement, the holder <b>99</b> and the floor panel concerned can be presented to each other, for example, by laterally displacing the holder <b>99</b> until it reaches position <b>108</b>. Hereby then the condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> is obtained, after which it suffices to activate the plunger <b>98</b> in order to bring the locking element <b>12</b> into the recess <b>13</b>. As described above, all this can take place during the continuous conveyance of the floor panels, for example, after they exit the milling device and before they are packaged. The holder <b>99</b>, or possibly several applied holders <b>99</b>, then can be displaced to and fro through all abovementioned positions. Also, multiple holders on a conveyor belt might be used, wherein a holder then is brought from position <b>108</b> back to position <b>101</b>, while already one or more other holders pass through the same trajectory. According to a variant, panels also may be supplied stepwise instead of continuously to an insertion device for locking elements <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0191">It is clear that by a lock-up body <b>14</b> which can be pivoted or bent out, it is intended that it can be pivoted or can be bent out in the plane of a cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0192">Generally, it is noted that the support portion of the lock-up body, around which it is rotatable, is a support portion which is intended to take up the forces when the floor panels attempt to get away from each other in upward direction. From US2007/0006543, which corresponds to WO2007/008139, also a rotatable locking element is known, which, however, contrary to the invention, does not rotate around a support point which, as above, is intended to provide for a lock-up support function which counteracts the unlocking of the floor panels.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0193">By a &#x201c;rigid&#x201d; lock-up body, it is meant that this rigidity exists at least in a plane according to the cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0194">The present invention is in no way limited to the embodiments described by way of example and represented in the figures, on the contrary may such floor panels be realized in various forms and dimensions, without leaving the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0195">From the above, it is clear that the invention, and in particular the locking element according to the invention, can be employed in various floor panels, amongst others, in laminate floor panels, prefabricated floor panels, such as so-called &#x201c;engineered wood&#x201d;, solid parquet, veneer parquet, as well as floor panels which are provided with any top layer, for example, vinyl, linoleum, stone, metal and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0196">It is noted that the core of such floor panel not necessary has to consist of wood or a product on the basis of wood and in principle may consist of any material, thus, for example, also synthetic material.</p>
