<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2005-0119372, filed on Dec. 8, 2005 which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an LCD driving circuit, and more particularly, to a gate driver capable of repairing defective stages, and a repairing method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) device displays images by controlling light transmittance of liquid crystal using electric fields. The LCD device includes a liquid crystal display panel in which pixels are arranged in a matrix format and driving circuits for driving the LCD panel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The LCD panel is configured such that a plurality of gate lines and a plurality of data lines orthogonally cross each other to define pixel areas within the crossings of the gate lines and the data lines. The LCD panel includes pixel electrodes and common electrodes for applying electric fields to the pixel areas.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Respective pixel electrodes are connected to the data lines via the sources and drains of thin film transistors (TFTs) employed as switching elements in each pixel. The TFTs are turned on by scan pulses applied to the gates via the gate lines to allow voltages corresponding to the data signals of the data lines to be charged to the pixel areas.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The driving circuits include a gate driver for driving the gate lines; a data driver for driving data lines; a timing controller for providing control signals for controlling the gate driver and data driver; and a power supply unit for providing various driving voltages used in the LCD device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The timing controller serves to control driving timing of the gate driver and the data driver and to provide the pixel data to the data driver. The power supply unit serves to boost or diminish an input voltage to generate a common voltage VCOM and driving voltages for a gate high voltage signal VGH, a gate low voltage signal VGL and other voltages. In addition, the gate driver sequentially provides the scan pulses to the gate lines to sequentially drive liquid crystal cells of an LCD panel line by line. The data driver provides pixel voltage signals to each data line each time a scan pulse is provided to one of the gate lines. The light transmittance of the LCD panel is controlled by electric fields that are applied to the pixel electrodes and the common electrodes of LC cells according to the pixel voltage signals to display images on the LCD panel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The gate driver includes a shift register to sequentially supply the above-described scan pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A driving circuit of the related art will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a shift register of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The shift register of the related art includes a plurality of stages ST<b>101</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>10</b><i>n+</i>1 which are dependently connected to each other. The stages ST<b>101</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>10</b><i>n </i>not including a dummy stage ST<b>10</b><i>n+</i>1 sequentially output scan pulses to the gate lines included in the display unit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Each of the stages ST<b>101</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>10</b><i>n+</i>1 is enabled as each stage receives a scan pulse outputted from the immediately preceding stage and disabled as each stage receives a scan pulse outputted from the immediately following stage.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>102</b> is enabled as it inputs a scan pulse from the 1<sup>st </sup>stage ST<b>101</b> and disabled as it inputs a scan pulse from the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To this end, each of the stages ST<b>101</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>10</b><i>n </i>has three output lines <b>141</b><i>a</i>, <b>141</b><i>b</i>, and <b>141</b><i>c</i>, as shown in 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>102</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The first output line <b>141</b><i>a </i>is electrically connected between a corresponding stage and a corresponding gate line. The second output line <b>141</b><i>b </i>is electrically connected between the first output line <b>141</b><i>a </i>and the following stage thereof. The third output line <b>141</b><i>c </i>is electrically connected between the first output line <b>141</b><i>a </i>and the preceding stage thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">If a defect occurs in one of the stages ST<b>101</b>&#x2dc;STn+1 such that the defective stage cannot be operated, none of the stages following the defective stage will be able to output a scan pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>103</b> is inoperable due to a defect, it does not output a scan pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a normal state, the 4<sup>th </sup>stage ST<b>104</b> immediately following the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>103</b> is enabled as it receives a scan pulse outputted from the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>103</b>. However, because the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>103</b> has been rendered inoperable due to a malfunction as described above, the 4<sup>th </sup>stage ST<b>104</b> is not enabled to output a scan pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Similarly, in the normal state, the 5<sup>th </sup>stage ST<b>105</b> immediately following the 4<sup>th </sup>stage ST<b>104</b> is enabled as it inputs a scan pulse outputted from the 4<sup>th </sup>stage ST<b>104</b>. However, since the 4<sup>th </sup>stage ST<b>104</b> does not output a scan pulse because of the failure of the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage, the 5<sup>th </sup>stage ST<b>105</b> cannot be enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The remaining stages, from the 6<sup>th </sup>stage to the nth stage ST<b>10</b><i>n </i>will be similarly unable output scan pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Therefore, the third to nth gate lines, which are connected to the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>103</b> to the nth stage ST<b>10</b><i>n</i>, cannot be operated due to the defect in the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage. Accordingly, pixel cells connected to the 3<sup>rd </sup>to nth gate lines cannot display images.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a gate driver and a method of repairing the gate driver that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An advantage of the present invention is to provide a gate driver and a method for repairing the gate driver, which are capable of operating with defective stages, in which the gate driver includes at least a repair line which is crossed with the first output line, and a repair scan pulse generator for providing repair scan pulses to the repair line.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Reference will now be made in detail to an embodiment of the present invention, example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a gate driver according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in the drawings, the gate driver includes: a shift register SR including a plurality of stages having a plurality of first output lines <b>241</b><i>a</i>; a repair line <b>222</b> which is arranged such that the repair line <b>222</b> crosses each of the first output lines <b>241</b><i>a</i>; a storage device <b>271</b> for storing information identifying a position of a certain stage; and a repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> for providing repair scan pulses Vrep to the repair line <b>222</b> on the basis of the information stored in the storage device <b>271</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Hereinafter, the above elements will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The shift register SR includes 1<sup>st </sup>to nth stages ST<b>201</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>20</b><i>n </i>and a dummy stage ST<b>20</b><i>n+</i>1. The shift register stages (ST<b>201</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>20</b><i>n+</i>1) sequentially generate output scan pulses to be supplied a display unit <b>200</b> of a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel. The 1<sup>st </sup>to nth stages ST<b>201</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>20</b><i>n </i>(i.e. not including the dummy stage ST<b>20</b><i>n+</i>1) each provides scan pulses to a corresponding gate line included in the display unit <b>200</b>. Accordingly, the respective gate lines GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn are sequentially driven from the first gate line GL<b>1</b> to the nth gate line GLn.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each of the stages ST<b>201</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>20</b><i>n+</i>1 is enabled in response to a scan pulse outputted from the immediately preceding stage (if any) and disabled in response to a scan pulse outputted from the immediately following stage. Each enabled stage inputs one of at least two types of clock pulses having a phase difference and provides the inputted clock pulse used as a scan pulse to a corresponding gate line. On the other hand, each disabled stage inputs an OFF power signal to provide it to a corresponding gate line such that the corresponding gate line can be deactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> is enabled in response to the first scan pulse from the 1<sup>st </sup>stage ST<b>201</b>, and disabled in response to the third scan pulse from the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b>. The enabled 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> receives the second clock pulse CLK<b>2</b> among the first to fourth clock pulses CLK<b>1</b>&#x2dc;CLK<b>4</b> which clock of the first to fourth clock pulses having a different phase, and provides the second clock pulse CLK<b>2</b> as a second scan pulse to the second gate line GL<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To this end, each of the stages (ST<b>202</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>20</b><i>n</i>) except for the stages ST<b>201</b> and the dummy stage ST<b>20</b><i>n+</i>1 has first to third output lines <b>241</b><i>a</i>&#x2dc;<b>241</b><i>c </i>as shown in stage ST<b>202</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>is electrically connected between a corresponding stage and a corresponding gate line. The second output line <b>241</b><i>b </i>is electrically connected between the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>and the following stage thereof. The third output line <b>241</b><i>c </i>is electrically connected between the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>and the preceding stage thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>of the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> electrically connects the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> to the second gate line GL<b>2</b>. The second output line <b>241</b><i>b </i>of the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> electrically connects the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>of the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> to the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b>. The third output line <b>241</b><i>c </i>of the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> electrically connects the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>of the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> to the 1<sup>st </sup>stage ST<b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Since the 1<sup>st </sup>stage ST<b>201</b> does not have a preceding stage, the 1<sup>st </sup>stage ST<b>201</b> has first and second output lines <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>b </i>but does not have a third output line <b>241</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, since the dummy stage ST<b>20</b><i>n+</i>1 does not have a following stage and does not supply scan pulses to a gate line, the dummy stage ST<b>20</b><i>n+</i>1 has a third output line <b>241</b><i>c </i>and does not have either a first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>for supplying a gate line or a second output line <b>241</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an alternative configuration of the shift register each of the stages (ST<b>201</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>20</b><i>n</i>) can be disabled through the clock pulses as each stage inputs one of the above-described clock pulses. In this alternative configuration, each of the stages (ST<b>201</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>20</b><i>n</i>) has only first and second output lines <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>b </i>does not need a third output line <b>241</b><i>c </i>to perform the disabling function. Further, the dummy stage may be omitted from the shift register SR and the nth stage ST<b>20</b><i>n </i>included in the shift register SR may have only the first output line <b>241</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although the repair line <b>222</b> is arranged to cross the first output lines <b>241</b><i>a</i>, an isolation film is formed therebetween electrically isolating the repair line <b>222</b> from the first output lines <b>241</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">One end of the repair line <b>222</b> is connected to the repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b>. The repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> reads information stored in the storage device <b>271</b> and controls the output timing of the repair scan pulse Vrep based on the information read from the storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The storage device <b>271</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention may be implemented with a programmable read only memory (PROM) or with other types of storage devices such as random access memory (RAM). The storage device <b>271</b> stores information identifying a position of a malfunctioning stage of the shift register SR.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> selects one of at least two clock pulses whose phases are different from one another to be used as a repair scan pulse Vrep. The repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> reads the information stored in the storage device <b>271</b> and selects one of the clock pulses based on the read result.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In other words, the repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> reads the information stored in the storage device <b>271</b> to identify which stage is presently in a malfunctioning state and then determines a clock pulse to be provided for the malfunctioning stage. In other words, the repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> outputs a scan pulse (i.e., a repair scan pulse Vrep) in the stead of the malfunctioning stage.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> outputs a clock pulse once each frame. The clock pulses, which are repeatedly outputted each period, are inputted to the repair scan pulse generator <b>170</b>. The repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> does not output the selected clock pulse each period, but outputs the selected clock pulse once each frame. Therefore, a clock pulse (i.e., a repair scan pulse Vrep) is supplied to the repair line <b>222</b> once each frame.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, when the repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> inputs first to fourth clock pulses CLK<b>1</b>&#x2dc;CLK<b>4</b> and the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> is in a malfunctioning state, the storage device <b>271</b> stores information identifying the position of the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b>. The repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> reads the information stored in the storage device <b>271</b> and based on the information read, selects the third clock pulse CLK<b>3</b> to be provided to the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The third clock pulses CLK<b>3</b> are outputted at a constant period. The repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> selects one of the third clock pulses CLK<b>3</b> at a particular period, and then outputs the selected third clock pulse CLK<b>3</b> used as a repair scan pulse Vrep.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The start time of the particular period corresponds to a start time when the malfunctioning 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> is designed to output a scan pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The gate driver according to the embodiment of the present invention is implemented with four clock pulses CLK<b>1</b>&#x2dc;CLK<b>4</b>, in which adjacent clock pulses of the four clock pulses have a phase difference of one clock pulse width.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The first to fourth clock pulses CLK<b>1</b>&#x2dc;CLK<b>4</b> are outputted from the timing controller and then amplified. The amplified first to fourth clock pulses CLK<b>1</b>&#x2dc;CLK<b>4</b> are provided to the respective stages through the first to fourth clock transmission lines <b>288</b><i>a</i>&#x2dc;<b>288</b><i>d. </i></p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> includes a clock generator <b>270</b><i>a </i>for reading information stored in the storage device <b>271</b> and for selecting and outputting one of the first to fourth clock pulses CLK<b>1</b>&#x2dc;CLK<b>4</b> based on the read result; and a signal amplifier <b>270</b><i>b </i>for amplifying a clock pulse from the clock pulse generator <b>270</b><i>a </i>to output the selected clock pulse thereto.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The timing controller <b>277</b><i>a </i>outputs the first to fourth clock pulses CLK<b>1</b>&#x2dc;CLK<b>4</b> through four first output transmission lines <b>401</b>.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The first to fourth clock pulses, which are outputted through the four first output transmission lines <b>401</b>, and the clock pulse CLKm, which is outputted from the single second output transmission line <b>402</b>, are provided to the level shifter <b>277</b><i>b</i>. In particular, the first to fourth clock pulses CLK<b>1</b>&#x2dc;CLK<b>4</b>, which are outputted through the first transmission line <b>401</b>, are provided to the level shifter <b>277</b><i>b </i>several times per frame. The clock pulse CLKm outputted from the second output transmission line <b>402</b> is provided to the level shifter <b>277</b><i>b </i>once per frame.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The level shifter <b>277</b><i>b </i>boosts voltage levels of the first to fourth clock pulses CLK<b>1</b>&#x2dc;CLK<b>4</b> provided thereto through the first output transmission line <b>401</b> and of the clock pulse CLKm provided thereto through the second output transmission line <b>402</b>. The clock pulses with boosted voltage levels are and then outputted by the level shifter <b>277</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The following is a description for a method for repairing the gate driver according to the first embodiment of the present invention, in which a stage is in a malfunctioning state due to a defect.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a schematic block diagram of the gate driver to describe a method for repairing the gate driver when the third stage of the shift register of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is inoperable.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> of the shift register SR is in a malfunctioning state, the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> does not generate any output. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the 1<sup>st </sup>and 2<sup>nd </sup>stages ST<b>201</b> and ST<b>202</b> operate normally such that the first and second gate lines GL<b>1</b> and GL<b>2</b> can be also operated. Because the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> is in a malfunctioning state, the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> and the 4<sup>th </sup>stage ST<b>204</b> through the dummy stage ST<b>20</b><i>n+</i>1 following the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> are not enabled by the 3<sup>rd </sup>state to output scan pulses. Therefore, absent a repair, the third to nth gate lines GL<b>3</b>&#x2dc;GLn connected to the 3<sup>rd </sup>to nth stages ST<b>203</b>&#x2dc;ST<b>20</b><i>n </i>do not receive scan pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In order to repair the gate driver, information identifying a position of the stage in a malfunctioning state is first stored in the storage device <b>271</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>connected to the stage in a malfunctioning state, (e.g. the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is then electrically connected to the repair line <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The electrical connection of an output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>to the repair line <b>22</b> may be made by laser wielding a cross point between the repair line <b>222</b> and the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>connected to the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> can be electrically separated or disconnected from the first output line <b>241</b><i>a</i>. The electrical disconnection between the output lead of the malfunctioning 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> and the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>may be achieved by removing the contact point therebetween using a laser. The electrical disconnection may prevent a distorted signal from the malfunctioning 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> from being provided to the third gate line GL<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Therefore, the repair line <b>222</b> is connected electrically through the cross point <b>281</b> to the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>of the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b>, the third gate line GL<b>3</b> is connected to the first output line <b>241</b><i>a</i>, the second output line <b>241</b><i>b </i>is connected to the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>of the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> and the third output line <b>241</b><i>c </i>is connected to the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>of the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When the gate driver, which is repaired as described above, is operated, the 1<sup>st </sup>stage ST<b>201</b> is enabled in response to the first clock transmission line <b>288</b><i>a</i>. The enabled 1<sup>st </sup>stage ST<b>201</b> receives the first clock pulse CLK<b>1</b> from the first clock transmission line <b>288</b><i>a </i>and then outputs the first clock pulse CLK<b>1</b> to be used as a first scan pulse. The first scan pulse is provided to the first gate line GL<b>1</b> through the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>and to the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> through the first and second output lines <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> is enabled in response to the first scan pulse from the 1<sup>st </sup>stage ST<b>201</b>. The enabled 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> receives the second clock pulse CLK<b>2</b> from the second clock transmission line <b>288</b><i>b </i>and then outputs the second clock pulse CLK<b>2</b> to be used as a second scan pulse. The second scan pulse is provided to the second gate line GL<b>2</b> though the first output line <b>241</b><i>a</i>, and to the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> through the first and second output lines <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>b</i>. In addition, the second scan pulse is provided to the 1<sup>st </sup>stage ST<b>201</b> through the first and third output lines <b>241</b><i>b </i>and <b>241</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Since the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b> is in a malfunctioning state, although it receives the second scan pulse from the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b>, it cannot output a third scan pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When a third clock pulse CLK<b>3</b> is outputted, or when the third clock pulse CLK<b>3</b> is provided to the 3<sup>rd </sup>clock transmission line <b>288</b><i>c</i>, the repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> also outputs a third clock pulse CLK<b>3</b>, and provides the third clock pulse CLK<b>3</b> for use as a repair scan pulse Vrep to the repair line <b>222</b>. The timing for outputting the clock pulse in the repair scan pulse generator <b>270</b> is controlled based on the information stored in the storage device <b>271</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The repair scan pulse Vrep is provided to the repair line <b>222</b>, which is connected to the third gate line GL<b>3</b> through the crossing point <b>281</b>. The repair scan pulse Vrep is then provided to the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b> through the crossing point <b>281</b> to disable the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage ST<b>202</b>, to the first output line <b>241</b><i>a </i>connected to the 3<sup>rd </sup>stage ST<b>203</b>, and to the third output line <b>241</b><i>c </i>connected to the first output line <b>241</b><i>a</i>.
