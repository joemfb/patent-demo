<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The loss of a jewelry item can be expensive as well as heart breaking. Many jewelry items are at least partially comprised of a multi-link band with multiple fastened or fastenable links. This may be true of such items as watches, bracelets, and necklaces, for example. Such items can sometimes come undone and be lost or damaged. Also, such jewelry items can have links fail, even if separate from links adjoined by an existing band clasp. The present device provides for installation onto such jewelry items in order to ensure against inadvertent loss.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The jewelry safety chain device relates to jewelry items and more especially to a safety chain device that prevents jewelry item loss even in the event of failure of item links or existing item clasp.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The general purpose of the jewelry safety chain device, described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a jewelry safety chain device which has many novel features that result in an improved jewelry safety chain device which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by prior art, either alone or in combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To attain this, the jewelry safety chain device provides eye screws that are designed to anchor into links and even each link of a multi-link jewelry item, such as a watch, bracelet, or necklace, for example. Preferably, the eye screws may be comprised of an eyelet on one end with a shaft extended from the eyelet. The shaft is threaded and also has a point. The eye screws are thereby more readily received by the links. The flexible cable of the device is passed through the eye screw at one end of a jewelry item and looped through the flexible cable's loop at the flexible cable first end. The flexible cable is passed through each eyelet of each eye screw. The second end of the flexible cable has a clasp that is hooked onto an eyelet of an eye screw that is typically, for example, attached to a side of a link at either an opposite end of a jewelry item or on an opposite side of a jewelry item, thereby ensuring against the potential loss of the jewelry item. Jewelry items often have securing devices that may be prone to releasing, for example. The device may be used to bridge across the links joined by the existing securing device, often the existing band clasp. The device provides a secondary insurance against jewelry item loss by providing a secondary clasp device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The device is available in various material makeups that may include stainless steel, gold, silver, platinum, and other appropriate materials that are aesthetically pleasing and that may be chosen to compliment a jewelry item. The device is provided in various sizes in order to be aesthetically pleasant when accompanying a given jewelry item.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The clasp disposed on the flexible cable second end may be comprised of any number of clasp designs, including a spring loaded clasp that resists opening.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus has been broadly outlined the more important features of the improved jewelry safety chain device so that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the jewelry safety chain device is to prevent jewelry item loss.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the jewelry safety chain device is to prevent loss of watches, bracelets, necklaces, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further object of the jewelry safety chain device is to be attractive.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An added object of the jewelry safety chain device is to be capable of installation to almost any multi-link band jewelry item.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">And, an object of the jewelry safety chain device is to be easily clasped and unclasped.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These together with additional objects, features and advantages of the improved jewelry safety chain device will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of presently preferred, but nonetheless illustrative, embodiments of the improved jewelry safety chain device when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref> thereof, the principles and concepts of the jewelry safety chain device generally designated by the reference number <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the device <b>10</b> partially comprises a flexible cable <b>20</b> having a first end <b>21</b> spaced apart from a second end <b>22</b>. A loop <b>23</b> is disposed on the flexible cable <b>20</b> first end <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a spring loaded clasp <b>24</b> is disposed on the flexible cable <b>20</b> second end <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of eye screws <b>30</b> is provided. Each eye screw <b>30</b> partially comprises an eyelet <b>31</b>. A shaft <b>32</b> is extended from the eyelet <b>31</b>. A point <b>33</b> is disposed distally on the shaft <b>32</b>. A thread <b>34</b> is disposed on the shaft <b>32</b> medially from the point <b>33</b>. The sharpened point <b>33</b> aids eye screw <b>30</b> insertion.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the eye screws <b>30</b> are threadably attached to a link <b>12</b> of an existing multi-link band <b>11</b>. Each link <b>12</b> has a right side <b>14</b> and a left side <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, each link <b>12</b> has one eye screw <b>30</b> disposed on the left side <b>15</b> thereof. One of the eye screws <b>30</b> is disposed on the right side <b>14</b> of each link <b>12</b> disposed on each of a first outer end <b>16</b> and a second outer end <b>17</b> of the band <b>11</b>. The flexible cable <b>20</b> and the loop <b>23</b> are configured to attach to the eyelet <b>31</b> of the eye screw <b>30</b> disposed on the left side of the link <b>12</b> disposed on the first outer end <b>16</b> of the multi-link band <b>11</b>. The flexible cable <b>20</b> is configured to pass through a remainder of the eyelets <b>31</b> of each eye screw <b>30</b> on the left side <b>15</b> and of the eye screw <b>30</b> on the right side <b>14</b> of the link <b>12</b> disposed on the second outer end <b>17</b>. The clasp <b>24</b> is configured to attach to one of the eyelets <b>31</b>. The device <b>10</b> is used to connect the links <b>12</b> of the existing multi-link band <b>11</b> across the existing band clasp <b>13</b>. The device <b>10</b> thereby removably secures a chosen pair of the links <b>12</b> together and prevents the multi-link band <b>11</b> from inadvertent disengagement, even if the existing band clasp <b>13</b> fails.</p>
