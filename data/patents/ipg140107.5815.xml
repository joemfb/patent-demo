Otherwise, in step <b>206</b>, a search result is selected. In step <b>207</b>, media content associated with the selected search result is downloaded to the MPS.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, searches may be made according to at least the following search criteria:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0042">time periods</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0043">device types</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0044">specific media</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0045">media types</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0046">specific media channels</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0047">media channel types</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">All of the various storage areas on the personal media network <b>100</b> may be searched unless such storage areas are specifically requested not to be searched or if search authorization has not been obtained. Authorization may be given a priori by a media device on the network, or authorization may be given at the time a request is made during a search.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">Various media types and formats may be available on the personal media network <b>100</b> including personal media, media content stored in a channel format, 3<sup>rd </sup>party media content, or any other digital media type and format.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0050">As an example, a user of the MPS <b>101</b> at the first home <b>102</b> may bring up a search engine user interface on a TV screen of the MPS <b>101</b> and establish search criteria comprising &#x201c;digital pictures&#x201d; and &#x201c;other MPS users&#x201d; and not &#x201c;3<sup>rd </sup>party providers&#x201d;. As a result, the user of MPS <b>101</b> may obtain search results indicating digital pictures that are stored on MPS <b>103</b>, wired media peripherals <b>110</b>, PC <b>111</b>, and wireless media peripherals <b>112</b> at the second home <b>104</b>. The second home may be the home of the user's brother, for example. The user of MPS <b>101</b> may see that, on PC <b>111</b>, the brother has digital pictures available from his most recent vacation. The user of the MPS <b>101</b> may select and download the digital pictures over the personal media network <b>100</b>. The user of MPS <b>101</b> may also see that, in main storage area <b>131</b>, the brother has digital pictures of his wife, but has not given authorization for anyone on the personal media network <b>100</b> to download them.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">As another example, the user of MPS <b>103</b> at the second home <b>104</b> may bring up a search engine user interface on a TV screen of the MPS <b>103</b> and establish search criteria comprising &#x201c;movies&#x201d; and &#x201c;3<sup>rd </sup>party media providers&#x201d; and not &#x201c;other MPS users&#x201d;. As a result, the user of the MPS <b>103</b> may obtain search results indicating movies that are available from the 3<sup>rd </sup>party media provider <b>113</b> and from the 3<sup>rd </sup>party storage vendor <b>116</b>. The user of the MPS <b>103</b> may select a movie from the 3<sup>rd </sup>party media provider <b>113</b> and download the movie to his main storage area <b>131</b>. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the user of the MPS <b>103</b> may have to first pay for the movie or may be billed. The user of MPS <b>103</b> may also see that certain movies are stored at the 3<sup>rd </sup>party storage vendor <b>116</b> but are not authorized for downloading because they are movies that are being stored as backup copies by some other 3<sup>rd </sup>party.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">As an alternative embodiment of the present invention, a PC having a MES platform with a search engine may be used to perform a search of a personal media network.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, searching may be done based on user authorization. For example, a user may choose to exclude certain 3<sup>rd </sup>party media on the media exchange network, only allowing certain types of 3<sup>rd </sup>party media to be searched.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, if a media peripheral comes into proximity of a MPS while the MPS is performing a search, the MPS may detect the presence of the media peripheral and perform a search of the media peripheral as well if the search criteria allow for such a search.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">A major challenge is to be able to transfer and share many different types of digital media, data, and services between one device/location and another with ease while being able to index, manage, and store the digital media and data.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">For example, it is desirable to be able to distribute and store many types of digital media in a PC and/or television environment in a user-friendly manner without requiring many different types of software applications and/or unique and dedicated interfaces. Any networking issues or other technical issues should be transparent to the users. It is also desirable to take advantage of existing hardware infrastructure, as much as possible, when providing such capability.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">In an embodiment of the present invention, a media exchange network is provided that enables many types of digital media, data, and/or services to be stored, indexed, viewed, searched for, pushed from one user to another, and requested by users, using a TV channel guide look-and-feel user interface. The media exchange network also allows a user to construct personal media channels that comprise his personal digital media (e.g., captured digital pictures, digital video, digital audio, etc.), request that third-party media channels be constructed from third-party digital media, and access the media channels pushed to him by other users on the media exchange network.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">PC's may be used but are not required to interface to the media exchange network for the purpose of exchanging digital media, data, and services. Instead, set-top-boxes or integrated MPS's (media processing systems) may be used with the media exchange network to perform all of the previously described media exchange functions using a remote control with a television screen.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">Current set-top-boxes may be software enhanced to create a MPS that provides full media exchange network interfacing and functionality via a TV screen with a TV guide look-and-feel. PC's may be software enhanced as well and provide the same TV guide look-and-feel. Therefore, the media exchange network supports both PC's and MPS's in a similar manner. Alternatively, a fully integrated MPS may be designed from the ground up, having full MPS capability.</p>
