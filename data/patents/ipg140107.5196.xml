<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to Doron et al., U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/310,474, entitled &#x201c;Ultrasonic Transducer for Bi-Directional Wireless Communication&#x201d;, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Implantable medical devices (IMDs) can perform a variety of diagnostic or therapeutic functions. An IMD can include one or more cardiac function management features, such as to monitor the heart or to provide electrical stimulation to a heart or to the nervous system, such as to diagnose or treat a subject, such as one or more electrical or mechanical abnormalities of the heart. Examples of IMDs can include pacemakers, automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices, implantable monitors, neuromodulation devices (e.g., deep brain stimulators, or other neural stimulators), cochlear implants, or drug pumps, among others. IMDs can include a telemetry circuit and an antenna, coupled to the telemetry circuit, such as to provide magnetic coupling between the IMD and one or more other devices to provide wireless communication (e.g., to send information, such as physiological or other information, from the implantable medical device to the external device, or to receive information, such as programming instructions, at the implantable medical device from the external device).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Magnetic coupling can be used to provide short-range (e.g., centimeters) communication between an implantable medical device implanted in a body and an external device, or between an implantable medical device outside of the body and an external device. Magnetic coupling communication largely relies on near-field coupling, where the field distribution is highly dependent upon the distance between and relative orientations of the transmitting and receiving antennas. This limits the effective range of wireless communication between the implantable medical device and the external device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Implantable medical devices (IMDs) can include one or more telemetry circuits to transfer information wirelessly between an external device and the IMD, such as after the IMD is implanted within a patient. The information can include operating commands or parameters either provided by the external device to the IMD, or from the IMD to the external device. Information from the IMD can include information obtained from one or more sensors, information about a patient's status, diagnostic information from the IMD, or the like. Various transduction schemes can be used to wirelessly transfer the information. In an example, information can be transferred acoustically such as between one or more implantable assemblies, or between an implantable assembly and an external transducer assembly, such as included in a handheld assembly. For example, the external handheld assembly can include one or more acoustic transducers, such as to interrogate or program the IMD via transcutaneous coupling of acoustic energy, such as including ultrasonic frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A piezoelectric element within the external handheld assembly can be used for wireless communication of information between an implantable device and the external handheld assembly, such as using ultrasonic energy coupled to a flexible portion of a housing of the external transducer assembly. The flexible portion can be configured to contact skin of a subject's body containing the implantable device. The transducer assembly can be configured to transmit or receive ultrasonic energy, such as by using at least partially overlapping respective transmit and receive ranges of resonant frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Example 1 includes an ultrasonic transducer assembly, such as comprising a housing including a flexible portion, the flexible portion configured to contact skin of a body containing an implantable device, a piezoelectric element within the housing configured for wireless communication of data between the implantable device and the ultrasonic transducer assembly using ultrasonic energy coupled to the flexible portion of the housing, a matching circuit included at least partially within the housing. In Example 1, the matching circuit can be configured to provide energy to the piezoelectric element using a first resonant operating frequency range, and to receive energy from the piezoelectric element using a second resonant operating frequency range when the piezoelectric element is receiving ultrasonic energy, and the first and second resonant operating frequency ranges can be at least partially overlapping.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In Example 2, the subject matter of Example 1 optionally includes a piezoelectric element configured to operate in a voltage-driven mode when the piezoelectric element is providing ultrasonic energy, and the piezoelectric element is optionally configured to provide a charge output to drive a charge amplifier when the piezoelectric element is receiving ultrasonic energy.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present inventors have recognized, among other things, that acoustic telemetry using ultrasonic energy can be useful for communicating information, such as between one or more implantable medical devices (IMDs) and an external assembly. The external assembly can be sized and shaped to be handheld, such as including an ultrasound transducer configured for bi-directional communication with the one or more IMDs. In an example, the ultrasound transducer can include a hollow portion, such as to contain one or more components included in a matching circuit, and a piezoelectric element coupled to a flexible portion of the housing and to the matching circuit. The combination of the housing, matching circuit, and piezoelectric element can be used to provide an ultrasound transducer assembly having transmit and receive characteristics that can include like frequencies of determinable efficiency at or near resonance for both transmit and receive operation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, the ultrasonic transducer can be operated in a voltage driven mode while transmitting using a first resonant frequency range, or the transducer can be coupled to a charge amplifier when receiving ultrasonic energy using a second resonant frequency range. The inventors have also recognized that at least some of the matching circuit components can be located within a hollow portion of the housing (e.g., a matching inductor nearby the piezoelectric element). Such a component location can both decrease the volume occupied by the ultrasonic transducer assembly, and can reduce mismatch between the transducer assembly and an amplifier or receiver. Locating at least some of the matching components within the housing can also reduce electrical interference susceptibility or emissions of the transducer assembly, since the housing can provide electrical shielding from other surrounding circuitry or interference sources. Also, locating at least some of the matching circuit components within the housing can reduce communication energy losses as compared to positioning the matching circuit further away from the piezoelectric element, or omitting the matching circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates generally an example of a system <b>100</b> that can include one or more implantable medical devices (IMDs), such as an implantable cardiac function management device (CFMD) <b>106</b>, an implantable sensor <b>108</b>, along with an external assembly <b>114</b> including an ultrasonic transducer (UT) <b>116</b>. In an example, the CFMD <b>106</b> can include one or more leads, such as an intravascularly-deliverable lead <b>104</b>, such as to provide one or more of a pacing therapy (e.g., bradycardia pacing, cardiac resynchronization pacing, or the like), a defibrillation countershock therapy (e.g., to terminate a tachyarrhythmia), a neural stimulation therapy, a drug delivery, or to provide remote sensing of electrical, mechanical, or chemical activity at one or more sites such as within or near a heart <b>102</b>. In an example, the CFMD <b>106</b> can communicate with the implantable sensor <b>108</b>, such as using one or more of an acoustic, a magnetic, a conductive, or an electromagnetic telemetry scheme, among others. In an example, the CFMD <b>106</b> can include an implantable ultrasonic transducer <b>112</b>, such as positioned on or within a portion of the CFMD <b>106</b> housing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an example, the implantable sensor <b>108</b> can include an implantable pressure sensor such as located within a pulmonary artery <b>110</b>, and the implantable sensor <b>108</b> can provide information about a pulmonary artery pressure to the CFMD <b>106</b>, such as for use by the CFMD in determining a patient status, adjusting one or more therapy parameters, or for subsequent transmission to the external assembly <b>114</b> by the CFMD <b>106</b>. An example of an intra-body ultrasonic telemetry system is discussed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0009818, entitled &#x201c;METHOD AND APPARATUS OF ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION FOR IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICE,&#x201d; filed on Jul. 9, 2004, assigned to Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, specifically including its discussion of modulation of acoustic energy for wireless acoustic transfer of information through a body, such as using one or more acoustic transducers coupled to a housing of an implantable medical device. Examples of an implantable PAP sensor such as the implantable sensor <b>108</b> are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/249,624, entitled &#x201c;METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PULMONARY ARTERY PRESSURE SIGNAL ISOLATION,&#x201d; filed on Oct. 13, 2005, assigned to Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, including its discussion of sensing information about pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and transmitting information indicative of PAP to one or more other devices, such as using an acoustic communication scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an example, the external assembly <b>114</b> can use its UT <b>116</b> to communicate with one or more of the implantable sensor <b>108</b> or the CFMD <b>106</b>, such as using ultrasonic energy coupled to or from the UT <b>116</b> through the body. In an example, a portion of the UT <b>116</b> can be positioned against the skin of the body containing the one or more IMDs, such as to allow transcutaneous coupling of ultrasonic acoustic energy from the transducer <b>116</b> through the skin and into the underlying tissue, or vice-versa. The external assembly <b>114</b> can include a controller circuit <b>115</b>, such as coupled to an acoustic telemetry circuit <b>118</b> that can be capable of either driving the UT <b>116</b> or receiving energy from the UT <b>116</b>. The controller circuit <b>115</b> can include one or more processors or memory circuits, such as for processing the information to be transmitted to or received from the one or more IMDs, or for interpreting or executing instructions causing the UT to transmit or receive information, among other things. For example, the controller circuit <b>115</b> can include a microprocessor or programmable logic device (PLD) such as including circuitry to provide instruction-set compatibility with one or more of an ARM&#x2122;, an ARC&#x2122;, a 68K, a PowerPC (PPC)&#x2122;, an x86, or a Z80&#x2122; processor, or compatibility with one or more other processor architectures or families. In an example, the memory circuit can include one or more of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM), a static random access memory (SRAM), or one or more non-volatile memories such as a masked read-only memory (ROM), or an erasable-programmable read-only memory (EPROM). In an example, the memory circuit can include a FLASH memory circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates generally an example of a system <b>200</b> that can include an implantable medical device <b>206</b>, a local external assembly <b>214</b>, and a remote external assembly <b>228</b>. In an example, the local external assembly <b>214</b> can be similar to the external assembly <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, such as including a hand-held ultrasonic &#x201c;reader&#x201d; configured for use by a clinician, caregiver, or by a patient, such as to query the implantable device <b>206</b>, configure the implantable device <b>206</b>, or transfer information between the implantable device <b>206</b> and the local external assembly <b>214</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the local external assembly <b>214</b> can include a controller circuit <b>215</b>, and a coupling <b>221</b> to a UT assembly <b>216</b> contained at least partially within the local external assembly <b>214</b>. In an example, the coupling <b>221</b> can include two or more conductors (e.g., leads, printed circuit board traces, or the like) such as connected to one or more components in a matching network, such as located within or near the UT <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The UT <b>216</b> can communicate with the implantable device <b>206</b> via an ultrasonic acoustic coupling <b>232</b>, such as to transmit instructions or configuration information to the implantable device <b>206</b>, or to receive information from the implantable device <b>206</b>. For example, the ultrasonic acoustic coupling <b>232</b> can include transduction of an electrical signal including communication information into a sequence of pulses or other modulated acoustic energy, coupled through tissue, and then converted from acoustic energy back into a detectable or receivable electrical signal. In an example, the local external assembly <b>214</b> can retain information to be transmitted to or received from the implant <b>206</b>, such as using a memory circuit <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an example, the memory circuit <b>220</b> can include instructions, such as to be interpreted or executed by a microprocessor <b>222</b> included in the local external assembly, such as to control one or more of a transmit amplifier <b>218</b>, a receiver <b>219</b>, or another communication circuit <b>224</b>, among other things. In an example, information stored in the memory circuit <b>220</b> can be transferred to the remote external assembly <b>228</b> using a communication link <b>226</b>, such as a wireless communication link (e.g., using magnetic, electromagnetic, or optical communication, such as using an indoor wireless network or a cellular telephone network), or using a wired communication link (e.g., a link provided by one or more network adaptors, such as connected to the internet, or a public-switched telephone network (PSTN), or the like). For example, the local external assembly <b>214</b> can be used to retrieve information about a patient from the implant <b>206</b> (e.g., information obtained by a sensor such as discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), using the acoustic coupling <b>232</b>, and the information can then be provided to the remote external assembly <b>228</b>, such as using the communication link <b>226</b> and communication circuit <b>224</b>. The remote external assembly <b>228</b> can include a nearby physician programmer, a desktop computer, a remote server or data repository, a cellular network basestation, a wireless network access point, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the UT <b>216</b> can be positioned against the skin of a patient <b>230</b>. The ultrasonic transducer assembly <b>216</b> can include a housing <b>238</b> such as having a mounting flange <b>240</b>, and a flexible portion <b>250</b> configured to contact the skin of the patient <b>230</b>. In an example, the housing <b>238</b> can be metallic, such as a single-piece housing <b>238</b> machined out of a stainless steel or aluminum billet or casting, or drawn, rolled, formed, stamped, or the like, such as fabricated from one or more of a roll, a bar, or a sheet stock. Stainless steel can be desirable since it can provide structural rigidity for the housing <b>238</b> but can still be flexible enough to couple acoustic energy between the flexible portion <b>250</b> of the housing <b>238</b> and a piezoelectric element <b>246</b> contained within the housing and attached to the flexible portion <b>250</b>. The piezoelectric element can include a stack of piezoelectric material layers (e.g. disc-shaped layers, or other footprint) sandwiched with electrode layers, such as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The piezoelectric element <b>246</b> can include a first lead <b>242</b>, and a second lead <b>243</b>, such as connected to a printed circuit board (PCB) assembly <b>248</b>. In an example, the PCB assembly can include one or more components located inside a hollow portion of the housing <b>238</b> (e.g., an inductor <b>244</b> included as a portion of a matching circuit) such as connected to first and second leads <b>242</b>-<b>243</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an example, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or <b>5</b>, the housing <b>238</b> can have a circular footprint. The combination of the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> and the housing <b>238</b>, including the flexible portion <b>250</b>, can resonate at one or more specified ranges of frequencies, such as supporting a flexural mode of deformation of the flexible portion <b>250</b>. The combination of the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> and the flexible portion <b>250</b> of the housing <b>238</b> can form a unimorph flexural transducer. In such a unimorph example, the flexible portion <b>250</b> of the housing <b>238</b> can include a circular footprint, and can vibrate using a flexural vibration mode including a deformation component orthogonal to the face of the circular footprint, such as shown in the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. For a unimorph flexural transducer, when the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> is driven, it attempts to expand or contract in a direction orthogonal to an applied electric field. Since the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> is attached to the flexible portion <b>250</b> of the housing <b>238</b>, the expansion or contraction force is constrained and instead the flexible portion <b>250</b> flexes in relation to the applied voltage. Similarly, when the flexible portion <b>250</b> is mechanically excited by acoustic energy from outside the housing <b>238</b>, such flexure can be coupled to the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> to provide an electrical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an example, the combination of the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> and the housing <b>238</b>, including the flexible portion <b>250</b>, can provide a resonant response for transmitting with peak efficiency when driven at or near a resonant frequency of between 20 kiloHertz (kHz) and 800 kHz, such as at about 40 kHz. The frequency of peak efficiency can correspond to a sensitivity at a frequency for which the UT <b>216</b> develops a higher pressure per volt of input stimulus as compared to other nearby frequencies. The UT <b>216</b> can be voltage-driven by a transmit amplifier <b>218</b> via the coupling <b>216</b>A, such as using a first resonant operating frequency range. In an example, the first resonant operating frequency range can include the frequency of peak efficiency. In an example, when the UT <b>216</b> is operated in the voltage-driven mode at or near the frequency of peak efficiency, the power factor of the load presented by the combination of the matching circuit and the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> can be at or near unity.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Similarly, the combination of the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> and the housing <b>238</b>, including the flexible portion <b>250</b>, can provide a resonant response when receiving, including a frequency of peak sensitivity at between 20 kHz and 800 kHz, such as at around 40 kHz. In an example, the UT <b>216</b> can receive ultrasonic energy using a second resonant operating frequency range including the frequency of peak sensitivity, such as using a receiver <b>219</b> configured to operate in a charge-amplification mode (e.g., to convert a charge supplied by the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> to a voltage). The first and second resonant operating frequency ranges can at least partially overlap (e.g., when the element <b>246</b> is voltage-driven when transmitting or coupled to a charge amplifier when receiving), and the UT <b>216</b> can be used for bi-directional ultrasonic communication at like frequencies of determinable efficiency whether transmitting or receiving. The matching circuit, such as including the inductor <b>244</b>, can be used to slightly broaden or spread the resonant receiving characteristic, or to enhance an efficiency of power coupling between the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> and the receiver <b>219</b>. For example, the matching circuit can modify the admittance characteristic of the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> to provide a power factor at or near unity during transmit or receive modes of operation (e.g., an imaginary part of the admittance can oscillate around zero during mechanical resonance, enhancing efficiency as compared to omitting the matching circuit). In an example, the matching circuit can dampen or attenuate a transducer resonance, such as using a matching circuit pole located at a frequency slightly offset from a transducer resonant frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an example, the external assembly can include multiple UTs <b>216</b>, or multiple piezoelectric elements <b>246</b> (e.g., four to six elements <b>246</b>) within a UT <b>216</b>, such as including one or more UTs <b>216</b> dedicated to receiving ultrasonic energy, or one or more UTs <b>216</b> dedicated to transmitting ultrasonic energy (e.g., such as including an array of UTs <b>216</b> at least partially exposed on the surface of the external assembly <b>214</b>). In examples including multiple UTs <b>216</b>, even if individual UTs are not used for bi-directional communication, the present inventors have also recognized that having a common UT <b>216</b> configuration for both transmit and receive can reduce production costs or complexity as compared to having individually customized UTs specifically for transmit operation, or for receive operation, but not both (e.g., the same or similar UT <b>216</b> configuration could be used regardless of whether its intended use is transmitting or receiving). In an example where the external assembly includes multiple UTs <b>216</b> or multiple piezoelectric elements <b>246</b>, the multiple UTs <b>216</b> or multiple elements <b>246</b> can be selectively driven to permit directional focusing or control of the shape or direction of the acoustic wavefront generated by the UTs <b>216</b> or elements <b>246</b>. Such focusing or steering can be used to overcome losses or scattering, such as due to air pockets in the communication path between one or more IMDs and the external assembly <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the housing <b>238</b> of the UT <b>216</b> can be conductively isolated from the skin of the patient <b>230</b>, such as using an insulating layer <b>234</b> on the exterior surface of the housing <b>238</b>, at least in the region near a face of the flexible portion <b>250</b> of the housing <b>238</b>. In an example, the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> can include a piezoelectric layer electrically connected to the housing <b>238</b> on an interior face at or near the flexible portion <b>250</b> of the housing <b>238</b>. The housing <b>238</b> can act as an electrode configured to couple voltage to the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> during transmission, or to provide a path for charge transfer from the piezoelectric element <b>246</b> when receiving acoustic energy. The insulating layer <b>234</b> can provide electrical isolation between the housing <b>238</b> and the patient <b>230</b>, such as to prevent exposing the patient <b>230</b> to the voltages used to drive the piezoelectric element <b>246</b>, such as when the housing is used as an electrode. In addition, or instead of electrical isolation, the insulating layer <b>234</b> can be used to reduce an acoustic impedance mismatch between the flexible portion <b>250</b> of the housing <b>238</b> and the skin of the patient <b>230</b>. The reduction in the acoustic impedance mismatch can allow the flexible portion <b>250</b> to more efficiently couple ultrasonic energy into the patient <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, the skin of the patient <b>230</b> and surrounding tissue can present a first acoustic impedance (e.g., related to a velocity of propagation of an acoustic wave within the body <b>230</b> medium). The flexible portion <b>250</b> of the housing <b>238</b> (e.g., a membrane), can present a second, different, acoustic impedance. In an example, the insulating layer <b>234</b> can be used to reduce an impedance mismatch between the first and second acoustic impedance, such as using an insulating layer having an intermediate acoustic impedance between the first and second acoustic impedances, such as a determined by a geometric mean or other function of the first and second acoustic impedances. In an example, the insulating layer can have a thickness of about a quarter-wavelength of the acoustic wavelength of the ultrasonic energy propagating through the insulating material, such as to reduce the acoustic impedance mismatch.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an example, the insulating layer can include a polyurethane material, a polyimide or polyamide material, an epoxy material, a polyester-epoxy combination, or one or more other materials. In an example, the insulating layer <b>234</b> can include a conversion coating or one or more other electrochemically-applied coatings such as an oxide-forming hard-coat (e.g., for an aluminum housing <b>238</b>). In an example, the insulating layer <b>234</b> can include a baked-on coating, such as epoxy coating, or an epoxy-polyester powder coating. In another example, the insulating layer <b>234</b> can be overmolded or painted onto at least a portion of the housing <b>238</b>, such as on or near the exterior face of the flexible portion <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The local external assembly <b>214</b> can itself include a housing, separate from the housing <b>238</b> of the UT <b>216</b>. In an example, the UT <b>216</b> can include an isolating mechanical coupling <b>236</b> between the housing <b>238</b> of the UT <b>216</b> and the housing of the local external assembly <b>214</b>. For example, the isolating mechanical coupling <b>236</b> can help prevent or reduce unwanted buzzing or vibration of the local external assembly <b>214</b> during transmission by the UT <b>216</b>. In an example, the isolating mechanical coupling <b>236</b> includes an elastomeric (e.g., rubber, silicone, etc.) sleeve, grommet, or gasket, such as located circumferentially around the housing <b>238</b> at or near where the housing <b>238</b> might contact the housing of the local external assembly <b>214</b>. Similarly, one or more elastomeric washers can be used to mount the flange <b>240</b> of the housing <b>238</b> internally within the local external assembly <b>214</b>, such as to reduce or prevent unwanted coupling of vibration internally.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates generally an example of a cut-away view of an ultrasonic transducer (UT) assembly <b>316</b>, similar to the UT <b>216</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The UT <b>316</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a housing <b>338</b>, including a mounting flange <b>340</b> and a flexible portion <b>350</b> (e.g., a flexible metallic membrane), coupled to a piezoelectric stack <b>346</b>, the stack <b>346</b> attached to a printed circuit board (PCB) assembly <b>348</b> including a component mounting area <b>348</b>A and a conductive portion <b>348</b>B, and the attachment including using a first and a second lead tab <b>342</b>-<b>343</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first, second, or a third component <b>347</b>A-C (or other components) can be located on the component mounting area <b>348</b>A, and one or more large components such as an inductor <b>344</b> can be mounted on an opposite side of the PCB assembly <b>348</b>, such as to take advantage of otherwise unused volume within the housing <b>338</b>. In an example, the PCB assembly <b>348</b> can include at least some components used to provide a matching circuit as discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, such as including the inductor <b>344</b>. For example, the inductor <b>344</b> is generally rated to withstand a voltage well in excess of the voltage applied during transmission of ultrasonic energy by the UT <b>316</b>, such as a rating meeting or exceeding 200 Volts. Generally, the volume needed for the inductor <b>344</b> will increase as its maximum rated voltage increases, for a specified inductance. The inductor <b>344</b> can be located within a hollow portion of the housing <b>338</b>. Locating the inductor within the housing <b>338</b> can provide transmission at a higher peak pressure than a transducer having a lesser-rated inductor, while also reducing the overall volume of the UT <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one or more cap screws such as a first cap screw <b>354</b>A or a second cap screw <b>354</b>B can be used to secure the PCB <b>348</b> to the housing <b>338</b>, or to secure the UT <b>316</b> to another assembly (e.g., a housing of a local external assembly <b>214</b> such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an insulating layer <b>352</b> can be included between the piezoelectric stack <b>346</b> and the flexible portion <b>350</b> of the housing <b>338</b>, such as to electrically isolate the piezoelectric stack <b>346</b> from the flexible portion <b>350</b> of the housing <b>338</b>. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an insulating layer can be included on an exterior portion of the housing <b>338</b>, such as on or near an exterior face of the flexible portion <b>350</b>. However, the exterior face of the flexible portion <b>350</b> need not be insulated when the interior insulating layer <b>352</b> is used, since the interior insulating layer <b>352</b> can adequately prevent the housing <b>338</b> from becoming energized with a voltage applied when the UT <b>316</b> is transmitting. The interior insulating layer <b>352</b> can include an alumina disc or other material of slightly larger diameter than the rest of the piezoelectric stack <b>346</b>, such as attached to the piezoelectric stack <b>346</b> prior to the installation within the housing <b>338</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an example, the combination of the piezoelectric stack <b>346</b> and interior insulating layer <b>352</b> can be pre-fabricated, such as using similar adhesives or other materials or processing as the rest of the stack <b>346</b>. In an example, one or more leads can be soldered or attached to one or more electrodes included in the stack <b>346</b>, such as to connect the stack <b>346</b> to one or more matching components located on the PCB <b>348</b> (e.g., including the inductor <b>344</b> or one or more of the first, second, or third components <b>347</b>A-C, etc.). The first and second lead tabs <b>342</b>-<b>343</b> can be used to simplify assembly as compared to using insulated lead wires, since the lead tabs <b>342</b>-<b>343</b> can be relatively rigid, and can penetrate the PCB <b>348</b> through one or more plated or non-plated holes. Such penetration can allow soldering or other electrical or mechanical bonding operations to be performed on or near the top-side component area <b>348</b>A of the PCB <b>348</b> during assembly. In an example, one or more of the first tab <b>342</b> or the second tab <b>343</b> can be stamped, formed, or cut at the same time as one or more electrode layers included as a portion of the piezoelectric stack <b>346</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates generally an example of a portion of a piezoelectric transducer assembly <b>400</b> (such as the UT <b>216</b> or UT <b>316</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>), including a piezoelectric stack <b>446</b> and a matching circuit <b>462</b>. The stack <b>446</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be used with the ultrasonic transducer housing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-3</figref>, or <b>5</b>A-C, such as for bi-directional wireless information transfer as a unimorph flexural transducer. In a unimorph example, the piezoelectric stack <b>446</b> can use an extensional/contractional mode of operation that excites or detects flexural motion by an attached flexible non-piezoelectric substrate (e.g., the flexible portions <b>250</b> or <b>350</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the stack can include multiple layers of a piezoelectric material, such as a piezoelectric crystal, a piezoceramic, a piezocomposite, or a piezopolymer material. Examples of piezopolymer material include poled polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a fluoropolymer film, among others. Examples of a piezoelectric crystal material include lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT), among others. Examples of piezocomposite materials include epoxy-loaded or other polymer-loaded piezoceramic materials, among others. Examples of a piezoceramic material include lead zirconate titanate (PZT), among others.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a first piezo layer <b>458</b>A can be attached to a first electrode layer <b>456</b>A, connected to a first lead <b>442</b>. In an example, the opposite side of the first piezo layer <b>458</b>A can be attached to a second electrode layer <b>456</b>B, connected to a second lead <b>443</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a second piezo layer <b>458</b>B, such as having an opposite polarization (e.g., indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) can also be connected to the second electrode layer <b>456</b>B. Similarly, a third piezo layer <b>458</b>C, a third electrode layer <b>456</b>C, and a fourth electrode layer <b>456</b>D can be attached and connected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a parallel connection example, but in another example, a series configuration can be used, and the polarization of each piezo layer <b>458</b>A-C need not be opposed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each of the first through third piezo layers <b>458</b>A-C can include a disc of piezoceramic lead zirconate titanate (PZT) material, such as PIC-255 provided by PI Ceramic (Germany). For example, each piezoceramic disc can be approximately 10 mm in diameter, and approximately 0.25 mm in height. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, one or more of the first through fourth electrode layers <b>456</b>A-D can include a copper electrode, or other conductive material, bonded to the adjacent piezo layers using a conductive adhesive, such as a conductive structural adhesive (e.g., epoxy, or one or more other adhesives). For example, one or more of the electrode layers <b>456</b>A-D can include one or more holes, such as a hole <b>460</b>, to allow a single adhesive application to bond both faces of a respective electrode layer (e.g., the second electrode layer <b>456</b>B) to respective adjacent piezo layers (e.g., the first and second piezo layers <b>458</b>A-B), forming a relatively durable unitized assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In an example, similar to the stack <b>346</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an insulating layer <b>452</b> can be attached to the fourth electrode layer <b>456</b>D. For example, the insulating layer <b>452</b> can include alumina, and can be approximately 12 mm in diameter, and approximately 0.25 mm in height, such as to electrically isolate the stack <b>446</b> from an adjacent conductive housing. Alumina can be desirable because of its rigidity and electrical isolation properties (e.g., a relatively high dielectric breakdown voltage as compared to some other non-ceramic materials). For example, the rigidity and thinness of the alumina when used as the insulating layer <b>452</b> can allow relatively efficient mechanical coupling of acoustic energy between the stack <b>446</b> and housing at ultrasonic frequencies, such as a resonant frequency of the whole UT assembly including the piezoelectric stack <b>446</b>, the housing, and the insulating layer <b>452</b>, while still providing desirable high-voltage isolation. In an example, as discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the insulating layer <b>452</b> can be assembled with the rest of the stack <b>446</b> prior to installation within the housing, such as using an adhesive similar to the adhesive used for bonding together one or more other layers of the stack <b>446</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an example, one or more of the second or third piezo layers <b>458</b>B-C can be omitted. However, use of more piezo layers in a parallel configuration and assembled having opposing polarizations as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can provide a greater pressure per volt of input stimulus as compared to a piezoelectric stack <b>446</b> including fewer layers. In an example, the insulating layer <b>452</b> can be omitted, along with the fourth electrode layer <b>456</b>D. Instead, the stack <b>446</b> can be attached to a conductive portion of the housing (e.g., the flexible portion <b>250</b>, <b>350</b>, or <b>550</b> of the housing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-3</figref>, or <b>5</b>), and the conductive portion can be used as an electrode. Use of the housing as an electrode can simplify the assembly of the stack <b>446</b>, but at the cost of adding an insulating layer elsewhere, such as to isolate the user of the transducer assembly from voltages used to excite the stack <b>446</b> when transmitting ultrasonic energy.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a matching circuit <b>462</b> can be connected to the first and second leads <b>442</b> and <b>443</b> as discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, such as to modify an admittance characteristic of the piezoelectric stack <b>446</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a first resistor <b>447</b>A can be connected to an inductor <b>444</b>, shunted by a capacitor <b>449</b> in series with a second resistor <b>447</b>B. In an example, the stack <b>446</b> can be modeled as a series-resonant circuit when the stack <b>446</b> is receiving ultrasonic energy and providing a time-varying charge output to a charge amplifier circuit through the matching circuit <b>462</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-C</figref> include illustrative examples of an ultrasonic transducer housing <b>500</b> (e.g., the housing <b>238</b> or <b>338</b> discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>) including an upper portion <b>538</b>A and a lower portion <b>538</b>B, a finite element model of a portion of the housing <b>500</b> including a piezoelectric element <b>546</b> illustrating deformation of a flexible portion <b>550</b> of the housing <b>500</b>, and an illustrative example of a receiving sensitivity plot <b>566</b> corresponding to the housing <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">While other dimensions can be used, in the illustrative examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-C</figref>, the housing <b>500</b> can include a stainless steel housing (e.g., including surgical-grade stainless steel such as austenitic grade 316 stainless steel or another grade or type of stainless steel) having an overall exterior height of approximately 12.2 mm. The upper flange thickness can be about 1.5 mm thick, and an overall height of the upper portion <b>538</b>A can be around 7.1 mm thick, when measured from the exterior. The overall exterior diameter of the flange <b>540</b> can be about 30 mm. The overall outer diameter of the upper portion <b>538</b>A can be about 24 mm, and the overall outer diameter of the lower portion <b>538</b>B can be about 16.5 mm, such as including a tapered or radiused portion leading down to an exterior bottom face of the flexible portion <b>550</b>. The inner diameter of the upper portion <b>538</b>A can be about 18.2 mm, and the inner diameter of the lower portion <b>538</b>B can be about 13.2 mm. The thickness of the flexible portion <b>550</b> not including the piezoelectric element <b>546</b> can be about 1.2 mm. The thickness of the flexible portion <b>550</b> and the piezoelectric element <b>546</b> can vary, depending on the number of layers used in the piezoelectric element, and whether or not one or more insulating layers are used either internally or externally to the housing <b>500</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>). In an example, the combined thickness of the flexible portion <b>550</b> and the element <b>546</b> can be less than or equal to 2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the illustrative examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-C</figref>, an ultrasound transducer can use the combination of the housing <b>500</b> and piezoelectric element <b>546</b> to provide a unimorph flexural transducer as discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>. For example, extension or contraction of the element <b>546</b> can be converted into flexure of the flexible portion <b>550</b>, or vice versa, (e.g., the flexible portion <b>550</b> can be a mechanical membrane to couple acoustic energy to or from the element <b>546</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Such conversion of extension or contraction to flexural motion can occur since the element <b>546</b> (e.g., the stack <b>246</b>, <b>346</b>, or <b>446</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>) is fixed to the flexible portion <b>550</b> and located asymmetrically to a neutral plane of the flexible portion <b>550</b> of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an illustrative example of an ultrasonic transducer such as using the matching circuit as discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> and housing geometry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-C</figref>, the transmit sensitivity of the ultrasound transducer can meet or exceed about 250 kiloPascals per Volt at a distance of 0.2 meters using water as a propagation medium, when operated in a voltage-driven mode, corresponding to a transmitting voltage response (TVR) meeting or exceeding 156 Decibels per Volt at a distance of 1 meter using water as a propagation medium, (relative to 1 microPascal per Volt at a distance of 1 meter).</p>

For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows a free-field receive sensitivity <b>566</b> as a function of frequency <b>564</b> (plotted in kHz), and represented in decibels (<b>562</b>), relative to 1 microPascal per Volt.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Finite element modeling (FEM) can be used to model a portion of the housing <b>500</b>, such as to explore variations in one or more housing <b>500</b> parameters (e.g. diameter, thickness, material selection, etc.), such as to reduce or eliminate unwanted spurious responses (e.g., unwanted resonances, or the like) in the transmitting or receiving characteristics, such as to obtain one or more of the deformation model of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> or the receiving characteristic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> (e.g., to achieve a specified determinable peak efficiency at or near a specified frequency).</p>
