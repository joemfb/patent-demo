<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2010-221279 filed on Sep. 30, 2010, and 2010-221285 filed on Sep. 30, 2010, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an image recording apparatus including a main frame having a pair of side plates facing each other and a base plate whose opposite end portions are supported by the respective side plates, and in particular, to a mechanism for mounting a sensor for sensing a recording medium being conveyed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is conventionally known an image recording apparatus capable of recording images on both faces (sides) of a recording sheet. According to this image recording apparatus, in the case of one-side recording, an image is recorded on one face of the recording sheet, and then the recording sheet is discharged. On the other hand, in the case of two-side recording, after a recording sheet on one side of which an image has been recorded is conveyed again to a recording portion through a return conveying path that extends from a downstream side of the recording portion to an upstream side thereof, an image is recorded on the other side of the recording sheet, and then the recording sheet is discharged. Each of the above-described conveying path and the above-described return conveying path is defined by a guide member. The guide member is disposed so as to be interposed between a pair of side plates spaced from each other in a widthwise direction of the apparatus, and opposite end portions of the guide member are supported by the respective side plates, whereby the guide member is secured to the side plates. It is noted that there is known a frame as a connecting mechanism including a pair of side plates facing each other and a connecting member bridged laterally therebetween for connecting the side plates to each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Where the image recording is performed on the recording sheet conveyed to the recording portion through the conveying path, there is a need to sense a position of the recording sheet being conveyed with great accuracy in order to convey the recording sheet to an image-recording starting position before the image recording. In order to satisfy this need, there can be considered an image recording apparatus including: a guide member supported by a pair of side plates; a rotator projected from a central portion of the guide member in a widthwise direction of the apparatus so as to intersect a conveying path; and a sensor for sensing a movement of the rotator via an interlocking shaft when the rotator is pressed by the recording sheet conveyed in one direction. In order to reduce the number of components, a sensor mount is provided on one end of the guide member integrally with the guide member.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, where the sensor mount is formed integrally with one end of the guide member, a length of the guide member becomes longer than a width of the conveying path. Thus, in the above-mentioned supporting mechanism whose opposite ends are respectively supported by a pair of side plates, a guide member is sometimes deformed by receiving too much force from a recording sheet being conveyed. In particular, in the case of a compact image recording apparatus including a two-side recording mechanism and usually placed on a desk, a conveying path and a return conveying path need to be provided at the same position in plan view in a height-limited space. As a result, the guide member needs to have less height and thickness. In this case, the guide member is more likely to be deformed. If the guide member is deformed, the sensor mount is displaced, making it impossible for the sensor to sense a movement of the rotator with great accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This invention has been developed in view of the above-described situations, and it is an object of the present invention to provide an image recording apparatus including a sensor that can sense a recording medium with great accuracy while preventing a positional displacement of a sensor mount.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object indicated above may be achieved according to the present invention which provides an image recording apparatus comprising: a main frame including (a) a pair of side plates facing each other in one direction and (b) a base plate whose opposite end portions in the one direction are respectively supported by the pair of side plates; a guide member provided at an inside area interposed between a pair of side plates in the one direction, so as to define a conveying path through which a recording medium is conveyed; and a sensor device supported by one of the pair of side plates and configured to sense the recording medium conveyed through the conveying path.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the optical sensor <b>68</b> is a photo interrupter of a transmission type having a light emitting element and a light receiving element disposed so as to face each other. When the light receiving element has received light emitted from the light emitting element, the optical sensor <b>68</b> outputs an electric signal (a sensor signal) in accordance with an amount (an intensity) of the received light. The light emitting element and the light receiving element are disposed on a distal end of the optical sensor <b>68</b>, functioning as a sensing portion <b>68</b>A of the optical sensor <b>68</b>. In a light path through which the light emitted from the light emitting element travels to the light receiving element, the sensing portion <b>68</b>A can detect the recording sheet <b>19</b> or the disc tray <b>48</b>. The optical sensor <b>68</b> is secured to a sensor holder <b>92</b> (as one example of the support member). The optical sensor <b>68</b> and the sensor holder <b>92</b> are one example of a sensor device.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The sensor holder <b>92</b> is mounted on an outer face <b>98</b> of the left first frame <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).

One example of a method of mounting the sensor holder <b>92</b> on the first frame <b>25</b> is as follows: a plurality of projections <b>93</b> are provided on a mount face <b>92</b>A of the sensor holder <b>92</b> which is mountable on an outer face <b>98</b> of the left first frame <b>25</b>, a plurality of mount holes <b>94</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) are formed in the first frame <b>25</b>, and the projections <b>93</b> of the sensor holder <b>92</b> are respectively fitted into the mount holes <b>94</b> of the first frame <b>25</b>, thereby securing the sensor holder <b>92</b> to the outer face <b>98</b> of the first frame <b>25</b>. Further, the sensor holder <b>92</b> is also mounted on a left end portion <b>66</b>A of the rail <b>66</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), i.e., on a portion of a lower face of the rail <b>66</b> which is located on a left side of the left first frame <b>25</b>.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The optical sensor <b>68</b> is mounted on the sensor holder <b>92</b> such that the light path of the sensing portion <b>68</b>A is located within a range of a pivotal movement of the detector <b>54</b>. In the present embodiment, when neither of the recording sheet <b>19</b> nor the disc tray is in the conveying path <b>31</b>, a distal end portion <b>54</b>A of the detector <b>54</b> enters into the light path of the sensing portion <b>68</b>A to intercept the light path (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In this case, a sensor signal of a LOW level is outputted from the optical sensor <b>68</b>. When the sensor signal of the LOW level has been outputted, the controller <b>100</b> of the MFP <b>10</b> judges that the distal end portion <b>54</b>A has entered in the light path of the sensing portion <b>68</b>A and that the recording medium has not reached the rotator <b>67</b>.

On a right end portion of the rotation shaft <b>57</b>, there is mounted the rotation restraining mechanism <b>80</b> for restraining or inhibiting the pivotal movement of the rotator <b>67</b> caused by the urging force F<b>1</b>. The rotation restraining mechanism <b>80</b> includes: a joint <b>83</b> connected to the right end portion of the rotation shaft <b>57</b>; a restraining member <b>81</b> fixed to the joint <b>83</b>; and a torsion coil spring <b>82</b> (hereinafter may be called &#x201c;spring <b>62</b>&#x201d;) mounted on the restraining member <b>81</b>.

The spring <b>82</b> applies to the restraining member <b>81</b> an urging force F<b>2</b> that is greater than the urging force generated by the spring <b>58</b>. This urging force F<b>2</b> causes the restraining member <b>81</b> to be pivoted in a direction in which the spring <b>58</b> urges the restraining member <b>81</b>. That is, the urging force F<b>2</b> is applied in a direction opposite to a direction in which the urging force F<b>1</b> is applied. The stopper <b>85</b> is, for example, engaged with the inner guide member <b>32</b>A<b>2</b>, thereby restraining a pivotal movement of the restraining member <b>81</b> such that the rotator <b>67</b> maintains its posture (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) in which the rotator <b>67</b> is projected upward from the slit <b>59</b>.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the switch-back-roller pair <b>37</b> disposed on a front side of the platen <b>22</b> is constituted by an upper pinch roller <b>37</b>A and the lower switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B. The upper pinch roller <b>37</b>A is, for example, supported by the first frames <b>25</b> so as to be rotated about a central axis of the pinch roller <b>37</b>A. It is noted that the illustration of the pinch roller <b>37</b>A is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The lower switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B are supported by the linkage plates <b>50</b> which will be described below so as to be rotated about a central axis of the lower switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B by the above-described drive portion. Further, the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B are supported by the linkage plates <b>50</b> which will be described below so as to be movable in the upward and downward direction <b>7</b> between (i) a contact posture thereof in which the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B are held in contact with the upper pinch roller <b>37</b>A and (ii) a distant posture thereof in which the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B are located on a lower side of the rollers <b>37</b>B taking the contact posture. A distance of the movement of the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B is set such that a distance between the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B and the pinch roller <b>37</b>A which are spaced from each other is greater than the thickness of the disc tray <b>48</b> (3 mm, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The support shaft <b>37</b>C of the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B is inserted through the elongate holes <b>25</b>B of the respective first frames <b>25</b>, and one end of each of a pair of right and left torsion coil springs <b>63</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is held in contact with a corresponding one of opposite end portions of the support shaft <b>37</b>C. Each of the torsion coil springs <b>63</b> is supported at a central portion and the other end thereof by a corresponding one of the first frames <b>25</b> so as to urge the support shaft <b>37</b>C upward by the above-described one end. The support shaft <b>37</b>C is urged upward by the torsion coil springs <b>63</b>, whereby the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B are kept pressed and held in contact with the pinch roller <b>37</b>A. When receiving the drive power of the conveyance motor <b>113</b> in this state, the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B are rotated, and the pinch roller <b>37</b>A is also rotated accordingly. In the case of one-side recording, the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B convey the recording sheet <b>19</b> frontward to discharge the recording sheet <b>19</b> onto the sheet-discharge portion <b>14</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) provided on the sheet-supply cassette <b>14</b>. In the case of two-side recording, the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B convey rearward the recording sheet <b>19</b> that has been temporarily conveyed frontward, to convey the recording sheet <b>19</b> into the return conveying path <b>34</b>. The recording sheet <b>19</b> having entered into the return conveying path <b>34</b> is conveyed from the first conveying path <b>32</b> to the second conveying path <b>33</b> while being turned upside down.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As described above, the second spring holders <b>61</b> are respectively mounted on the base portions <b>51</b> of the respective linkage plates <b>50</b>, and thus the second spring holders <b>61</b> are slid in the frontward and rearward direction <b>8</b> integrally with the base portions <b>51</b>. On a rear part of the holder portion <b>61</b>A of each second spring holders <b>61</b>, there is formed an inclined face <b>61</b>D which is inclined downward toward a rear side thereof.

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">There will be next explained a configuration of the controller <b>100</b> with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the controller <b>100</b> mainly includes a CPU <b>101</b>, a ROM <b>102</b>, and a RAM <b>103</b>. The CPU <b>101</b>, the ROM <b>102</b>, and the RAM <b>103</b> are connected to one another via a bus line. The controller <b>100</b> is connected to the operation panel <b>16</b>, the carriage motor <b>111</b>, the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b>, the conveyance motor <b>113</b>, an encoder <b>116</b>, the optical sensor <b>68</b>, and the optical sensor <b>118</b> via an input and output port <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The CPU <b>101</b> is configured to control various functions of the MFP <b>10</b> in accordance with data values and programs stored in the ROM <b>102</b> and the RAM <b>103</b> and control various members connected to the input and output port <b>105</b>. The ROM <b>102</b> is an unrewritable memory storing therein control programs and so on to be executed by the MFP <b>10</b>. The RAM <b>103</b> is a rewritable volatile memory and temporarily stores various data when the MFP <b>10</b> performs various operations.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">There will be next explained, with reference to a flow-chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, (a) a processing executed by the CPU <b>101</b> for sensing the conveyed positions of the disc tray <b>48</b> and the recording sheet <b>19</b> and so on in the image recording and (b) operations of the members of the MFP <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Initially in S<b>12</b>, the CPU <b>101</b> judges whether the recording mode is the label recording mode or not. When the tray guide <b>45</b> has been pulled out frontward by the user and is ready for the label recording, the detector, not shown, is retracted from a sensing portion of the optical sensor <b>118</b>, whereby a level of an output signal of the optical sensor <b>118</b> is changed from a LOW level to a HIGH level. The CPU <b>101</b> judges that the tray guide <b>45</b> has been pulled out on the basis of this change and then changes the recording mode to the label recording mode.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">When the tray guide <b>45</b> has been pulled out frontward by the user, and the linkage plates <b>50</b> are changed from the initial posture to the expanded posture, the platen <b>22</b>, the discharging rollers <b>36</b>B, and the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B are lowered, causing the second conveying path <b>33</b> to be expanded in the upward and downward direction <b>7</b>. It is noted that the expanded posture of the linkage plates <b>50</b> is a posture for the image recording on the disc medium such as a CD and a DVD.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Then in S<b>14</b>, the CPU <b>101</b> changes the roller holder <b>74</b> to the distant posture to move the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B away from the conveying roller <b>35</b>A. Then, where a label recording command has been inputted from the operation panel <b>16</b> or the PC (S<b>16</b>: YES), the CPU <b>101</b> in S<b>17</b> executes a processing for conveying the disc tray <b>48</b> rearward. After the second conveying path <b>33</b> has been expanded in the upward and downward direction <b>7</b>, the user inserts the disc tray <b>48</b> into the second conveying path <b>33</b> from the opening <b>17</b> in a state in which the disc tray <b>48</b> is supported by the tray guide <b>45</b>. The user inputs the label recording command after the disc tray <b>48</b> has been inserted to a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 10A</figref>. Where the label recording command has been inputted by the user, the CPU <b>101</b> controls the conveyance motor <b>113</b> to rotate the conveying roller <b>35</b>A and the discharging rollers <b>36</b>B reversely. As a result, the disc tray <b>48</b> is conveyed rearward.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, when the disc tray <b>48</b> has been conveyed rearward, a rear end portion of the disc tray <b>48</b> pushes down rearward the rotator <b>67</b> being inclined frontward. Thus, the detector <b>54</b> retracted frontward from the sensing portion <b>68</b>A enters into the sensing portion <b>68</b>A and then exits rearward. In this movement, a level of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> is changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level and immediately thereafter changed to the HIGH level again. Where the label recording command has been inputted and where the signal level of the optical sensor has been changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level, the CPU <b>101</b> in S<b>18</b> senses that the rear end portion of the disc tray <b>48</b> has passed through the rotator <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Where the rear end portion of the disc tray <b>48</b> has been sensed in S<b>18</b>, the CPU <b>101</b> in S<b>19</b> conveys the disc tray <b>48</b> to a position at which the image recording can be performed on the label face of the disc medium and then performs the image recording on the label face of the disc medium while forwardly rotating the conveying roller <b>35</b>A to intermittently convey the disc tray <b>48</b> frontward.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the image recording, the CPU <b>101</b> in S<b>20</b> senses the rear end of the disc tray <b>48</b> again on the basis of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b>. When the disc tray <b>48</b> has been conveyed frontward, the rear end portion of the disc tray <b>48</b> passes through the rotator <b>67</b>, and the rotator <b>67</b> returns to the above-described posture (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) thereof in which the rotator <b>67</b> is inclined frontward. In this operation, the detector <b>54</b> retracted rearward from the sensing portion <b>68</b>A enters into the sensing portion <b>68</b>A and then exits frontward. In this movement, the level of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> is changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level and immediately thereafter changed to the HIGH level again. When the signal level of the optical sensor has been changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level again in the image recording, the CPU <b>101</b> senses that the rear end portion of the disc tray <b>48</b> has passed through the rotator <b>67</b> again. In S<b>21</b>, when the image recording processing has been finished, the conveying roller <b>35</b>A and so on are continuously rotated to discharge the disc tray <b>48</b> frontward. Then in S<b>23</b>, the CPU <b>101</b> changes the roller holder <b>74</b> to the contact posture to bring the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B into contact with the conveying roller <b>35</b>A, and the CPU <b>101</b> finishes this processing.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">On the other hand, where the CPU <b>101</b> has judged in S<b>12</b> that the recording mode is not the label recording mode, the CPU <b>101</b> goes to S<b>30</b>. Where the CPU <b>101</b> has judged that an image recording command has been inputted together with the image data from the PC, for example (S<b>30</b>: YES), the recording mode is changed to the normal recording mode, and the recording sheet <b>19</b> is supplied from the sheet-supply cassette <b>14</b> in S<b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Then in S<b>34</b>, on the basis of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b>, the CPU <b>101</b> senses a position of a leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> in the second conveying path <b>33</b>. When the leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has pushed down the rotator <b>67</b> during the conveyance of the recording sheet <b>19</b>, the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> is changed from the LOW level to the HIGH level. On the basis of this change of the signal level, the CPU <b>101</b> senses that the leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has passed through the rotator <b>67</b>. Where the CPU <b>101</b> has sensed the leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> (S<b>34</b>: YES), the CPU <b>101</b> in S<b>35</b> starts the image recording on the recording sheet <b>19</b> after the recording sheet <b>19</b> has been conveyed to the position for the image recording. It is noted that when the leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has reached a position at which the convey-roller pair <b>35</b> can nip and convey the recording sheet <b>19</b>, the sheet-supply roller <b>41</b> stops supplying the recording sheet <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">When the image recording has been finished, the recording sheet <b>10</b> is discharged in S<b>40</b>, and thereafter the CPU <b>101</b> executes S<b>23</b> and finished this processing.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">&#x3c;Effects of First Embodiment&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As described above, the sensor holder <b>92</b> and the inner guide member <b>32</b>A<b>2</b> are independently of each other, in other words, the sensor holder <b>92</b> is constructed as another member from the inner guide member <b>32</b>A<b>2</b>. Thus, it is possible to employ a layout in which the inner guide member <b>32</b>A<b>2</b> is disposed between the first frames <b>25</b> of the main frame <b>65</b>, and the sensor holder <b>92</b> is attached or fastened to the outer face <b>98</b> of the first frame <b>25</b>. Further, thanks to this layout, even if the inner guide member <b>32</b>A<b>2</b> is deformed or bent by a force applied during the conveyance of the recording medium, the deformation has no effect on the sensor holder <b>92</b>. Thus, a positional displacement of the sensor holder <b>92</b> is not caused, whereby an accuracy of the sense of the sensor <b>68</b> supported by the sensor holder <b>92</b> is not lowered. Further, it is possible to secure the sensor holder <b>92</b> to the first frame <b>25</b> and the rail <b>66</b>, whereby a strength of securing the sensor holder <b>92</b> is improved. Further, since the sensor holder <b>92</b> is disposed outside the first frame <b>25</b>, a length of the inner guide member <b>32</b>A<b>2</b> can be made generally equal to a length of the conveying path <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">It is noted that, in the present first embodiment, the optical sensor <b>68</b> is used as one example of the sensor, but instead of the optical sensor <b>68</b>, there may be employed another type of sensor such as a reflective sensor, a magnetic sensor, and a contact sensor. Further, in the above-described embodiment, the MFP <b>10</b> has the return conveying path <b>34</b>, but the present invention may be applied to a construction not having the return conveying path <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">There will be next explained an MFP <b>210</b> as a second embodiment of the present invention. It is noted that the same reference numerals as used in the first embodiment are used to designate the corresponding elements of this second embodiment, and an explanation of which is dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">There is conventionally known an image recording apparatus which is provided with a cover for opening or exposing a conveying path in order to remove a recording sheet jammed in the conveying path. In this type of image recording apparatus, when the recording sheet is conveyed with the cover being opened, the recording sheet may come flying out to the outside of the apparatus or may be jammed in the conveying path. Thus, the image recording apparatus is equipped with a sensor for sensing an open or closed state of the cover, i.e., for sensing whether the cover is opened or closed.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">However, if a plurality of sensors are provided for all objects to be sensed in order to sense all of the objects (e.g., a conveyed position of the recording sheet, the open or closed state of the cover, and so on), an increase in the number of components leads to a higher component cost and a higher assembling cost required for a sensor mounting work and a wiring work. Such a construction needs to find spaces in the apparatus for mounting the sensors and for routing lead wires, which complicates a layout of wirings and inner mechanisms. In particular, in a compact image recording apparatus usually placed on a desk, a casing of the apparatus has to be made larger in order to secure spaces for mounting the sensors and for routing wirings, which hinders a downsize of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">This second embodiment has been developed in view of the above-described situations, and it is an object of the second embodiment to provide an image recording apparatus achieving the effects of the above-described first embodiment and being capable of sensing a conveyed position of a recording medium and an open or closed state of a cover with a single sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the MFP <b>210</b> as the second embodiment is provided with a cover <b>224</b> for opening and closing a rear portion of a printing section <b>215</b>. A sensing mechanism <b>252</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) of a conveying device <b>230</b> of the second embodiment can sense an open or closed state of the cover <b>224</b> and so on in addition to the conveyed positions of the recording sheet <b>19</b> and the disc tray <b>48</b>. Further, the conveying device <b>230</b> includes a cam driving mechanism <b>88</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) which is driven by the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b>. In the present second embodiment, the MFP <b>210</b> includes a switching gear <b>114</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) driven by the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b>. By switching the drive-power transmitting paths of the switching gear <b>114</b>, the drive power of the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b> is transmitted to one of the sheet-supply roller <b>41</b> and the cam driving mechanism <b>88</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). Further, as will be described later, a controller <b>200</b> of the second embodiment senses the presence or absence of the recording medium, the conveyed position in the conveying path, a posture (a movement position) of a roller holder <b>274</b> which will be described below, and the open or closed state of the cover <b>224</b> which will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">&#x3c;Cover <b>224</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The cover <b>224</b> is provided on the rear portion of the printing section <b>215</b>. A support shaft <b>224</b>A is inserted through a lower end of the cover <b>224</b>. The support shaft <b>224</b>A is rotatably supported by a frame, not shown. The cover <b>224</b> is pivoted about the support shaft <b>224</b>A between (i) a first posture indicated by solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> for covering the rear portion (face) of the printing section <b>215</b> and (ii) a second posture indicated by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> in which the cover <b>224</b> is located on a rear side of the rear portion of the printing section <b>215</b> for exposing the inside of the printing section <b>215</b>. The outer guide member <b>32</b>B is provided on an inner face of the cover <b>224</b>. The outer guide member <b>32</b>B is constructed integrally with the cover <b>224</b>. Accordingly, when the cover <b>224</b> is pivoted, the outer guide member <b>32</b>B is also pivoted in the same direction as a pivotal direction of the cover <b>224</b>. In the present embodiment, when the cover <b>224</b> is in the first posture, the outer guide member <b>32</b>B is disposed so as to face an inner guide member <b>32</b>A, whereby the first conveying path <b>32</b> is defined by the outer guide member <b>32</b>B and the inner guide member <b>32</b>A. On the other hand, when the cover <b>224</b> is changed from the first posture to the second posture, the outer guide member <b>32</b>B is moved away from the inner guide member <b>32</b>A to open the first conveying path <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">A pressing portion <b>229</b> is provided on an upper end portion of the inner face of the cover <b>224</b>. The pressing portion <b>229</b> is provided at a central portion of the cover <b>224</b> in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b> so as not to interfere with the recording sheet conveyed through the first conveying path <b>32</b>. The pressing portion <b>229</b> presses up a second arm <b>294</b>C of a sensor arm <b>294</b> which will be described below in a process in which the cover <b>224</b> is pivoted from the second posture to the first posture.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">&#x3c;Roller Holder <b>274</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the roller holder <b>274</b> (as one example of a driven-roller support member) is provided slightly on a rear side of the convey-roller pair <b>35</b>. The roller holder <b>274</b> is independent of the platen <b>22</b>, in other words, the roller holder <b>274</b> is constructed as another member from the platen <b>22</b>. The roller holder <b>274</b> has four blocks connected to one another in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b>, so that the roller holder <b>74</b> has an elongated shape in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b> in its entirety. Each of the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B is rotatably supported by a front upper end portion of a corresponding one of the blocks. In the present embodiment, the roller holder <b>274</b> supports the eight pressing rollers <b>35</b>B arranged in a row in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b>. A plurality of support shafts <b>76</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) are provided on a rear upper end portion of the roller holder <b>274</b>. These support shafts <b>76</b> are supported by the respective bearings <b>26</b>B provided on the sub-frame <b>26</b> which will be described below. This construction allows the roller holder <b>274</b> to be pivoted about the support shafts <b>76</b>. More specifically, the roller holder <b>274</b> is pivotable about the support shafts <b>76</b> between (i) a sixth posture in which the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B are held in contact with the upper conveying roller <b>35</b>A and (ii) a seventh posture in which the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B is distant from the conveying roller <b>35</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the sub-frame <b>26</b> formed of the metal plate is provided under the roller holder <b>274</b>. The sub-frame <b>26</b> is secured at its opposite ends to the first frames <b>25</b>. The coil springs <b>78</b> are provided between the roller holder <b>274</b> and the sub-frame <b>26</b>. It is noted that the illustration of the conveying roller <b>35</b>A is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The coil springs <b>78</b> are provided near the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B such that the direction in which the coil springs <b>78</b> are extended or contracted coincides with the upward and downward direction <b>7</b>. Specifically, upper ends of the coil springs <b>78</b> are respectively accommodated in spring holders <b>78</b>A provided on a back face (a lower face) of an upper wall of the roller holder <b>274</b>, and lower ends of the coil springs <b>78</b> are mounted on the sub-frame <b>26</b>. The coil springs <b>78</b> are provided between the roller holder <b>274</b> and the sub-frame <b>26</b> in a state in which the coil springs <b>78</b> are contracted in advance to apply a preset urging force to the conveying roller <b>35</b>A. As a result, an upward urging force generated by extension movement of the coil springs is applied to the roller holder <b>274</b>, causing the roller holder <b>274</b> to maintain the above-described sixth posture. The upward urging force of the coil springs <b>78</b> is applied to the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B via the roller holder <b>274</b>, whereby the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B are held in pressing contact with the conveying roller <b>35</b>A by the above-described urging force. It is noted that, when a front end portion of the roller holder <b>274</b> is lowered against the above-described urging force by the cam driving mechanism <b>88</b> which will be described below, the roller holder <b>274</b> is changed from the sixth posture to the seventh posture, so that the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B are moved downward away from the conveying roller <b>35</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, on a central part of a rear end portion of the roller holder <b>274</b>, there is provided a stopper <b>74</b>A projected slantly rearward and downward from the rear end portion. The stopper <b>74</b>A is provided on a rear side of a rotational axis of the roller holder <b>274</b>. The stopper <b>74</b>A is engaged with the restraining member <b>81</b> which will be described below to restrain the pivotal movement of the restraining member <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">&#x3c;Sensing Mechanism <b>252</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The sensing mechanism <b>252</b> (as one example of a detecting portion) is configured to sense (a) the recording sheet <b>19</b> conveyed in the above-described normal recording mode, (b) the disc tray <b>48</b> in the above-described label recording mode, (c) the posture of the roller holder <b>274</b>, and (d) the open or closed state of the cover <b>224</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, this sensing mechanism <b>252</b> is provided on a rear side of the convey-roller pair <b>35</b> (i.e., on an upstream side of the convey-roller pair <b>35</b> in the direction in which the recording sheet <b>19</b> is conveyed in the image recording) and on a front side of the cover <b>224</b>. The sensing mechanism <b>252</b> includes: a casing <b>69</b> supporting the roller holder <b>274</b> pivotably and accommodating components of the sensing mechanism <b>252</b>; the optical sensor <b>68</b> provided on an outer (left) side of a left end portion of the casing <b>69</b>; the sensor arm <b>294</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, as one example of a first linkage mechanism) interlocked with opening and closing operations of the cover <b>224</b>; and a coil spring <b>298</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). The casing <b>69</b> is elongated in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b>, and a plurality of the claws, not shown, provided on a front end of the casing <b>69</b> are engaged with the sub-frame <b>26</b>, thereby securing the casing <b>69</b> to the sub-frame <b>26</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, in the casing <b>69</b> is rotatably supported the rotation shaft <b>57</b> extending from the central portion of the sub-frame <b>26</b> in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b> to an outside of the left end portion. To the rotation shaft <b>57</b> is fixed the rotator <b>67</b> having the arm shape (as one example of the first detector). A slit is formed in a central portion of the casing <b>69</b> in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b>. The rotator <b>67</b> is projected upward from the rotation shaft <b>57</b> through the slit and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, exposed outward from the inside of the casing <b>69</b>. The detector <b>54</b> (as one example of the second detector) is provided on the left end of the rotation shaft <b>57</b>. The detector <b>54</b> is projected in the same direction as the rotator <b>67</b>. The rotator <b>67</b> and the detector <b>54</b> are fixed to the rotation shaft <b>57</b>. Accordingly, when the force has been applied to the rotator <b>67</b> in its rotational direction, the detector <b>54</b> is rotated with the rotator <b>67</b> in the direction in which the rotator <b>67</b> is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">&#x3c;Rotation Restraining Mechanism <b>80</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the torsion coil spring <b>58</b> is mounted on the rotator <b>67</b>. The spring <b>58</b> applies to the rotator <b>67</b> the urging force F<b>1</b> for pivoting the rotator <b>67</b> rearward from the posture thereof shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. On the right end portion of the rotation shaft <b>57</b>, there is mounted the rotation restraining mechanism <b>80</b> (one example of a second linkage mechanism) for restraining or inhibiting the pivotal movement of the rotator <b>67</b> caused by the urging force F<b>1</b>. The rotation restraining mechanism <b>80</b> includes: the joint <b>83</b> connected to the right end portion of the rotation shaft <b>57</b>; the restraining member <b>81</b> fixed to the joint <b>83</b>; and the torsion coil spring <b>82</b> mounted on the restraining member <b>81</b>. The joint <b>83</b> is connected to the right end portion of the rotation shaft <b>57</b> so as to be rotatable about the axis of the rotation shaft <b>57</b>. This joint <b>83</b> is configured to allow the rotator <b>67</b> to be pivoted frontward from its posture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and to restrain or inhibit the rotator <b>67</b> from being pivoted rearward.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The restraining member <b>81</b> has a projection <b>84</b> projected in a direction perpendicular to the rotation shaft <b>57</b>. The projection <b>84</b> is projected rearward from the restraining member <b>81</b>. The spring <b>82</b> applies to the restraining member <b>81</b> the urging force F<b>2</b> that is greater than the urging force generated by the spring <b>58</b>. Specifically, the spring <b>82</b> applies to the restraining member <b>81</b> the urging force F<b>2</b> (&#x3e;F<b>1</b>) for pivoting the projection <b>84</b> upward from the posture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. That is, the urging force F<b>2</b> is applied in the direction opposite to the direction in which the urging force F<b>1</b> is applied. The urging force F<b>2</b> is considerably less than the urging force of each coil spring <b>78</b>. The above-described stopper <b>74</b>A provided on the rear end of the roller holder <b>274</b> is held in contact with an upper face of the projection <b>84</b>. These constructions enable the forces applied to the members to be balanced with one another, thereby maintaining the rotator <b>67</b> in the posture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17A</figref>, i.e., a fifth posture in which the rotator <b>67</b> is projected upward from the rotation shaft <b>57</b> so as to intersect the second conveying path <b>33</b>. On the other hand, when the can driving mechanism <b>88</b> which will be described below has changed or moved the front end portion of the roller holder <b>274</b> from the sixth posture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> to the seventh posture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the stopper <b>74</b>A located on a rear side of the support shafts <b>76</b> about which the roller holder <b>274</b> is rotated is moved upward. As a result, the restraining member <b>81</b> receives the urging force F<b>2</b> and is pivoted in a direction in which the urging force F<b>2</b> urges the restraining member <b>81</b>. Interlocking with this pivotal movement, the rotator <b>67</b> is inclined frontward by receiving the pivotal force from the joint <b>83</b>, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the detector <b>54</b> is retracted from the sensing portion of the sensor <b>68</b>. It is noted that an amount of this pivotal movement of the rotator <b>67</b> is so small that the rotator <b>67</b> is kept intersecting the second conveying path <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">&#x3c;Optical Sensor <b>68</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The optical sensor <b>68</b> is the photo interrupter of the transmission type having the light emitting element and the light receiving element disposed so as to face each other. When the light receiving element has received light emitted from the light emitting element, the optical sensor <b>68</b> outputs an electric signal (a sensor signal) in accordance with an amount (an intensity) of the received light. The light path extending from the light emitting element to the light receiving element functions as the sensing portion <b>68</b>A of the optical sensor <b>68</b>. The optical sensor <b>68</b> is mounted on the first frames <b>25</b> such that the sensing portion <b>68</b>A is located within the range of the pivotal movement of the detector <b>54</b>. In the present embodiment, when the roller holder <b>274</b> is in the sixth posture, and the recording sheet <b>19</b> is not present in the second conveying path <b>33</b>, the distal end portion <b>54</b>A of the detector <b>54</b> (as one example of a sensed portion) enters into the sensing portion <b>68</b>A to intercept the light path (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17A</figref>). In this case, the sensor signal of the LOW level is outputted from the optical sensor <b>68</b>. When the sensor signal of the LOW level has been outputted, the controller <b>200</b> judges that the distal end portion <b>54</b>A has entered in the sensing portion <b>68</b>A. It is noted that the posture of the detector <b>54</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17A</figref>) in which the distal end portion <b>54</b>A has entered in the sensing portion <b>68</b>A corresponds to a third posture. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, when the disc tray <b>48</b> is guided through the conveying path <b>31</b> to push down the rotator <b>67</b> rearward, the detector <b>54</b> is pivoted rearward, so that the distal end portion <b>54</b>A thereof is retracted from the light path of the sensing portion <b>68</b>A. Further, as shown in FIGS. <b>18</b>A<b>1</b>-<b>18</b>B<b>4</b>, also when the recording sheet <b>19</b> is guided through the conveying path <b>31</b> to push down the rotator <b>67</b> frontward, the detector <b>54</b> is pivoted rearward, so that the distal end portion <b>54</b>A thereof is retracted from the light path of the sensing portion <b>68</b>A. In this movement, the signal level of the optical sensor <b>68</b> is changed from the LOW level to the HIGH level. When the sensor signal has been changed from the LOW level to the HIGH level, the controller <b>200</b> judges that the distal end portion <b>54</b>A has been retracted from the light path of the sensing portion <b>68</b>A. It is noted that the posture of the detector <b>54</b> in which the distal end portion <b>54</b>A has been retracted from the sensing portion <b>68</b>A is a fourth posture.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the optical sensor <b>68</b> of the second embodiment is disposed on a left side of the left first frame <b>25</b> in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b>. That is, the optical sensor <b>68</b> is not disposed at an inside area interposed between the pair of the first frame <b>25</b>, but disposed at an outside area located outside the pair of the first frames <b>25</b> in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b>. Like the optical sensor <b>68</b> of the first embodiment, the optical sensor <b>68</b> of the second embodiment is secured to the left first frame <b>25</b> from a left side thereof. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the optical sensor <b>68</b> of the second embodiment is fixed to the sensor holder <b>92</b> that is fixed to an outer face of the first frame <b>25</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the sensor holder <b>92</b> for holding the optical sensor <b>68</b> of the second embodiment on the first frame <b>25</b> includes the mount face <b>92</b>A and the projections <b>93</b> that are provided on the mount face <b>92</b> to be mounted on the outer face <b>98</b> of the first frame <b>25</b>, and the projections <b>93</b> are fitted into the respective mount holes <b>94</b> of the first frame <b>25</b>, thereby securing the sensor holder <b>92</b> to the outer face <b>98</b> of the first frame <b>25</b>. Further, the sensor holder <b>92</b> is also fixed to an end portion of the rail <b>66</b> in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, that is, the sensor holder <b>92</b> is also fixed to the lower face of the rail <b>66</b> at a position outside the area interposed between the first frames <b>25</b> in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b>. Specifically, the engaging pieces <b>95</b> provided on the upper portion of the sensor holder <b>92</b> are engaged with the mount holes <b>96</b> formed in the end portion of the rail <b>66</b>, whereby the sensor holder <b>92</b> is fixed to the rail <b>66</b>. As a result, the optical sensor <b>68</b> fixed to the sensor holder <b>92</b> is reliably fixed to the outer face of the first frame <b>25</b> and the end portion of the rail.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">&#x3c;Sensor Arm <b>294</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the sensor arm <b>294</b> has an arm shape elongated in the frontward and rearward direction <b>8</b>. This sensor arm <b>294</b> is provided on an upstream side of the convey-roller pair <b>35</b> and on an upper side of the rotator <b>67</b>. The sensor arm <b>294</b> includes: a support shaft <b>294</b>A extending in the rightward and leftward direction <b>9</b>; a first arm <b>294</b>B extending rearward from the support shaft <b>294</b>A; and the second arm <b>294</b>C extending rearward from the first arm <b>294</b>B. The support shaft <b>294</b>A is supported by a frame, not shown, allowing the sensor arm <b>294</b> to be pivoted about the support shaft <b>294</b>A. This sensor arm <b>294</b> is pivotable between (i) an upper posture (indicated by solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) in which the sensor arm <b>294</b> is located on an upper side of the rotator <b>67</b> so as not to contact the rotator <b>67</b> and (ii) a lower posture (indicated by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) in which the sensor arm <b>294</b> can be brought into contact with the rotator <b>67</b> to pivot the rotator <b>67</b> frontward from the fifth posture to the fifth posture.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The coil spring <b>298</b> is provided on an upper side of the first arm <b>294</b>B. The coil spring <b>298</b> is secured at one end thereof to a frame, for example, and is secured at the other end thereof to an upper face of the first arm <b>294</b>B. When the sensor arm <b>294</b> is in the upper posture, the coil spring <b>298</b> urges the first arm <b>294</b>B downward at a predetermined elastic force. The elastic force of the coil spring <b>298</b> is a force enough to pivot the rotator <b>67</b> frontward.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the present embodiment, in a process in which the cover <b>224</b> is pivoted from the second posture to the first posture, the pressing portion <b>229</b> is brought into contact with the second arm <b>294</b>C to apply a force for pressing the second arm <b>294</b>C upward. As a result, the second arm <b>294</b>C is lifted against an urging force of the coil spring <b>298</b>. That is, the sensor arm <b>294</b> is pivoted about the support shaft <b>294</b>A in a counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to take the upper posture. Accordingly, as long as the cover <b>224</b> is in the first posture, the sensor arm <b>294</b> is kept in the upper posture and does not act on the rotator <b>67</b>. On the other hand, when the cover <b>224</b> has been pivoted from the first posture to the second posture, the pressing portion <b>229</b> is moved away from the second arm <b>294</b>C. As a result, by receiving the urging force of the coil spring <b>298</b>, the sensor arm <b>294</b> is pivoted about the support shaft <b>294</b>A in a clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to take the lower posture. When the sensor arm <b>294</b> has been pivoted to the lower posture, the first arm <b>294</b>B is brought into contact with the rotator <b>67</b> to pivot the rotator <b>67</b> frontward from its fifth posture. In this movement, the signal level of the optical sensor <b>68</b> is changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level. That is, when the cover <b>224</b> is in the first posture, the optical sensor <b>68</b> outputs the signal of the HIGH level.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">&#x3c;Cam Driving Mechanism <b>88</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">By receiving the drive power from the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b>, the cam driving mechanism <b>88</b> moves or changes the roller holder <b>274</b> between the above-described sixth posture and seventh posture.

Each of the shaft guides <b>75</b> stands upright from an upper face of the sub-frame <b>26</b>. Each shaft guide <b>75</b> supports the cam shaft <b>90</b> rotatably and supports the cam shaft <b>90</b> movably in the upward and downward direction <b>7</b>, and each shaft guide <b>75</b> includes a vertically long guide groove <b>75</b>A and a cam receiving portion <b>75</b>B projected leftward from an upper end of a corresponding one of the shaft guides <b>75</b> to a position over a corresponding one of the cams <b>91</b>. The cam shaft <b>90</b> is inserted at its opposite end portions through the guide grooves <b>75</b>A of the respective shaft guides <b>75</b> of the sub-frame <b>26</b> in a state in which the cam shaft <b>90</b> is inserted through rings of the respective bearings <b>89</b>. As a result, the cam shaft <b>90</b> is supported movably along the guide groove <b>75</b>A in the upward and downward direction <b>7</b>. The cams <b>91</b> are fixed to the cam shaft <b>90</b>. Each cam <b>91</b> is fixed to the cam shaft <b>90</b> so as to be located on a lower side of the cam receiving portion <b>75</b>B of the corresponding shaft guide <b>75</b>. The linkage member <b>292</b> is a member for receiving the drive power from the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b> and is fixed to a right end portion of the cam shaft <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">When the linkage member <b>292</b> is in a posture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the cams <b>91</b> are in a free state from the cam shaft <b>90</b>, i.e., a state in which no drive power is transmitted from the cam shaft <b>90</b> to the cams <b>91</b>. In this state, the cam shaft <b>90</b> is supported by lower portions of the bearings <b>89</b>. The roller holder <b>274</b> is kept in its sixth posture in which the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B are held in pressing contact with the conveying roller <b>35</b>A by the upward urging force of the springs <b>78</b>. On the other hand, when the drive power of the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b> has been inputted to the linkage member <b>292</b>, and the cam shaft <b>90</b> has been pivoted, the cams <b>91</b> are also pivoted. When the pivotal movement of the cams <b>91</b> has caused its outer edge portions to be brought into contact with the respective cam receiving portions <b>75</b>B, the cam shaft <b>90</b> is pressed downward, which lowers the cam shaft <b>90</b>. When the cam shaft <b>90</b> has been lowered, the cam shaft <b>90</b> pulls the front end portion of the roller holder <b>274</b> downward together with the bearings <b>89</b> against the urging force of the springs <b>78</b>, thereby changing the roller holder <b>274</b> to the seventh posture. As a result, the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B are moved away from the conveying roller <b>35</b>A. In the present embodiment, a distance of the movement of the roller holder <b>274</b> is set so as to become generally equal to the thickness of the disc tray <b>48</b> (3 mm, for example). It is noted that a posture changing mechanism of the present invention is constituted by the cam driving mechanism <b>88</b> and the springs <b>78</b>, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The interrupt processing explained below is a processing for sensing, on the basis of the output signals from the single sensor <b>68</b>, (a) the open or closed state of the cover <b>224</b>, (b) the posture of the roller holder <b>274</b>, (c) the conveyed positions of the recording sheet <b>19</b> and the disc tray <b>48</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Where the MFP <b>210</b> is in a standby state in which the MFP <b>210</b> can receive the image recording command, the roller holder <b>274</b> is in the sixth posture, and the cover <b>224</b> is in the first posture (i.e., the closed posture). Where the MFP <b>210</b> is in the standby state, the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>211</b> executes a processing (a cover-posture sensing processing) for sensing the open or closed state of the cover <b>224</b> on the basis of the signal sent from the sensor <b>68</b>. Specifically, where the signal sent from the sensor <b>68</b> is the LOW level, the CPU <b>201</b> judges that the cover <b>224</b> is in the first posture (the closed posture), and where the signal sent from the sensor <b>68</b> is the HIGH level, the CPU <b>201</b> judges that the cover <b>224</b> is in the second posture (the open posture). Where the CPU <b>201</b> has judged that the cover <b>224</b> is in the second posture, the CPU <b>201</b> outputs error information indicating that the cover <b>224</b> is open, to the LCD <b>16</b>A and/or an external device such as the PC. It is noted that, during executing the cover-posture sensing processing in S<b>211</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> does not execute the processing for sensing the posture of the roller holder <b>274</b>, or the processing for sensing the conveyed positions of the disc tray <b>48</b> or the recording sheet <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Then in S<b>212</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> judges whether the recording mode is the label recording mode or not. When the tray guide <b>45</b> has been pulled out frontward by the user and is ready for the label recording, the detector, not shown, is retracted from the sensing portion of the optical sensor <b>118</b>, whereby the level of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>118</b> is changed from the LOW level to the HIGH level. The CPU <b>201</b> judges that the tray guide <b>45</b> has been pulled out on the basis of this change and then changes the recording mode to the label recording mode.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">When the tray guide <b>45</b> has been pulled out frontward by the user, and the linkage plates <b>50</b> are changed from the initial posture to the expanded posture, the platen <b>22</b>, the discharging rollers <b>36</b>B, and the switch-back rollers <b>37</b>B are lowered, causing the second conveying path <b>33</b> to be expanded in the upward and downward direction <b>7</b>. It is noted that the expanded posture of the linkage plates <b>50</b> is the posture for the image recording on the disc medium such as a CD and a DVD.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In S<b>211</b>, where the CPU <b>201</b> has judged that the recording mode is the label recording mode, the CPU <b>201</b> issues an interrupt command in S<b>213</b>. This interrupt command is for interrupting the cover-posture sensing processing to execute another sensing processing using the signal sent from the sensor <b>68</b>. That is, after the interrupt command has been outputted, the open or closed state of the cover <b>224</b> is not sensed. After the interrupt command has been outputted, the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>214</b> executes a processing for moving the roller holder <b>274</b> to the seventh posture in order to move the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B away from the conveying roller <b>35</b>A. Specifically, the path through which the drive power is transmitted from the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b> is changed from a path to the sheet-supply roller <b>41</b>, to a path to the cam driving mechanism <b>88</b>, and then the CPU <b>201</b> drives the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b> by a predetermined rotational amount. As a result, the drive power of the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b> is transmitted to the roller holder <b>274</b> via the cam driving mechanism <b>88</b>, whereby the roller holder <b>274</b> is moved from the sixth posture to the seventh posture. As a result, the conveying roller <b>35</b>A is moved away from the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B. It is noted that one specific example of switching the transmitting path is using a movable member such as the carriage <b>23</b> to change a position of a switching lever provided on the switching gear <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Then in S<b>215</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> judges on the basis of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> whether the roller holder <b>274</b> is in the seventh posture or not. When the roller holder <b>274</b> has moved to the seventh posture, the rotator <b>67</b> is inclined frontward as described above, whereby the detector <b>54</b> is retracted frontward from the sensing portion <b>68</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>). In this movement, the level of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> is changed from the LOW level to the HIGH level. Where the recording mode is in the label recording mode and where the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> has changed from the LOW level to the HIGH level, the CPU <b>201</b> judges that the roller holder <b>274</b> is in the seventh posture.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">It is noted that, where the CPU <b>201</b> has judged in S<b>215</b> that the roller holder <b>274</b> is not in the seventh posture, the CPU <b>201</b> repeats the processings of S<b>214</b> and S<b>215</b>. Where although these processings have been repeated a predetermined number of times, the CPU <b>201</b> has judged that the roller holder <b>274</b> is not in the seventh posture nevertheless, the CPU <b>201</b> displays, on the LCD <b>16</b>A or the PC, an error message indicating a malfunction of the roller holder <b>274</b>, and then suspends this label recording processing.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Where the CPU <b>201</b> has judged that the roller holder <b>274</b> is in the seventh posture (S<b>215</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> judges in S<b>216</b> whether or not the label recording command has been inputted from the operation panel <b>16</b>, the PC, or the like. Where the CPU <b>201</b> has judged that the label recording command has been inputted (S<b>216</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>217</b> executes the processing for conveying the disc tray <b>48</b> rearward. After the second conveying path <b>33</b> has been expanded in the upward and downward direction <b>7</b>, the user inserts the disc tray <b>48</b> into the second conveying path <b>33</b> from the opening <b>17</b> in the state in which the disc tray <b>48</b> is supported by the tray guide <b>45</b>. The user inputs the label recording command after the disc tray <b>48</b> has been inserted to a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17B and 10A</figref>. Where the label recording command has been inputted by the user, the CPU <b>201</b> controls the conveyance motor <b>113</b> to rotate the conveying roller <b>35</b>A and the discharging rollers <b>36</b>B reversely. As a result, the disc tray <b>48</b> is conveyed rearward.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17C and 10B</figref>, when the disc tray <b>48</b> has been conveyed rearward, the rear end portion of the disc tray <b>48</b> pushes down rearward the rotator <b>67</b> being inclined frontward. Thus, the detector <b>54</b> retracted frontward from the sensing portion <b>68</b>A enters into the sensing portion <b>68</b>A and then exits rearward. In this movement, the level of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> is changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level and immediately thereafter changed to the HIGH level again. Where the label recording command has been inputted and where the signal level of the optical sensor has been changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level, the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>218</b> senses that the rear end portion of the disc fray <b>48</b> has passed through the rotator <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Where the CPU <b>201</b> has sensed the rear end portion of the disc tray <b>48</b> (S<b>218</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>219</b> conveys the disc tray <b>48</b> to a position at which an image is recorded on the label face of the disc medium and then performs the image recording on the label face of the disc medium while intermittently conveying the disc tray <b>48</b> frontward by rotating the conveying roller <b>35</b>A forwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In the image recording, the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>220</b> senses the rear end of the disc tray <b>48</b> again on the basis of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b>. When the disc tray <b>48</b> has been conveyed frontward, the rear end portion of the disc tray <b>48</b> passes through the rotator <b>67</b>, and the rotator <b>67</b> returns to the above-described posture (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>) thereof in which the rotator <b>67</b> is inclined frontward. In this operation, the detector <b>54</b> retracted rearward from the sensing portion <b>68</b>A enters into the sensing portion <b>68</b>A and then exits frontward. In this movement, the level of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> is changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level and immediately thereafter changed to the HIGH level again. When the signal level of the optical sensor has been changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level again during the image recording, the CPU <b>201</b> senses that the rear end portion of the disc tray <b>48</b> has passed through the rotator <b>67</b> again. In S<b>221</b>, when the image recording processing has been finished, the conveying roller <b>35</b>A and so on are continuously rotated to discharge the disc tray <b>48</b> frontward.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Where the label recording command has been inputted again (S<b>222</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> repeats the processings of S<b>217</b> through S<b>221</b>. On the other hand, where the label recording command has not been inputted, and the tray guide <b>45</b> has been pressed rearward by the user, the level of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>118</b> is changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level. On the basis of this change, the CPU <b>201</b> judges that the label recording mode is finished, and then changes the recording mode to the normal recording mode. At this time, the CPU <b>201</b> drives the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b> by a predetermined amount to bring the pressing rollers <b>35</b>B into pressing contact with the conveying roller <b>35</b>A, and then in S<b>223</b> returns the roller holder <b>274</b> from the seventh posture to the sixth posture.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Then in S<b>224</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> judges on the basis of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> whether the roller holder <b>274</b> is in the sixth posture or not. When the roller holder <b>274</b> has returned to the sixth posture, the rotator <b>67</b> inclined frontward moves rearward, whereby the detector <b>54</b> enters into the sensing portion <b>68</b>A. In this movement, the level of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> is changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level. On the basis of this change, the CPU <b>201</b> judges that the roller holder <b>274</b> has returned to the sixth posture. Then in S<b>225</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> issues an interruption canceling command. When the interruption canceling command has been issued, the suspended cover-posture sensing processing is restarted, enabling the sensing of the open or closed state of the cover <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">On the other hand, where the output signal of the optical sensor <b>118</b> remains at the HIGH level in S<b>211</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> maintains the standby state. In the standby state, the linkage plates <b>50</b> are kept in the initial posture. Where the CPU <b>201</b> has judged that the image recording command has been inputted together with the image data from the PC, for example (S<b>230</b>: YES), the recording mode is changed to the normal recording mode, and the recording sheet <b>19</b> is supplied from the sheet-supply cassette <b>14</b> in S<b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Then in S<b>232</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> judges whether an amount of the conveyance of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has reached a predetermined conveyance amount or not. Here, the predetermined conveyance amount is an amount or distance of the conveyance of the recording sheet until the leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> reaches a position just before the rotator <b>67</b>. The CPU <b>201</b> calculates an actual conveyance amount on the basis of encoder signals from the sheet-supply roller <b>41</b> and the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b> and compares the obtained actual conveyance amount with the above-described predetermined conveyance amount to perform the judgment in S<b>232</b>. Here, where the CPU <b>201</b> has judged that the conveyance amount of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has reached the predetermined conveyance amount, that is, where the CPU <b>201</b> has judged that the leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has reached the position just before the rotator <b>67</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> issues the above-described interrupt command in S<b>233</b>. That is, the cover-posture sensing processing of S<b>211</b> is continued without suspension until the interrupt command is issued in S<b>233</b>, and after the interrupt command has been issued in S<b>233</b>, the cover-posture sensing processing is suspended.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">After the interrupt command has been issued, the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>234</b> senses the position of the leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> in the second conveying path <b>33</b> on the basis of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b>. As shown in FIG. <b>18</b>A<b>2</b> or <b>18</b>B<b>2</b>, when the leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has pushed down the rotator <b>67</b> during the conveyance of the recording sheet <b>19</b>, the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> is changed from the LOW level to the HIGH level. On the basis of this change of the signal level, the CPU <b>201</b> senses that the leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has passed through the rotator <b>67</b>. Where the CPU <b>201</b> has sensed the leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> (S<b>234</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>235</b> starts the image recording on the recording sheet <b>19</b> after the recording sheet <b>19</b> has been conveyed to the position for the image recording. It is noted that when the leading end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has reached the position at which the convey-roller pair <b>35</b> can nip and convey the recording sheet <b>19</b>, the sheet-supply roller <b>41</b> stops supplying the recording sheet <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Where the recording sheet <b>19</b> is a thick paper sheet such as a glossy paper sheet and a postcard, for example, the CPU <b>201</b> goes to S<b>236</b>. On the other hand, where the recording sheet <b>19</b> is a thin paper sheet such as what is called a plain paper sheet, the CPU <b>201</b> goes to S<b>240</b> after the image recording has been completed. In S<b>240</b>, the recording sheet <b>19</b> is discharged, and the CPU <b>201</b> goes to S<b>223</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">There will be hereinafter explained processings in the case where the recording sheet <b>19</b> is the thick paper sheet. Where the image recording is performed on the thick paper sheet having a thickness equal to or greater than a certain thickness, the following phenomenon occurs when a trailing end of the recording sheet has passed through the nipping position of the convey-roller pair <b>35</b>. That is, the thick recording sheet tends to be conveyed by an excessive amount, resulting in appearance of a widthwise white line on a recorded surface of the sheet. Such a white line may deteriorate an image quality. In order to solve this problem, where the image recording is performed on the thick paper sheet, when the trailing end of the sheet has reached the nipping position, the rollers of the convey-roller pair <b>35</b> needs to be moved away from each other to prevent the above-described excessive conveyance. Thus, the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>236</b> senses a position of the trailing end of the recording sheet <b>19</b>. When the trailing end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has passed through the rotator <b>67</b> during the conveyance of the recording sheet <b>19</b>, the rotator <b>67</b> returns to its original position, and accordingly the detector <b>54</b> is pivoted to enter into the sensing portion <b>68</b>A of the optical sensor <b>68</b> again (see FIG. <b>18</b>B<b>3</b>). In this operations, the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> is changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level. On the basis of this change, the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>236</b> senses that the trailing end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has passed through the rotator <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">When the trailing end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has been sensed, the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>237</b> judges whether the trailing end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has reached the nipping position of the convey-roller pair <b>35</b> or not. Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> calculates a conveyance amount of the recording sheet <b>19</b> after the trailing end has been sensed on the basis of the signal from the conveying roller <b>35</b>A or the encoder <b>116</b> mounted on the conveyance motor <b>113</b>, and compares the obtained value with a distance from the rotator <b>67</b> to the nipping position. Where the obtained value is the same as the distance to the nipping position, the CPU <b>201</b> judges that the trailing end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has reached the nipping position of the convey-roller pair <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Where the CPU <b>201</b> has judged that the trailing end of the recording sheet <b>19</b> has reached the nipping position of the convey-roller pair <b>35</b> (S<b>237</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> in S<b>238</b> performs a processing for moving the roller holder <b>274</b> to the seventh posture as in S<b>214</b>. Then in S<b>239</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> judges whether the roller holder <b>274</b> is in the seventh posture or not on the basis of the output signal of the optical sensor <b>68</b> as in S<b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">It is noted that, where the CPU <b>201</b> has judged in S<b>239</b> that the roller holder <b>274</b> is not in the seventh posture, the CPU <b>201</b> repeats the processings of S<b>238</b> and S<b>239</b> again. Where although these processings have been repeated a predetermined number of times, the CPU <b>201</b> has judged that the roller holder <b>274</b> is not in the seventh posture nevertheless, the CPU <b>201</b> displays, on the LCD <b>16</b>A or the PC, the error message indicating the malfunction of the roller holder <b>274</b> and then suspends or continues the image recording processing. After the image recording has been completed, the recording sheet <b>19</b> is discharged in S<b>240</b>, and the CPU <b>201</b> goes to S<b>223</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In view of the above, the CPU <b>201</b> can be considered to include a first detecting section configured to detect the posture of the cover <b>224</b> on the basis of the output from the optical sensor <b>68</b> where a conveyance distance in which the recording sheet <b>19</b> has been conveyed from the sheet-supply cassette <b>14</b> is less than a length of a path extending from the sheet-supply cassette <b>14</b> to the rotator <b>67</b>, and this first detecting section can be considered to perform the processing in S<b>211</b>.

<p id="p-0171" num="0170">By executing the interrupt processing as described above, it is possible to sense the open or closed state of the cover <b>224</b>, the posture of the roller holder <b>274</b>, the conveyed positions of the recording sheet <b>19</b> and the disc tray <b>48</b> in the conveying path <b>31</b> on the basis of the change of the level of the output signal from the single sensor <b>68</b>. This eliminates a need to provide optical sensors for a plurality of objects to be sensed, leading to a reduction in the number of the sensors to be provided.

<p id="p-0172" num="0171">It is noted that, in the present second embodiment, the optical sensor <b>68</b> is used as one example of the sensor, but instead of the optical sensor <b>68</b>, there may be employed another type of sensor such as a reflective sensor, a magnetic sensor, and a contact sensor. In the above-described embodiment, the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b> is commonly used as the drive source of the roller holder <b>274</b>, but an independent drive source such as a solenoid and a motor may be used without commonly using the sheet-supply motor <b>112</b>. In this case, the roller holder <b>274</b> is moved without switching the drive-power transmitting paths.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Further, in the second embodiment, the sensor arm <b>294</b> is retracted upward from the optical sensor <b>68</b>, but the sensor arm <b>294</b> may be configured to be retracted to a position under the optical sensor <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Further, in the second embodiment, the open or closed state of the cover <b>224</b>, the posture of the roller holder <b>274</b>, and the conveyed positions of the recording sheet <b>19</b> and the disc tray <b>48</b> are sensed on the basis of the output signals of the sensor <b>68</b>, but the present invention may be applied to a construction in which only two objects, i.e., the open or closed state of the cover <b>224</b> and the posture of the roller holder <b>274</b> are sensed on the basis of the output signals of the sensor <b>68</b>. The present invention may also be applied to a construction in which only the open or closed state of the cover <b>224</b> and the conveyed positions of the recording sheet <b>19</b> and the disc tray <b>48</b> are sensed on the basis of the output signals of the sensor <b>68</b>.</p>
