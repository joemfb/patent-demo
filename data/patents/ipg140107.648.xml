<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 371 of PCT/EP11/53919 filed on Mar. 15, 2011, which claims priority to EPO No. 10157256.8, filed Mar. 22, 2010, the technical disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a sonotrode.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many pourable food products, such as fruit juice, pasteurized or UHT (ultra-high-temperature processed) milk, wine, tomato sauce, etc., are sold in packages made of sterilized packaging material.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical example of this type of package is the parallelepiped-shaped package for liquid or pourable food products known as Tetra Brik Aseptic (registered trademark), which is made by folding and sealing laminated strip packaging material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The packaging material has a multilayer structure substantially comprising a base layer for stiffness and strength, which may comprise a layer of fibrous material, e.g. paper, or of mineral-filled polypropylene material; and a number of layers of heat-seal plastic material, e.g. polyethylene film, covering both sides of the base layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the case of aseptic packages for long-storage products, such as UHT milk, the packaging material also comprises a layer of gas- and light-barrier material, e.g. aluminium foil or ethyl vinyl alcohol (EVOH), which is superimposed on a layer of heat-seal plastic material, and is in turn covered with another layer of heat-seal plastic material forming the inner face of the package eventually contacting the food product.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As is known, such packages are made on fully automatic packaging machines, on which a continuous tube is formed from the web-fed packaging material; the web of packaging material is sterilized on the packaging machine itself, e.g. by applying a chemical sterilizing agent, such as a hydrogen peroxide solution, which, after sterilization, is removed, e.g. vaporized by heating, from the surfaces of the packaging material; and the web of packaging material so sterilized is maintained in a closed sterile environment, and is folded and sealed longitudinally to form a vertical tube.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The tube is filled from the top with the sterilized or sterile-processed food product, and is gripped at equally spaced cross sections by two pairs of jaws. More specifically, the pairs of jaws act cyclically and successively on the tube to seal the packaging material of the tube and form a continuous strip of pillow packs connected to one another by respective transversal sealing bands.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The pillow packs are separated by cutting the relative sealing bands, and are then conveyed to a final folding station where they are folded mechanically into the finished parallelepiped shape.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a first alternative, the packaging machine comprises two forming assemblies movable along respective guides and which interact cyclically with the tube to heat seal the packaging material of the tube. Each forming assembly comprises a slide movable back and forth along respective guide; and the two jaws which are hinged at the bottom to the respective slide, and move between a closed position, in which they cooperate with the tube to seal it, and an open position in which they are detached from the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a second alternative, the packaging machine comprises two chain conveyors defining respective endless path and fitted with respective number of jaws. The two paths have respective branches substantially facing and parallel to each other, and between which the tube of packaging material is fed so that the jaws on one conveyor cooperate with the corresponding jaws on the other conveyor along branches of respective paths, to grip the tube at a number of successive cross sections, and to seal and cut the packs.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the case of aseptic packages with an aluminium layer as the barrier material, the cross sections of the tube are normally sealed by induction of leakage current in the aluminium layer to melt the heat-seal plastic material locally.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">More specifically, one of the jaws in each pair comprises a main body made of nonconductive material, and an inductor housed in a face seat on the main body; while the other jaw has pressure pads made of flexible material, such as rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The inductor is energized when the relative pair of jaws grips the tube, so as to seal a cross section of the tube by heat sealing the plastic covering material.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the case of packages with no layer of aluminium or other electrically conductive materials, the cross sections of the tube are normally sealed using a hot plate for locally heating the packaging material inwards.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">More specifically, one of the jaws is equipped with a hot plate, while the other normally has one or more pressure pads of flexible material. This method, commonly referred to as &#x201c;hot-plate&#x201d; sealing, calls for relatively prolonged contact between the hot plate and the packaging material.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To accelerate local melting of the packaging material, and so increase package production speed, increasing use is made of ultrasonic sealing devices, which substantially comprise a mechanical-vibration generator or sonotrode and an anvil&#x2014;known for example from EP-B-615907 in the name of the same Applicant&#x2014;fitted to respective jaws in each pair and which cooperate with each other to heat the packaging material by means of ultrasonic vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">More precisely, the sonotrode disclosed in EP-B-615907 substantially comprises a head and a unique drive unit which consists of a stack of alternate piezoelectric ceramic plates and conductive metal sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The head defines a sealing surface which extends along a first direction, and the drive unit is fitted to the head on the opposite side of the sealing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The drive unit is coupled to an alternate current generator. In this way, the piezoelectric ceramic plates convert the electrical supplied voltage into a mechanical strain which causes the oscillation of the head and, therefore, the sealing of the transversal sealing band.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In particular, the sonotrode constitutes a half-wave resonator, i.e. the entire length of the sonotrode along a second direction orthogonal to the first direction consists of half a wave length of the oscillation of the head.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Ultrasonic sealing devices of the type described in EP-B-615907 have the following drawback.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When a longer transversal sealing band is desired, for example for transversally sealing a particularly high package, a plurality of the above-described sonotrodes are interconnected for an additional length.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">However, the inevitable errors during the interconnection of the sonotrodes are likely to generate a non-uniform vibration between such sonotrodes. Accordingly, the resulting transversal sealing band may be uneven.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">To overcome this drawback, WO-A-2007/020208, in the name of the same Applicant, discloses a single-piece sonotrode which accommodates three driven units fed by a single generator. In greater detail, drive units are fixed into respective recesses of the sonotrode, and have respective plurality of piezo-elements.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, the sonotrode disclosed in WO-A-2007/020208 comprises a pair of slots which are arranged between respective couples of drive units adjacent to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Finally, the sonotrode comprises a plurality, in particular three pairs, of S-shaped hooks for fixing the sonotrode to the frame of the jaw. The S-shaped hooks of each pair are arranged on opposite lateral side surfaces of the sonotrode and may be welded or unitarily formed to the sonotrode. Accordingly, the sonotrode is prevented from oscillating at the S-shaped hooks. In other words, the S-shaped hooks define respective nodal points of the sonotrode and lie on a &#x201c;so-called&#x201d; nodal plane of such sonotrode.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">More precisely, slots extend orthogonal to a sealing surface of the sonotrode and between two subsequent pairs of S-shaped hooks. In particular, slots extend both above and below the S-shaped hooks. Accordingly, slots pass through the nodal plane of the sonotrode.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The Applicant has found that the vibration of the sonotrode disclosed WO-A-2007/020208 is made unstable by some additional parasitic frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Accordingly, the resulting transversal sealing band may still be not completely uniform and continuous. Furthermore, these additional parasitic frequencies result in additional fatigue stresses onto the sonotrode, with a consequent reduction of its fatigue residual life.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A need is felt within the industry to obtain a sonotrode which is able to generate a considerable long sealing band and the vibration of which is as less as possible affected by the above-mentioned additional frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A need is also felt within the industry to reduce as far as possible the power losses due to the water stagnation within the sonotrode, so as to limit the consequent reduction of the effective sealing time and, therefore, the risk that the sealing band remains partially unsealed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A need is finally felt within the industry to distance as far as possible the parasitic frequencies of the sonotrode.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">EP-A-1241099 discloses an ultrasonic sealing device which comprises a casing fixed to one of the jaw, and three distinct sonotrodes arranged side by side and housed in the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sealing device also comprises two beamlike intermediate supports located each between the heads of two sonotrodes adjacent to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In particular, the head of each sonotrode does not have any slot therein.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is an object of the present invention to provide a sonotrode, designed to meet at least one of the aforementioned needs.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to the present invention, there is provided a sonotrode, as claimed in claim <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0108">The operation of sonotrode <b>1</b> is hereinafter described with reference to only a couple of jaw <b>6</b> and counterjaw, and starting from a configuration in which jaw <b>6</b> and counterjaw are in the closed configuration and grip tube <b>2</b> at a cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0109">In such configuration, sonotrode <b>1</b> cooperates with anvil <b>9</b> and the cross section of tube <b>2</b> is gripped therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0110">At this stage, the generator feeds drive units <b>12</b> with a given value of alternate current, so causing the ultrasonic vibration of piezo-electric elements <b>13</b> and, therefore, of sonotrode <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0111">The ultrasonic vibration of sonotrode <b>1</b> causes the sealing of tube <b>2</b> and the formation of sealing band <b>5</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0116">In other words, edge <b>20</b> forms a continuous closed nodal line of sonotrode <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0117">Once drive units <b>12</b> are deactivated, and before jaw <b>6</b> and counterjaw are opened to commence the next forming cycle, knife <b>65</b> is activated and expelled from seat <b>64</b> in anvil <b>9</b> to cut the packaging material along the relative sealing band <b>5</b> and so detach from tube <b>2</b> a relative pillow pack which is subsequently folded into the finished shape.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0118">The advantages of sonotrode <b>1</b> according to the present invention will be clear from the foregoing description.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0119">In particular, slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b> extend completely within respective portions <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and at a certain distance from plane P, which is defined by the edge <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0120">The Applicant has found that, due to the fact that slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b> do not pass through the plane P defined by the continuous nodal line of head <b>15</b>, the vibration of sonotrode <b>1</b> substantially lacks the additional parasitic frequencies that affect the sonotrode disclosed in the introductory part of the present description.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0121">More precisely, the Applicant has found that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the plots G, Z of the module and the phase of the impedance as a function of frequency and at a constant value of sealing force for a sonotrode similar to the one disclosed in WO-A-2007/020208 have respective low-frequency inflections I, J close to the resonance frequency and a succession of very close local maxima and minima.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0122">The presence of inflections I, J and of very close maxima and minima is mainly due to an additional mode excited by the additional parasitic frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0123">Differently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the plots K, L of the module and the phase of the impedance as a function of frequency and at a constant value of sealing force for sonotrode <b>1</b> lack both low-frequency inflections and the succession of very close local maxima and minima.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0124">This is due to the fact that the vibration of sonotrode <b>1</b> lacks the above-mentioned additional frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0125">As a consequence, even when they are particularly long, the transversal sealing bands <b>5</b> carried out by sonotrode <b>1</b> are particularly uniform. This is due to the fact that the same head <b>15</b> houses a plurality of piezo-electric elements <b>13</b> and to the fact that the plane P is not crossed by slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0126">Furthermore, due to the fact that slots <b>23</b> extend within portion <b>21</b> only, water stagnation is limited to portion <b>21</b> only and substantially prevented in portion <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the power losses due to water stagnation are dramatically reduced, so increasing the likelihood that transversal sealing bands <b>5</b> are completely sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0127">Sealing rings <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are effective in reducing the transmission of the vibration from head <b>15</b> to elements <b>31</b>, <b>45</b> and crossbar <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0128">Finally, the Applicant has found that due to the fact that it has an odd number of drive unit <b>12</b>, sonotrode <b>1</b> exhibits parasitic frequencies at higher distance from one another than the known sonotrodes having an even number of drive unit.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0129">Clearly, changes may be made to sonotrode <b>1</b> described herein without, however, departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0130">In particular, head <b>15</b> could comprise, instead of edge <b>20</b>, a plurality of attack elements which are connected to jaw <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0131">In this case, the attack elements define respective nodal point of head <b>15</b> and lie on plane P while slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b> are detached from plane P.</p>
