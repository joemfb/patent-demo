<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to cell culture methodology. More specifically, this invention relates to enhanced formation of extracellular matrices using volume exclusion agents.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Collagen is necessary for the tensile strength and structural integrity of tissues. Cells in culture make very low levels of collagen but can be stimulated to make higher levels of collagen, in the form of procollagen, by the addition of growth factors. Additionally, cells in culture do not efficiently process procollagen to collagen. As a result, even if collagen synthesis is stimulated, almost all of the procollagen is released into the media and little or no collagen is assembled into fibrils associated with the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The corneal stroma of the eye contains an extensive and transparent extracellular matrix that is interspersed with keratocytes. Transparency of this matrix requires uniformly small diameter collagen fibrils with constant inter-fibril spacing. The matrix is composed primarily of the fibrillar collagen types I and V, with lesser amounts of types III, VI and XII, and four leucine-rich type proteoglycans; three with keratin sulfate chains, lumican, keratocan, and osteoglycin/mimecan, and one with a chondroitin sulfate chain, decorin. In vitro studies have shown that collagen type V and the core proteins of the leucine-rich proteoglycans can act to regulate collagen fibril growth and these findings have been confirmed in vivo in the Col5a1 haploinsufficent mouse, in the lumican null mouse and in the keratocan null mouse.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The keratocytes in the corneal stroma are responsible for making, maintaining and repairing the corneal stroma's matrix. Keratocytes can be isolated from the stroma of rabbit and bovine corneas by collagenase digestion. Once isolated, they can be cultured in serum free media where they maintain their normal dendritic morphology as well as other in vivo characteristics (Beales et al., Proteoglycan synthesis by bovine keratocytes and corneal fibroblasts: maintenance of the keratocyte phenotype in culture. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci (1999) 40:1658-1663). The media supplement &#x201c;ITS&#x201d; and high levels of insulin, a component of &#x201c;ITS&#x201d;, have been shown to stimulate the proliferation of bovine keratocytes while maintaining their dendritic morphology and keratan sulfate proteoglycan synthesis (Musselmann K, et al., Maintenance of the keratocyte phenotype during cell proliferation stimulated by insulin. J Bio Chem (2005) 280:32634-32639). Furthermore, in the presence of ascorbic acid, a cofactor necessary for collagen triple helix stability, insulin also has been shown to increase the synthesis of collagen by 11-fold and lumican/keratocan by 2-3 fold (Musselmann et al., Stimulation of collagen synthesis by insulin and proteoglycan accumulation by ascorbate in bovine keratocytes in vitro. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci (2006) 47: 5260-5266). Thus, insulin may act to maintain the normal keratocyte phenotype and that proteoglycan stability may be linked to collagen stability.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Insulin has a high affinity for its own receptor, and it also has a low affinity for the IGF-I receptor. High levels of insulin would therefore activate keratocytes through both receptors. High levels of insulin would not normally be present in the corneal stroma, however IGF-II, another ligand for IGF-IR, is in the bovine corneal stroma and it causes bovine keratocytes to proliferate and maintain their normal phenotype in vitro (Musselmann et al., IGF-II is present in bovine corneal stroma and activates keratocytes to proliferate in vitro. Exp Eye Res (2008) 86:506-511). IGF-I stimulates the proliferation of rabbit keratocytes in vitro while maintaining their dendritic morphology.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As discussed above, even if collagen synthesis is stimulated using growth factors, almost all of the procollagen is released into the media and little or no collagen is assembled into fibrils associated with the cells. Improvements in the techniques used to facilitate matrix deposition and formation are desired in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Cells in culture secrete most of the collagen into the media as unprocessed procollagen, i.e., the cells do not convert procollagen to collagen. In contrast, normal extracellular matrix deposition involves procollagen processing to collagen, fibril assembly and deposition into the cell layer to form a collagenous extracellular matrix. We have found that the addition of certain growth factors to the culture medium will stimulate collagen synthesis. We have also discovered that adding a thin layer of a certain volume exclusion agent on top of the cells will dramatically enhance the conversion of procollagen to collagen and will increase the amount of collagen and extracellular matrix associated with the cells. In addition, it is associated with a more normal cell topography associated with tissue-specific extracellular matrix assembly in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Cells in culture make very low levels of collagen but can be stimulated to make higher levels of collagen, in the form of procollagen, by the addition of the growth factors IGF-I, PDGF, TGF-&#x3b2; or insulin to the medium as taught herein. The effect of high levels of insulin and low levels of IGF-I on keratocyte proliferation and on the synthesis of collagen and proteoglycans by bovine keratocytes in culture is shown herein. The effect of an agarose overlay on the processing of procollagen to collagen required for fibril formation and extracellular matrix assembly is also detailed in the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This invention will be useful for the bioengineering of connective tissues for medical applications that require an extensive and functional extracellular matrix with high tensile strength such as those in the cornea stroma, skin, tendons, ligaments, articular cartilage and the intervertebral disks. In addition, a tissue-specific matrix would be essential as a scaffold for cells in applications where cell-matrix interactions are important to maintain cell phenotype and a tissue-specific matrix would facilitate integration with the surrounding extracellular matrix into which it was implanted, e.g., an artificial pancreas.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a first aspect this invention provides a method of enhancing the formation of extracellular matrices in culture. The method includes the steps of plating out cells on a tissue culture substrate, adding a volume exclusion agent on top of the plated cells, adding tissue culture media containing a growth factor to the substrate containing the overlaid plated cells, and incubating the plated cells in a tissue culture incubator. The growth factor can be IGF-I, PDGF, TGF-&#x3b2; or insulin. A hydrogel can be used as the volume exclusion agent. Advantageous hydrogels include agarose, kappa-carrageenan, iota-carrageenan, gelatin, elastin-mimetic protein polymers and silk-elastin block copolymers. Dialysis membranes with predetermined MW pore sizes and high viscosity solutions of methycellulose can also be used as the volume exclusion agent. Pore sizes of the membranes can be selected based upon the desired retention or diffusion characteristics of the membrane relative to the secreted molecules. For example, if one seeks to retain a secreted protein within the environment created by the membrane, a membrane could be selected with a pore size sufficiently small to ensure that the molecule is unable to diffuse across the barrier created by the membrane. In light of the foregoing, membranes having pore sizes of 10 kd, 13 kd, 25 kd, 50 kd to as large as 300 kd can be selected for use. Advantageously, a membrane of about 25,000 to 50,000 MW pore size is employed. Agarose overlays are particularly advantageous volume exclusion agents. Agarose overlays can be made from an approximately 3% solution of low melting temperature agarose in distilled water. Alternatively, the solution of low melting temperature agarose can be an approximately 1%, 2%, 4%, 5%, or 6% solution, or in a range from 1-6%, 2-5%, 2-4%, 2.5-3.5%, or ranges encompassed therein. More particularly, the approximately 3% solution of low melting temperature agarose in distilled water can be prepared by combining an approximately 6% solution of low melting temperature agarose in distilled water with an equal volume of 2&#xd7; tissue culture media containing 2&#xd7; growth factor. The method of enhancing the formation of extracellular matrices in culture can further include the steps of adding media containing a growth factor to the plated cells following the plating of the cells on a tissue culture substrate, incubating the plated cells to facilitate attachment of the cells to the tissue culture substrate and removing the media from the substrate containing the growth factor stimulated cells. The cells can be incubated for a period of 1-4 days to allow for attachment. Advantageously, the incubation to allow for attachment is about four days before the agarose overlay is added. Moreover, the cells can be plated at a high density of about 100,000-cells/cm2. Alternatively, the density can be in the range of 50,000-150,000-cells/cm2, 60,000-140,000-cells/cm2, 75,000-125,000-cells/cm2, or 80,000-120,000-cells/cm2. In an advantageous embodiment the cells are fibroblasts. In a particularly advantageous embodiment the cells are keratocytes, tenocytes or chondrocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a second aspect this invention provides a method of enhancing the formation of extracellular collagen matrices in culture. The method includes the steps of plating out keratocytes on a tissue culture substrate, adding a volume exclusion agent on top of the plated keratocytes, adding tissue culture media containing a growth factor to the substrate containing the overlaid plated cells and incubating the plated keratocytes in a tissue culture incubator. The growth factor can be IGF-I or insulin. A hydrogel can be used as the volume exclusion agent. Advantageous hydrogels include agarose, kappa-carrageenan, iota-carrageenan, gelatin, elastin-mimetic protein polymers and silk-elastin block copolymers. Agaose overlays are particularly advantageous volume exclusion agents.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a third aspect this invention provides a second method of enhancing the formation of extracellular matrices.

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">This invention enhances both the synthesis of collagen and the conversion of procollagen to collagen and, as a result, increases extra cellular matrix formation associated with the cells.

Keratocytes grown with an agarose overlay demonstrate stratification and the development of intercellular spaces defined by a series of complex cell processes. Keratocytes formed 2-4 layers separating lamellae-like structures containing abundant organized collagen fibrils. These spaces are filled with collagen fibrils that have small homogenous diameters and regular packing like that seen in the corneal stroma. The collagen fibrils are in both cross (wide arrows) and longitudinal (narrows arrows) comparable to that seen in the orthogonal stromal lamellae. Keratocytes without an agarose overlay appeared as sparse monolayers consistent with a dendritic morphology but with little matrix deposition and no stratification.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Cells in culture secrete most of the collagen into the media as unprocessed procollagen. In other words, the cells do not convert the procollagen to collagen. In contrast, normal extracellular matrix deposition involves procollagen processing to collagen, fibril assembly and deposition into the cell layer to form a collagenous extracellular matrix. We have found that the addition of certain growth factors to the culture medium will stimulate collagen synthesis. We have also discovered that adding a thin layer of a certain volume exclusion agent on top of the cells will dramatically enhance the conversion of procollagen to collagen and will increase the amount of collagen and extracellular matrix associated with the cells. In addition, it is associated with a more normal cell topography associated with tissue-specific extracellular matrix assembly in vivo. This invention will be useful for the bioengineering of connective tissues for medical applications that require an extensive and functional extracellular matrix with high tensile strength such as those in the cornea stroma, skin, tendons, ligaments, articular cartilage and the intervertebral disks. In addition, a tissue-specific matrix would be essential as a scaffold for cells in applications where cell-matrix interactions are important to maintain cell phenotype and a tissue-specific matrix would facilitate integration with the surrounding extracellular matrix into which it was implanted, e.g., an artificial pancreas.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, a &#x201c;volume exclusion agent&#x201d; is a semipermeable barrier or membrane used to overlay cells where the barrier or membrane keeps the procollagen secreted from the cells at or near the keratocyte surface. By keeping the procollgen at or near the surface, while similarly impeding the diffusion of necessary enzymes to convert procollagen to collagen, the volume exclusion agent effects the efficient processing of procollagen to collagen and assists in the subsequent fibril and matrix assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Hydogels are advantageous volume exclusion agents. Hydrogels are hydrated polymer gels exhibiting a degree of flexibility similar to natural tissue. The hydrogel of the present invention may be produced from a hydrogel precursor selected from the group consisting of thermally gelling polysaccharides, such as agarose, or thermally gelling proteins, such as gelatin. Agarose is a natural polymer extracted from seaweed, and varies in its properties (molecular weight, precise chemical composition, side chains, etc.) and may be chemically functionalized to alter desirable properties such as the gelation temperature. Further, while commercially available agarose gels have a variety of electroendoosmosis (EEO) values when used for electrophoresis, such properties should not be critical in the present invention. Other potentially useful thermally gelling polysaccharides include kappa-carrageenan and iota-carrageenan. Gelatin is a protein derived from collagen from a wide variety of animal tissues and species. Like agarose, the properties of gelatin such as molecular weight and precise chemical composition are variable, yet the invention is not strongly dependent upon the exact compositions. Furthermore, there are other thermally gelling proteins that are potentially useful in this invention, such as elastin-mimetic protein polymers and silk-elastin block copolymers. See Hurt and Gehrke, Thermally Associating Polypeptides Designed for Drug Delivery Produced by Genetically Engineered Cells, J. Phar. Sci. Vol. 96 No. 3 (March 2007. In general, an elastin mimetic protein is one which has an amino acid sequence and secondary structure derived from native (naturally occurring) elastin.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The agarose or gelatin will preferably have a gelling temperature such that cells may be overlayed with a solution of the agarose or gelatin at a temperature that does not significantly impair cell viability. As such, the agarose or gelatin preferably does not gel at a temperature higher than that which is compatible with cell viability. Typically, for example, the agarose or gelatin should permit overlay at a temperature ranging from about 30&#xb0; C. to 40&#xb0; C. The solution preferably gels in less than about four hours, more preferably less than one hour, and still most preferably on the order of minutes (typically 1 to 20 minutes, and even 2 to 5 minutes). The solution also preferably takes more than one minute to gel so that there is sufficient time to overlay the cells on the tissue culture substrate. The actual gel point temperature is not critical if the gelation is sufficiently slow and as long as the gel is stable at the temperature range of the application and which preserves cell viability. Most preferred agarose gels are the so-called &#x201c;low-melting&#x201d; gels as they have gelation temperatures near 32&#xb0; C. Thus, with such gels, there is less concern about inadvertently contacting the cells with a pre-gel solution that is too hot or that gels before the cells are fully dispersed in the solution.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Pharmacological levels of insulin can stimulate the synthesis of normal corneal stromal collagen and proteoglycans by bovine keratocytes in culture. Insulin was compared to physiological levels of IGF-I and it was found that IGF-I also stimulated the synthesis of these extracellular matrix components, but less than that of insulin. Keratocytes in monolayer culture secreted most of the collagen synthesized into the media in the form of procollagen, a precursor of collagen. An overlay of 3% agarose on the keratocytes in culture was found to enhance the conversion of procollagen to collagen and increased the deposition of collagen and proteoglycans into the cell layer. The extracellular matrix associated with the keratocytes cultured under agarose exhibited a corneal stromal-like architecture. These results suggest that enhancing the conversion of procollagen to collagen is a key step in the formation of extracellular matrix by keratocytes in vitro. Agarose overlay of insulin-activated keratocytes in culture is a useful model for studying corneal stromal extracellular matrix assembly in vitro.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Summary.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Ultrastructural analyses of the cell cultures demonstrated that the agarose overlay significantly enhanced the deposition of an extensive and normal appearing extracellular matrix. The matrix was characterized by collagen fibrils in the overlaid cultures which were sparse in the non-overlaid controls. This indicates normal processing of procollagen associated with fibril assembly. In addition, the overlay was associated with cell surface specializations/compartments characteristic of cells in vivo. These microdomains are associated with fibril and matrix deposition and not present in the non-over-laid cultures.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">We have found that the addition of certain growth factors to the culture medium will stimulate collagen synthesis. We have also discovered that adding a thin layer of a certain volume exclusion agent on top of the cells will dramatically enhance the conversion of procollagen to collagen and will increase the amount of collagen and extracellular matrix associated with the cells. In addition, it is associated with a more normal cell topography associated with tissue-specific extracellular matrix assembly in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The ability of insulin and IGF-1 to stimulate the proliferation of keratocytes in culture was evaluated over a 13-day period. Keratocytes were isolated from corneas and plated in DMEM/F12 on the same day. The media was changed the following day (day 1) to media supplemented with 10 &#x3bc;g insulin/ml, 10 ng IGF-1/ml or unsupplemented media (control) and the DNA content of the cultures was determined on days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 of culture. Compared to controls, cultures supplemented with insulin or with IGF-1 contained significantly higher levels of DNA by day 4 of culture and essentially remained at those levels for the duration of the culture period (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Media from these cultures was changed every 3 days. The media harvested on days 7, 10, and 13 of culture was digested either with endo-&#x3b2;-galactosidase or with chondroitinase ABC and was evaluated either for keratocan and lumican content or for decorin content, respectively, by western blot using antibodies to the core proteins of these proteoglycans. The volume of media analyzed was normalized to the DNA content. The media from the IGF-1 cultures contained substantially higher levels of these proteoglycans than media from control cultures and, in most instances, the media from the insulin cultures contained even higher levels than the media from IGF-1 cultures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Pepsin readily degrades globular proteins, but the triple helical domains of collagen are resistant to this protease. Aliquots of pepsin digested media and cell layers, normalized for DNA, harvested from the day 7, 10, and 13 time points were fractionated on SDS/PAGE and the collagenous proteins visualized by simply blue staining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Similar to that seen for the proteoglycans, the media (M) from the IGF-1 cultures contained substantially higher amounts of the &#x3b1;1(I), &#x3b1;2(I) and &#x3b1;1(V) chains of collagen than the control cultures and media from the days 10 and 13 insulin cultures contained slightly higher levels of these collagens than the IGF-1 cultures. Collagenous protein was not detected in the cell layer (CL) until day 10 and there was considerably less collagenous protein in the cell layer compared to that in the media, but by day 13 the same trend seen in the media was apparent in the cell layer: that is, more collagen in the IGF-1 cultures than controls and even more in the insulin cultures. These results demonstrate that most of the collagenous proteins synthesized were deposited in the media.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">We next determined if deposition of collagen with the cell layer could be enhanced by plating keratocytes at a higher density. The same number of cells (400,000) were plated per well in 6 and in 24 well plates to produce a five-fold difference in plating density; &#x2dc;20,000-cells/cm2 in 6 well plates (low density cultures) and &#x2dc;100,000 cells/cm2 in 24 well plates (high density cultures). It was possible, however, to use the same amount (2 mls) of media per well during subsequent culture for both cell densities because of the depth of the wells. One day after plating (day 1), there was 27% less DNA/well in the high density cultures than in the low density cultures which suggests that keratocytes may have higher attachment efficiencies at the lower plating density (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The DNA content per well increased significantly during the subsequent 12 days of culture in both plates; &#x2dc;2.1 fold increase in the low density cultures and &#x2dc;1.7 fold increase in the high density cultures. Thus, during days 7-10 of culture, the cell density in the high density cultures was only &#x2dc;2.6 fold higher than in the low density cultures. SDS/PAGE analyses of aliquots of pepsin digests from the cell layers, normalized to DNA content, demonstrated that the levels of collagenous proteins were slightly greater in cells at the higher density at all 3 time points (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Type I collagen is initially synthesized as procollagen with N&#x2212; and C&#x2212; terminal globular domains. The procollagen globular domains are cleaved by specific proteases during post-translational processing and this allows the triple helical regions of collagen to laterally associate into fibrils. The processing of type I procollagen and subsequent assembly of collagen fibrils occurs quickly and completely in vivo. In contrast, cultured fibroblasts incompletely process procollagen to collagen and because procollagen cannot efficiently form normal fibrils, it accumulates in the culture medium (Goldberg et al., Precursors of collagen secreted by cultured human fibroblasts. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (1972) 69:3655-3659). Consequently, we analyzed culture medium, normalized for DNA, from keratocytes harvested on day 10 for type I procollagen using a monoclonal antibody (Foellmer et al., A monoclonal antibody specific for the amino terminal cleavage site of procollagen type 1. Eur J Biochem (1983)134:183-189) specific for the N-terminal globular domain of &#x3b1;1(I) by western blot (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, lanes WB). Compared to controls, media from IGF-II cultures contained higher levels of type I procollagen. Furthermore, media from IGF-1 cultures and from insulin cultures contained increasingly higher levels of type I procollagen, respectively. Staining SDS/PAGE of media from insulin cultures for protein showed that the major protein band in the media co-migrated with the major band detected by the antibody to the pro-&#x3b1;1(I) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, lane CB).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The addition of neutral polymers, such as dextran and polyethylene glycol, to the culture medium has been shown to increase the processing of procollagen to collagen by fibroblasts in culture and to cause an increase in the amount of collagen associated with the cell layer (Bateman et al., Induction of pro collagen processing in fibroblast cultures by neutral polymers. J Biol Chem (1986) 261:4198-4203; Bateman et al., Cell-layer-associated proteolytic cleavage of the telopeptides of type I collagen in fibroblast culture. Biochem J (1987) 245: 677-682). We cultured insulin activated keratocytes in media supplemented with 5% dextran 40 and found that they deposited substantially lower levels of procollagen in the media and demonstrated increased levels of collagen associated with the cell layer (data not shown). However, the dextran treated keratocytes contained numerous large cytoplasmic vacuoles that were the predominant cytoplasmic feature (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>). These vacuoles were large and found in large clusters. In contrast, the keratocytes cultured in the absence of dextran contained occasional vacuoles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>). Organ culture of human corneas in media containing dextran also has been shown to produce vacuoles in keratocytes. However, these vacuoles were comparable in size, morphology and distribution to those seen in the untreated control keratocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Encapsulation of collagenase isolated chondrocytes by suspension in media containing 2% agarose has been shown to enhance the deposition of pericellular matrix by the chondrocyte during subsequent culture (Chang et al., Structural colocalisation of type VI collagen and fibronectin in agarose cultured chondrocytes and isolated chondrons extracted from adult canine tibial cartilage. J Anat (2007) 190 (Pt 4): 523-532). The pericellular matrix of chondrocytes contains collagen. We hypothesized that culture of keratocytes in agarose would enhance procollagen processing and deposition in the cell layer. However, instead of encapsulation, keratocytes were first plated at high density (100,000-cells/cm2), cultured in media containing insulin for days 1-4 and then, on day 4 of culture, the media was removed and media containing molten 3% agarose was layered on top of the attached cell layer. After the agarose has set, 2 mls of media was added to the well above the agarose layer. Cultures were harvested on days 7, 10, and 13 of culture without intervening media replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Cultures with and without an agarose overlay were evaluated for collagen content in the two different compartments. SDS/PAGE/Western blots with antibodies to procollagen type I, of DNA-normalized aliquots from the media and acetic acid extracts of the cell layers showed that the media of agarose over-layered cultures contained substantially less procollagen type I than the media of cultures without agarose (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). In contrast, the levels of type I procollagen in the cell layer extracts were far less than that in the media, although the extracts of cell layers over-layered with agarose contained higher levels of type I procollagen than the extracts of cell layers without agarose. SDS/PAGE analysis of DNA-normalized aliquots of pepsin digests of media and cell layers showed that compared to cultures without agarose, the agarose over-layered cultures contained substantially less collagenous protein in the media and also contained more collagenous protein in the cell layer at all 3 time points (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Together, the results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> indicate that the collagenous proteins detected in the media are procollagen while the collagenous proteins detected in the cell layer are collagen. These results also indicate that the agarose overlay enhances the processing of procollagen to collagen resulting in fibril formation and association with the cell layer.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Cultures with and without an agarose overlay were harvested on days 8 and 13 and guanidine extracts of the cell layers were evaluated for lumican and keratocan content. DNA-normalized aliquots of the extracts were digested with endo-&#x3b2;-galactosidase and core protein levels were determined by western blot using antibodies to lumican and keratocan (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Compared to cultures without agarose, cultures with agarose contained higher levels of lumican on day 13 and higher levels of keratocan on both days 8 and 13. These data indicate that the agarose overlay also enhances the incorporation of proteoglycans into the extracellular matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Cultured keratocytes both with and without an agarose overlay were fixed at day 13 for transmission electron microscopy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The keratocytes without an agarose overlay were arranged as monolayers. Keratocytes were associated with single and small groups of collagen fibrils. In contrast, the keratocyte cultures with the agarose overlay had a significant enhancement of collagen fibril deposition and also demonstrated stratification of the keratocytes. This was a major feature in large regions of the cultures with 2-4 layers of keratocytes. The regional nature coupled with the absence of keratocyte proliferation suggests the stratification resulted from reorganization and migration of keratocytes in response to the extracellular matrix deposited in the agarose overlay cultures. In addition, these cultures exhibited a more complex arrangement of keratocytes. The cells formed parallel spaced layers with numerous cytoplasmic processes delineating intercellular spaces. These spaces were filled with collagen fibrils displaying an orderly deposition of fibrils mimicking the cornea stroma-specific architecture, i.e., homogeneous small diameter fibrils with regular packing.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Pharmacological levels of insulin and physiological levels of IGF-I are shown herein to stimulate similar levels of cell proliferation, proteoglycan production and collagen synthesis by keratocytes in culture. The stimulation by insulin was, in most cases, slightly more than that of IGF-I. Insulin can bind to the receptors for IGF-I, but with much lower affinity. This suggests that the major pharmacological action of insulin could be through IGF-IR, but because the stimulation by insulin was greater than IGF-I, there may be additional actions of high levels of insulin on keratocytes, such as also activating the receptors for insulin. These data also indicate that, like shown for pharmacological levels of insulin, physiological levels of IGF-I can stimulate proliferation and the synthesis of normal matrix components by keratocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">While insulin substantially increased collagen synthesis by keratocytes, very little of the collagen made was deposited with the cell layer, i.e., assembled into fibrils. Increasing the length of time in culture and the initial plating density of the cells did, however, increase deposition of collagen with the cell layer. Most of the collagen was secreted into the media as procollagen, a precursor of collagen. The processing of procollagen to collagen by fibroblasts in culture was shown to be incomplete (Goldberg et al. 1972) and it is now apparent, from the data presented in this report, that keratocytes in culture also have this deficiency. We found, however, that culturing keratocytes under a layer of agarose enhanced the processing of procollagen to collagen, the assembly of collagen into fibrils and the deposition of fibrils and proteoglycans with the cell layer. Without wishing to be bound to a particular theory, one possible explanation is that the agarose provided a semi-permeable barrier that kept the secreted procollagen as well as the processing enzymes at or near the keratocytes surface leading to efficient processing to collagen and subsequent fibril and matrix assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The processing of procollagen with subsequent fibril and matrix assembly in the cell layer associated with culture under an agarose overlay generated a corneal stroma-like architecture. Again, without wishing to be bound to a particular theory, we can speculate that the processing of procollagen and matrix deposition resulted in a substrate with which the keratocytes could interact. These keratocytes-matrix interactions favored the keratocytes phenotype and drove cornea-like organization. After the deposition of an extracellular matrix, the keratocytes became stratified as parallel oriented layers. It is probable that this keratocyte organization is due to the deposition of a stromal extracellular matrix that drives cell migration and organization. The intercellular spaces between the layers of keratocytes contain a well organized matrix. The collagen fibrils have small homogeneous diameters and are regularly packed. We suggest that this stroma-like architecture is generated by regulated assembly. This begins with normal pro collagen processing and fibril formation involving collagen types I and V, and includes the interaction of the assembling fibrils with decorin, lumican and keratocan. These interactions would regulate the later stages in fibril formation as well as packing.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Chondrocytes in cell culture without agarose encapsulation readily synthesize procollagen type II and deposit it into the culture media. Encapsulation of chondrocytes in agarose was originally used to enhance the differentiation of chondrocytes in culture and was later shown to also promote the formation of the chondrocyte pericellular matrix, which would contain collagen (Chang et al. 1997). Thus, agarose encapsulation might be enhancing procollagen type II processing to collagen by chondrocytes in culture as well.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Agarose overlay differs from agarose encapsulation. The encapsulation method is done on unattached cells or clumps of cells in suspension and results in the formation of tiny spheres containing cells and their associated matrix. The overlay method described here is done on cells that are attached to a substrate. The keratocytes in this report are attached to the bottom of a culture dish and the overlay results in the formation of a sheet of cells and their associated matrix. Furthermore, with the overlay method, the thickness and diameter of the resulting sheet could be varied by the initial plating density and size of the culture dish.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The processing of procollagen to collagen is thought to take place on the plasma membrane or cell surface [for review see (Canty and Kadler, Procollagen trafficking, processing and fibrillogenesis. J Cell Sci (2005) 118: 1341-1353)]. Dextran and other high molecular weight neutral polymers have been shown to increase the processing of procollagen and its deposition with the cell layer in cell culture [this report and (Bateman et al. 1986; Bateman et al. 1987)]. These agents are thought to act by a volume exclusion mechanism to increase the concentration of macromolecules in a solution (Atha and Ingham, Mechanism of precipitation of proteins by polyethylene glycols. Analysis in terms of excluded volume. J Biol Chem (1981) 256:12108-12117). Their presence would reduce the space that is available for large molecules, such as procollagen, but not for small molecules, such as salts and amino acids. Thus, for the processing of procollagen, the presence of these crowding agents in the media would increase the concentration of procollagen on the surface of the cells where the proteases are that clip off its globular domains. Agarose has not been considered to be a crowding agent but it is routinely used as a molecular sieve to separate proteins and nucleic acids according to their size. A layer of agarose over cells in culture would therefore act as a semipermeable membrane to retard the diffusion of secreted macromolecules, such as procollagen, into the media and, as a result, the concentration of procollagen would increase on the surface of the cells where collagen processing takes place. The difference between an agarose overlay and dextran in solution is that the agarose, because it is insoluble, is a physical presence that would put some degree of confinement on the cell layer that could alter cell-cell interactions or cell movement.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Collagen binds to fibronectin and collagen fibril formation is facilitated by the presence of the integrin receptors for fibronectin, the presence of fibronectin and the formation of fibronectin fibrils [for review see (Canty and Kadler 2005)]. The agarose overlay also would act to increase the concentration of fibronectin on the cell surface and this could increase its assembly into fibrils as well as its binding to collagen and to its receptor. Type V collagen has been shown to nucleate collagen fibril formation and absence of type V collagen results in an embryonic lethal phenotype due to lack of fibril formation in the presence of normal type I collagen concentrations (Wenstrup et al., Type V collagen controls the initiation of collagen fibril assembly. J Biol Chem (2004) 279:53331-53337). It was suggested that this nucleation involves a regulatory interaction at or near the cell surface involving a molecular complex. Integrin frequency and distribution on the plasma membrane of the cell may play a role in determining the architectural arrangement of an extracellular matrix by positioning these regulatory complexes. This agarose overlay method will likely be a useful tool for studying cell-specific extracellular matrix assembly in vitro.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">We have shown that IGF-I, TGF-&#x3b2;, and PDGF, but not FGF-2, stimulate collagen synthesis by keratocytes in culture. We have also shown that culturing insulin activated keratocytes under a thin layer of agarose increases the processing of procollagen to collagen and increases ECM formation. ECM formation by keratocytes cultured in these growth factors and under agarose is now evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Collagenase-isolated keratocytes from bovine corneas were plated at 40,000 cells/cm2 and then cultured with DMEM/F12 alone, or DMEM/F12 supplemented with either 10 ng IGF-I, 2 ng TGF-&#x3b2;, 10 ng FGF-2, or 10 ng PDGF/ml, all with ascorbate. Cultures were overlaid with &#x2dc;1 mm of 3% agarose on day 4 and harvested for analysis on day 12. Keratocytes cell number was determined by measuring DNA content (cyquant assay). Collagen was determined by pepsin digestion, SDS/PAGE, simply blue staining, and by western blots with antibodies to procollagen I and III. ECM morphology was evaluated by electron microscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Compared to cultures without an agarose overlay, cultures with an agarose overlay had a 50%-89% reduction in levels of procollagen in the media. Conversely, agarose cultures had higher levels of collagen type I deposited with the cell layer, IGF-I was 9.1 fold higher; TGF-&#x3b2; was 6.2 fold higher; PDGF was 2.8 fold higher; DMEM/F12 was 2.5 fold higher; and FGF-2 was 0.6 fold higher. Electron microscopy showed that the FGF-2 agarose cultures had little or no ECM and the keratocytes were in close cell contact while IGF-I agarose cultures had the least cell contact with an extensive fibrillar ECM. TGF-&#x3b2; agarose cultures had both a fibrillar and amorphous ECM. Accordingly, agarose overlay increases ECM formation with the cell layer only when the synthesis of collagen was stimulated and that the ECM morphology is growth factor specific.</p>

The digests were adjusted to neutrality with NaOH, dialyzed against deionized water, lyophilized and reconstituted in 100 &#x3bc;l of sample buffer (Invitrogen).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Extraction of Cell Layers.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Two mls of 0.5 M acetic acid or 250 &#x3bc;l of 4 M guanidine-HCl was added to each well containing cells and the cell layer extracted over night at 4&#xb0; C. The wells were scraped; the extracts from 4 wells were combined and any insoluble material pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was dialyzed against deionized water. The acetic acid extracts and the guanidine extracts were used in Western blots to detect procollagen type I and proteoglycans, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Concentration of Media.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Media samples were used directly for detection of procollagen type I by Western blot. Media samples used for SDS/P AGE Simply Blue staining and for detection of core proteins were first concentrated to 1/10th volume using spin concentrators from Amicon. Aliquots of media and guanidine extracts of the cell layers were digested with endo-&#x3b2;-galactosidase or chondroitinase ABC according to the vendor's instructions for detection of lumican and keratocan core proteins or decorin core protein, respectively, by Western blot.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">SDS/PAGE and Western Blot.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The size of the aliquots taken from the media, the cell layer extracts and the pepsin digests for electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels was normalized to the DNA content of those cultures or to the DNA content of parallel cultures. This made it possible to directly compare the amount of a particular protein produced by the same number of cells. All samples were reduced prior to electrophoresis and were electrophoresed according to the vendor's instructions. Gels were stained for proteins using Simply Blue and Western blots were performed using the ECL Western blotting analysis system according to the vendor's instructions. Primary antibodies included: rabbit anti-sera to bovine lumican and to bovine keratocan (Berryhill et al., Production of prostaglandin D synthase as a keratan sulfate proteoglycan by cultured bovine keratocytes. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci (2001) 42:1201-1207), mouse monoclonal anti-decorin (DS1, Hybridoma Bank, U. of Iowa) and mouse monoclonal anti-procollagen type I (SP1.D8, Hybridoma Bank, U. of Iowa).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Electron Microscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Cultured keratocytes were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Briefly, mono layers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 7.4, with 8.0 mM CaCl2 (Birk and Trelstad 1984), post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series. The agarose layer was removed before the 100% ethanol step. After dehydration in an ethanol series, the cells were infiltrated and embedded in a mixture of EMbed 812, nadic methyl anhydride, dodecenyl succinic anhydride and DMP-30 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pa.). Thin sections (90 nm) were cut using a Reichert UCT ultramicrotome and post-stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate and 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 3.2. The sections were analyzed using a lEOL 1400 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV and digital images were captured with a Gatan Orius camera.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Statistics.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Statistical analysis was performed with four determined values for each point using Statview (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). Data are expressed as the mean&#xb1;standard error. Significant differences were determined by paired t-test.</p>
