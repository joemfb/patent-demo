<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, the most commonly used transistor for implementing logic devices in integrated circuits is the metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). In particular, the combination of complementary n-type and p-type MOSFETs, a technology known as &#x201c;CMOS,&#x201d; allows for the creation of low power logic devices. Because n-MOS and p-MOS devices are connected in series, no drain current flows&#x2014;except for a small charging current during the switching process between two different states. Furthermore, improved fabrication techniques have, over the years, led to the reduction of MOSFET sizes through a technique known as &#x201c;scaling,&#x201d; which has led to smaller, more densely packed, and faster chips.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">More recently, however, the speed benefits typically associated with scaling have diminished due to fundamental physical constraints inherent in MOSFETs. For example, in order to switch the voltage state of a MOSFET, the MOSFETs gate terminal must be sufficiently charged. The amount of charge that will switch the MOSFET on is proportional to the capacitance of the MOSFET' s gate terminal. One consequence of scaling is that the thickness of the gate insulator must be reduced to maintain acceptably small short-channel effects. Furthermore, to counteract the increased leakage current that may result from the reduced dielectric thickness and thereby keep the gate leakage current below acceptable levels, the gate insulator may be made of a dielectric with a dielectric constant, &#x201c;k,&#x201d; higher than that of silicon dioxide, whose k equals 3.9. Both the reduced thickness and the higher dielectric constant result in higher capacitance. Therefore, although the maximum drain current may increase for the scaled CMOS device, this benefit is largely limited by the increased capacitance. The result is that although the density of CMOS devices continues to increase, the speed performance of such devices has not increased substantially over the generations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Junction field effect transistors (JFETs), on the other hand, do not utilize an insulated gate. Rather, in a typical JFET, the gate is a p-doped or n-doped semiconductor material and the gate directly contacts the semiconductor body, forming a p-n junction between the gate and the transistor's conductive channel. Because JFETs do not utilize an insulated gate, the total gate capacitance in a JFET may be greatly reduced, which may result in a higher transistor switching speed compared to existing CMOS technology.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, typical JFETs have limited applicability due to the low forward-bias turn-on voltage, i.e. the diode turn-on voltage, of the p-n junction between the gate and the channel of the JFET. In a typical JFET, the depletion region at the gate-channel interface prevents conduction when the gate potential is sufficiently low. To turn on the JFET, the gate potential is raised, which narrows the depletion region, allowing current to flow between the source and the drain. When the gate potential is raised above the forward bias potential of the p-n junction between the gate and the channel (typically 0.6 to 0.7 volts), current then starts to flow from the gate to the drain. This greatly increases the power consumption of the device. There is a limit, therefore, to the voltage that may be applied to a JFET. As a result, typical prior art JFETs may not be suitable in systems or devices which utilize a high voltage relative to the diode turn-on voltage of the JFET.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it may be advantageous to provide an improved low-power semiconductor device with reduced gate capacitance and faster switching speed compared to existing CMOS technology. Specifically, it may be advantageous to provide a JFET with improved electrical characteristics that address the limitations discussed above.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the present invention relate to JFETs with improved electrical characteristics that address the limitations discussed above, making them more suitable for use in a wide range of semiconductor devices, such as logic devices and memory access devices. Specifically, several embodiments relate to methods and devices for raising the voltage level that may be applied to the gate of a JFET without exceeding the diode turn-on voltage of the p-n junction between the gate and the channel. Several embodiments also relate to systems and devices that include JFETs with improved electrical characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For the sake of clarity, it is noted that in discussing the relationship between deposited materials, the terms &#x201c;over,&#x201d; or &#x201c;above&#x201d; are used to describe materials that are connected but that may, or may not, be in direct contact. By contrast, the term &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; is used to indicate direct contact between the materials described.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Turning now to the drawings, and referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram depicting a processor-based system, generally designated by reference numeral <b>10</b>, is illustrated. The system <b>10</b> may be any of a variety of types such as a computer, pager, cellular phone, personal organizer, control circuit, etc. In a typical processor-based device, one or more processors <b>12</b>, such as a microprocessor, control the processing of system functions and requests in the system <b>10</b>. As will be appreciated, the processor <b>12</b> may include an embedded North or South bridge (not shown), for coupling each of the aforementioned components thereto. Alternatively, the bridges may include separate bridges coupled between the processor <b>12</b> and the various components of the system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The system <b>10</b> typically includes a power supply <b>14</b>. For instance, if the system <b>10</b> is a portable system, the power supply <b>14</b> may advantageously include permanent batteries, replaceable batteries, and/or rechargeable batteries. The power supply <b>14</b> may also include an AC adapter, so the system <b>10</b> may be plugged into a wall outlet, for instance. The power supply <b>14</b> may also include a DC adapter such that the system <b>10</b> may be plugged into a vehicle cigarette lighter, for instance. Various other devices may be coupled to the processor <b>12</b> depending on the functions that the system <b>10</b> performs. For instance, a user interface <b>16</b> may be coupled to the processor <b>12</b>. The user interface <b>16</b> may include buttons, switches, a keyboard, a light pen, a mouse, and/or a voice recognition system, for instance. A display <b>18</b> may also be coupled to the processor <b>12</b>. The display <b>18</b> may include an LCD display, a CRT, LEDs, and/or an audio display, for example. Furthermore, an RF sub-system/baseband processor <b>20</b> may also be coupled to the processor <b>12</b>. The RF sub-system/baseband processor <b>20</b> may include an antenna that is coupled to an RF receiver and to an RF transmitter (not shown). One or more communication ports <b>22</b> may also be coupled to the processor <b>12</b>. The communication port <b>22</b> may be adapted to be coupled to one or more peripheral devices <b>24</b> such as a modem, a printer, a computer, or to a network, such as a local area network, remote area network, intranet, or the Internet, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Because the processor <b>12</b> generally controls the functioning of the system <b>10</b> by implementing software programs, memory is operably coupled to the processor <b>12</b> to store and facilitate execution of various programs. For instance, the processor <b>12</b> may be coupled to the volatile memory <b>26</b> which may include Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and/or Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). The volatile memory <b>26</b> may include a number of memory modules, such as single inline memory modules (SIMMs) or dual inline memory modules (DIMMs). As can be appreciated, the volatile memory <b>26</b> may simply be referred to as the &#x201c;system memory.&#x201d; The volatile memory <b>26</b> is typically quite large so that it can store dynamically loaded applications and data.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The processor <b>12</b> may also be coupled to non-volatile memory <b>28</b>. The non-volatile memory <b>28</b> may include a read-only memory (ROM), such as an EPROM, and/or flash memory to be used in conjunction with the volatile memory. The size of the ROM is typically selected to be just large enough to store any necessary operating system, application programs, and fixed data. Additionally, the non-volatile memory <b>28</b> may include a high capacity memory such as a tape or disk drive memory.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One or more components of the system <b>10</b> may include improved JFETs (depicted herein with reference numeral &#x201c;<b>32</b>&#x201d; for n-type and &#x201c;<b>52</b>&#x201d; for p-type) fabricated in accordance with embodiments described herein. Some examples of devices in which improved JFETs may be beneficial are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a memory device with improved JFETs, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> illustrate integrated circuit logic devices with improved JFETs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref> describe the improved JFETs and methods of fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a partial schematic illustration of an integrated circuit, such as a memory device <b>29</b>, which may be implemented in the volatile memory <b>26</b>, is illustrated. The memory device <b>29</b> includes an array of memory cells having transistors which may be fabricated in accordance with the techniques described herein. In one or more embodiments, the memory device <b>29</b> may comprise a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device. The memory device <b>29</b> includes a number of memory cells <b>30</b> arranged in a grid pattern and comprising a number of rows and columns. The number of memory cells <b>30</b> (and corresponding rows and columns) may vary depending on system requirements and fabrication technology. Each memory cell <b>30</b> includes an access device comprising a JFET <b>32</b> and a storage device comprising a capacitor <b>34</b>. The access device is implemented to provide controlled access to the storage device. The JFET <b>32</b> includes a drain terminal <b>36</b>, a source terminal <b>38</b>, and a gate <b>40</b>. The capacitor <b>34</b> is coupled to the source terminal <b>38</b>. The terminal of the capacitor <b>34</b> that is not coupled to the JFET <b>32</b> may be coupled to a ground plane. As described further below, the drain <b>36</b> is coupled to a bit line (BL) and the gate <b>40</b> is coupled to a word line (WL).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be noted that although the above description depicts the terminal of the access device coupled to the capacitor <b>34</b> as the &#x201c;source&#x201d; <b>38</b> and the other non-gate terminal of the access device as the &#x201c;drain&#x201d; <b>36</b>, during read and write operations, the JFET <b>32</b> may be operated such that each of the terminals <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> operates at one time or another as a source or a drain. Accordingly, for purposes of further discussion it should be recognized that whenever a terminal is identified as a &#x201c;source&#x201d; or a &#x201c;drain,&#x201d; it is only for convenience and that in fact during operation of the JFET <b>32</b> either terminal could be a source or a drain depending on the manner in which the JFET <b>32</b> is being controlled by the voltages applied to the terminals <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>. In addition, it will be appreciated that embodiments of a memory device <b>29</b> may include p-type JFETs, n-type JFETS or a combination of both.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As previously described, the memory array is arranged in a series of rows and columns. To implement the data storage capabilities of a memory cell <b>30</b>, an electrical charge is placed on the drain <b>36</b> of the JFET <b>32</b> via a bit line (BL). By controlling the voltage at the gate <b>40</b> via the word line (WL), the depletion region between the gate <b>40</b> and the channel may be narrowed such that the electrical charge at the drain <b>36</b> can flow to the capacitor <b>34</b>. By storing electrical charge in the capacitor <b>34</b>, the charge may be interpreted as a binary data value in the memory cell <b>30</b>. For instance, for a single-bit storage device, a positive charge above a known threshold voltage stored in the capacitor <b>34</b> may be interpreted as binary &#x201c;1.&#x201d; If the charge in the capacitor <b>34</b> is below the threshold value, a binary value of &#x201c;0 &#x201d; is said to be stored in the memory cell <b>30</b>. For reasons discussed above, it will be appreciated that the voltage at the gate <b>40</b> may be limited to a voltage sufficiently below the diode turn-on voltage of the JFET's gate-channel junction.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The bit lines BL are used to read and write data to and from the memory cells <b>30</b>. The word lines WL are used to activate the JFET <b>32</b> to access a particular row of a memory cell <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the memory device <b>29</b> also includes a periphery portion which may include an address buffer <b>42</b>, row decoder <b>44</b> and column decoder <b>46</b>. The row decoder <b>44</b> and column decoder <b>46</b> selectively access the memory cells <b>30</b> in response to address signals that are provided on the address bus <b>48</b> during read, write and refresh operations. The address signals are typically provided by an external controller such as a microprocessor or another type of memory controller. The column decoder <b>46</b> may also include sense amplifiers and input/output circuitry to further facilitate the transmission of data to and from the memory cell <b>30</b> via the bit lines BL.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one mode of operation, the memory device <b>29</b> receives the address of a particular memory cell <b>30</b> at the address buffer <b>42</b>. The address buffer <b>42</b> identifies one of the word lines WL of the particular memory cell <b>30</b> corresponding to the requested address and passes the address to the row decoder <b>44</b>. The row decoder <b>44</b> selectively activates the particular word line WL to activate the JFET's <b>32</b> of each memory cell <b>30</b> that is connected to the selected word line WL. The column decoder <b>46</b> selects the bit line (or bit lines) BL of the memory cell <b>30</b> corresponding to the requested address. For a write operation, data received by the input/output circuitry is coupled to the selected bit line (or bit lines) BL and provides for the charge or discharge of the capacitor <b>34</b> of the selected memory cell <b>30</b> through the JFET <b>32</b>. The charge corresponds to binary data, as previously described. For a read operation, data stored in the selected memory cell <b>30</b>, represented by the charge stored in the capacitor <b>34</b>, is coupled to the select bit line (or bit lines) BL, amplified by the sense amplifier and a corresponding voltage level is provided to the input/output circuitry in the column decoder <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described below, a memory device <b>29</b> that uses improved JFETs in accordance with certain disclosed embodiments may exhibit superior performance compared to prior art memory devices. For example, memory device <b>29</b> may exhibit increased performance due to the increased switching speed of the improved JFETs <b>32</b>. Furthermore, because the JFET <b>32</b> may be activated by a lower gate voltage compared to typical MOSFET based memory devices, the charge stored on capacitor <b>34</b> may also be reduced, which may reduce leakage current of the capacitor <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition to the memory device <b>29</b>, improved JFETs may also be used in other parts of the system <b>10</b>. For example, JFETs fabricated in accordance with the techniques described herein may be used in the processor(s) <b>12</b>, or any other component of the system <b>10</b> that uses integrated circuit logic devices. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, various embodiments of integrated circuit logic devices that include improved JFETs are depicted. Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an embodiment of a JFET inverter <b>50</b> is shown. The JFET inverter <b>50</b> includes a p-type JFET <b>52</b> and an n-type JFET <b>32</b> coupled in series between a high voltage terminal <b>54</b> and a low voltage terminal <b>56</b>. It will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the output terminal <b>58</b> will be electrically coupled to the high voltage terminal <b>54</b> when the input terminal <b>60</b> is low and will be electrically coupled to the low voltage terminal <b>56</b> when the input terminal <b>60</b> is high.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts an embodiment of a JFET NAND gate <b>64</b>. The JFET NAND gate <b>64</b> includes two p-type JFETs <b>52</b> and two n-type JFETs <b>32</b> coupled between a high voltage terminal <b>54</b> and a low voltage terminal <b>56</b> as shown. It will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the output terminal <b>66</b> will be electrically coupled to the high voltage terminal <b>54</b> when either of input terminal <b>68</b> or <b>70</b> is low and will be electrically coupled to the low voltage terminal <b>56</b> when both input terminals <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> are high.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts an embodiment of a JFET NOR gate <b>72</b>. The JFET NOR gate <b>72</b> includes two p-type JFETs <b>52</b> and two n-type JFETs <b>32</b> coupled between a high voltage terminal <b>54</b> and a low voltage terminal <b>56</b> as shown. It will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the output terminal <b>74</b> will be electrically coupled to the high voltage terminal <b>54</b> when both input terminals <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> are low and will be electrically coupled to the low voltage terminal <b>56</b> when either of input terminals <b>76</b> or <b>78</b> is high.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With regard to the logic devices <b>50</b>, <b>64</b>, and <b>72</b> discussed above, the voltage level applied to the gates <b>40</b> and <b>62</b> of the JFETs <b>32</b> and <b>52</b> may be kept below the diode turn-on voltage of the gate-channel junction to avoid excessive gate-to-drain current and the resulting power dissipation. To increase the voltage that may be applied to the JFET gates <b>40</b> and <b>62</b> without causing gate-to-drain current, the JFETs <b>32</b> and <b>52</b> may be fabricated in accordance with one or more embodiments that will be discussed below. It will be appreciated that the integrated circuit logic devices depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> are examples only and many other JFET logic devices are possible, utilizing improved JFETs in accordance with disclosed embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, embodiments of improved JFETs are depicted. Generally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> depict JFETs with improved gate structures that allow the JFETs to be coupled to a higher gate voltage without exceeding the diode turn-on voltage of the gate-channel junction. In this way, the improved JFET will be less susceptible to the excessive power loss associated with exceeding the diode turn-on voltage of the gate-channel junction. By improving the performance of the JFET in this way, the improved JFETs may be used in a greater variety of semiconductor devices, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> depict an n-type, i.e. n-channel, JFET <b>32</b> with a gate structure having doped and undoped portions in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. For example, as described further below, the gate structure may include an intrinsic material sandwiched between a p-type and an n-type material to provide a p-i-n (PIN) gate. It will be appreciated that an n-type JFET <b>32</b> is described for convenience only, and that embodiments of the present invention also include p-type, i.e. p-channel, JFETs. Therefore, it will be understood that the term &#x201c;PIN&#x201d; is not intended to refer to a particular ordering of the p-type and n-type materials. Furthermore, the JFET <b>32</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> may be fabricated in any semiconductor material, such as the silicon substrate <b>79</b>, or, alternatively, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the JFET <b>32</b> may be fabricated on top of a p-type material <b>80</b>. Accordingly, the silicon substrate <b>79</b> may be a p-type substrate, or, alternatively, a p-type material <b>80</b> may be formed by creating a p-type well in the substrate <b>79</b>. The p-type material <b>80</b> may also be electrically coupled to the gate terminal <b>40</b> via a terminal (not shown) that is directly coupled to the p-type material <b>80</b>. In alternative embodiments, the JFET <b>32</b> may not include the underlying p-type material <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Above the p-type material <b>80</b>, the n-type JFET <b>32</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> may also include a semiconductor material <b>82</b>, which is n-doped and forms a channel region between the source terminal <b>36</b> and the drain terminal <b>38</b>. In addition, the JFET <b>32</b> may include an n-type source region <b>84</b> and an n-type drain region <b>86</b>, which may optionally be heavily doped in order to provide a low resistance between the source and drain electrodes <b>88</b> and <b>90</b> and the channel region. In some embodiments, the JFET <b>32</b> may also include lightly doped drain (LDD) regions. Spacer oxides <b>92</b> may also be included to separate the source and drain electrodes <b>88</b> and <b>90</b> from the gate structure. Also included in the JFET <b>32</b> is a gate contact <b>100</b>, which may be formed of any suitable metal or polysilicon conductor and facilitates the electrical connection between the top material <b>98</b> of the gate and the gate terminal <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Turning specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a JFET <b>32</b> with a three-layer PIN gate in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is depicted. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the PIN gate may be a stack of three semiconductor materials, which may include any semiconductor material, such as silicon, silicon carbide, germanium, carbon-implanted silicon, silicon-germanium heterostructures or a combination thereof. The bottom material <b>94</b> of the PIN gate is n-doped and located directly on the semiconductor substrate <b>79</b> over the channel region formed in the semiconductor material <b>82</b>. Above the bottom material <b>94</b> is an intrinsic material <b>96</b>. Above the intrinsic material <b>96</b> is a p-doped top material <b>98</b>. Thus, the gate structure essentially forms a PIN diode disposed directly on the channel region.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In certain embodiments, both the bottom material <b>94</b> and the top material <b>98</b> may be approximately 500 to 700 angstroms thick and doped at a level of approximately 1e17 to 1e20 atoms per cubic centimeter. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the bottom material <b>94</b> is n-doped and the top material <b>98</b> is p-doped, however, in embodiments in which the channel is p-doped, the bottom material <b>94</b> is also p-doped and the top material <b>98</b> is n-doped. The intrinsic material <b>96</b> may be approximately 50 to 200 angstroms thick and may be undoped or lightly doped. It will be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the term &#x201c;intrinsic&#x201d; may be used to describe a semiconductor that is undoped or lightly doped. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the intrinsic material <b>96</b> may be silicon implanted with carbon. Implanting the silicon with carbon increases the bandgap of the intrinsic material <b>96</b>, and may therefore increase the diode turn-on voltage of the JFET <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The advantage of forming a PIN gate as described above is that the diode turn-on voltage of the JFET <b>32</b> may be increased. In some embodiments, the diode turn-on voltage may be increased up to approximately 0.5 to 2.0 volts higher than JFETs that use conventional gate structures. This may allow for the use of n-JFETs and p-JFETs in logic devices and/or memory devices, such as those described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, with the advantage of significantly reduced gate capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, the diode turn-on voltage of the JFET <b>32</b> may be manipulated by controlling the thicknesses and doping levels of the three PIN gate materials <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>. For example, the diode turn-on voltage may be increased by increasing the thickness of the intrinsic material <b>96</b>. Other characteristics of the JFET may also be manipulated. For example, the doping level of the bottom material <b>94</b> may be controlled so that the depletion layer may extend completely through the conductive channel in the semiconductor material <b>82</b> when the JFET <b>32</b> is switched off. For another example, the top material <b>98</b> may be heavily doped to provide good contact characteristics with the gate contact <b>100</b> and to increase the depth of penetration of the depletion region into the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the doping levels of the bottom material <b>94</b> and top material <b>98</b> may be kept low to avoid excessive diffusion of the dopants into the intrinsic material <b>96</b>. In addition to keeping the dopant levels low, diffusion of dopants into the intrinsic material <b>96</b> may also be avoided by including thin insulators between the materials, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a JFET <b>32</b> with a three-layer PIN gate in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is depicted. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, one or more embodiments may also include a first protective material <b>102</b>, located between the bottom material <b>94</b> and the intrinsic material <b>96</b>, and a second protective material <b>104</b>, located between the intrinsic material <b>96</b> and the top material <b>98</b>. The protective materials <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may include a native oxide or may include other dielectric materials such as hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide and titanium dioxide. The thickness of the protective materials <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may be in the range of approximately five to twenty angstroms. Although the protective materials <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are made of electrically insulative material, the protective materials <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are thin enough that the PIN gate materials <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, and <b>98</b> are strongly coupled electrostatically. Therefore, the protective materials <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may not significantly decrease the conductivity of the PIN gate structure. However, the protective materials <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may prevent the passage of n-type and p-type dopants present in the bottom material <b>94</b> and the top material <b>98</b>. In this way, the dopants may be prevented from diffusing into the intrinsic material <b>96</b> during certain high-temperature processes typically used in semiconductor device fabrication. In alternative embodiments, the gate structure of the JFET <b>32</b> may include either the first protective material <b>102</b> or the second protective material <b>104</b>, but not both.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, another embodiment of a PIN gate in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is depicted. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the diode turn-on voltage of the JFET <b>32</b> may be further increased by forming the intrinsic material <b>96</b> with a silicon-germanium heterostructure. The silicon-germanium heterostructure may be formed from alternating formations of intrinsic germanium <b>106</b>, <b>110</b> and intrinsic silicon <b>108</b>, <b>112</b>. Although four formations are depicted, embodiments may include any number of formations and may include a number of silicon formations unequal to the number of germanium formations. Each formation <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> may be a monolayer approximately 10 angstroms thick.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Because the germanium and silicon exhibit different bandgaps, a barrier height will exist at the boundary between the silicon formations <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> and the germanium formations <b>106</b>, <b>110</b>. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the &#x201c;barrier height&#x201d; represents an amount of energy that a charge carrier must obtain to move from one material to another. The increased barrier height may, therefore, increase the diode turn-on voltage of the gate-channel junction.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a JFET <b>32</b> with a two-layer PIN gate in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is depicted. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the intrinsic material <b>96</b> may be located directly on the channel region and may be approximately 50 to 200 angstroms thick. As before, the top material <b>98</b> is p-doped and located over the intrinsic material <b>96</b>, however, unlike the previously described embodiments the bottom material <b>94</b> is eliminated. Nevertheless, the gate structure still resembles a PIN diode, with the n-type channel essentially taking the place of the n-type bottom material <b>94</b>. In some embodiments, a protective material may also be included between the top material <b>98</b> and the intrinsic material <b>96</b>, as described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a process for fabricating an improved JFET <b>32</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is shown. The process <b>114</b> may be used to fabricate individual JFETs, JFET arrays, or complementary JFET devices such as those described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The process <b>114</b> starts with bulk semiconductor substrate <b>79</b> or silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, which is processed at step <b>116</b> to form an active area and isolation regions using conventional lithography, oxidation and dopant implantation processes. At step <b>116</b>, p-doped and/or n-doped wells may be formed for the creation of n-type and/or p-type JFETs, respectively. In addition, a triple well may optionally be formed to provide increased isolation for the JFET device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next at step <b>118</b>, the threshold voltage of the device is adjusted by doping the active region of the JFET in accordance with techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. After adjusting the threshold voltage at step <b>118</b>, the process <b>114</b> may advance to step <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step <b>120</b>, the bottom material <b>94</b> of the PIN gate stack is formed directly on the substrate <b>79</b> over the channel region. The bottom material <b>94</b> may be formed of any suitable semiconductor material, such as silicon. The bottom material <b>94</b> may be deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or grown epitaxially via atomic layer deposition (ALD) to a thickness of approximately 500 to 700 angstroms. After depositing the bottom material <b>94</b>, the bottom material <b>94</b> is doped to a level of approximately 1e17 to 1e20 atoms per cubic centimeter. For an n-type JFET, the bottom material <b>94</b> is doped n-type, and for a p-type JFET, the bottom material <b>94</b> is doped p-type. Alternatively, the bottom material may be omitted or may be a part of the substrate <b>79</b>, as described and illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At step <b>122</b>, the first protective material <b>102</b> may be formed over the bottom material <b>94</b>. The first protective material <b>102</b> may be formed by growing a native oxide, or depositing a high dielectric constant dielectric material such as hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide and titanium dioxide through one or more ALD cycles. The first protective material <b>102</b> may be formed to a thickness in the range of approximately five to twenty angstroms. As described above, the formation of the first protective material <b>102</b> may be omitted in certain embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, at step <b>124</b>, the intrinsic material <b>96</b> may be formed over the first protective material <b>102</b> or the underlying bottom material <b>94</b> to a thickness of approximately 50 to 200 angstroms. The instrinsic material <b>96</b> may be deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or grown epitaxially. As described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the intrinsic material <b>96</b> may be formed of silicon and may also be implanted with carbon. Therefore, after depositing the intrinsic material <b>96</b>, carbon may be implanted at a dose of 1.0e16 atoms per cubic centimeter with an implant energy of approximately 1 to 5 keV.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, as described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the intrinsic material <b>96</b> may also be a heterostructure. Therefore, the intrinsic material <b>96</b> may be formed by depositing alternating monolayers of germanium and silicon. The process may begin by depositing either germanium or silicon over the first protective material <b>102</b> or, if the first protective material <b>102</b> is omitted, the underlying bottom material <b>94</b>. Each material may be formed to a thickness of approximately ten angstroms and may be formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or grown epitaxially.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, at step <b>126</b>, the second protective material <b>104</b> may be formed over the intrinsic material <b>96</b>. As with the first protective material <b>102</b>, the second protective material <b>104</b> may be formed to a thickness of approximately ten angstroms by growing a native oxide, or depositing a high dielectric constant dielectric material via ALD or may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, at step <b>128</b>, the top material <b>98</b> of the PIN gate stack may be formed over the second protective material <b>104</b> or the underlying intrinsic material <b>96</b>. As with the bottom material <b>94</b>, the top material <b>98</b> may be formed of any suitable semiconductor material, such as silicon and deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or grown epitaxially via atomic layer deposition (ALD) to a thickness of approximately 500 to 700 angstroms. After depositing the top material <b>98</b>, the top material <b>98</b> may be doped to a level of approximately 1e17 to 1e20 atoms per cubic centimeter. For an n-type JFET, the top material <b>98</b> will be doped p-type, and for a p-type JFET, the top material <b>98</b> will be doped n-type.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, at step <b>130</b> the PIN gate dopants are activated by annealing at a temperature in the range of 1000 degrees Celcius for a time period of approximately 5 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">After finishing the steps described above, the gate structure will be substantially complete. The process <b>114</b> will then advance to step <b>132</b>, in which a gate contact material is formed over the top material <b>98</b> of the PIN gate stack with a thickness of approximately 200 to 1000 angstroms to form the gate contact <b>100</b>. The gate contact material may include any suitable metal, such as tungsten, nickel, titanium, tantalum, or cobalt, and may be formed by any method known in the art for depositing metal on semiconductor, such as CVD, physical vapor deposition (PVD), or sputtering for example. In one or more embodiments, the gate contact material may include a metal silicide, such as tungsten silicide, nickel silicide, titanium silicide, tantalum silicide, or cobalt silicide, and may be formed by growing or depositing polysilicon by CVD or low pressure CVD and doping the polysilicon through a process such as diffusion doping or ion implantation. After depositing the gate contact material, the gate contact <b>100</b> may be patterned using known photolithography techniques and formed using known etching techniques. In some embodiments, such as when the gate itself is metal, the step of forming a gate contact <b>100</b> over the gate may be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, at step <b>134</b>, the source and drain regions are formed using a technique such as gate-self-aligned implantation to create source and drain extension regions known as lightly-doped-drain (LDD) regions. The source and drain regions may be doped with any suitable dopants, such as boron, BF<sub>2</sub>, or indium for p-type doping, or arsenic, phosphorous, or antimony for n-type doping. Dopants may be implanted with a dose in the range of 1e13 to 1e15 atoms per cubic centimeter and an implant energy in the range of 5 to 30 keV. In some embodiments, the implantation may optionally be accomplished through plasma assisted doping (PLAD).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, at step <b>136</b>, the spacers <b>92</b> may be formed. To form the spacers <b>92</b> an oxide, nitride or other dielectric material or combination of materials may be formed over the top and sides of the gate stack. After depositing the spacer material, the spacers <b>92</b> are formed on the sides of the gate to a thickness of approximately 100 to 500 angstroms using photolithography and etching techniques known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, at step <b>138</b> the source and drain regions <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> may be implanted to form heavily doped n+ or p+ source and drain regions. The source and drain regions may be doped with any suitable dopants, such as boron, BF<sub>2</sub>, or decaborane for p-type doping, or arsenic or phosphorous for n-type doping. Dopants may be implanted with a dose in the range of 1e15 to 1e16 atoms per cubic centimeter and an implant energy in the range of 0.5 to 10 keV.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, at step <b>140</b> the dopants implanted in previous steps are activated. First, a dielectric material, such as an oxide, nitride or combination is deposited to cap the active area. Then, the dopants are activated by an rapid thermal anneal or laser anneal. For example, the anneal may occur at 1000 to 1100 degrees Celsius and last for 2 to 10 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Finally, at step <b>142</b>, all of the remaining contacts and interconnects may be formed in accordance with processes that are well known in the art. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize process variations that may be implemented while still remaining within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the advantages of forming a JFET in accordance with the process described above. Specifically, by forming a gate that includes a PIN gate stack, the diode turn-on voltage of the JFET may be increased. Therefore, unlike prior art, the presently described embodiments may operate under a larger operating voltage compared to conventional JFETs while still maintaining a low gate current. Consequently, this may allow the use of JFETs in a wider range of electronic devices, such as the logic devices and memory storage devices described above.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">While the invention may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and have been described in detail herein. However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following appended claims.</p>
