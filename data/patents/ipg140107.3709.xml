<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a radar apparatus that detects at least a direction in which a target is present and an antenna device suitably used in the radar apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the past, a radar apparatus that transmits and receives a continuous wave (a radar wave) to detect a target is mounted on an automobile. In the radar apparatus of this type (a vehicle-mounted radar apparatus), to detect a direction in which a target (e.g., a roadside object such as a guardrail or a leading vehicle) is present and accurately specify a position of the target, an array antenna configured by arranging a plurality of antenna elements at equal intervals specified in advance is used as a reception antenna (see, for example, Patent Literature 1).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading>

<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H08-181537</li>
</ul>
</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Compared with a distance to a vehicle, which is one of detection targets, the traveling speed of the vehicle is high. Therefore, the vehicle-mounted radar apparatus needs to detect the direction of a target present in a position away from the vehicle (e.g., about 100 meters to 200 meters). The antenna elements are arranged to make it possible to narrow down beam width, i.e., sharpen a main lobe of the array antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, in a general vehicle-mounted radar apparatus, an angle range where a direction in which a target is present can be detected is narrowed (although this angle range is narrow, a detection area in which a target present in a position away from a vehicle can be detected is hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;normal detection area&#x201d;). It is difficult to detect at an early stage another vehicle that cuts in front of the own vehicle from a side.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Specifically, the conventional vehicle-mounted radar apparatus is required to have an ability for detecting, while maintaining a state in which a target present in a position away from a vehicle can be detected (i.e., while maintaining a detection ability in the normal detection area), the direction of the target in a wider angle range (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;wide angle range&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, to enable detection of a direction in the wide angle range in addition to the normal direction area, for example, it is conceivable to adopt a method of using a reception antenna including a first array antenna in which a plurality of antenna elements are arranged at a first arrangement interval and a second array antenna in which a plurality of antenna elements are arranged at a second arrangement interval set narrower than the first arrangement interval. Actually, if this method is used, it is possible to detect a direction in the wide angle range in addition to the normal detection area.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in this method, there is a problem in that the area of the reception antenna is large and cost increases. In particular, in the vehicle-mounted radar apparatus, limitation on a setting place are extremely large. Therefore, it is difficult to increase the area of the reception antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been devised in view of the above and it is an object of the present invention to provide a radar apparatus that can detect, in a wider angle range in addition to the normal detection area, a direction in which a target is present without increasing the area of the reception antenna and an antenna device that can be applied to the radar apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to solve above-mentioned problems and to achieve the object, a radar apparatus according to the present invention includes a transmitting unit that generates a probe wave including a continuous wave, an antenna unit including a transmission antenna that radiates the probe wave to a space and a reception antenna that receives a reflected wave from a target of the probe wave, a receiving unit that outputs a signal obtained by down-converting a reception signal from the reception antenna into a predetermined frequency band, and a signal processing unit that applies a predetermined frequency analysis to the signal output from the receiving unit and outputs information concerning one or more of a distance to the target, a relative speed to the target, and a direction in which the target is present, wherein when a detection area of the target is classified into a first detection area that is an area at a distance closer than a set distance set in advance and at an angle wider than a set angle set in advance and a second detection area that is an area at a distance farther than the set distance and on an inner side of the set angle, the reception antenna includes a plurality of antennas for reception as array antennas and, in the reception antenna, a reception first array that probes the first detection area using a predetermined number of antennas adjacent to one another among the plurality of antennas for reception and a reception second array that probes the second detection area using all the antennas are configured, the transmission antenna is shared as an antenna for probe of the first and second detection areas, second null of a radiation pattern by the transmission antenna and first null of a reception pattern by the reception second array are substantially matched, and a level difference between a first side lobe of the radiation pattern of the transmission antenna and first null of the radiation pattern is within a predetermined value.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With the radar apparatus according to the present invention, there is an effect that it is possible to provide a radar apparatus that can detect, in a wider angle range in addition to the normal detection area, a direction in which a target is present without increasing the area of the reception antenna.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a functional configuration of a radar apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the radar apparatus according to this embodiment is a radar apparatus of an FM-CW system and includes an antenna unit <b>10</b>, a transmitting unit <b>20</b>, a local signal (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;LO signal&#x201d;) amplifying unit <b>30</b>, a receiving unit <b>40</b>, and a signal processing unit <b>50</b>. The transmitting unit <b>20</b>, the LO-signal amplifying unit <b>30</b>, and the receiving unit <b>40</b> configure a transmission and reception circuit unit. The antenna unit <b>10</b> is arranged in a pre-stage section of this transmission and reception circuit. The signal processing unit <b>50</b> is arranged in a post-stage section of the transmission and reception circuit unit.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Details of the components of the radar apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are explained. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the antenna unit <b>10</b> includes a transmission antenna <b>12</b> that forms a transmission channel (CH) of an antenna system and a reception antenna <b>14</b> that forms a reception channel group (CH<b>1</b>, CH<b>2</b>, . . . , and CH<b>8</b>) of the antenna system. The reception channel CH<b>1</b> is formed by antennas <b>14</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>14</b><sub>2</sub>, the reception channel CH<b>2</b> is formed by antennas <b>14</b><sub>3 </sub>and <b>14</b><sub>4</sub>, the reception channel CH<b>3</b> is formed by antennas <b>14</b><sub>9 </sub>and <b>14</b><sub>10</sub>, and the reception channel CH<b>4</b> is formed by antennas <b>14</b><sub>11 </sub>and <b>14</b><sub>12</sub>. On the other hand, the reception channels CH<b>5</b> to CH<b>8</b> are respectively formed by antennas <b>14</b><sub>5 </sub>to <b>14</b><sub>8</sub>. However, the configuration of the antenna unit <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows only an example of the configuration and is not limited to those components. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the transmission antenna <b>12</b> and the antennas <b>14</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>14</b><sub>12 </sub>included in the reception antenna <b>14</b> does not need to be a single antenna and can be an array antenna including a plurality of antenna elements.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The transmitting unit <b>20</b> includes an oscillator <b>21</b> that outputs a predetermined modulation signal necessary for the radar apparatus, an amplifier <b>22</b> that amplifies the output of the oscillator <b>21</b>, a distributor <b>23</b> that distributes an output of the amplifier <b>22</b>, and an amplifier <b>24</b> that has an output terminal connected to the transmission antenna <b>12</b> and amplifies an output of the distributor <b>23</b>. The amplifier <b>24</b> is, for example, a high-frequency amplifier (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a multiplying-by-two amplifier is shown) having a frequency multiplying function. If the high-frequency amplifier having the frequency multiplying function is used, a design frequency of the transmission and reception circuit unit can be reduced to, for example, a half (in the case of the multiplying-by-two amplifier) with respect to the frequency of a probe wave (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;radar wave&#x201d;) radiated to the space through the transmission antenna <b>12</b>. Therefore, there is an advantage that it is easy to design the transmission and reception circuit unit.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The LO-signal amplifying unit <b>30</b> includes an amplifier <b>32</b> that amplifies an LO signal supplied via the distributor <b>23</b> of the transmitting unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The receiving unit <b>40</b> includes a mixer <b>42</b> that is connected to the reception antenna <b>14</b> and down-converts a reception signal of the reception antenna <b>14</b> based on the LO signal input via the distributor <b>23</b> of the transmitting unit <b>20</b>. The mixer <b>42</b> is configured to be provided for each of the reception channels. The receiving unit <b>40</b> also includes an LO-signal distribution circuit <b>44</b>, which is a supply (distribution) circuit for an LO signal to the mixer <b>42</b>. An arrangement position of the mixer <b>42</b> on signal lines <b>46</b> that connect the antenna unit <b>10</b> and the signal processing unit <b>50</b> is adjusted to set supply path length for the LO signal to the mixer <b>42</b> (the LO signal is equivalent to L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, . . . ) and supply path length for an RF signal to the mixer <b>42</b> (the RF signal is equivalent to D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, . . . ) to an equal distance among the reception channels (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;line length equalization for the reception channels&#x201d; when necessary).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The concept of the line length equalization for the reception channels is explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, signal electric lengths between mixers <b>42</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>42</b><sub>2 </sub>and the amplifier <b>32</b> of the LO-signal amplifying unit <b>30</b> are respectively represented as L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> and signal electric lengths between mixers <b>42</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>42</b><sub>2 </sub>and reception antennas corresponding to the reception channels CH<b>1</b> and CH<b>2</b> are respectively represented as D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>. The mixers <b>42</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>42</b><sub>2 </sub>are arranged to satisfy a relation of &#x201c;L<b>1</b>=L<b>2</b>&#x201d; with respect to the LO signal and satisfy a relation of &#x201c;D<b>1</b>=D<b>2</b>&#x201d; with respect to the RF signal. The same holds true concerning the other mixers. If the mixers are arranged based on such a concept of the line length equalization, it is possible to reduce a gain deviation and an amplitude deviation among the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the signal lines <b>46</b> that transmit signals from the reception channels CH<b>5</b> to CH<b>8</b> are arranged in the center. The signal lines <b>46</b> that transmit signals from the reception channels CH<b>1</b> and CH<b>2</b> and the reception channels CH<b>3</b> and CH<b>4</b> are arranged on both sides. However, the signal lines <b>46</b> are not always limited to this configuration. However, when the signal lines <b>46</b> are configured as shown in the figure, the reception channels CH<b>1</b> and CH<b>2</b> and the reception channels CH<b>3</b> and CH<b>4</b> are symmetrically formed and, on the other hand, a phase relation concerning reception signals is opposite with respect to the reception channels CH<b>5</b> to CH<b>8</b>. Therefore, when signals of the reception channels CH<b>1</b> and CH<b>2</b> and the reception channels CH<b>3</b> and CH<b>4</b> leak into the reception channels CH<b>5</b> to CH<b>8</b>, the reception channels act to cancel the leak signals. Therefore, as shown in the figure, it is desirable to arrange the reception channels CH<b>5</b> to CH<b>8</b> in the center and arrange the reception channels CH<b>1</b> and CH<b>2</b> and the reception channels CH <b>3</b> and CH<b>4</b> on both the sides.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The signal processing unit <b>50</b> includes a video amplifier (AMP) <b>51</b> that is connected to the mixer <b>42</b> and amplifies a signal after down-convert, a multiplexer (MUX) <b>52</b> that sequentially switches signals corresponding to the reception channels passed through the video amplifier <b>51</b> and outputs the signals to an AD converter <b>53</b>, the AD converter (ADC) <b>53</b> that analog-digital converts an output of the multiplexer <b>52</b>, and a microcomputer <b>54</b> that generates, based on an output of the AD converter <b>53</b>, one or more kinds of information concerning a target and outputs the information. The video amplifier <b>51</b> includes amplification circuits <b>56</b> (<b>56</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>56</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . ) that amplify signals down-converted by the mixer <b>42</b> and filters <b>58</b> (<b>58</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>58</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . ) that apply band width limitation to output signals of the amplification circuits <b>56</b> and output the signals to the multiplexer <b>52</b>. The microcomputer <b>54</b> includes, in addition to basic elements such as a ROM, a RAM, and a CPU, processing means (e.g., DSP) that can execute fast Fourier transform (FFT) processing or the like on data captured via the AD converter <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram. For example, a component such as a filter inserted between the mixer <b>42</b> of the receiving unit <b>40</b> and the video amplifier <b>51</b> of the signal processing unit <b>50</b> and a component such as a control circuit (Application Specific Integrated Circuit: ASIC) that is inserted between the microcomputer <b>54</b> and the oscillator <b>21</b> and performs control of the oscillator <b>21</b> are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the video amplifier <b>51</b>, the multiplexer <b>52</b>, and the AD converter <b>53</b> are provided in the signal processing unit <b>50</b>. However, one of the video amplifier <b>51</b>, the multiplexer <b>52</b>, and the AD converter <b>53</b> can be removed from the signal processing unit <b>50</b> and provided in the receiving unit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A schematic operation of the radar apparatus configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A high-frequency signal in a millimeter wave band or a microwave band generated by the oscillator <b>21</b> and amplified by the amplifier <b>22</b> is distributed by the distributor <b>23</b> and input to the amplifier <b>24</b> and the amplifier <b>32</b> of the LO-signal amplifying unit. The amplifier <b>24</b> generates a transmission signal using the high-frequency signal from the distributor <b>23</b> and transmits the transmission signal as a radar wave via the transmission antenna <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The radar wave (i.e., a reflected wave) transmitted from the transmission antenna <b>12</b> and reflected by a target is received by the reception antenna <b>14</b> and input to the mixer <b>42</b>. The respective mixers <b>42</b> provided for the respective reception channels mix an LO signal from the amplifier <b>32</b> in a reception signal input from the reception antenna <b>14</b> to thereby generate beat signals. The beat signals are input to the video amplifier <b>51</b> in parallel for the respective reception channels, amplified and band-limited by the video amplifier <b>51</b>, sequentially switched by the multiplexer <b>52</b>, sampled by the A/D converter <b>53</b>, and input to the microcomputer <b>54</b>. The A/D converter <b>53</b> executes sampling processing on a combined output of predetermined channels selected out of the reception channels CH<b>1</b> to CH<b>8</b> during one modulation period of the radar wave, i.e., for each of an uplink section and a downlink section of the radar wave. The microcomputer <b>54</b> calculates, using sampling data from the A/D converter <b>53</b>, for example, direction information of the target, relative distance information between an own vehicle and the target, and relative speed information of the own vehicle and the target and outputs the information to a not-shown vehicle controller or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of an overview of an antenna board in the radar apparatus according to this embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plurality of antenna elements (patch antennas) formed in a rectangular shape are arranged in a predetermined pattern on an antenna board <b>64</b>. These antenna elements are connected by not-shown strip lines. The strip lines are led to be combined at power feeding points of a transmission antenna and a reception antenna not shown in the figure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the shape of the antenna elements is the rectangular shape. However, antenna elements having an arbitrary shape such as a polygonal shape, a circular shape or an elliptical shape can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">On the antenna board <b>64</b> in this embodiment, antenna element groups (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;linear arrays&#x201d;) arranged at equal intervals in the vertical direction with respect to the space (a first direction: an up-down direction on the paper surface) are arranged at a predetermined interval (in the example shown in the figure, 0.7&#x3bb;: &#x3bb; is the wavelength of a transmission signal) in the horizontal direction (a second direction: a left-right direction on the paper surface). Among these linear arrays, four rows on the right side on the paper surface form transmission channels and the remaining twelve rows form reception channels (a reception channel group). Among the linear arrays forming the reception channel group, linear arrays of four rows in the center form reception channels CH<b>5</b> to CH<b>8</b> in the reception channel group with each one row set as a channel unit. On the other hand, linear arrays of eight rows on both sides (four rows on one side) among the linear arrays forming the reception channel group form reception channels CH<b>1</b> to CH<b>4</b> in the reception channel group with two rows set as a channel unit. In other words, outputs of linear arrays of two rows on the most left side on the paper surface are two-arrays-combined and form the reception channel CH<b>1</b>. Outputs of linear arrays of two rows adjacent to the reception channel CH<b>1</b> (linear arrays between the reception channels CH<b>1</b> and CH<b>5</b>) are two-arrays-combined and form the reception channel CH<b>2</b>. Outputs of linear arrays of two rows adjacent to the right side of the reception channel CH<b>8</b> are two-arrays-combined and form the reception channel CH<b>3</b>. Outputs of linear arrays of two rows adjacent to the right side of the reception channel CH<b>3</b> are two-arrays-combined and form the reception channel CH<b>4</b>. The combination of the two arrays in the reception channels CH<b>1</b> to CH<b>4</b> is realized on the antenna board <b>64</b>. The combination of the two arrays are realized on the antenna board <b>64</b>, whereby it is easy to connect the antenna board <b>64</b> and a transmitting unit circuit board and a receiving unit circuit board described later. In particular, a hole of a waveguide structure (a waveguide hole explained later) is necessary for the connection of the transmitting unit circuit board and the receiving unit circuit board. Therefore, the combination of the two arrays is realized on the antenna board <b>64</b>, whereby there is an advantage that it is unnecessary to provide a plurality of waveguide holes.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as an example of this embodiment, an element interval in the horizontal direction is shown as 0.7&#x3bb;. However, the element interval does not need to be 0.7&#x3bb;. An increase in the element interval is advantageous in terms of a gain. However, because the position of first null shifts to the inner side (a 0&#xb0; direction) and affects a detection distance in the front direction. Therefore, an excessively wide element interval is undesirable. Conversely, if the element interval is reduced, an antenna aperture area decreases and an antenna gain decreases. In particular, if the element interval is reduced to be equal to or smaller than 0.5&#x3bb;, because null due to an array factor does not occur, there is an advantage that it is unnecessary to perform null filling. However, because an antenna gain in the front direction is small and an increase in the number of antenna elements is inevitable, an excessively narrow element interval is undesirable. Therefore, the element interval in the horizontal direction is desirably in a range of &#xb1;20% (0.56&#x3bb; to 0.84&#x3bb;) with respect to 0.7&#x3bb; set as a reference and is more desirably in a range of &#xb1;10% (0.63&#x3bb; to 0.77&#x3bb;).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the reception channels configured as explained above, in the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, an array configuration for combining signals using the reception channels CH<b>5</b> to CH<b>8</b> (first reception channels) is defined as a reception first array and an array configuration for combining signals using all the reception channels CH<b>1</b> to CH<b>8</b> (second reception channels) is defined as a reception second array. As explained in detail later, in the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, processing for detecting, at a wide angle, a target at a near distance (e.g., within 10 meters) or an intermediate distance (e.g., within 60 meters) (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;wide angle middle detection processing&#x201d; or abbreviated as &#x201c;wide angle middle&#x201d;) and processing for detecting a target at a far distance (e.g., 60 meters or more) (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;long detection processing&#x201d; or abbreviated as &#x201c;long&#x201d;) are defined. The reception first array is used in the wide angle middle detection processing. The reception second array is used in the long detection processing. In other words, an antenna device applied to the radar apparatus according to this embodiment configures an array antenna for both far and near distances and is configured to switch and use two reception patterns for reception according to a detection distance of a target and share and use a part of an array antenna irrespective of a detection distance of a target.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the reception second array is used, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> combines outputs of the reception channels CH<b>5</b> and CH<b>6</b> through analog signal processing or digital signal processing (for convenience of explanation, a combined reception channel is referred to as reception channel CH<b>9</b>) to configure linear arrays in two rows including an antenna <b>14</b><sub>5 </sub>and an antenna <b>14</b><sub>6</sub>. The signal processing unit <b>50</b> combines outputs of the reception channels CH<b>7</b> and CH<b>8</b> (for convenience of explanation, a combined reception channel is referred to as reception channel CH<b>10</b>) to configure linear arrays in two rows including an antenna <b>14</b><sub>7 </sub>and an antenna <b>14</b><sub>8</sub>. In other words, the reception second array is configured using signals of six reception channels, i.e., CH<b>1</b>, CH<b>2</b>, CH<b>9</b>, CH<b>10</b>, CH<b>3</b>, and CH<b>4</b> formed by linear arrays obtained by combining outputs of two antennas. The signal processing unit <b>50</b> performs the long detection processing by frequency analysis explained later using reception signals (beat signals) from the combined six reception channels.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of a sectional structure of the radar apparatus according to this embodiment. Specifically, an example of a sectional structure including an antenna unit, a transmitting unit, an LO-signal amplifying unit, and a receiving unit mounted on a circuit board is shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the antenna board (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) on which the transmission antenna and the reception antenna are formed is bonded to a motherboard <b>62</b> using, for example, an adhesive <b>88</b>. On the bonded motherboard <b>62</b>, when the antenna board <b>64</b> side is set on the lower surface side, the transmitting unit <b>20</b>, the LO-signal amplifying unit <b>30</b>, and the receiving unit <b>40</b> are joined and arranged via BGA balls (solder balls) <b>76</b> on the upper surface side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the transmitting unit <b>20</b>, components (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the amplifier <b>24</b> is shown) included in the transmitting unit <b>20</b> is arranged on the upper side of a transmitting unit circuit board <b>66</b>. In the LO-signal amplifying unit <b>30</b>, the amplifier <b>32</b> included in the LO-signal amplifying unit <b>30</b> is arranged on the upper side of an LO-signal amplifying unit circuit board <b>68</b>. In the transmitting unit circuit board <b>66</b> and the LO-signal-amplifying unit circuit board <b>68</b>, lids <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> are respectively provided to cover the components of the transmitting unit <b>20</b> and the LO-signal amplifying unit <b>30</b>. The lids <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> enable hermetical sealing of high-frequency circuit components and suppression of emission and incidence of unnecessary high-frequency signals.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the receiving unit <b>40</b>, components (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in addition to the mixer <b>42</b>, reception circuit components such as chip resistors <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> are shown) included in the receiving unit <b>40</b> are arranged on the lower surface side (the motherboard <b>62</b> side) of a receiving unit circuit board <b>70</b>. The BGA balls <b>76</b> are arranged at a predetermined interval equal to or smaller than a quarter of intra-dielectric substrate effective wavelength &#x3bb; concerning a high-frequency signal processed by the receiving unit <b>40</b> and connected to a grounded conductor of the receiving unit circuit board <b>70</b> and a grounded conductor of the motherboard <b>62</b>. The BGA balls <b>76</b> and the grounded conductor of the receiving unit circuit board <b>70</b> and the motherboard <b>62</b> surround the reception circuit components. As a result, the mixer <b>42</b> is covered with the receiving unit circuit board <b>70</b> and the BGA balls <b>76</b>. The reception circuit components can be sealed without using lids. Electromagnetic shield of the reception circuit components is performed. There is also an effect that it is possible to reduce the influence of unnecessary waves that are likely to be emitted from the transmitting unit <b>20</b> or the LO-signal amplifying unit <b>30</b> and made incident on the receiving unit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the receiving unit <b>40</b>, as in the transmitting unit <b>20</b> and the LO-signal amplifying unit <b>30</b>, the components can be arranged on the upper surface side of the receiving unit circuit board <b>70</b> and lids can be provided above the components.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Electric connection of the amplifier <b>24</b> of the transmitting unit <b>20</b> and the transmission antenna is realized by a power feed pad for transmission antenna <b>90</b> provided on the antenna board <b>64</b>, a coaxial signal line <b>94</b> provided in the antenna board <b>64</b> and connected to the power feed pad for transmission antenna <b>90</b>, and a waveguide hole <b>80</b> provided right above the coaxial signal line <b>94</b>. With this configuration, the power feed pad for transmission antenna <b>90</b> and the transmitting unit <b>20</b> are arranged side by side on a substantial straight line via a transmission line of a coaxial structure and a hole of a waveguide structure. A wiring structure is simplified. There is also an effect in a reduction of a transmission loss.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Electric connection of the mixer <b>42</b> of the receiving unit <b>40</b> and the reception antenna is realized by a power feed pad for reception antenna <b>92</b> provided on the antenna board <b>64</b>, a coaxial signal line <b>96</b> provided in the antenna board <b>64</b> and connected to the power feed pad for reception antenna <b>92</b>, a waveguide hole <b>81</b> provided right above the coaxial signal line <b>96</b>, and a signal line <b>98</b> disposed in the receiving unit circuit board <b>70</b> and electrically connected to one end of the mixer <b>42</b>. With this configuration, the power feed pad for reception antenna <b>92</b> and one end of the signal line <b>98</b> are arranged side by side on a substantial straight line via a signal transmitting unit of a coaxial structure and a signal transmitting unit of a waveguide structure. A connection structure for the antenna unit and the transmitting unit is simplified. There is also an effect in a reduction of a transmission loss.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Electric connection of the mixer <b>42</b> of the receiving unit <b>40</b> and the amplifier <b>32</b> of the LO-signal amplifying unit <b>30</b> is realized by a signal line <b>83</b> disposed in the receiving unit circuit board <b>70</b> and electrically connected to the other end of the mixer <b>42</b> and a signal line <b>82</b> disposed in the motherboard <b>62</b> and electrically connected to the amplifier <b>32</b> and the mixer <b>42</b> via the BGA balls <b>76</b>. As explained above, because the connection of the transmission antenna and the transmitting unit <b>20</b> and the electric connection of the reception antenna and the receiving unit <b>40</b> are realized on both end sides of the motherboard <b>62</b>, a large area (a dielectric area) is formed in the center of the motherboard <b>62</b>. Therefore, because electric connection of the mixer <b>42</b> and the amplifier <b>32</b> can be performed using this area, it is possible to perform wiring design with a high degree of freedom.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As the motherboard <b>62</b>, the antenna board <b>64</b>, the transmitting unit circuit board <b>66</b>, the LO-signal amplifying unit circuit board <b>68</b>, and the receiving unit circuit board <b>70</b>, various boards such as a resin board and a ceramic board excellent in a high-frequency transmission characteristic can be used. In particular, as boards mounted with high-power high-frequency circuit components such as the transmitting unit circuit board <b>66</b> and the LO-signal amplifying unit circuit board <b>68</b>, a ceramic board on which a high-frequency circuit is easily designed and that is easily reduced in size is suitable. As the motherboard <b>62</b>, a resin board inexpensive compared with the ceramic board is suitably used. As the antenna board <b>64</b> and the receiving unit circuit board <b>70</b>, a resin board having a lower loss concerning a high-frequency signal than the motherboard <b>62</b> is suitably used. The motherboard <b>62</b>, the antenna board <b>64</b>, and the receiving unit circuit board <b>70</b> are formed of resin boards and integrally joined, whereby coefficients of linear expansion in joining the boards can be set close to one another. Therefore, reliability of joining against thermal stress under a heat environment in which an automobile is used is improved compared with that of the ceramic board, which is a fragile material. Consequently, because a package size of the receiving unit circuit board <b>70</b> can be increased, the receiving unit having six or more reception channels can be configured by an integrated high-frequency (in particular, millimeter wave equal to or higher than 60 GHz) package.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Antenna gains (a transmission system and a reception system) in the radar apparatus according to this embodiment are explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram of an antenna gain by the transmission antenna (the transmission array) and an antenna gain by the reception antenna (the reception first array and the reception second array). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a waveform indicated by a solid line is the antenna gain by the transmission array, a waveform indicated by an alternate long and short dash line is an antenna gain by the reception first array (the first reception channel), and a waveform indicated by a broken line is an antenna gain by the reception second array (the second reception channel).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As explained above, the antenna gain by the reception first array is an antenna gain formed by the reception channels CH<b>5</b> to CH<b>8</b> (the linear arrays in the four rows in the center) and used in the wide angle middle detection processing. Therefore, the antenna gain has wider angle directivity. On the other hand, the antenna gain by the reception second array is an antenna gain formed by the reception channels CH<b>1</b> to CH<b>8</b> (the linear arrays in the twelve rows in total obtained by combining the antennas) and used in the long detection processing. Therefore, the antenna gain has narrow directivity (a large gain and narrow reception beam width) compared with the reception first array.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The antenna gain by the transmission array is an antenna gain formed by the transmission channels (the liner arrays in the four rows on the transmission side). As shown in the figure, the antenna gain has narrower directivity than the antenna gain of the reception second array. In the antenna gain by the transmission array, second null of the transmission array and first null of the reception second array are matched. The first null of the transmission array is filled such that a gain difference between the first null of the transmission array and a first side lobe of the transmission array is within a predetermined value (e.g., 5 decibels).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A first reason for matching the second null of the transmission array and the first null of the reception second array is to secure a transmission and reception combined gain in the long detection processing. A second reason is to secure a D/U ratio in the long detection processing.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the long detection processing, a detection area does not need to be a wide angle. Therefore, the reception second array having narrow reception beam width is used. On the other hand, because a detection distance of a target depends on a product of a gain of the transmission array and a gain of the reception array (the reception second array) (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;transmission and reception combined gain&#x201d;), it is desirable to reduce the transmission and reception combined gain on the outside a detection range as much as possible. Therefore, the second null of the transmission array and the first null of the reception second array on the outside of the detection range are matched to conversely improve the transmission and reception combined gain within the detection range.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A detection area of the long detection processing is assumed to be, for example, &#xb1;20&#xb0; and an angle (a direction) of the second null of the transmission array and the first null of the reception second array is assumed to be &#xb1;30&#xb0;. On the other hand, when the detection area is set to, for example, &#xb1;20&#xb0;, because of a characteristic of signal processing, for example, a reflection signal from a target at 30&#xb0; appears as a reception signal in an angle position of about &#x2212;10&#xb0; (the reflection signal at 30&#xb0; is returned with a position of 20&#xb0; as a reference). Therefore, when a transmission and reception combined gain at 30&#xb0; is large, the transmission and reception combined gain adversely affects the signal processing as a D/U ratio (Desire to Undesire ratio). Therefore, as explained above, the second null of the transmission array and the first null of the reception second array is matched.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A first reason for filling the first null of the transmission array to set the gain difference between the first null of the transmission array and the first side lobe of the transmission array within the predetermined value (e.g., 5 decibels) is to secure a transmission and reception combined gain in the wide angle middle detection processing. A second reason is to increase an angle in the wide angle middle detection processing (eliminate a blind area).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, in the wide angle middle detection processing, it is a point to use a side lobe (the first side lobe) of the transmission array. A reason for using the side lobe is to secure a detection distance in a 0&#xb0; direction in the long detection processing in which the transmission array is shared (when only a main lobe of the transmission array is used, a gain in the 0&#xb0; direction decreases and the detection distance in the 0&#xb0; direction decreases). On the other hand, when the first side lobe of the transmission array is used, a detection distance at an angle of null near the first side lobe (closer to the main lobe side than the first side lobe) decreases. Therefore, in this embodiment, gain control for the transmission antenna is performed to fill the first null of the transmission array (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;null filling&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram of the concept of the null filling. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the left figure is a radiation pattern obtained when the null filling is not performed and the right figure is a radiation pattern obtained when the null filling is performed. As shown in the figure, the null (the first null) present near &#xb1;20&#xb0; is filled and a gain of &#xb1;20&#xb0; to over &#xb1;30&#xb0; is substantially flat. As a result, a transmission and reception combined gain in the wide angle middle detection processing is secured, the blind area is eliminated, and an increase in an angle can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The technology of the null filling is a publicly-known technology and disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. S58-118971. Therefore, detailed explanation is omitted herein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram of an example of an antenna gain formed based on the concept explained above. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a waveform shown in the left figure is an antenna gain (for both wide angle middle and long) of the transmission array, a waveform shown in the center upper figure is an antenna gain (for the long mode) of the reception second array, and a waveform shown in the center lower figure is an antenna gain (for wide angle middle) of the reception first array. Therefore, a transmission and reception combined gain for long is a gain sum (the right upper figure) of the waveforms shown in the left figure and the center upper figure. A transmission and reception combined gain for wide angle middle is a gain sum (the right lower figure) of the waveforms shown in the left figure and the center lower figure. As it is evident from these figures, gain switching of the long detection processing and the wide angle middle detection processing is realized by appropriately switching the reception first array and the reception second array for which array gains are appropriately set.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram for explaining a transmission and reception combined gain lower limit value, null width, and minimum width of null. First, the transmission and reception combined gain lower limit value is explained. In the upper part of (a) of the figure, an example of a transmission and reception combined gain in the wide angle middle detection processing is shown. A broken line shown in the figure indicates a lower limit value of a transmission and reception combined gain (a transmission and reception combined gain lower limit value). This transmission and reception combined gain lower limit value means a gain level of the transmission and reception combined gain under which detection of a target is impossible. A signal received by the receiving unit from a more distant place is smaller. Therefore, the transmission and reception combined gain lower limit value can be defined as a transmission and reception combined gain at a maximum detection distance of the wide angle middle detection processing.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The null width is explained. In the lower part of (a) of the figure, the portion of null that occurs in a transmission and reception combined gain waveform shown in the upper part is shown. As shown in the figure, the null width can be defined as an angle (angle width) between intersections with the transmission and reception combined gain lower limit value drawn on the transmission and reception combined gain waveform. The intersection on the inner side (the 0&#xb0; direction side) of the two intersections that define the null width is further defined as a &#x201c;null inner side angle&#x201d;. This null inner side angle is a parameter that is necessary in determining &#x201c;allowable null width&#x201d; explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The minimum width of null is explained. In (b) of the figure, the concept of the minimum width of null is shown. As explained above, in the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, a detection distance of a wide angle section (e.g., &#xb1;20&#xb0; to over &#xb1;30&#xb0;) in the wide angle middle detection processing is secured by performing the null filling for filling the first null of the transmission array. On the other hand, it is difficult to perform null filling for completely filling the first null. A detection distance in the 0&#xb0; direction of the long detection processing is sacrificed by the null filling. On the other hand, if a target having small width (e.g., a motorbike or a bicycle) can be detected, the width of null does not need to be set smaller than the width of the target. Therefore, the null width in the transmission and reception combined gain for wide angle middle allows null equal to or smaller than the minimum width at which the small width target such as a motorbike or a bicycle is not completely included in the null width. By specifying such minimum width (allowable null width), it is possible to suppress a decrease in the detection distance in the 0&#xb0; direction of the long detection processing.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph of a relation between the detection distance and the allowable null width. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the abscissa indicates the distance (the detection distance) and the ordinate indicates the allowable null width. A state of changes of the distance and the allowable null width is shown using the null inner side angle as a parameter. Two points explained below are made clear from the figure.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(1) The allowable null width is smaller as the detection distance is larger.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(2) The allowable null width is smaller as an absolute value of the null inner side angle is smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Therefore, the allowable null width can be determined according to a maximum detection distance in the wide angle middle detection processing and an angle position on the inner side (the null inner side angle) in the first null of the transmission array.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Details of target detection processing executed by the signal processing unit <b>50</b> are explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart for explaining a processing procedure of the target detection processing in this embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> are diagrams of sub-flows (subroutines) read out from a flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. This target detection processing is started every time interval specified in advance after the start of the radar apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the target detection processing is started, at step S<b>10</b>, the oscillator <b>21</b> is started and starts transmission of a radar wave.

At the following step S<b>12</b>, when the signal processing unit <b>50</b> acquires a desired number of sampling values, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> stops the oscillator <b>21</b> to thereby stop the transmission of the radar wave.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At step S<b>13</b>, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> executes a predetermined frequency analysis (e.g., FFT processing) and calculates a power spectrum (a frequency spectrum) for each of an uplink section and a downlink section.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Specifically, in this long detection processing, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, at step S<b>140</b>, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> detects a peak frequency component (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;frequency peak&#x201d;) present on the spectrum calculated using the signals of the reception channels CH<b>1</b> to CH<b>8</b>. The frequency peak detected at step S<b>140</b> represents a distance to a target candidate (i.e., a likely target) that reflects the radar wave (i.e., the signal processing unit <b>50</b> detects the target candidate that reflects the radar wave).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At step S<b>141</b>, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> executes, based on the specific spectrum calculated at step S<b>13</b>, a direction analysis for estimating a direction in which the target candidate detected at step S<b>140</b> is present. In this embodiment, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> executes the direction analysis using a MUSIC method for calculating, using null of the reception second array having a narrow half-value angle, a MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) spectrum (a peak point of the MUSIC spectrum is an index representing the direction in which the target candidate is present) from the specific spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At step S<b>142</b>, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> determines whether a power difference and an angle difference between a frequency peak calculated from the beat signal in the uplink section and a frequency peak calculated from the beat signal in the downlink section at step S<b>140</b> are within an allowable range specified in advance. As a result of the determination, if the power difference and the angle difference between both the peaks are within the allowable range, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> executes pair matching for recognizing both the peaks as probable target candidates (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;provisional targets&#x201d;). In this pair matching, concerning only the recognized provisional targets, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> generates, using a well-known method in the radar apparatus of the FM-CW system, target information according to, for example, distances to the provisional targets, relative speeds between the provisional targets and the own vehicle, and directions in which the provisional targets are present and returns to the target detection processing.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the signal processing unit <b>50</b> returns to the target detection processing (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), at step S<b>15</b>, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> executes the wide angle middle detection processing.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in the wide angle detection processing, at step S<b>150</b>, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> detects a frequency peak present on the spectrum (a spectrum for wide angle) calculated using the signals of the reception channels CH<b>5</b> to CH<b>8</b> (i.e., detects a target candidate).</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this wide angle middle detection processing, the signal processing unit <b>50</b> extracts a combination of frequency peaks based on a reflected wave from the same target present in a wide angle area, recognizes the combination of the frequency peaks as provisional targets, and generates target information for each of the provisional targets.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The signal processing unit <b>50</b> returns to the target detection processing (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The configuration and the operation of the radar apparatus according to this embodiment are explained and the details of the target detection processing, which is a principal part of the radar apparatus according to the present invention, are explained above. As explained above, the radar apparatus according to this embodiment adopts the configuration in which the mixers are provided for the respective reception channels and simultaneous reception of required channels (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;direct simultaneous reception&#x201d;) can be performed without switching the sub-arrays (the channels) (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;direct simultaneous reception system). Therefore, the radar apparatus according to this embodiment can perform further improvement concerning frequency resolution and high-frequency noise.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a diagram for explaining the concept of expansion of frequency modulation width, which is one of performance improvement methods in the radar apparatus according to this embodiment. Typical frequency modulation width in the radar apparatus in the past is, for example, 0.5 millisecond as shown on the left side of the figure. On the other hand, the frequency modulation width of the radar apparatus according to this embodiment is, for example, 1.5 milliseconds, which is three times as long as that of the radar apparatus in the past. By performing such expansion of the frequency modulation width, two effects are obtained. One effect is that a large number of sampling points of a beat signal can be acquired and frequency resolution is improved, i.e., resolution of a detection distance is improved. The other effect is that resolution band width decreases, which is effective in a reduction of high-frequency noise.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram for explaining the concept of narrowing of a filer band, which is another one of the performance improvement methods in the radar apparatus according to this embodiment. In the radar apparatus in the past that does not adopt the direct simultaneous reception system, one mixer down-converts signals of a plurality of channels. Therefore, as a characteristic of an analog filter of a typical radar apparatus, for example, a filter characteristic equivalent to 200 kHz&#xd7; the number of channels is necessary. On the other hand, in the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, because the direct simultaneous reception system is adopted, it is possible to narrow down bands of the filters (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) provided for the respective channels (narrowing of bands). In other words, in the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, it is possible to set the bands of the filters for the respective channels to, for example, 200 kilohertz. As a result, in the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, there is an effect that it is possible to reduce high-frequency noise and an SN ratio is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As explained above, with the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, in the transmission antenna, one transmission array is shared irrespective of a detection distance of a target. In the reception antenna, the two reception arrays for reception (the reception first array and the reception second array) are switched and used according to a detection distance of a target. On the other hand, these two reception arrays are configured to share and use a part of antennas (sub-arrays). Because a switch or the like is not used for switching of the reception first array and the reception second array, switching of the reception first array and the reception second array is instantaneously performed. Both the reception first array and the reception second array are configured to be capable of simultaneously receiving required channels without switching sub-arrays (channels) that form the two reception arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Therefore, with the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, it is possible to quickly perform target detection at the wide angle area that is an angle range wider than the normal angle range (the target detection is realized in the wide angle middle detection processing) while keeping on enabling detection of a target present in a position away from a vehicle (i.e., while maintaining target detection performance in a far distance area (the target detection is realized in the long detection processing). As a result, with the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, for example, it is possible to realize both earlier detection of a cutting-in vehicle suddenly appearing in front of the own vehicle and detection of an accurate position of a target present at a far distance.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Moreover, in the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, the detection is realized by defining a combination of the antenna elements or the sub-arrays without changing an arrangement interval of the antenna elements included in the array antenna or adding antenna elements.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Therefore, in the antenna unit applied to the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, compared with the antenna unit applied to the radar apparatus in the past it is possible to realize the functions explained above without increasing an antenna area (an aperture area).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">With the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, the second null of the radiation pattern by the transmission array and the first null of the reception pattern by the reception second array are matched (do not need to be completely matched). Therefore, it is possible to secure a transmission and reception combined gain in the long detection processing and secure a D/U ratio in the long detection processing.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">With the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, for an increase in an angle in the wide angle middle detection processing, the form of using the first side lobe of the radiation pattern by the transmission array is adopted. When the first side lobe is used, the first null of the transmission array is filled using the method of null filling. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate a blind area in the wide angle middle detection processing while securing a transmission and reception combined gain in the wide angle middle detection processing.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">With the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, when the null filling for filling the first null of the transmission array is performed, a gain difference between the first null of the transmission array and the first side lobe of the transmission array is set to be within the predetermined value (e.g., within 5 decibels). Therefore, it is possible to increase an angle in the wide angle middle detection processing without substantially affecting detection performance of the long detection processing.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">With the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, concerning the connection of the antenna board and the transmission circuit board, the antenna board side is the coaxial structure and the transmission circuit board side is the waveguide structure and these structure sections are arranged side by side on a substantially straight line.

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the receiving unit applied to the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, after the circuit components are mounted on the lower surface side of the individual circuit board, the balls are attached to the receiving unit to package the receiving unit. Therefore, there is an effect that it is easy to mount the receiving unit on the motherboard, it is easy to connect the receiving unit to the antenna board, and it is possible to hermetically seal the receiving unit without providing lids. In the receiving unit, as in the transmitting unit, the components can be arranged on the upper surface side of the receiving unit circuit board and the lids can be provided above the components. In this case, the same effects can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, among the circuit components of the transmission system, after the LO-signal amplifying unit that distributes an LO signal to the mixer of the receiving unit is mounted on the circuit board separate from the other circuit components of the transmitting unit, the lids and the balls are attached to the transmitting unit to package the transmitting unit. Therefore, even after a transmission package and a reception package having a small degree of freedom of arrangement are arranged because of limitations with the antenna circuit board, there is an effect that connection to the mixer of the reception package can be easily performed using a free space of the motherboard.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the radar apparatus according to this embodiment, the direct simultaneous reception system for enabling simultaneous reception of required channels without switching the sub-arrays (the channels) is adopted.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">For example, in the arrays of the reception arrays according to the embodiment, the reception first array (for both wide angle middle and long) is configured using the linear arrays in the four rows in the center. However, the linear arrays are not limited to the four rows in the center and can be three rows in the center or five rows in the center. The liner arrays do not always need to be provided in the center. The reception first array can be formed using the liner arrays in four rows on the left side or four rows on the right side. The linear array in each one row does not have to be the array configuration and can be configured as a single antenna element.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the embodiment, the processing for detecting, at a wide angle, a target at a near distance or an intermediate distance is classified as the wide angle middle detection processing and the processing for detecting a target at a far distance is classified as the long detection processing. However, these classifications merely indicate an example. In the present invention, processing for detecting a target present in an area at a distance closer to a set distance set in advance and an angle wider than a set angle set in advance (a first detection area) only has to be classified as the wide angle middle detection processing and processing for detecting a target present in an area at a distance farther than the set distance set in advance and on the inner side of the set angle set in advance (a second detection area) only has to be classified as the long detection processing.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the target detection processing in the embodiment, MUSIC is used as the method of a direction analysis. However, the method of a direction analysis is not limited to this. For example, the direction analysis can be performed using DBF (Digital Beam Forming).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The present invention can be applied to various radar apparatuses such as a pre-crush safety system (so-called PCS), an adaptive cruise control system (so-called ACC), forward collision warning (so-called FCW), and lane change warning (so-called LCW).</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As explained above, the present invention is useful as a radar apparatus and an antenna device that make it possible to detect, in a wider angle range in addition to a normal detection area, a direction in which a target is present without increasing the area of a reception antenna.</p>
