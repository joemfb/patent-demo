<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0043084, filed on May 6, 2011, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following description relates to an optical pick-up and an optical information storage medium system using the optical pick-up.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Optical information storage media including, for example, optical discs, are recorded and readout by optical recording/reproducing apparatuses. The optical recording/reproducing apparatuses may use laser beams having different wavelengths and objective lenses having different numerical apertures, according to the amount of information to be stored. In other words, as the capacity of an optical disc is increased, an objective lens with a light source having a shorter wavelength or with a greater numerical aperture may be used. For example, in a case of a compact disc (CD), a beam having a wavelength of about 780 nm and an objective lens having a numerical aperture of about 0.45 are used, in a case of a digital versatile disc (DVD), a beam having a wavelength of about 650 nm and an objective lens having a numerical aperture of about 0.6 are used, and in a case of a Blu-ray Disc (BD), a beam having a wavelength of about 405 nm and an objective lens having a numerical aperture of about 0.85 are used. The BD having a greater capacity than the DVD, which has a greater capacity than the CD.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described above, in order to increase the density of an optical disc, a size of a light spot formed on the optical disc is decreased. In order to decrease the size of the light spot, a wavelength of a beam is decreased, and/or a numerical aperture of an objective lens is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As another aspect, an expensive component is used to decrease the wavelength of the beam, and in response to the numerical aperture of the objective lens being increased, a focus depth is decreased by an amount corresponding to the square of the numerical aperture. A coma aberration is increased by an amount corresponding to the cube of the numerical aperture, so that an increase in the density of the optical disc, by decreasing the size of the light spot, may be limited.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to an increase in demand the optical disc with a larger capacity, a multilayer structure having more than one recording layer is used. Thus, the recording capacity of an optical disc having at least two recording layers formed on one side or both sides of the optical disc may be greater than the recording capacity of an optical disc having a single recording layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As described above, a multilayer optical disc may be used to increase a capacity of the optical recording/reproducing apparatuses. As another aspect, in response to the multilayer optical disc being used, light reflected from an adjacent layer other than a target reproducing/recording layer creates interference with signal light. The interference with signal light may create noise.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In general, a differential push-pull (DPP) method may correct an offset of a push-pull signal that is generated in response to an eccentricity disc being reproduced. The differential push-pull (DPP) method may be selected as a tracking method of a recordable optical disc. According to a general DPP method, a grating may be used to divide light into 0<sup>th</sup>-order light (main light) and two first-order lights (sub-lights). In consideration of an efficient use of light, a ratio of &#x2212; first-order light: 0<sup>th</sup>-order light:+ first-order light with respect to the amounts of divided lights may be approximately 1:10:1.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In response to the DPP method being used to detect a tracking error signal in a dual-layer optical disc having two recording layers, 0<sup>th</sup>-order light reflected from an adjacent layer may overlap with first-order light reflected from a target reproducing/recording layer causing a deterioration of the tracking error signal. In other words, the amount of light of 0<sup>th</sup>-order light reflected from the target reproducing/recording layer is significantly different from the amount of light of the 0<sup>th</sup>-order light reflected from the adjacent layer. On the other hand, the amount of light of the first-order light reflected from the target reproducing/recording layer is not significantly different from the amount of light of the 0<sup>th</sup>-order light reflected from the adjacent layer. Thus, the 0<sup>th</sup>-order light of the adjacent layer significantly affects a differential signal (a sub push-pull (SPP) signal with respect to sub-light) used to detect the tracking error signal in the DPP method.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to prevent the SPP signal from being unstable due to interlayer interference light, a one-beam tracking method has been proposed. The one-beam tracking method does not use sub-lights but instead uses main light. As another aspect, in the one-beam tracking method, the amount of light of the signal light is great, but the amount of light of the signal light is not free of interlayer interference. In response to a multilayer optical disc being embodied, an interlayer gap may be further decreased. In addition, as the interlayer gap decreases, a push-pull detection signal with respect to main light, i.e., a main push-pull (MPP) signal may further be deteriorated.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The following detailed description is provided to assist the reader in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the methods, apparatuses, and/or systems described herein. Accordingly, various changes, modifications, and equivalents of the systems, apparatuses and/or methods described herein will be suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art. Also, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions may be omitted for increased clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an optical information storage medium system according to one or more example, a one-beam tracking method may be used in recording and reproducing of a multilayer high-density optical information storage medium to reduce interference of a tracking error signal due to interlayer interference light.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a multilayer optical information storage medium having a plurality of layers, for example, a dual-layer optical information storage medium having two layers, a layer close to a light incident surface of the dual-layer optical information storage medium may refer to a layer L1, and a layer relatively far from the light incident surface may refer to a layer L0. The layer L1 has about 30% reflection and about 70% transmission, and the layer L0 has about 95% reflection and about 5% transmission. Due to a characteristic of the dual-layer optical information storage medium, in response to the layer L1 being reproduced/recorded, reflected light that passes through the layer L1 is defocused in the layer L0. On the other hand, in response to the layer L0 being reproduced/recorded, reflected light is defocused in the layer L1. The reflected light generated by an adjacent layer is defocused, so that, in response to the reflected light being formed in a photo-detector, the beam size of the reflected light is increased. In response to light being spread due to the increased beam size of the reflected light from the adjacent layer, the reflected light may affect signal light but not significantly. However, in response to the beam size of the reflected light from the adjacent layer being small (but the beam size being greater than the signal light), the reflected light may significantly affect the signal light.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a DVD, which may be a dual-layer optical disc, an interlayer gap may be sufficiently large so that, in response to the reflected light from the adjacent layer being defocused and formed in the photo-detector, the reflected light may have a relatively large size. Thus, the reflected light may not significantly affect the signal light. However, in a case of a high-density optical information storage medium such as a Blu-ray Disc (BD) having the storage capacity greater than a DVD, a numerical aperture of an objective lens may be greater than a numerical aperture of an objective lens of the DVD, and a thickness between a light incident surface and a recording layer is about 0.1 mm and is significantly less than a thickness between a light incident surface and a recording layer of the DVD.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In response to the high-density optical information storage medium such as the BD having a plurality of recording layers, an interlayer gap may be proportional to a focus depth. In this regard, the focus depth may correspond to &#x3bb;/NA<sup>2 </sup>(where &#x3bb; relates to a wavelength of light and NA relates to a numerical aperture), so that the interlayer gap of the DVD dual-layer optical disc relates to about 55 &#x3bc;m. On the other hand, the interlayer gap of the BD may be equal to or less than half of 55 &#x3bc;m. In other words, the interlayer gap of the BD may be significantly less than the interlayer gap of the DVD dual-layer optical disc. Also, in response to the number of recording layers stacked on one side being increased, the interlayer gap may be further decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Thus, in response to the high-density optical information storage medium such as the BD having a greater density than a density of the DVD dual-layer optical disc, the BD having a plurality of recording layers, for example, two layers or four layers, the interlayer gap therebetween may be significantly small so that a smaller beam size of light reflected from an adjacent layer is formed in the photo-detector. The smaller beam size of light is in comparison to beam size of light in the DVD dual-layer optical disc. Thus, in a differential push-pull (DPP) method, interlayer interference noise may significantly affect a sub push-pull (SPP) signal where the beam size of signal light is less than the beam size of a main push-pull (MPP) signal because, in response to the SPP signal being amplified k times to remove a DC offset component of a tracking error signal, the interlayer interference noise may also be amplified k times, so that DC variation totally applies to a DPP signal. The differential push-pull (DPP) method may be a general tracking method with respect to a land/groove-type optical information storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In comparison to the DPP method, in a one-beam tracking method, usage of the SPP signal weaker than the MPP signal with respect to interlayer interference may be excluded. As a result, the stability of a tracking signal may be improved. As another aspect, because the interlayer interference may also affect the MPP signal, the one-beam tracking method may not be completely free from the interlayer interference.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In response to a multilayer optical information storage medium being embodied, an interlayer gap may be further decreased, and as the interlayer gap decreases, the MPP signal may further deteriorate. Thus, in a multi-layer optical information storage medium system, it may be beneficial to reduce the deterioration of the MPP signal.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of an optical configuration of an optical pick-up. The optical pick-up according to the present example may be compatible with a high-density optical information storage medium and a plurality of low-density optical information storage media. The plurality of low-density optical information storage media may have different recording densities and formats. For example, the optical pick-up may be compatible with a BD-based optical disc (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;BD&#x201d;), a digital versatile disc (DVD)-based optical disc (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;DVD&#x201d;) and a compact disc (CD)-based optical disc (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;CD&#x201d;). In another example, the optical pick-up may be compatible with the BD and the DVD. In yet another example, the optical pick-up may be compatible with only the BD.
