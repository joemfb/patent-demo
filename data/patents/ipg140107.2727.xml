<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the use of centrally acting NK<sub>1 </sub>antagonists to treat nausea and vomiting, particular nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy, and to the treatment of such nausea and vomiting over multiple consecutive days. The present invention also relates to combined oral dosage forms of palonosetron and netupitant.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the development of the 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>antagonist in the early 1990s, there emerged new strategies in the medical community to better control nausea and vomiting caused by various medical procedures, including chemotherapy (CINV), surgery (PONV), and radiation therapy (RINV). When added to steroids such as dexamethasone, several 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>antagonists have been demonstrated to significantly improve the standard of life for patients undergoing emetogenic medical procedures. Examples of 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>antagonists include ondansetron, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, and palonosetron, developed by Helsinn Healthcare.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Palonosetron hydrochloride has recently emerged as a highly efficacious anti-nauseant and anti-emetic agent. See PCT publications WO 2004/045615 and 2004/073714 from Helsinn Healthcare. Palonosetron hydrochloride is sold in the United States as a sterile injectable liquid under the ALOXI&#xae; brand, in sterile unit dose vials containing 0.075 or 0.25 mg. of palonosetron hydrochloride. Palonosetron hydrochloride also is also sold as an orally administered soft-gel dosage form containing 0.5 mg. of palonosetron hydrochloride.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The official chemical name for palonosetron hydrochloride is (3aS)-2-[(S)-1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1-oxo-1Hberiz[de]isoquinoline hydrochloride (CAS No. 119904-90-4); its empirical formula is C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>24</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O.HCl, and its molecular weight is 332.87. The compound is represented by the following chemical structure:</p>

Methods of synthesizing palonosetron are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,202,333 and 5,510,486. Pharmaceutically acceptably dosage forms are described in PCT publications WO 2004/067005 and WO 2008/049552 from Helsinn Healthcare.
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">NK<sub>1 </sub>antagonists have also recently emerged as a tool for combating nausea and vomiting from emetogenic medical procedures. Most recently, aprepitant was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (&#x201c;FDA&#x201d;) for use in combination with other anti-emetic agents for the prevention of nausea and vomiting from moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy. However, it quickly became apparent that aprepitant's effect was limited principally to vomiting&#x2014;not nausea&#x2014;and that aprepitant did not provide as much benefit during the acute phase of CINV. When tested against nausea in humans, aprepitant was unable to induce a significant reduction in the incidence or severity of nausea following moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy when compared to a 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>antagonist alone. See FDA Approved Labeling for Emend&#xae;. Thus, while aprepitant is approved by FDA for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in humans, this indication is somewhat misleading because aprepitant did not reduce nausea in the clinical trials preformed for aprepitant more than nausea controlled by the other components of the anti-emetic regimen. In addition, the results reported in Grunberg et al., S<smallcaps>UPPORT </smallcaps>C<smallcaps>ANCER </smallcaps>C<smallcaps>ARE </smallcaps>(2009) 17:589-594, from a combined treatment of aprepitant and palonosetron, were far from promising.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Merck &#x26; Co. markets aprepitant, as EMEND&#xae; in the United States. The product is approved in a capsule dosage form, and is marketed for the prevention of CINV (acute and delayed) in combination with other anti-emetic agents such as ondansetron and metoclopramide. The product reportedly has a terminal half-life of from 9 to 13 hours. While aprepitant has demonstrated some effect against nausea, its effects have been inconsistent. Casopitant is another NK<sub>1 </sub>antagonist that has been tested against nausea and vomiting in humans. A clinical study of casopitant is discussed in <i>Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management </i>2009:5 pp 375-384 to Ruhlmann et al. and <i>Drug Metabolism and Disposition</i>, vol. 37, No. 8, 2009, pp. 1635-1645 to Pellegatti et al.

Casopitant has the formula (2R,4S)-4-(4-acetytlpiperazin-1-yl)-N-{(1R)-1-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethyl}-2-(4-fluoro-2-methylphenyl)-N-methylpiperidine-1-carboxamide, and the below chemical structure:</p>

Methods of synthesizing and formulating netupitant and its prodrugs are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,297,375, 6,719,996 and 6,593,472 to Hoffmann La Roche.
</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other representative NK<sub>1 </sub>antagonists include ZD4974 (developed by AstraZeneca), CGP49823 (developed by Ciba-Geigy), Lanepitant and LY686017 (developed by Eli Lilly), FK888 (developed by Fujisawa), Vofopitant, Vestipitant and Orvepitant (developed by GlaxoSmithKline), Befetupitant (developed by Hoffmann-La Roche), R116031 (developed by Janssen), L-733060 and L-736281 (developed by Merck), TKA731, NKP608 and DNK333 (developed by Novartis), CP-96345, CP-99994, CP-122721, CJ-17493, CJ-11974 and CJ-11972 (developed by Pfizer), RP67580 and Dapitant (developed by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), Nolpitantium and SSR240600 (developed by Sanofi-Aventis), SCH388714 and Rolapitant (developed by Schering-Plough), TAK637 (developed by Takeda), HSP117 (developed by Hisamitsu), KRP103 (developed by Kyorin Pharm) and SLV317 (developed by Solvay). Chemical structures of the above-mentioned NK<sub>1 </sub>antagonists are shown below and discussion of those compounds as well as other NK<sub>1 </sub>antagonists is present in <i>Expert Opin. Ther. Patents </i>(2010) 20(8), pp 1019-1045 by Huang et al.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The background of U.S. Pat. No. 6,297,375 suggests that NK<sub>1 </sub>antagonists are useful for treating a variety of conditions in which substance P (the natural ligand for the NK<sub>1 </sub>receptor) is active. These conditions include depression, pain (especially pain resulting from inflammatory conditions such as migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease), central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, headache, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, attenuation of morphine withdrawal, cardiovascular changes, oedema, chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity and other respiratory diseases including allergic rhinitis, inflammatory diseases of the gut including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, ocular injury and ocular inflammatory diseases. The background even mentions motion sickness and vomiting, but fails to call out nausea specifically.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for more effective treatments of nausea and vomiting, particularly nausea and vomiting emanating from chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. In addition, given the prolonged incidence of nausea and vomiting induced by these emetic events, there is a need for treating such nausea and vomiting for a prolonged period of time. Further, there is a need for the development of dosage forms to reduce drug-drug interaction, improve stability, and potentiate effects of each component of the combined dosage forms.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide new methods for treating or preventing nausea and vomiting using an NK<sub>1 </sub>antagonist, particularly netupitant.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is another object of the invention to provide methods for treating or preventing nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Still another object of the invention is to augment existing treatments for CINV, RINV or PONV by steroids and 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>antagonists, and thereby provide additional protection against both nausea and vomiting, especially during the acute and delayed phases.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another object of the invention is to provide a single combined dose of netupitant and a 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>antagonist and to the use of that single dose without further dosing, for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during the acute and delayed phases of CINV, RINV or PONV.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is another object to provide novel methods to treat nausea, vomiting, and other undesirable effects from moderately emetogenic and highly emetogenic chemotherapy (&#x201c;MEC and HEC&#x201d;), especially HEC, during the acute and delayed phases following such treatments.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is another object to provide novel dosage forms to reduce drug-drug interaction, improve stability, enhance bioavailability and potentiate therapeutic effect of each component of the combined dosage forms comprising netupitant and/or 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>antagonist and/or dexamethasone, in treating or preventing nausea and vomiting.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">After extensive testing into the clinical effects of netupitant, it has unexpectedly been discovered that netupitant is active against nausea, and that a single dose of netupitant is able to treat nausea and vomiting in response to highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy for five consecutive days. It has also been discovered, quite unexpectedly, that netupitant exhibits unique binding habits to NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors in the brain. In particular, it has been discovered that netupitant binds to NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors in the striatum in a long-lasting manner, and that less than 20 or 30% of netupitant is released from striatum NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors even ninety-six hours after administration. This is in stark contrast to aprepitant, in which receptor binding drops swiftly over time, and must be dosed repeatedly if emesis control is desired throughout the delayed phase; and which shows no meaningful effect against nausea.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">These discoveries have led to the development of a unique dosing regimen to treat nausea during the first day after an emesis-inducing event, in addition to the second, third, fourth and fifth days after such induction. Therefore, in one embodiment the invention provides a method of treating nausea and vomiting for a period of five consecutive days in a patient in need thereof, comprising administering to said patient netupitant or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in an amount which is therapeutically effective against nausea and vomiting during the acute and delayed phases, and which is effective to enter the systemic circulation, cross the blood brain barrier and occupy at least 70% of NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors in the striatum seventy-two hours after said administration.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another embodiment, the netupitant is combined with other anti-emetic agents, including a 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>antagonist such as palonosetron and a corticosteroid such as dexamethasone, in a manner that results in even greater efficacy against nausea. It has been discovered that palonosetron is much more effective in combinations with netupitant than it is in combination with aprepitant, as reported by Grunberg et al., Support Cancer Care (2009) 17:589-594. In addition, palonosetron shows an improved pharmacokinetic profile (e.g., better bioavailability) when palonosetron is in combination with netupitant as opposed to palonosetron in single dose administration. Based on these discoveries, solid oral dosage forms have been developed that combine netupitant or another NK1 antagonist and palonosetron for the treatment of acute and delayed emesis.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It has also been discovered that netupitant potentiates the effect of dexamethasone, such that the dexamethasone is effective even when administered at sub-therapeutic doses (i.e. doses at which the dexamethasone would be ineffective if administered by itself). Therefore, in another embodiment the invention provides a combination therapy for treating nausea and vomiting for five consecutive days in a patient in need thereof, consisting essentially of:

    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0025">Day 1 netupitant&#x2014;administering to said patient on day one netupinant or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in an amount which is therapeutically effective against nausea and vomiting during the acute and delayed phases, and which is effective to enter the systemic circulation, cross the blood brain barrier and occupy at least 70% of NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors in the striatum seventy-two hours after said administration;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0026">Day 1 palonosetron&#x2014;administering to said patient on day one a therapeutically effective amount of a 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>antagonist (preferably palonosetron) effective to treat said nausea and vomiting during the acute and delayed phases;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0027">Day 1 dexamethasone&#x2014;administering to said patient on day one a first dose of dexamethasone which is ineffective against nausea and vomiting when administered alone, but effective against nausea and vomiting when administered in combination with said netupitant and palonosetron, wherein said first dose comprises from 50 to 70% of a minimum effective dose when administered alone; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0028">Days 2-5 dexamethasone&#x2014;when the patient is undergoing highly emetogenic chemotherapy, administering to said patient, on days two, three and four, a second dose of dexamethasone which is ineffective against nausea and vomiting when administered alone, but effective against nausea and vomiting when administered in combination with said netupitant, wherein said second dose comprises from 40 to 60% of a minimum effective dose when administered alone on days two, three and four.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">The dosage forms are extremely versatile and stable owing to their unique design and formulation. This versatility and stability is accomplished by formulating the NK1 antagonist and palonosetron in separate dosage forms and combining the dosage forms in one capsule. Thus, for example, the palonosetron can be formulated in a small gel-cap at a dose of around 0.5 mg, and the netupitant or other NK1 antagonist formulated in a tablet at a dose of about 100 to 150 mg. A capsule can then be filled with one or more palonosetron gel-caps and one or more netupitant (or other NK1 antagonist) tablets, depending on the therapeutic objective for the product. Because the palonosetron and NK1 antagonist are in separate dosage units, they can be formulated without regard to the stability of the other, and without degradation to by-products, for instance (3S)-3-[(3aS)-1-oxo-2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-2-yl]-1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-olate, a degradation by-product of palonosetron. As a result, the presently discovered dosage forms offer advantages, such as, reducing drug-drug interaction, improving stability, and potentiating effects of each component of the dosage forms in treating or preventing emesis.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">Thus, in one embodiment the invention provides an orally administered dosage form comprising a combination of palonosetron and an NK1 antagonist (preferably netupitant), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">In another embodiment the invention provides an orally administered capsule dosage form comprising (a) an outer shell; (b) one or more tablets housed within said outer shell, each comprising an NK1 antagonist (preferably netupitant) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients; and (c) one or more soft-gel capsules housed within the outer shell, each comprising palonosetron or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester or prodrug thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients; wherein said dosage form comprises (3S)-3-[(3aS)-1-oxo-2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-2-yl]-1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-olate in an amount that does not exceed 3 wt. %.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">In still other embodiments the invention provides methods of treating acute and delayed-onset emesis by administering the dosage forms of the present invention to a human in need thereof, preferably shortly before the emesis inducing event.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">Additional embodiments and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The embodiments and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Methods of Treatment</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">As noted above, the invention is premised on several unique discoveries, and provides the following independent methods that can be practiced according to the present invention, including:</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">In a first principal embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating nausea and vomiting for a period of five consecutive days in a patient in need thereof, comprising administering to said patient netupitant or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in an amount which is therapeutically effective to treat nausea and vomiting during the acute and delayed phases, which enters the systemic circulation, crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies at least 70% of NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors in the striatum seventy-two hours after said administration.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">In a second principal embodiment, the invention provides a combination therapy for treating nausea and vomiting for five consecutive days in a patient in need thereof, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">(i) administering to said patient on day one netupitant or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in an amount which is therapeutically effective to treat nausea and vomiting during the acute and delayed phases, which enters the systemic circulation, crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies at least 70% of NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors in the striatum seventy-two hours after said administration;</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">(ii) administering to said patient on day one a therapeutically effective amount of a 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>antagonist (preferably palonosetron, more preferably 0.5 mg. of oral palonosetron as palonosetron hydrochloride) effective to treat said nausea and vomiting during the acute and delayed phases;</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">(iii) administering to said patient on day one a first dose of dexamethasone which is ineffective against nausea and vomiting when administered alone, but effective against nausea and vomiting when administered in combination with said netupitant and palonosetron, wherein said first dose comprises from 50 to 70% of a minimum effective dose when administered alone; and</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061">(iv) if the patient is undergoing highly emetogenic chemotherapy, administering to said patient, on days two, three and four, a second dose of dexamethasone which is ineffective against nausea and vomiting when administered alone, but effective against nausea and vomiting when administered in combination with said netupitant, wherein said second dose comprises from 40 to 60% of a minimum effective dose when administered alone on days two, three and four.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">Various sub-embodiments are envisaged for these principal embodiments. For example, the netupitant can be administered as a free base or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, but is preferably administered as the free base. In addition, the netupitant is preferably administered in an amount ranging from about 50 to about 500 mg., from about 200 to about 400 mg., and preferably about 300 mg., based on the weight of the free base. A preferred route of administration for the netupitant is oral. In terms of binding to NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors, the netupitant preferably binds to at least 80 or even 85% of NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors in the striatum seventy-two hours after administration. As of ninety six hours after administration, the netupitant preferably binds less than 70, 60, 50 or even 40% of said NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">The methods of the present invention are all effective at treating or preventing nausea and vomiting induced by numerous events, including chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (&#x201c;CINV&#x201d;), from moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy, radiation therapy induced nausea and vomiting (&#x201c;RINV&#x201d;), and post-operative nausea and vomiting (&#x201c;PONV&#x201d;). The method is preferably performed shortly before the emesis inducing event (i.e. no more than 1 or 2 hours before the event). The methods may be used to treat nausea and vomiting during the acute phase of emesis, or during the delayed phase.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">The drugs specified by the individual embodiments may be administered by any suitable dosing regimen, as is well known in the art, but in a preferred embodiment the netupitant, 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>antagonist and steroid are administered orally. A preferred oral dose of palonosetron ranges from about 0.075 to about 1.0 mg, or from about 0.25 to about 0.75 mg, but is preferably about 0.5 mg. A preferred oral dose of netupitant ranges from about 50 to 500 mg, or from about 200 to about 400 mg, but is preferably about 300 mg. A preferred dose of corticosteroid, preferably dexamethasone, is 12 mg administered orally or via injection on the first day of treatment, and 8 mg administered orally or via injection on the second, third and fourth days after said treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">It will be further understood that the netupitant can be administered in prodrug form, in which case the invention will provide a method of treatment by inducing plasma levels of netupitant, and in each case the plasma level of netupitant induced by the prodrug administration will correspond to the level attained by the administration of netupitant or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, in the doses and routes of administration described herein.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0091">Objective</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">The effects of palonosetron on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of netupitant and the effects of netupitant on the PK of palonosetron were examined in healthy volunteers.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">Methods</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094">A randomized, open, 3-way crossover study was conducted. Each subject participated in 3 treatment periods, each lasting approximately 12 days (Day &#x2212;1 to Day 11). The treatment periods were separated by wash-out periods of no less than 14 days (between Day 1 of any 2 consecutive treatment periods).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095">The following treatments were investigated:</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096">Treatment A: oral netupitant 450 mg. administered as single dose of three 150 mg. capsules.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097">Treatment B: oral palonosetron 0.75 mg. and oral netupitant 450 mg. administered simultaneously as three capsules of 150 mg. netupitant followed by 1 capsule of 0.75 mg. palonosetron.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0098">Treatment C: oral palonosetron 0.75 mg. administered as single dose as one 0.75 mg. capsule.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0099">Doses were administered under fasting conditions. Subjects fasted over-night for approximately 10 hours. Water, however, was permitted up to 1 hour pre-dose. Food intake was permitted 4 hours post-dose, and water was allowed ad libitum 1 hour post-dose.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0100">Doses were administered with the subject in an upright position. The subjects remained in an upright position for 4 hours post-dose. The capsules were swallowed whole with 250 mL of room-temperature tap water. Repeated PK blood sampling (for netupitant and/or palonosetron) was performed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0101">Results</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0102">The primary PK variables assessed for netupitant and palonosetron were the maximum plasma concentration observed (C<sub>max</sub>), the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable sampling time point (t) (AUC<sub>0-t</sub>), and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>0-inf</sub>). The secondary PK variables assessed were the terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2,z</sub>), and the time at which the maximum plasma concentration was observed (t<sub>max</sub>). Results are depicted in below Tables 3 and 4, as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>

<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Netupitant+Dexamethasone Drug Interaction Study</heading>
<p id="p-0103" num="0106">The effect of netupitant on orally administered dexamethasone pharmacokinetics was evaluated in this study. This was a randomized, open, 3-period crossover study utilizing an incomplete Latin Square design where subjects were given dexamethasone alone, or oral Netupitant 100 mg., 300 mg. or 450 mg. each given with dexamethasone. Netupitant was given orally on Day 1 only. The dexamethasone regimen for each treatment was 20 mg. orally Day 1, followed by 8 mg. orally every 12 hours from Day 2 through Day 4. Nineteen subjects (12 male and 7 female) completed the study (i.e., all 3 treatment periods).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0107">Mean plasma concentrations of dexamethasone were higher when dexamethasone was co-administered with netupitant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The increase appeared to be dependant on the netupitant exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0108">The AUC<sub>0-24 </sub>(Day 1) of dexamethasone increased 1.5, 1.7 and 1.8-fold with co-administration of 100, 300 and 450 mg. netupitant, respectively. The AUC<sub>24-36 </sub>(Day 2) of dexamethasone increased 2.1, 2.4 and 2.6-fold and AUC<sub>84-108 </sub>and AUC<sub>84-inf </sub>(Day 4) increased 1.7, 2.4 and 2.7-fold, with co-administration of 100, 300 and 450 mg. netupitant, respectively. Dexamethasone C<sub>max </sub>on Day 1 was only slightly affected by co-administration of netupitant (1.1-fold increase during co-administration with 100 and 300 mg. netupitant, respectively, and 1.2-fold increase during co-administration with 450 mg. netupitant). C<sub>max </sub>on Day 2 and Day 4 was increased approximately 1.7-fold in subjects administered netupitant. Dexamethasone C<sub>min </sub>on Days 2-4 was increased approximately 2.8, 4.3 and 4.6-fold with co-administration of 100, 300 and 450 mg. netupitant, respectively. This clearly shows that the co-administration of netupitant and dexamethasone enhances the bioavailability of dexamethasone and provides a better therapeutic window of dexamethasone.</p>
<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 4</heading>
<heading id="h-0024" level="1">Netupitant Pet Receptor Occupancy Study</heading>
<p id="p-0106" num="0109">This was a randomized, open-label, positron emission tomography (PET) study using 11C-GR205171 as tracer in 6 healthy male volunteers (2 per dose level) receiving single doses of netupitant (100, 300 or 450 mg) to investigate the degree of occupancy of NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors in human brain, and to determine the relationship between plasma concentration of netupitant and NK<sub>1 </sub>receptor occupancy (RO).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0110">The anticipated high NK<sub>1</sub>-RO (90% or higher) close to the expected C<sub>max </sub>(6 hours post dose) was reached for striatum, occipital cortex, frontal cortex and anterior cingulate in 3 of 6 subjects of whom 1 received 300 mg. and 2 received 450 mg. of netupitant as a single oral dose.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0111">All doses showed a relatively long duration of blockade of NK<sub>1 </sub>receptors and the decline over time was dose dependent. In the 100 mg. dose group, 4 of 6 regions still had a mean NK<sub>1</sub>-RO over 70% at 96 hours post dose. In the highest dose group (450 mg), 5 of 6 regions had a mean NK<sub>1</sub>-RO of 80% or higher at 96 hours post dose. A comparison of the results for the dose groups (100 mg., 300 mg. and 450 mg) showed a consistent but small increase in NK<sub>1</sub>-ROs with increasing netupitant dose. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>)</p>

<heading id="h-0026" level="1">Clinical Efficacy Study</heading>
<p id="p-0109" num="0112">A phase 2 trial evaluated three single doses of netupitant combined with palonosetron and dexamethasone compared to palonosetron alone and dexamethasone to obtain dose ranging information for netupitant used with oral palonosetron in the CINV patient population.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0113">The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of three single oral doses of netupitant combined with oral palonosetron and given with dexamethasone, versus oral palonosetron-alone given with dexamethasone (without netupitant) for the prevention of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC)-induced nausea and vomiting. The FDA-approved oral aprepitant regimen given with IV ondansetron and dexamethasone was included in the study as an active comparator for exploratory purposes. The FDA-approved oral palonosetron 0.5 mg. dose was used in each applicable treatment group in this study.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0114">This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, stratified study. Eligible patients were randomized (stratified by gender) to one of the following treatment groups:
