<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure is generally related to bridge upgrades and replacement, and in particular to replacement of a bridge cap without or prior to alteration or replacement of a bridge deck.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It may be desirable to repair or replace a bridge without rerouting the traffic that frequently traverses it. For example, railroad bridges typically carry regular freight or passenger traffic which cannot be easily or cheaply rerouted. As such, repair or replacement of such bridges is preferably conducted in a manner that would have minimal disruption to the bridge deck. For example, by installing new columns and bridge caps adjacent to old (i.e. preexisting) columns and bridge caps, the old columns and bridge caps may become redundant to supporting the bridge deck and beams, and may subsequently be removed. Alternatively, the columns and/or caps may be replaced individually, one at a time. Throughout this process, traffic may traverse the bridge deck unimpeded. Once an entire set of new columns and bridge caps are in place, the bridge deck and the support beams may be quickly replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, the process of replacing a bridge cap without disturbing the bridge deck and beams is a multi-step process, requiring repeated engagements between a lifting apparatus and the bridge cap that is being lifted into place. For example, in some conventional configurations, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,363,671, the lifting apparatus may need to be repeatedly adjusted as the bridge cap is slid between the beams and the new columns. For example, in that configuration, multiple lift rods are configured to selectively engage or disengage the bridge cap, by extending through the bridge deck in spacings between the bridge beams. The bridge cap is then slid until an engaging one of the lift rods moves adjacent to one of the bridge beams, at which time a disengaged lift rod is moved through a different spacing between the bridge beams to assist in supporting the bridge cap, while the lift rod that is adjacent to the bridge beam is disengaged. The sliding movement of the bridge cap then may continue, with the repeated engagement and disengagement of the lift rods between the bridge beams, until the bridge cap is supported on both sides of the bridge beams and bridge deck, to lift the bridge cap into final position on the columns.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It may be appreciated that each engagement and disengagement of the bridge cap (i.e. through the lift rods extending between the bridge beams and bridge deck) is potentially hazardous to field personnel and other workers assisting the lift, as they must be in close proximity to the lifted bridge cap to position and engage the lift rods, or other support structures. Additionally, the bridge deck must often be modified so as to expose the spacing between the bridge beams, to allow for the progressive and gradual movement of the new bridge cap onto the associated columns. Furthermore, with each engagement between spaces of the bridge beams, a potential of accidently impacting the bridge beam is increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment, a lifting device is configured to support a bridge cap when lifting the bridge cap onto columns under a bridge deck. The lifting device includes an upper bracket arm configured to extend over an upper surface of the bridge deck. The lifting device also includes a lower bracket arm configured to extend under a bottom surface of the bridge deck, and to selectively engage the bridge cap at opposite ends of the bridge cap. The lifting device further includes a side bracket portion connecting the lower bracket arm and the upper bracket arm. The side bracket portion is configured to transmit a force associated with a weight of the bridge cap to the upper bracket arm. The upper bracket arm, the lower bracket arm, and the side bracket portion are configured to define an open space extending from free ends of the upper bracket arm and the lower bracket arm to the side bracket portion. The open space is configured to receive the bridge deck when the lifting device is supporting the bridge cap as the bridge cap is being lifted onto the columns.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another embodiment, a method of installing a bridge cap onto columns under a bridge deck includes providing a lifting device configured to support the bridge cap. The lifting device includes an upper bracket arm configured to couple to a crane and extend generally above the bridge cap, a lower bracket arm configured to extend along the bridge cap, and a side bracket portion connecting the lower bracket arm and the upper bracket arm, the side bracket portion being configured to transmit a force associated with a weight of the bridge cap to the upper bracket arm. The upper bracket arm, lower bracket arm, and side bracket portion generally define an open space therebetween, the open space extending from free ends of the upper bracket arm and the lower bracket arms to the side bracket portion. The method also includes securing the bridge cap to the lower bracket arm at opposite ends of the bridge cap. The method additionally includes moving the lifting device generally horizontally so that the bridge cap is positioned generally between the columns and a bottom surface of the bridge deck, and the upper bracket arm generally extends over an upper surface of the bridge deck, such that the bridge deck is received in the open space. The method further includes lowering the lifting device so that the bridge cap is supported by the columns.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other features and advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.</p>

The connected end <b>180</b> of the upper beam <b>160</b> couples to an upper side-beam <b>190</b>. As described in greater detail below, the upper side-beam <b>190</b> is configured to extend from the upper beam <b>160</b> towards the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b>. In particular, the upper side-beam <b>190</b> is configured to couple to a lower side-beam <b>200</b> of the lower lifting assembly <b>140</b>, as described in greater detail below. It may be appreciated, however, that in some embodiments the upper side-beam <b>190</b> and the lower side-beam <b>200</b> may be replaced by a common side-beam, which may be one continuous piece. Generally the upper side-beam <b>190</b> and the lower side-beam <b>200</b> may together be of sufficient vertical length so that the upper beam <b>160</b> may extend over the top of a bridge deck, while the bridge cap <b>110</b> and the associated support structures of the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> may extend under the bridge deck and associated bridge beams, when the bridge cap <b>110</b> is being moved laterally between the bridge beams and the columns that the bridge cap <b>110</b> will rest on. In some embodiments, an intermediate side-beam may couple between the upper side-beam <b>160</b> and the lower side-beam <b>200</b>, so as to facilitate use of the lifting device <b>100</b> with a thicker bridge deck and associated bridge beams.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The attachment of the upper beam <b>160</b> and the upper side-beam <b>190</b> may vary across embodiments. For example, in the illustrated embodiment the upper beam <b>160</b> and the upper side-beam <b>190</b> are coupled through a pair of coupling plates <b>210</b> which may be welded across aligned faces of the upper beam <b>160</b> and the upper side-beam <b>190</b>. In an embodiment, an engaging face of the upper side-beam <b>190</b> may also or alternatively be welded onto the underside of the upper beam <b>160</b>. It may be appreciated that other connections may also or alternatively be provided, including but not limited to rivets, pins, bolts, and hooks. Additionally, as noted above, in some embodiments the upper side-beam <b>190</b> may be integrally formed with the upper beam <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> includes a lower beam <b>220</b> that is configured to extend alongside the bridge cap <b>110</b>, configured to support the weight of the bridge cap <b>110</b>. In an embodiment the lower beam <b>220</b> may have sufficient length to enable cap supports <b>230</b> (individually cap supports <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>) to engage the ends <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>. As one non-limiting example, in an embodiment wherein the bridge cap <b>110</b> is approximately 15 feet long, the lower beam <b>220</b> may be approximately 20 feet long. In the illustrated embodiment, cap support <b>230</b><i>a </i>is mounted to the lower beam <b>220</b> to receive the end <b>120</b><i>a </i>of the bridge cap <b>110</b>, while cap support <b>230</b><i>b </i>is mounted to the lower beam <b>220</b> to receive the end <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the bridge cap <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, each of the cap supports <b>230</b> are coupled to the lower beam <b>220</b> via mounting beams <b>240</b><i>a </i>that engage a top <b>220</b><i>a </i>of the lower beam <b>220</b>, and mounting beams <b>240</b><i>b </i>that engage a bottom <b>220</b><i>b </i>of the lower beam <b>220</b>. In various embodiments the coupling therebetween may be via welding, bolts, rivets, pins, or by any other appropriate connection. In an embodiment, a back support structure may be welded between the mounting beam <b>240</b><i>a </i>and the mounting beam <b>240</b><i>b </i>on a back side <b>220</b><i>c </i>of the lower beam <b>220</b> opposite a cap facing side <b>220</b><i>d </i>of the lower beam <b>220</b>, so as to provide additional support for the cap supports <b>230</b>. In an embodiment, either or both of the cap supports <b>230</b> may be adjustably mounted on the lower beam <b>220</b>, so as to allow for connection to differing lengths of bridge caps <b>110</b>. It may be appreciated that such adjustment may be facilitated by any appropriate engagement mechanism, including but not limited to support bolts being driven through the mounting beams <b>240</b><i>a </i>into apertures associated with different lengths of the bridge cap <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, the cap supports <b>230</b> may be mounted on the lower beam <b>220</b> so as to provide a space therebetween sufficient to receive a largest standard size of bridge cap <b>110</b>. In such an embodiment, spacers may be positioned between each end <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b </i>and the associated cap support <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b</i>, so as to securely hold the bridge cap <b>110</b> between the cap supports <b>230</b>. As indicated above, in embodiments where the lifting device <b>100</b> is configured to receive differing lengths of bridge caps <b>110</b>, adjustment of the position of the cable engaging support <b>150</b><i>a </i>may facilitate balancing the weight of the lifting device <b>100</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b>, to support them from above a combined center of gravity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The cap supports <b>230</b> may engage the bridge cap <b>110</b> in a supportive manner through any appropriate mechanism. In some embodiments, weld plates may be fixed to or otherwise formed in the ends <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>, and may be welded to (and subsequently cut from) the cap supports <b>230</b> to support the weight of the bridge cap <b>110</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, apertures <b>250</b> are formed in the cap supports <b>230</b>. Bolts or other fasteners may selectively extend through the apertures <b>250</b> into the ends <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the bridge cap <b>110</b> to support the bridge cap <b>110</b> from within. In some embodiments, the bolts or other fasteners that extend through the apertures <b>250</b> may be of sufficient strength such that a single bolt associated with cap support <b>230</b><i>a </i>and a single bolt associated with cap support <b>230</b><i>b </i>may fix the bridge cap <b>110</b> relative to the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a pair of apertures <b>250</b> is associated with each of the cap supports <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>, which may distribute the weight of the bridge cap <b>110</b>, prevent pivoting thereof, and so on. In other embodiments, additional apertures <b>250</b> configured to receive additional bolts or other fasteners may also be formed in each of the cap supports <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>. It may be appreciated that once the bridge cap <b>110</b> is placed on the bridge columns, as described in greater detail below, the bolts or other fasteners may be withdrawn from the bridge cap <b>110</b>, so that the bridge cap <b>110</b> may be supported by the columns, while the lifting device <b>100</b> may move relative to the bridge cap <b>110</b>, for removal thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Although not shown in the illustrated embodiment in some embodiments, a support ledge may additionally or alternatively be formed at the bottom of each of the cap supports <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>, configured to support the bridge cap <b>110</b> from the bottom of the bridge cap <b>110</b>, adjacent to the ends <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>. While such an embodiment might not be preferred, as it may be difficult to position the support ledge underneath the bridge cap <b>110</b> so as to lift the bridge cap <b>110</b>, such support ledges may be more useful where the bridge cap <b>110</b> is formed to contain raised supporting portions that may engage such support ledges, to assist in the lift of the bridge cap <b>110</b>. In an embodiment containing support ledges, it may be appreciated that an open space between the support ledges of the cap supports <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b </i>may allow the bridge cap <b>110</b> to engage the columns associated therewith. Accordingly, the lifting device <b>100</b> may then be lowered slightly, so that the bridge cap <b>110</b> is supported by the columns instead of the support ledges, before the lifting device is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cap supports <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>, together with the lower beam <b>220</b>, may form a generally U-shaped receiving space configured to envelop the ends <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>, as well as a longitudinal side <b>260</b><i>a</i>, leaving at least a longitudinal side <b>260</b><i>b </i>of the bridge cap <b>110</b> unobstructed, which may facilitate removal of the lifting device <b>100</b> from the bridge cap <b>110</b> when the bridge cap <b>110</b> is installed on the columns. In embodiments utilizing a single bolt or fastener through an associated aperture <b>250</b> in the cap supports <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>, a cap facing side <b>220</b><i>d </i>of the lower beam <b>220</b> may prevent pivoting of the bridge cap about an axis established by the bolt or fastener through each cap support <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>. In other embodiments utilizing a single bolt or fastener through an associated aperture <b>250</b> in each of the cap supports <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>, the bolt or fastener associated with each cap support <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b </i>may be offset from one another, so as to not define a single axis, which may prevent pivotal movement thereabout. It may be appreciated that in some embodiments the bridge cap <b>110</b> may be coupled to the lower beam <b>220</b> at the longitudinal side <b>260</b><i>a</i>, which may also prevent pivotal movement of the bridge cap <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It may be appreciated that balancing the weight of the bridge cap <b>110</b> during a lift may be important to the structural stability of the lifting device <b>100</b>, and may simplify movement of the lifting device <b>100</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b>. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> may be configured to mount to the upper bracket assembly <b>130</b> so that the upper beam <b>160</b> extends generally above and parallel to the bridge cap <b>110</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the upper beam <b>160</b> is configured to extend above a center of gravity of the combination of the lifting device <b>100</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b> in a longitudinal direction, so that the cable engaging support <b>150</b><i>a</i>, centered in a lateral direction on the upper beam <b>160</b> may support the lifting device <b>100</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b> without the assembly tipping forward or backward (i.e. pivoting about either of the longitudinal sides <b>260</b><i>a </i>or <b>260</b><i>b</i>). While in some embodiments the upper beam <b>160</b> may be centered over the bridge cap <b>110</b>, in other embodiments the upper beam <b>160</b> may extend over a weighted center between the bridge cap <b>110</b> and the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b>. Other positions of the upper beam <b>160</b> relative to the lower beam <b>220</b> are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, it may be appreciated that one or more of the cable engaging supports <b>150</b> may be positioned on the upper beam <b>160</b> so as to approximately balance the weight of the lifting device <b>100</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b> across the length of the lifting device <b>100</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b>. For example, while in some embodiments at least one of the cable engaging supports <b>150</b> may be centered over the bridge cap <b>110</b> in a direction of elongation thereof, in other embodiments at least one of the cable engaging supports <b>150</b> may be positioned at a joint center of gravity for the lifting device <b>100</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b> in either or both of the lateral and longitudinal directions. In an embodiment, one of the cable engaging supports <b>150</b> may be positioned above a center of gravity for the lifting device <b>100</b> alone, and may be utilized instead of the cable engaging support <b>150</b> positioned above the center of gravity for the lifting device <b>100</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b> once the bridge cap <b>110</b> is separated from the lifting device <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the cable engaging support <b>150</b><i>a </i>is positioned above the center of gravity in both the lateral and longitudinal directions for the assembly of the lifting device <b>100</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b>. As described in greater detail below, the cable engaging support <b>150</b><i>b </i>is shown extending offset from the upper beam <b>160</b>, positioned above the center of gravity in both the lateral and longitudinal directions for the lifting device <b>100</b> in the absence of the bridge cap <b>110</b>. In embodiments of the lifting device <b>100</b> configured to support different lengths of bridge caps <b>110</b>, it may be appreciated that the cable engaging support <b>150</b><i>a </i>may be adjustable in its position along the upper beam <b>160</b>. Adjustment of the position of the cable engaging support <b>150</b><i>a </i>may be facilitated by any appropriate mechanism, including but not limited to being bolted to one or more of a plurality of adjustment apertures extending along the upper beam <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It may be appreciated that in some embodiments a length of the lower beam <b>220</b>, and the positioning of the beam cap <b>110</b> when coupled thereto, may assist in balancing the lifting device <b>100</b> when supporting the beam cap <b>110</b>. Such positioning of the cap supports <b>230</b>, the cable engaging supports <b>150</b>, the respective lengths of the upper beam <b>160</b> and the lower beam <b>220</b>, and other weighting considerations may therefore generally be configured in some embodiments to mitigate a tendency for one side of the bridge cap <b>110</b> to tip to a lower angle than the opposite side of the bridge cap <b>110</b>, increasing difficulty in its placement onto the columns. Regardless of the positioning of the cable engaging supports <b>150</b>, where the upper beam <b>160</b> is generally aligned with the upper side-beam <b>190</b> and the lower side-beam <b>200</b>, the connection of the lower side-beam <b>200</b> to the lower beam <b>220</b> may facilitate an offset therebetween. In other embodiments, the lower beam <b>220</b> may be generally aligned with the upper side-beam <b>190</b> and the lower side-beam <b>200</b>, such that an offset may be established between the upper side-beam <b>190</b> and the upper beam <b>160</b>. In still other embodiments, an offset may be established between the upper side-beam <b>190</b> and the lower side-beam <b>200</b>. Other configurations are also possible that establish both a vertical and horizontal offset of the upper beam <b>160</b> and the lower beam <b>220</b>, as they extend generally parallel to the orientation of the bridge cap <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrated embodiment, the lower side-beam <b>200</b> is coupled to the lower beam <b>220</b> by an offset support assembly <b>270</b>, configured to support the entirety of the weight of the beam <b>220</b>, the cap supports <b>230</b>, the beam cap <b>110</b>, and all appurtenant mounting structures, and transmit the force thereof onto the lower side-beam <b>200</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the offset support assembly <b>270</b> includes an upper plate <b>280</b><i>a </i>that engages the top <b>220</b><i>a </i>of the lower beam <b>220</b>, and a lower plate <b>280</b><i>b </i>that engages the bottom <b>220</b><i>b </i>of the lower beam <b>220</b>. While in some embodiments the upper plate <b>280</b><i>a </i>and the lower plate <b>280</b><i>b </i>are welded to the lower beam <b>220</b>, bolts, fasteners, or other connections may additionally or alternatively be provided to facilitate the securing thereof. Furthermore, in some embodiments, such as that illustrated, a pipe <b>290</b> extends between the upper plate <b>280</b><i>a </i>and the lower plate <b>280</b><i>b</i>, and engages the cap engaging side <b>220</b><i>d </i>of the lower beam <b>220</b>. While in some embodiments the pipe <b>290</b> is welded to the cap engaging side <b>220</b><i>d</i>, the pipe <b>290</b> may additionally or alternatively partially extend into the lower beam <b>220</b>, further distributing forces acting on the lower beam <b>220</b> across the offset support assembly <b>270</b>. In an embodiment, the pipe <b>290</b> may be welded to both the upper plate <b>280</b><i>a </i>and the lower plate <b>280</b><i>b</i>. It may be appreciated that the curved shape of the pipe <b>290</b> is generally resistant to torsion, which may resist against the lower beam <b>200</b> pivoting relative to the upper beam <b>160</b> at the offset support assembly <b>270</b>. Additionally, the upper plate <b>280</b><i>a </i>and the lower plate <b>280</b><i>b </i>coupled together by the pipe <b>290</b>, and by additional structures, as described below, may generally prevent bending between the lower beam <b>220</b> and the lower side-beam <b>200</b> at the offset support assembly <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, stiffening plates <b>300</b> may be positioned between the upper plate <b>280</b><i>a </i>and the lower plate <b>280</b><i>b</i>, and may provide further rigidity for the offset support assembly <b>270</b>. In embodiments of the offset support assembly <b>270</b> containing the pipe <b>290</b>, the pipe <b>290</b> may extend through the stiffening plates <b>300</b>. In an embodiment, the stiffening plates <b>300</b> may be welded to both the pipe <b>290</b> and to the upper plate <b>280</b><i>a </i>and the lower plate <b>280</b><i>b</i>. In alternative embodiments, separate pipes <b>290</b> may be secured between the cap engaging side <b>220</b><i>d </i>of the lower beam <b>220</b> and an adjacent stiffening plate <b>300</b>, between sets of stiffening plates <b>300</b>, and/or to a stiffening plate <b>300</b> furthest from the cap engaging side <b>220</b><i>d </i>of the lower beam <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, including the illustrated embodiment, a mounting between the offset support assembly <b>270</b> and the lower side-beam <b>200</b> is reversible, so that the lower beam <b>200</b> may selectively extend along either the longitudinal side <b>260</b><i>a </i>(e.g., a left-handed engagement, as shown), or may be flipped so as to extend along the longitudinal side <b>260</b><i>b </i>(e.g., a right-handed engagement). In the illustrated embodiment, an engagement plate <b>305</b> is provided, associated with the lower side-beam <b>200</b>, which may alternatively be mounted to the so-called upper plate <b>280</b><i>a </i>to create the left-handed engagement, or may be mounted to the so-called lower plate <b>280</b><i>b </i>to create the right-handed engagement. In such an embodiment, the position of the lower beam <b>220</b> would be offset from the upper beam <b>160</b> in an opposite direction, changing the center of gravity for the lifting device <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the cable engaging support <b>150</b><i>c </i>is illustrated extending offset from the upper beam <b>160</b> opposite to the cable engaging support <b>150</b><i>b</i>, facilitating a balanced lifting support for the dead weight of the lifting device <b>100</b> alone, when the configuration has been switched from the left-handed engagement to the right-handed engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in an embodiment, support bolts <b>310</b> may couple the engagement plate <b>305</b> to the offset support assembly <b>270</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the support bolts <b>310</b> extend through both the engagement plate <b>305</b> and the offset support assembly <b>270</b>, further distributing the load of the lower beam <b>220</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b> (and appurtenant structures) through the offset support assembly <b>270</b>. Additionally, in some embodiments several of the support bolts <b>310</b> may extend through the pipe <b>290</b>. The number of support bolts <b>310</b> utilized in the offset support assembly <b>270</b> may vary across embodiments, and may depend on the typical load carried therewith. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, in some embodiments additional bolts may be positioned proximal to the bridge cap <b>110</b>, so as to provide further support for the weight of the bridge cap <b>110</b>. While in the illustrated embodiment the support bolts <b>310</b> are long bolts that extend through the engagement plate <b>305</b> as well as both the lower plate <b>280</b><i>b </i>and the upper plate <b>280</b><i>a</i>, in other embodiments shorter bolts may be utilized, that connect the engagement plate <b>305</b> to the upper plate <b>280</b><i>a </i>in the left-handed engagement, or the lower plate <b>280</b><i>b </i>in the right-handed engagement. As shown, the support bolts <b>310</b> are secured by nuts <b>320</b>. Any other appropriate securing mechanism may be utilized to securely couple the offset support assembly <b>270</b> to the lower side-bracket <b>200</b>, to distribute the weight of the bridge cap <b>110</b> to the upper beam <b>160</b>.</p>

In an embodiment, where the engagement is not reversible between the left-handed engagement and the right-handed engagement, the coupling members <b>330</b> may be welded directly between the lower side-beam <b>200</b> as well as to the upper plate <b>280</b><i>a</i>. In some reversible embodiments, the coupling members <b>330</b> may be bent or otherwise multi-faceted, so as to have a face that engages the lower side-beam <b>200</b> and a face that engages either the upper plate <b>280</b><i>a </i>or the lower plate <b>280</b><i>b </i>depending on the reversible configuration. In some such embodiments, the support bolts <b>310</b> may extend through the face engaging the upper plate <b>280</b><i>a</i>, to provide left-handed engagement between the offset support assembly <b>270</b> and the lower side-beam <b>200</b>, or may extend through the face engaging the lower plate <b>280</b><i>b</i>, to provide right-handed engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As indicated above, while in some embodiments the upper side-beam <b>190</b> and the lower side-beam <b>200</b> may be replaced by a common side-beam, in the illustrated embodiment the upper side-beam <b>190</b> and the lower side-beam <b>200</b> are selectively coupled to one another. In particular, in the illustrated embodiment the upper side-beam <b>190</b> includes therein a pair of apertures <b>340</b> extending therethrough, configured to receive therein an associated pair of coupling bolts <b>350</b>.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In embodiments where the upper bracket assembly <b>130</b> and the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> are separable from one another, cable engaging supports may be associated with separately lifting the upper bracket assembly <b>130</b> and the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, it may be appreciated that the cable engaging support <b>150</b><i>d </i>may be positioned on the upper bracket assembly <b>130</b> above the center of gravity for the upper bracket assembly <b>130</b> alone. Additionally, cable engaging supports <b>425</b> formed on the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b>, may facilitate lifting the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> above a center of gravity thereof. It may be appreciated that due to the offset support assembly <b>270</b> and the cap supports <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b </i>extending from one side of the lower beam <b>220</b>, a center of gravity for the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> alone may be at a remote position (e.g., spaced from the structure of the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b>) that would be inconvenient to install a single cable engaging support <b>425</b>. Accordingly, in the illustrated embodiment the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> includes a cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>a </i>associated with the offset support assembly <b>270</b> or the lower side-beam <b>200</b> (or engaging structures therebetween), and a cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>b </i>associated with the lower beam <b>220</b>. It may be appreciated that coupling to both the cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>a </i>and the cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>b </i>may allow stable and balanced support of the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> alone. As shown, in an embodiment with reversible left-handed and right-handed engagements, a cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>c </i>may be positioned opposite to the cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>b</i>, so to allow for lifting support of the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> alone when in the right-handed engagement configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, the cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>a </i>is mounted to (e.g., welded to) an associated one of the coupling members <b>330</b>, so as to be utilized with the cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>b </i>(as the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> is in the left-handed engagement configuration). It may be appreciated that an additional cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>a </i>(obscured in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be mounted to the other of the coupling members <b>330</b>, so as to be utilized with the cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>c </i>when the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> is in the right-handed engagement configuration. In some embodiments a common cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>a </i>for the offset support assembly <b>270</b> may be positioned thereon, while the cable engaging supports <b>425</b><i>a </i>and <b>425</b><i>b </i>may be positioned on the lower side-beam <b>200</b> so as to allow for support of the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> by the common cable engaging support <b>425</b><i>a</i>, and either of the cable engaging supports <b>425</b><i>a </i>and <b>425</b><i>b</i>, above the center of gravity of the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> in either the left-handed engagement or right-handed engagement configurations respectively. In other embodiments, any other positioning or configuration of one or more cable engaging supports <b>425</b> associated with the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b> (including but not limited to being formed associated with either the lower side-beam <b>200</b>, the engagement plate <b>305</b>, or appurtenant structures) may additionally or alternatively be utilized.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> illustrate the operation of an embodiment of the lifting device <b>100</b> in installing a bridge cap <b>110</b>. As shown, the lifting device <b>100</b> is supported by a cable C of a crane (not shown), which supports the weight of the lifting device <b>100</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that the bridge cap <b>110</b> may be secured to the cap supports <b>230</b> of the lifting device <b>100</b> by bolts <b>425</b>, which extend through the apertures <b>250</b> of the cap supports <b>230</b>, into the bridge cap <b>110</b>. The view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> faces the free end <b>170</b> of the upper beam <b>160</b> and the cap support <b>230</b><i>b</i>, between which is an open space sized to receive an existing bridge structure <b>430</b>. As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the existing bridge structure <b>430</b> includes old columns <b>440</b> and old bridge caps <b>450</b> that support the beams <b>460</b> and deck <b>470</b>. In an embodiment, clearance of the upper beam <b>160</b> above an upper surface of the bridge deck may be approximately greater than 3 feet, while clearance of the bridge cap <b>110</b> and the beams <b>460</b> may be less, including, for example, being approximately less than a foot.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It may be appreciated that the existing bridge structure <b>430</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a rail road bridge, and as such, the deck <b>470</b> includes rails <b>480</b> and ties <b>490</b>, surrounded by track ballast <b>500</b>. Conventionally, the ties <b>490</b> are constructed of wood, while the track ballast <b>500</b> is formed of crushed stone. Older existing bridge structures <b>430</b> may also generally be constructed of wood, however are typically being replaced by reinforced concrete structures. It may be appreciated that to install the bridge cap <b>110</b>, new columns <b>510</b> may be driven into the ground, positioned between adjacent sets of the old columns <b>440</b>. As shown, in some embodiments guide members <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may be mounted to one of the new columns <b>510</b>, so as to facilitate positioning the bridge cap <b>110</b> relative to the new columns <b>510</b>. Specifically, in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a guide member <b>520</b><i>a </i>is configured to assist in positioning the end <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the bridge cap <b>110</b> (serving as a stop), while the guide member <b>520</b><i>b </i>is configured to assist in positioning the side <b>260</b><i>b </i>of the bridge cap <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrate a different view of the process of using the lifting device <b>100</b> to lift the bridge cap <b>110</b> onto the new columns <b>510</b> that have been installed underneath the existing bridge structure <b>430</b>. Specifically, the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> may be along a section of the existing bridge structure <b>430</b> adjacent to the new columns <b>510</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the guide members <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may be mounted to the new columns <b>510</b>, and may be aligned to guide a precise placement of the bridge cap <b>110</b> during installation with the lifting device <b>100</b>. While the bridge deck <b>470</b> and beams <b>460</b> of the existing bride structure <b>430</b> are being supported by the old columns <b>440</b> and old bridge caps <b>450</b>, the lifting device <b>100</b> may be hoisted by the cable C generally horizontally between top surfaces <b>530</b> of the new columns <b>510</b> and bottom surfaces <b>540</b> of the bridge beams <b>460</b>. The movement of the bridge cap <b>110</b> into place may continue until the bridge cap <b>110</b> is in position, which may be guided by the guide members <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. In some embodiments, installation of the bridge cap <b>110</b> may include the use of guide cables pulled by workers, while support and movement is provided by the crane lifting the lifting device <b>100</b> via the cable C. In various embodiments, cable supports for the guide cables may be provided on the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the cable engaging supports <b>425</b> may be utilized as such anchors for guide cables. Other guide cable supports may be positioned elsewhere on the lower bracket assembly <b>140</b>, the bridge cap <b>110</b>, or elsewhere on the lifting device <b>100</b>, to allow the workers to assist in movement of the bridge cap <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, once the bridge cap <b>110</b> has been positioned above the new columns <b>510</b>, the crane operator may lower the bridge cap <b>110</b> onto the new columns <b>510</b>, releasing any tension on the bolts <b>425</b>. The bridge cap <b>110</b> may then be secured onto the new columns <b>510</b>, such as by interlocking onto the new columns <b>510</b>, being welded or cemented thereon, or by any other appropriate mechanism. After the tension on the bolts <b>425</b> is released, the bolts <b>425</b> may also be removed by pulling them out of the bridge cap <b>110</b>, disengaging the connection between the lifting device <b>100</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Once the bridge cap <b>110</b> is disengaged from the lifting device <b>100</b>, the lifting device <b>100</b> may be removed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in an embodiment this removal may include laterally moving the lifting device <b>100</b> by increasing a spacing between the lower beam <b>220</b> and the bridge cap <b>110</b>, until the cap supports <b>230</b> are no longer aligned with the bridge cap <b>110</b> (and the new columns <b>510</b>). The lifting device <b>100</b> may then be moved in a direction so that the lower beam <b>220</b> and the upper beam <b>160</b> no longer surround the bridge deck <b>470</b> and the beams <b>460</b> (e.g., in the direction of the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), at which point the lifting device <b>100</b> may be moved to be secured to another bridge cap for further installation, or may be removed entirely if the no longer needed.
