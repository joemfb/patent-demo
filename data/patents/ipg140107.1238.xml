<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 60/591,441 filed on Jul. 27, 2004. This application is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/067,040 filed on Feb. 25, 2005.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to inflators for vehicle airbags and, more particularly, to a linear inflator which discharges inflation gas along the length of the inflator for use in side impact or head curtain airbag systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In inflation systems for deploying an air bag in a motor vehicle, it is desirable to be able to modify an inflation profile produced by a given inflator design without substantial modifications to the design, in order to accommodate different desired airbag inflation profiles. One method of varying the inflation profile is to modify the composition, amount, and/or physical arrangement of gas generant in the inflator. However, this method of varying the inflation profile may entail relatively complex changes to the inflator design and components, and may also add to inflator manufacturing cost and complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, many inflator housing designs possess degrees of strength and rigidity that are under-utilized in vehicle designs due to the configurations of the inflator housings.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An inflator construction is provided for use in an inflatable vehicle occupant protection system. In one aspect of the invention, the inflator includes a longitudinal enclosure having a substantially uniform cross-sectional area along at least a portion of the enclosure, and a gas generant composition positioned along at least a portion of the enclosure. The gas generant composition is distributed substantially uniformly along the at least a portion of the enclosure. A first plurality of gas exit apertures is formed along the at least a portion of the enclosure to enable fluid communication between the enclosure and an exterior of the enclosure. The apertures of the first plurality of gas exit apertures are spaced apart a distance proportional to a desired rate of propagation of a combustion reaction of gas generant positioned between the apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect of the invention, the inflator includes a longitudinal enclosure having a substantially uniform cross-sectional area along at least a portion of the enclosure, and a gas generant composition positioned along the at least a portion of the enclosure. The gas generant composition is distributed substantially uniformly along the at least a portion of the enclosure. A first plurality of gas exit apertures is formed along the at least a portion of the enclosure to enable fluid communication between the enclosure and an exterior of the enclosure. The number of apertures in the first plurality of gas exit apertures is inversely proportional to a desired rate of propagation of a combustion reaction of gas generant positioned between the apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another aspect of the invention, an airbag device is disclosed which includes an inflator having an inflator housing configured as a structural member of a vehicle. The inflator housing may be employed as a stand-alone structural member in the vehicle, or used to reinforce another structural member. The housing may include a cavity portion having a cylindrical cross-section. The cavity portion may serve as the structural member, or the housing may include extensions coupled to the cavity portion to provide a structural member having a desired configuration.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an inflator <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention. Inflator <b>10</b> is preferably constructed of components made from a durable metal such as carbon steel or iron, but may also include components made from tough and impact-resistant polymers, for example. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate various methods of construction for the various components of the inflator. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,035,757, 6,062,143, 6,347,566, U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 2001/0045735, WO 01/08936, and WO 01/08937 exemplify typical designs for the various inflator components, and are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, but not by way of limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, inflator <b>10</b> includes a tubular housing <b>12</b> comprising a cavity portion <b>11</b> for receiving inflator components, such as a gas generant composition, therein. Cavity portion <b>11</b> has a pair of opposed ends <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and a housing wall <b>18</b>. Housing <b>12</b> may be cast, stamped, extruded, or otherwise metal-formed. A plurality of gas exit apertures <b>20</b> are formed along housing wall <b>18</b> to permit fluid communication between an interior of the housing and an airbag (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A longitudinal gas generant enclosure <b>22</b> is inwardly radially spaced from housing <b>12</b> and is coaxially oriented along a longitudinal axis of the housing. Enclosure <b>22</b> has an elongate, substantially cylindrical body defining a first end <b>22</b><i>a</i>, a second end <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and an interior cavity for containing a gas generant composition <b>24</b> therein. Enclosure first end <b>22</b><i>a </i>is positioned to enable fluid communication between an igniter <b>26</b> and the enclosure interior cavity. Enclosure <b>22</b> is configured to facilitate propagation of a combustion reaction of gas generant <b>24</b> along the enclosure, in a manner described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A plurality of gas generant tablets <b>24</b> are stacked side by side along the length of enclosure <b>22</b>. Each tablet <b>24</b> has substantially the same dimensions. In one embodiment, each gas generant tablet <b>24</b> has an outer diameter of &#xbc;&#x2033; and a pair of opposing, generally dome-shaped faces <b>27</b>, providing a maximum tablet width of approximately 0.165&#x2033; between faces. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, tablets <b>24</b> are shaped or configured to advantageously create a cavity <b>25</b> between adjacent tablets <b>24</b>. These cavities <b>25</b> provide a volume of air space relative within enclosure <b>22</b>, thereby enhancing the burn characteristics of tablets <b>24</b> when they are ignited. An alternative arrangement of the gas generant along the length of the enclosure may be provided. Hoverer, any arrangement of gas generant along the enclosure preferably provides a substantially uniform average distribution of gas generant along the length of the enclosure. Examples of gas generant compositions suitable for use in the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,035,757, 6,210,505, and 5,872,329, incorporated herein by reference. However, the range of suitable gas generants is not limited to those described in the cited patents.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A quantity of a known auto-ignition composition <b>28</b> is positioned at either end of the stack of gas generant material <b>24</b>. Enclosure <b>22</b> is environmentally sealed at both ends with an aluminum tape <b>29</b> or any other effective seal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An igniter <b>26</b> is secured to inflator <b>10</b> such that the igniter is in communication with an interior of gas generant enclosure <b>22</b>, for activating the inflator upon occurrence of a crash event. In the embodiment shown, igniter <b>26</b> is positioned within an annular bore of an igniter closure <b>30</b>. Igniter <b>26</b> may be formed as known in the art. One exemplary igniter construction is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,009,809, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Igniter closure <b>30</b> is crimped or otherwise fixed to a first end <b>14</b> of housing <b>12</b>. A first endcap <b>32</b> is coaxially juxtaposed adjacent igniter closure <b>30</b> to form, in conjunction with igniter closure <b>30</b>, an inner housing for igniter <b>26</b>. First endcap <b>32</b> also provides a closure for gas generant enclosure <b>22</b>. A second endcap <b>34</b> is crimped or otherwise fixed to a second end <b>16</b> of housing <b>12</b>. Endcaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and igniter closure <b>30</b> may be cast, stamped, extruded, or otherwise metal-formed. Alternatively, endcaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> may be molded from a suitable polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A filter <b>36</b> may be incorporated into the inflator design for filtering particulates from gases generated by combustion of gas generant <b>24</b>. In general, filter <b>36</b> is positioned between gas generant <b>24</b> and apertures <b>20</b> formed along inflator housing wall <b>18</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, filter <b>36</b> is positioned exterior of gas generant enclosure <b>22</b> intermediate enclosure <b>22</b> and housing wall <b>18</b>, and substantially occupies the annular space between gas generant enclosure <b>22</b> and housing wall <b>18</b>. In an alternative embodiment (not shown), filter <b>36</b> is positioned in the interior cavity of enclosure <b>22</b> between gas generant <b>14</b> and enclosure gas exit apertures <b>40</b> formed along enclosure <b>22</b>. The filter may be formed from one of a variety of materials (for example, a carbon fiber mesh or sheet) known in the art for filtering gas generant combustion products.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In accordance with the present invention, a plurality of gas exit apertures <b>40</b> is particularly formed along enclosure <b>22</b> to tailor the rate of propagation of a combustion reaction of the gas generant <b>24</b> along the enclosure, as required by design criteria. Apertures <b>40</b> are spaced apart along enclosure <b>22</b> as described in greater detail below. Enclosure <b>22</b> may be roll formed from sheet metal and then perforated to produce apertures <b>40</b>. Enclosure apertures <b>40</b> are environmentally sealed with an aluminum tape <b>42</b> or any other effective seal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The size of the holes or gas exit apertures preferably ranges from about one millimeter to about one-half the diameter of the propellant tube. Holes smaller than one millimeter are often difficult to manufacture with consistent size and with the desired efficiency. Holes or gas exit apertures larger than half the diameter of the propellant tube weaken the structure of the tube and are therefore relatively difficult to produce.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The gas exit apertures are preferably spaced about six millimeters to twenty-six millimeters on center (OC). A spacing less than about six mm may weaken the structure, and presents a further structural concern if the local or associated gas exit aperture size is relatively large or close to the diameter of the propellant tube. Spacing larger than twenty-six mm may be employed although the efficiency of the cooling screen may consequently be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As such, the present invention incorporates a tailored overall surface area dependent on both the size and spacing of the gas exit apertures. The overall surface area may be tailored based on various design criteria such as the composition of the gas generant and/or the desired inflation profile of an associated airbag, for example. The distribution of the overall surface area from a relatively lower aperture area within the first half of the propellant tube (that is the half closest or adjacent to the ignition source) to a relatively larger aperture area within the second half of the propellant tube (that is the half of the propellant tube farthest from the ignition source) provides the desired combustion propagation across the length of the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The percentage of the total surface area as a function of the position of the holes from the ignition source is tabulated and exemplified below. The open area is defined as the sum of the area of each hole in the propellant tube. Starting with a known example of equally spaced holes of equal size, the orifice area is equally distributed throughout the length of the propellant tube. This results in the fastest propagation time and the shortest burnout time, or, the time required to completely combust the gas generant. The share of the aperture/orifice area at the ignition end of the tube is relatively smaller while the share of the orifice area at the opposite end of the ignition tube is relatively larger. This causes a proportional increase in the time it takes for the entire propellant stack to ignite and therefore affects the initial combustion rate and the duration of gas generation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is believed that after initiator <b>26</b> is activated, the propagation rate of the combustion reaction along the enclosure is dependent upon the number of apertures <b>40</b> and the spacing between the apertures along enclosure <b>22</b>. More specifically, it is believed that, along the sections of the enclosure where the aperture spacing is 1&#x2033; OC, the combustion reaction propagates via hot gases because the pressure inside this portion of the enclosure is relatively high due to the relative shortage of apertures to relieve the pressure; thus, there is a driving pressure force urging the hot gases further down the enclosure. In the sections where the aperture spacing is &#xbd;&#x2033; OC, the combustion reaction still propagates via hot gases but at a slower rate because the internal pressure is relatively lower, due to the shorter distance between apertures. In the sections where the aperture spacing is &#xbc;&#x2033; OC, apertures <b>40</b> are relatively numerous, permitting the enclosure internal pressure to be more easily relieved; thus, there is minimal driving pressure force urging the hot gases further down the length of the enclosure. In this case, the combustion reaction continues to propagate at a relatively slower rate as each tablet <b>24</b> ignites the next adjacent tablet as it burns.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, it is believed that a relatively greater spacing between enclosure apertures <b>40</b> produces a correspondingly greater pressure within enclosure <b>22</b>, resulting in a more rapid propagation (via hot gases) of the combustion reaction along the portion of the gas generant residing between the spaced-apart apertures. The more rapid propagation of the combustion reaction results in a more rapid burning of the gas generant and, thus, a more rapid generation of inflation gas, and more rapid inflation of an associated airbag, for example. Therefore, to affect the propagation rate of a combustion reaction along a portion of the enclosure, the apertures along the portion of the enclosure may be spaced apart a distance proportional to a desired rate of propagation of a combustion reaction of gas generant positioned between the apertures. Therefore, the combustion propagation rate may be tailored using an appropriate arrangement of enclosure apertures, to accommodate greater or lesser desired airbag inflation rates, and also to accommodate desired shorter or longer inflation durations. It should be appreciated that the type of propellant or gas generant composition <b>24</b> employed, for example those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,035,757, 5,872,329, and 6,210,505, each herein incorporated by reference, may also be determinative of the desired combustion propagation rate across the length of the propellant tube <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the propellant employed will affect the aperture open area along the length of the propellant tube. As different propellants are employed, the &#x201c;aperture open area/unit length of the propellant tube&#x201d; may be iteratively determined by experimental methods to produce the desired propagation rate across the length of the enclosure or propellant tube. For example, propellant tubes containing the same propellant could be perforated with different open areas per unit length across the length of the propellant tube in accordance with the present invention, and then qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated for sustained combustion, combustion propagation, inflation profile of an associated airbag, gas generating duration, inflator pressure across the length thereof, and other design criteria.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In view of the data given above, the present invention includes a propellant tube <b>22</b> having a plurality of gas exit apertures <b>40</b> wherein the area of each hole is calculated and a total open aperture area or sum is calculated by adding the gas exit aperture areas together. A first perforated section <b>23</b> or portion of the propellant tube <b>22</b> is fixed closest to the igniter <b>26</b>, wherein the first portion <b>23</b> includes less than half of the total open aperture area. A second perforated section <b>25</b> or portion of the propellant tube <b>22</b> is integral to and in coaxial relation with the first portion <b>23</b>, wherein the second portion <b>25</b> includes more than half of the total open aperture area. As exemplified in the table given above, the first portion <b>23</b> may include up to 75% of the total length of the propellant tube <b>22</b>, for example. On the other hand, the second portion <b>25</b> may include as little as 25% of the total length of the propellant tube <b>22</b>, for example. It should be appreciated that in a preferred embodiment, the first half <b>27</b> of the tube <b>22</b> will contain less than half of the total open aperture area, and the second half <b>29</b> of the propellant tube <b>22</b> will contain more than half of the total open aperture area. As discussed above, the respective first and second gas exit aperture areas of either the first or second sections may be tailored by the number and size of respective gas exit apertures included in either section.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Accordingly, consistent with the table given above, the present invention may also be characterized as an elongated inflator <b>10</b> comprising a plurality of collinear and integral sections that together constitute a single perforated tube <b>22</b>. As such, in this embodiment, a first section nearest to an associated igniter, a second section juxtaposed to the first section, a third section juxtaposed to the second section, and a fourth section farthest from the igniter and juxtaposed to the third section constitute the propellant tube internal to the inflator. More generally, the present invention includes an elongated inflator <b>10</b> that contains an elongated propellant tube <b>22</b> substantially coextensive therewith. A first end <b>31</b> of the propellant tube <b>22</b> is fixed to an associated igniter <b>26</b>. A second end <b>33</b> of the propellant tube <b>22</b> is preferably capped to seal off the flow of combustion gases upon inflator <b>10</b> activation. A plurality of gas exit orifices <b>40</b> is formed within the propellant tube <b>22</b> from the first end to the second end. As supported in the table shown above relative to overall open aperture area, the number and/or size of the apertures increases per unit length from the first end to the second end.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is noted that the stacking of substantially uniform gas generant tablets <b>24</b> adjacent each other along enclosure <b>22</b> provides for a relatively constant average density of gas generant along the enclosure. Also, the use of an enclosure having a substantially constant cross-sectional area along the length of the enclosure provides for a substantially constant volume per unit length of the enclosure. These features aid in minimizing pressure variations within the enclosure due to such factors as variations in enclosure volume, and localized hot spots and higher pressure regions resulting from disparities in gas generant distribution along the enclosure. The dome-shaped faces of each propellant tablet further facilitates an ease of assembly in that each dome-shaped face provides a pivot point at its apex that physically communicates with the apex of an adjacent tablet's propellant face. Accordingly, by virtue of the pivot point created on each dome-shaped face, the same juxtaposed orientation of each propellant tablet is assured without undue complication.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Upon activation of the inflator, it is believed that the magnitude of the pressure drop along the inflator is related to the total number of apertures along the respective gas generant enclosure. It is also believed that a greater number of apertures along the enclosure, spaced along a greater length of the enclosure, provides a greater total aperture area for relief of enclosure internal pressure. Thus, a greater number of apertures along the gas generant enclosure may serve to reduce the combustion propagation rate relative to an enclosure having relatively fewer apertures, because of the relatively larger pressure drop in the enclosure having the greater number of apertures. Therefore, to affect the propagation rate of a combustion reaction along a portion of the enclosure, the number of apertures provided along the portion of the enclosure is made inversely proportional to a desired rate of propagation of a combustion reaction along the gas generant positioned between the apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an inflator constructed in accordance with the principles outlined above may be incorporated into a vehicle occupant restraint system <b>200</b>. Vehicle occupant restraint system <b>200</b> includes at least one airbag <b>202</b> (a side-curtain airbag in the embodiment shown) and an inflator <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention and coupled to airbag <b>202</b> so as to enable fluid communication with an interior of the airbag. Vehicle occupant restraint system <b>200</b> may be in operative communication with a crash event sensor <b>211</b> which communicates with a known crash sensor algorithm that signals actuation of vehicle occupant restraint system <b>200</b> via, for example, activation of airbag inflator <b>10</b> in the event of a collision.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In yet another aspect of the present invention, the pyrotechnic inflator described above or other similarly constructed inflators such as those exemplified and described in U.S. application Ser. Nos. 09/846,004 and 10/662,771 (each incorporated herein by reference), may be configured as a structural member of a vehicle. As used herein, the use of the inflator housing as a &#x201c;structural member&#x201d; refers to the use of the housing in a structural role (such as load bearing or impact resistance) separate from the function of a conventional inflator (i.e., supplying an inflation fluid to an airbag or other inflatable element of a vehicle occupant protection system). Generally, such a structural role would normally be performed by an element different from a conventional inflator.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-21</figref> show examples of ways in which an inflator housing <b>12</b> in accordance with the present invention may be employed as a primary, stand-alone structural member in a vehicle, or as a member used to reinforce another structural member in the vehicle. Where the inflator housing is used as a stand-alone structural member, the housing may be fabricated in the desired shape of the structural member (for example, a frame used in a vehicle door). Alternatively, the housing may comprise a cavity portion having a cylindrical cross-section as previously described. The cylindrical cavity portion may serve as the structural member, or the housing may include one or more extensions coupled to the cavity portion as described herein to provide a structural member having the desired configuration. Where the inflator housing is used to reinforce another structural member, the housing may comprise a cavity portion having a cylindrical cross-section as previously described. The cylindrical cavity portion may be detachably coupled to the other structural member to provide the reinforcement, or the housing may include one or more extensions detachably coupled to the cavity portion as described herein to provide the reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Both in cases where the inflator housing is used as a stand-alone structural member and in cases where the inflator housing is intended to serve as reinforcement for another structural member of the vehicle, the configuration of the housing may be optimized for resistance to impact forces. In one example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, housing <b>12</b> is formed with a generally rectangular shape. In the cross-section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the average distance of the housing material from a neutral axis <b>110</b> of the cross-section is greater than the average distance of the housing material in a circular cross-section (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) from its corresponding neutral axis <b>120</b>. As is known in the art, increasing the average distance of the housing material from a neutral axis extending perpendicular to an applied bending force will increase the resistance of the cross-section to the bending force. Housing <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is preferably oriented within the vehicle such that a projected resultant collision force vector acts along a line indicated by arrow &#x201c;A&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A stiffening of the inflator housing is also produced by employing cross-sections shaped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a plurality of corrugations <b>130</b> are formed along at least one surface of inflator housing <b>12</b>-<i>b</i>. Corrugations <b>130</b> act as stiffening members for resisting an impact force along an axis indicated by arrow &#x201c;B&#x201d;. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a &#x201c;T&#x201d;-section is formed along a side of a cylindrical housing cavity portion <b>12</b>-<i>c</i>. The combination of the &#x201c;T&#x201d;-section and the cylindrical cavity portion acts as a modified &#x201c;I&#x201d;-beam, stiffening the inflator housing cross-section against a resultant force acting along an axis indicated by arrow &#x201c;C&#x201d;. The cross-sections shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> may be produced by extrusion or any other suitable method. In addition, inflator cavity portions and extensions formed into any one of many other possible cross-sections may be used. However, the configuration of cavity portion <b>11</b> should enable use of the cavity portion as a structural member or as a support for another vehicle structural member. Either the cavity portion alone should be usable as a structural member or support, or the cavity portion should be usable as a structural member or support when coupled to extensions, other inflator housings, or other structural members, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As explained above, inflator housing <b>12</b> alone may be used as a structural member for reinforcing another structural member of the vehicle. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, in other embodiments, housing <b>12</b> includes one or more extensions <b>150</b> extending from cavity portion <b>11</b> containing gas generant <b>24</b> and igniter <b>26</b>. Extensions <b>150</b> further augment the structural and safety advantages of using inflator housing <b>12</b> as a reinforcement member by enabling the housing to be fabricated into any of a wide variety of shapes conforming to the contours of various other structural members (for example, vehicle roof pillars), according to design requirements. Extensions <b>150</b> may be solid or substantially hollow. Extensions <b>150</b> may also be formed integral with cavity portion <b>11</b>. Alternatively, extensions <b>150</b> may comprise separate pieces that may be coupled to cavity portion <b>11</b> in a manner described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, where extension <b>150</b> is formed from a discrete member and attached to housing cavity portion <b>11</b>, a coupling means, generally designated <b>60</b>, is provided to enable detachable coupling of the extension to the cavity portion. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, in one embodiment, the coupling means comprises an engaging portion <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> on the housing cavity portion <b>11</b> configured for engaging a complementary engaging portion <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> of extension <b>150</b>. Any of several methods may be used to provide engagement between engaging portions <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>150</b>-<b>1</b>. In one embodiment, engaging portions <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> are configured for engaging each other in an interference fit. In another embodiment, engaging portions <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> are configured for threadedly engaging each other.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a collar <b>155</b> may be provided for facilitating either threaded or press-fit engagement of both cavity portion <b>11</b> and extension <b>150</b>. Collar <b>155</b> is either internally threaded or designed to engage one or both of cavity portion <b>11</b> and extension <b>150</b> in an interference fit, as desired. In further embodiments, coupling between cavity portion <b>11</b> and extensions <b>150</b>, other inflators, or other vehicle structural members may be effected by welding, brazing, adhesive application, fasteners, etc. In addition, polarization features may be incorporated into the coupling means to aid in orienting and securing cavity portion <b>11</b> and extension <b>150</b> with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Engaging portions <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> may comprise one or more threaded projections or openings provided along cavity portion <b>11</b> for engaging complementarily threaded projections or openings on end portions of extension <b>150</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>11</b>, and <b>12</b>, multiple attachment points may be provided along inflator housing <b>12</b> for receiving portions of extensions <b>150</b> therein, for connecting to additional inflators, or for connecting to other vehicle structural members, according to design requirements. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows one embodiment of a housing cavity portion <b>11</b> configured for attachment to one of more extensions <b>150</b>, to one or more additional inflators, or to multiple additional vehicle structural members, as described herein. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, endcaps <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> are provided at each end of housing cavity portion <b>11</b>. Endcaps <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> are secured in position using a suitable securement method (for example, crimping of the housing as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Endcaps <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> hermetically seal the portion of inflator housing <b>12</b> containing gas-generating components. An access orifice <b>165</b> may be provided in a wall of the inflator housing <b>12</b> to enable electrical connection of igniter <b>26</b> to an igniter activation circuit via wires or a cable (not shown). The coupling means <b>60</b>, for coupling either extension <b>150</b> or another structural member of the vehicle to the inflator housing, is provided at each end portion of the housing cavity portion <b>11</b>, on a side of housing crimp <b>170</b> opposite a respective one of endcaps <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>. Coupling means <b>60</b> are also provided along cavity portion <b>11</b> intermediate ends <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the coupling means comprises a plurality of internal threads <b>175</b> formed in cavity portion <b>11</b>. Threads <b>175</b> are adapted for engaging complementary threads formed along an extension <b>150</b>, another inflator, or another structural member of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, where the inflator housing is to be used to reinforce another structural member in the vehicle, another coupling means is provided along inflator housing <b>12</b> to enable coupling of the housing to the other structural member. Inflator housing <b>12</b> is preferably coupled to a portion of the vehicle using a method that secures the inflator housing in intimate contact with the vehicle before and during a collision event. This enables immediate and efficient transmission of collision forces to the inflator housing via the structural member to which the inflator housing is secured. Attachment methods such as welding or adhesive bonding may be suitable for this purpose. In a particular embodiment, the method of securing housing <b>12</b> to the vehicle permits relatively easy removal of the inflator housing for replacement after the inflator has been activated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an embodiment of one exemplary method for coupling inflator housing <b>12</b> to a vehicle. An inflator housing cavity portion <b>11</b> and an extension <b>150</b>, as previously described, are coupled to a structural member (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a roof section) of a vehicle, extending between the vehicle C-pillar and the A-pillar, with extension <b>150</b> also extending along the A-pillar. A plurality of actuatable brackets <b>180</b> are welded or otherwise suitably secured along a structural member <b>185</b> of the vehicle to which inflator housing <b>12</b> is to be coupled. Brackets <b>180</b> may be opened to permit insertion and removal of inflator housing <b>12</b>, and closed to secure housing <b>12</b> therein. When brackets <b>180</b> are closed, the brackets engage inflator housing <b>12</b> in an interference fit to secure the inflator housing in intimate contact with structural member <b>185</b>. Brackets <b>180</b> are preferably secured to structural member <b>185</b> in a manner that prevents the brackets from separating from the structural member during collision, thereby enabling transmission of collision forces to inflator housing <b>12</b>. In an alternative embodiment, inflator cavity portion <b>11</b> and extension <b>150</b> are welded or otherwise non-detachably coupled to brackets <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Other, alternative methods for coupling inflator housing <b>12</b> to another structural member of the vehicle are also contemplated. The actual method used to couple the inflator housing to the other structural member may be based on design requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-11</figref>, and <b>12</b> show several exemplary embodiments of inflator housings used for reinforcing other structural members of a vehicle. In essence, the inflator housing is configured for coupling to another structural member of a vehicle so as to reinforce the other structural member in the area in which the inflator housing is coupled. The other structural member is reinforced by the structure and inherent strength of inflator housing <b>12</b>. Accordingly, airbag modules incorporating an airbag and a pyrotechnic inflator as described herein provide structural advantages and enhanced safety features heretofore not featured by side curtain airbag modules.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an embodiment in which extension <b>150</b> is formed integral with cavity portion <b>11</b>. As explained previously, extension <b>150</b> may be either solid or substantially hollow. In cases where extension <b>150</b> is hollow, an end closure (such as <b>30</b> or <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is provided to hermetically seal cavity portion <b>11</b>, thereby fluidly isolating cavity portion <b>11</b> from an interior portion of extension <b>150</b> to prevent leakage of inflation gas therein.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a particular embodiment in which a network of cavity portions <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b </i>and extensions <b>150</b> are incorporated into the vehicle roof and roof support pillars. Cavity portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>extend along sides of the vehicle roof between the A-pillars and the C-pillars. Cavity portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>are configured to inflate side-curtain airbags (not shown) along the driver side and passenger side of the vehicle. Cavity portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>is coupled to both of cavity portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>in a manner previously described. Cavity portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>is configured to inflate a ceiling-mounted airbag actuatable, for example, in the event of a vehicle rollover accident. In addition, multiple extensions <b>150</b> are coupled to cavity portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>in a manner previously described. Cavity portions <b>150</b> are also coupled to (and extend along) the vehicle A-pillars and C-pillars to provide reinforcement for these vehicle structural members. Extensions <b>150</b> also span the vehicle roof to connect opposite cavity portions <b>11</b><i>a</i>, thereby providing added strength to the support structure. The interconnected support structure formed by coupling cavity members and extensions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> provides a &#x201c;cage&#x201d; partially enclosing the driver and passengers of the vehicle. In this manner, the inflator housings (comprising cavity portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>and extensions <b>150</b>) increase the strength of the roof structure of the vehicle while also providing inflation gas to multiple inflators, thereby greatly enhancing vehicle occupant protection.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In yet another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, inflator housing <b>12</b> is positioned and secured to a vehicle roof <b>185</b> within the trim extending between vehicle roof pillars &#x201c;A&#x201d; and &#x201c;C&#x201d;, to inflate a side-curtain airbag for protecting vehicle occupants during side collisions. When positioned as shown and secured to a portion of vehicle roof <b>185</b> (and, optionally, to one or more of vehicle roof pillars &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d;, and &#x201c;C&#x201d;), inflator housing <b>12</b> acts to strengthen and stiffen the portion of the roof to which it is attached. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the inflator housing is shown welded to a section of the vehicle roof extending between the A-pillar and the C-pillar.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in another embodiment, inflator housing <b>12</b> is formed into a vehicle bumper (or a portion of the bumper). The inflator housing includes a cavity portion extending substantially across the width of the vehicle and an extension <b>150</b> coupled to each end of the cavity portion. Extensions serve to couple cavity portion <b>11</b> to the frame of the vehicle. In this configuration, inflator housing absorbs collision forces incident on the bumper while simultaneously generating and supplying inflation gas to an inflatable element (for example, a bladder) of the vehicle bumper system. Bumper systems incorporating inflatable elements are known in the art. Several examples of such systems include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,651,569 and 6,389,777, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In yet another aspect of the invention, a vehicle component is provided wherein the present inflator not only functions to provide a relatively quicker and more uniform inflation of the associated airbag, but also functions to provide structural enhancement to the respective component. By providing the inflator as an integral part of the associated component, a modular assembly at the ultimate assembly point is also facilitated, thereby simplifying the manufacturing process of the respective component. The vehicular components may for example include vehicle doors, seats, instrument panels and so forth. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, it will be appreciated that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-21</figref>, the present inflator typically encompasses all, or substantially all, of the expanse or dimension of a particular member of the respective vehicle component. Stated another way, the inflator may be oriented along a dimensional measurement defined as the length, width, depth, or other dimension of the respective vehicle component. Further, as described herein, the inflator <b>22</b> has a propellant bed <b>24</b> that spans the length of the inflator <b>22</b>, thereby providing uniform inflation of an airbag <b>25</b> when the inflator <b>22</b> is activated upon a crash event.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, a vehicle seat <b>302</b> employing an inflator <b>310</b> of the present invention is shown. It will be appreciated that an inflator <b>310</b> as described herein is integrated into a seat frame or assembly <b>304</b> by welding or otherwise fixing the inflator <b>310</b> thereto. As shown, the inflator <b>310</b> extends for at least substantially all of the height or dimensional measurement <b>323</b> of the seat <b>302</b>, or for at least substantially all of the respective dimension correlating to the structural member replaced by the inflator <b>310</b>, thereby providing uniform inflation of an airbag <b>325</b> associated therewith. The airbag or inflatable cushion <b>325</b> may be formed as known in the art. As with any of the embodiments, the inflator <b>310</b> may be positioned within the length of the airbag <b>325</b>, whereby the airbag <b>325</b> is simply laterally folded, and then stored along side the inflator <b>310</b> in substantial coextensive relation with the height of the seat. As exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 5,588,671, herein incorporated by reference, the seat <b>302</b> may be provided with a tear seam <b>306</b> or other release mechanism as known in the art, thereby providing release of the airbag <b>325</b> upon gas generator <b>310</b> activation. As exemplified in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,630,616 and 6,709,053, herein incorporated by reference, other features of the seat <b>302</b> may be manufactured or provided as known in the art. In operation, by employing an inflator <b>310</b> of the present invention, the airbag <b>325</b> is essentially uniformly inflated across the height (or depth) of the seat <b>302</b> thereby increasing the relative speed of inflation as compared to other airbag/inflator designs and also maximizing the occupant protection provided by the airbag <b>325</b>. Furthermore, the inflator <b>310</b> functions as a structural member of the seat <b>302</b> thereby enhancing the occupant protection and comfort afforded thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, a vehicle door <b>402</b> employing an inflator <b>410</b> of the present invention is shown. It will be appreciated that an inflator <b>410</b> as described herein is integrated into the door assembly <b>402</b> thereby functioning as a side intrusion beam assembly for occupant protection during a side crash event. Again, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the inflator <b>410</b> extends for at least substantially all or most of the length of the door <b>402</b>. As with any of the embodiments, it will be appreciated that the inflator <b>410</b> could, on the other hand, be placed in an orthogonal or oblique cross orientation relative to the length of the vehicle component or door <b>402</b> in this case, thereby tailoring the deployment of the airbag <b>425</b> to design criteria while yet still providing structural enhancement within the door. U.S. Pat. No. 5,813,719 exemplifies one method of fixing the inflator <b>410</b> to the door <b>402</b>. It will be appreciated that other methods may be employed as understood by one of ordinary skill. In essence, an elongated inflator <b>410</b> of the present invention is welded to brackets <b>423</b> that are integral with or integrated to the door assembly <b>402</b>. As exemplified in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,439,248 and 5,431,435, herein incorporated by reference, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the door <b>402</b> may be provided with a detachable inner trim panel (not shown) facing the occupant, or, with a flexible door panel <b>404</b> having a tear seam <b>406</b>, or, with any other airbag release mechanism known in the art, thereby providing release of the airbag upon gas generator activation. As exemplified in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,378,896, 4,966,388, and 5,865,496, other features of the door assembly <b>402</b> may be manufactured or provided as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In yet another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, a vehicle dashboard or instrument panel <b>502</b> employing an inflator <b>510</b> of the present invention is shown. It will be appreciated that an inflator <b>510</b> as described herein is integrated into the instrument panel <b>502</b> thereby functioning as a structural support across the front of the passenger cavity <b>504</b>. Again, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the inflator <b>510</b> extends for at least substantially all or most of the length of the instrument panel <b>502</b>. A gas generant bed <b>524</b> is substantially coextensive with the length of the inflator <b>510</b>. The inflator <b>510</b> may be welded to the structural elements <b>512</b> underlying the instrument panel <b>502</b> in the same way that the inflator <b>510</b> is welded within the door <b>502</b> described above. As exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 6,386,580, herein incorporated by reference, the instrument panel <b>502</b> may be provided with a door, tear seam portion, or other airbag release mechanism as known in the art, thereby releasing the airbag <b>525</b> upon activation of gas generator <b>510</b>. As also exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 6,386,580, other features of the instrument panel <b>502</b> may be formed or provided as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In sum, the present invention includes a vehicle component employing an airbag inflator not only as a gas generating means, but also as a structural member within the respective component. Accordingly, the inflators of the present invention incorporate hard and tough materials including steel, metal, or similarly strong materials. The inflator spans at least one desired dimension of the vehicle component thereby ensuring structural support and inflatable protection across the span of the desired dimension (height, depth, width, etc). The present invention also contemplates a method of manufacturing a vehicle component by welding or otherwise fixing an inflator within the component in substantial coextension with at least one desired dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In yet another aspect of the invention, a method of manufacturing a vehicle component having at least one dimensional length is described, the method comprising the steps of: 1) providing an elongated perforated inflator substantially coextensive with the at least one dimensional length; 2) fixing the elongated perforated inflator within the vehicle component along the at least one dimensional length; 3) providing a propellant bed substantially coextensive with the elongated perforated inflator; and 4) providing an airbag in fluid communication with the inflator and substantially coextensive therewith, the airbag stored within the vehicle component.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A variety of fabrication methods may be used to construct an inflator housing having the desired form, depending upon the design requirements of the structural member in question. Manufacturing methods such as casting, machining, stamping, forming, molding, etc., may be used, depending on design requirements. Where the inflator housing is configured as a structural member of the vehicle, the housing/structural member may be attached to the remainder of the vehicle using methods normally used for attaching conventional, similarly-functioning structural members to a vehicle. The attachment method or methods used will vary according to the design requirements of the components to be joined, and may include various forms of welding or the use of fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the embodiments discussed above, where the inflator housing is used as a structural member of the vehicle, it will be appreciated that the design of the inflator housing will comply with all regulations and standards for vehicle structural members promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Therefore, an inflator housing in accordance with the present invention may be employed as a primary, stand-alone structural member in a vehicle, or as a member used to reinforce another structural member in the vehicle. Where the inflator housing is used as a stand-alone structural member, the housing may be fabricated in the desired shape of the structural member. Alternatively, the housing may be formed having a cavity portion with a cylindrical cross-section as described herein. The cylindrical cavity portion may serve as the structural member, or one or more extensions as described herein may be detachably coupled to the cavity portion to provide a structural member having the desired configuration. Where the inflator housing is used to reinforce another structural member, the housing may be formed with a cavity portion having a cylindrical cross-section as described herein. The cylindrical cavity portion may be detachably coupled to the other structural member to provide the reinforcement, or one or more extensions as described herein may be detachably coupled to the cavity portion to provide the reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It will be understood that the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment(s) of the present invention is for illustrative purposes only. As such, the various structural and operational features herein disclosed are susceptible to a number of modifications commensurate with the abilities of one of ordinary skill in the art, none of which departs from the scope of the present invention. For instance, in inflator <b>10</b>, the aperture cross-sectional area may be varied from what is given in the examples. Accordingly, the average aperture diameter may range from 2.0 mm to 6.0 mm but is not thereby limited. Further, the other dimensions of inflator <b>10</b> such as the housing diameter and the housing length may be similarly modified. Other modifications will be understood in accordance with the contemplated breadth of the present inventions. The preceding description, therefore, is not meant to limit the scope of the invention. Rather, the scope of the invention is to be determined only by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
