<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to apparatus for cutting objects and more particularly pertains to a new tire shearing apparatus for facilitating faster and more uniform shearing of a tire into pieces that may be more easily transported and processed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Specialized machinery has been developed for shearing used tires into forms that are more suitable for transport and recycling of the tires. Illustrative technology is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,531,146; U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,035; U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,637; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,975,579, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The size of a tire that can be transported and/or processed may be limited, so the portion of the circumference of the tire that may be suitably included in one piece of sheared tire will vary depending upon the size of the tire and will vary greatly due to the large range in tire sizes that may be processed by the machinery. Moreover, the larger the tire, the more cuts that will have to be made in repetitive cutting operations that must maintain consistency in size so that the maximum weight is not exceeded. It may be difficult to maintain any consistency in the size of the ire segments when the operation needs to be repeated many times, even if the cycle times are relatively short. Moreover, as the length of the segment of tire will vary from one tire to the next depending upon the size of the tire, it may be difficult for an operator to remember the correct distance that the tire is to be advanced through the shear to achieve the correct length of the tire segment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to a shearing apparatus for cutting tires, and which may comprise a frame and a shearing assembly configured to shear a portion of a tire along a shear plane, with the shearing assembly including a lower shear blade structure and an upper shear blade structure mounted on the frame in a shearing relationship with the lower shear blade structure. The apparatus may also comprise a tire indexing structure configured to advance a portion of the tire a distance through the shear plane for shearing the portion of the tire at the shear plane away from a remainder of the tire. The tire indexing structure may include a tire clamping assembly configured to clamp onto a location on the tire and being movable between an initial position and a final position to move the portion of the tire through the shear plane, a carriage assembly configured to move the tire clamping assembly between the initial position and the final position, and a guide defining a path along which the carriage assembly and tire clamping assembly is movable between the initial and final positions.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 14</figref> thereof, a new tire shearing apparatus embodying the principles and concepts of the disclosed subject matter will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one aspect, the disclosure relates to a tire shearing apparatus <b>10</b> that is highly suitable for cutting or severing tires into pieces that are more easily transported and processed for purposes such as recycling. A tire <b>2</b> may include a pair of annular side walls which each include a tire bead <b>6</b> that defines the opening of the tire. The side walls extend from the tire bead to a circumferential tread wall <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The tire shearing apparatus <b>10</b> may include a frame <b>12</b> that provides support for various structures and elements of the apparatus <b>10</b>, and in some embodiments may be provided with wheels <b>14</b> to facilitate the movement of the apparatus <b>10</b> from location to location, although this is not critical to the functionality of the apparatus. The frame <b>12</b> generally extends below the other structures and assemblies of the apparatus <b>10</b> to support these elements with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The shearing apparatus <b>10</b> may include a shearing assembly <b>16</b> that is configured to shear a portion of a tire along a shear plane <b>18</b> when the tire is positioned in the assembly <b>16</b>, and typically will cut the tire along a substantially radial line across the side and tread walls on one side of the tire, so that segments of the tire are cut from the rest of the tire like pie pieces. The shear plane <b>18</b> may be a substantially vertically-oriented plane. The shearing assembly <b>16</b> may include a lower shear blade structure <b>20</b> and an upper shear blade structure <b>22</b> that are mounted on the frame <b>12</b> in a shearing relationship with each other. The lower <b>20</b> and upper <b>22</b> shear blade structures may be movable with respect to each other between an open position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) and a shear position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In some of the most preferred embodiments, the upper and lower shear blade structures form a V-shaped opening in the open position for receiving a portion of a tire to be cut, and movement of the upper and lower shear blade structures from the open to the shear position is a pivotal movement.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The lower shear blade structure <b>20</b> may be is fixedly mounted on the frame such that the lower shear blade structure is immobile when the upper and lower shear blade structures move between the open and shear positions. The lower shear blade structure <b>20</b> may include a lower shear blade <b>24</b> with a shear edge <b>26</b> in a substantially horizontal orientation. The shear edge <b>26</b> is generally oriented at the plane on which the tire to be cut is supported on the frame <b>12</b>, and may be just above or just below that plane although it is preferable that the edge is substantially in the support plane of the tire to facilitate movement of the tire into the opening formed by the upper and lower shear blade structures and to facilitate the shearing of the tire.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The lower shear blade structure may also include one or more guide elements <b>28</b> mounted on the frame adjacent to the lower shear blade and may be configured to be positioned adjacent to a portion of the upper shear blade structure when the upper shear blade structure pivots with respect to the lower shear blade structure toward the shear position. The one or more guide elements extend upwardly from the tire support plane so that the one or more guide elements are able to engage at least one of the beads of the tire being severed and thereby function to hold the tire in position in the V-shaped opening as the upper shear blade structure moves downwardly toward the shear position which tends to push the tire from the opening if not blocked by the elements.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Significantly, the one or more guide elements <b>28</b> may be elongated in a vertical direction which provides the elements with the ability to engage not only the tire bead closest to the tire support plane, but also the other tire bead if it remains on the tire carcass. Illustratively, the vertical height of the one or more elements <b>28</b> above the tire support plane may be increased to be in the range of approximately 18 inches to 22 inches which is highly suitable for engaging both beads of a tire. This elongation of the one or more guide elements <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> can avoid the tendency of the upper tire bead and side wall to creep or move over the top end of the elements as the upper shear blade structure makes contact with the tire and pushes against it to create the shearing action.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The upper shear blade structure <b>22</b> may be moveably mounted on the frame to move with respect to the fixed lower shear blade structure. The upper shear blade structure <b>22</b> may include an upper blade support arm <b>30</b> that is pivotably mounted on and movable with respect to the frame. The upper shear blade support arm <b>30</b> may have an inboard end <b>32</b> and an outboard end <b>34</b>. The inboard end <b>32</b> may be pivotally mounted on the frame <b>12</b> and the outboard end <b>34</b> may swing in an arc when the upper blade support arm is pivoted between the open and shear positions.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The upper shear blade structure <b>22</b> may further include an upper shear blade <b>36</b> that is mounted on the upper shear blade support arm <b>30</b> and may extend for substantially the entire length of the arm. The upper shear blade <b>36</b> may be positioned adjacent to the lower shear blade <b>24</b> when the upper and lower shear blade structures are in the shear position, and may be spaced from the lower shear blade when the upper and lower shear blade structures are in the open position. The upper shear blade may also have a shear edge that may contact as the shear blade structures move from the open to the shear position. The upper <b>36</b> and lower <b>24</b> shear blades may have respective shear surfaces <b>37</b>, <b>25</b> that extend from the respective shear edges of the respective blades. The shear surfaces are in contact with each other in the shear position of the upper and lower shear structures, and a plane of the shear surface <b>37</b> of the upper shear blade <b>36</b> is preferably parallel to a plane of the shear surface <b>25</b> of the lower shear blade <b>26</b> such that the shear surfaces are in abutment when the upper and lower shear structures are in the shear position. Gaps between the shear surfaces of the blades caused by shear surfaces that lie in diverging planes that have previously been used tend to allow portions of the tire to move in between the shear surfaces and tend to impede or impair the movement of the blade structures.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The upper shear blade structure may further include an upper grip element <b>40</b> that is configured to grip a tire positioned between the upper and lower shear blade structures when the upper shear blade structure moves toward the lower shear blade structure to achieve the shear position. The smooth and linear nature of the blades <b>24</b>, <b>36</b> tend to permit the tire to slide along the shear edges and surfaces unless there is some resistance to the movement. The upper grip element <b>40</b> having a lower edge <b>42</b> that is contoured to grip a tire positioned in the V-shaped opening, and may be mounted on the upper blade support arm <b>30</b> adjacent to the upper shear blade, and may even protrude beyond the shear edge of the upper shear blade. The lower edge <b>42</b> may have a plurality of arcuate divots <b>44</b> and may also have a plurality of flats <b>45</b>, with a flat being positioned between each of the divots to space the divots from each other. In some of the most preferable embodiments, the arcuate divots <b>44</b> are semicircular in shape. The arcuate divots are highly effective for engaging the tire to resist sliding of the tire along the shear edge of the upper shear blade <b>36</b> as the blade <b>36</b> moves downwardly and apply pressure to the tire.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A pivot mount <b>48</b> may be mounted on the frame <b>12</b> to support the upper blade support arm <b>30</b> in a manner that permits the pivot movement of the arm <b>30</b>. The pivot mount <b>48</b> may include a pivot pin <b>50</b> and a pair of pin supports <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> that are mounted on the frame in a spaced relationship with respect to each other with the pivot pin extending between the pin supports. The inboard end <b>32</b> of the upper blade support arm may be positioned between the pin supports with the pin <b>50</b> passing through the arm and extending at least partially into the supports <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The apparatus <b>10</b> may also include a thrust adjustment assembly <b>54</b> that provides an adjustable degree of thrust correction for the upper shearing blade structure <b>22</b> as the blade structure <b>22</b> moves from the open position to the shear position to bias the upper shear blade against the lower shear blade even as the tire being sheared tends to force these elements out of alignment and out of contact with each other as the upper shear blade structure pivots downwardly. The thrust adjustment assembly <b>54</b> may include a thrust plate <b>56</b> that is positioned alongside the path of a portion of the upper shearing blade structure <b>22</b> and contacts the blade structure <b>22</b> as it descends. The thrust plate <b>56</b> may be mounted to a thrust plate support <b>58</b> positioned behind the thrust plate <b>56</b>, Collectively the thrust plate and thrust plate support may form a stop or barrier to resist the tire being sheared from sliding away from the shearing assembly <b>16</b> as the upper shear blade structure moves downwardly. In some embodiments, a roller <b>60</b> is mounted on the upper shear blade structure <b>22</b> that is positioned to contact the face <b>57</b> of the thrust plate <b>56</b> along a portion of the movement of the blade structure <b>22</b> toward the shear position such that movement close to the shear position is guided by contact between the roller and the thrust plate.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Advantageously, the position of the thrust plate, or at least the face <b>57</b> of the thrust plate, is adjustable to permit movement of the face <b>57</b> relatively closer and farther from the shear edge <b>26</b> of the lower shear blade and thereby adjust the path of the upper shear blade <b>36</b> to be closer to the lower shear blade <b>24</b>, such as ear of the parts occurs. In the illustrative embodiments, the position of the thrust plate with respect to the thrust plate support may be adjusted by one of more fasteners that extend into the thrust plate and the thrust plate support and are threaded to adjust the proximity of these elements to each other by rotating the fasteners. Optionally, other elements may be used to adjust the proximity of these elements.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The apparatus <b>10</b> may also include a tire support structure <b>70</b> that is mounted on the frame <b>12</b> and is configured to support a tire in the support plane and at a level that permits the tire to be advanced over the lower shear blade structure <b>20</b>. The tire support structure <b>70</b> may include at least one roller <b>72</b> on which a tire may be rested and the tire may be rotated about a substantially horizontal axis to rotate the tire about a substantially vertical axis. The tire support structure may include a plurality of rollers that are arranged to support locations along the circumference of the tire, and may be oriented, for example, at 90 degree intervals. The rollers may be positioned on substantially opposite positions with respect to the shear plane and may also be positioned in the shear plane. The tire support structure <b>70</b> may also include a support surface <b>74</b> that substantially corresponds to the support plane, and may be located on or both sides of the shear plane.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The tire shearing apparatus <b>10</b> may also include a tire indexing structure <b>80</b> that is configured to advance a portion of the tire for a distance through the shear plane, with the distance of advancement being substantially uniform at each movement of the tire so that consistency in the size and weight of the tire segments may be achieved. The distance of advancement may be adjustable through adjustment of the tire indexing structure, so that the distance may be adjusted to reflect the size of the tire and the resulting tire segment weight and size may controlled. The tire indexing structure <b>80</b> thus moves the tire between the upper and lower shear blade structures so that the shear plane defined by the blades <b>24</b>, <b>36</b> cross the location on the tire where shearing the tire will result in a tire segment of desired size.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The tire indexing structure may include a tire clamping assembly <b>82</b> that is configured to clamp onto a portion of the tire for the purpose of holding onto the tire while the tire is being moved, and in some implementations holding onto the tire until after the shearing has been accomplished, but the clamping assembly may release the tire after movement has been achieved but prior to shearing. The clamping assembly engages a location on the tire that is adjacent to but not a part of the portion of the tire that is to be sheared away in the next shearing operation, which allows the clamping assembly to remain engaged with the tire while the shearing operation is occurring to help stabilize the tire carcass against movement during shearing.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The tire clamping assembly <b>82</b> may be movable between an initial position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and a final position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). The final position may be located relatively closer to the shear plane than the initial position. The distance between the initial position of the clamping assembly and the final position of the assembly may generally correspond to the distance of advancement of the tire through the shear plane. The distance between the initial and final positions of the assembly <b>82</b> may be adjustable to adjust the size or length of the tire segment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The damping assembly <b>82</b> may include at least one clamp <b>84</b> that is configured to clamp onto a portion of the wall of the tire, and in some of the most preferred embodiments includes a pair of the clamps <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>. Each of the clamps may include a clamp arm <b>86</b> that is movable and preferably pivotable between a clamp position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which is generally employed when the tire is being advanced through the shear plane and engaged by the arm and a release position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) which is generally employed when the tire clamping structure is being repositioned with respect to the tire after a shearing operation has been completed, and another portion of the tire needs to be advanced through the shear plane. The clamp position may be characterized by the clamp arms <b>86</b> contacting and pressing against a location on the tire, and the release position may be characterized by the clamp being moved out of contact or engagement with the tire. In the illustrative embodiments, the clamp arms <b>86</b> are substantially C shaped with a deep depth to allow the arm to reach over the side wall and bead of the tire and reach into the interior of the tire and engage the inner surface <b>9</b> of the tread wall with an end or tip <b>87</b> of the clamp arm.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each of the clamps <b>84</b>, <b>85</b> may include an upright member <b>88</b>, and the clamp arm <b>86</b> may be mounted on the upright member, and preferably is pivotally mounted thereon. An end of the clamp arm <b>86</b> that is located opposite of the tip <b>87</b> may be connected to the upright member, and the tip <b>87</b> may be configured so that it presses the portion of the tire that it engages against the upright member <b>88</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Each of the clamps <b>84</b>, <b>85</b> may also include a clamp actuator <b>90</b> that is configured to move the clamp arm <b>86</b> with respect to the upright member <b>88</b>, and to accomplish this movement the clamp actuator may be connected to the clamp arm and the upright member.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The tire indexing structure may further include a carriage assembly <b>92</b> that may generally support and move the tire clamping assembly <b>82</b>. The carriage assembly <b>92</b> may move the tire clamping assembly from the initial position to the final position as the tire is advanced through the shear plane, and also from the final position to the initial position after the shearing operation when another location on the tire needs to be engaged for the next movement. The clamp or clamps <b>84</b>, <b>85</b> may be mounted on the carriage assembly, and illustratively the upright member <b>88</b> extends through the carriage assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The carriage assembly may include at least one carriage plate <b>94</b>, and may include a pair of carriage plates <b>94</b>, <b>95</b> that may be spaced from each other but oriented generally parallel o each other. A hole <b>96</b> may extend through each of the carriage plates <b>94</b>, <b>95</b> and an upright member <b>88</b> may extend through the hole. The carriage plate or plates are generally moveable between the initial and final positions of the tire The carriage assembly <b>92</b> may include an indexing actuator <b>98</b> that is configured to move the carriage plate or plates between a position corresponding to the initial position of the tire clamping assembly and a position corresponding to the final position of the tire clamping assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The tire indexing structure <b>80</b> may also include a guide <b>104</b> which may define a path along which the carriage assembly <b>92</b> and tire clamping assembly <b>82</b> may be movable. The path may be generally arcuate in character, although this is not critical. The guide <b>104</b> may include at least one guide plate <b>106</b>, and may include a pair of guide plates <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>. The guide plate or plates may be spaced from each other, with one of the carriage plates <b>95</b> being located in the space between the guide plates. A slot <b>108</b> may extend through the guide plate and may define the path along which the assemblies <b>82</b>, <b>92</b> move. At least one, and preferably both, of the upright members <b>88</b> may extend through the slot to facilitate the movement of the assemblies <b>82</b>, <b>92</b> along the path. The slot <b>108</b> may have a shape that generally corresponds to the shape of the path. The length of the slot may define the extremes for the initial and final position of the tire clamping assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Another part of the tire indexing structure <b>80</b> may be an adjustment assembly <b>110</b> that is configured to adjust the distance between the initial position and the final position of the tire clamping assembly. The adjustment assembly may be configured to stop movement of the carriage assembly <b>92</b> along the guide <b>104</b> when the adjustment assembly is activated. The adjustment assembly may be configured to deactivate the indexing actuator <b>98</b> of the carriage assembly when the carriage assembly engages or contacts an element of the adjustment assembly. In some embodiments, the adjustment assembly <b>110</b> is configured to permit adjustment of the initial position of the tire clamping assembly while the final position remains relatively unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The adjustment assembly <b>110</b> may include a deactivating switch <b>112</b> that is positioned to be contacted and actuated as the carriage assembly and tire clamping assembly move along the path of the guide <b>104</b>. The switch <b>112</b> may include, for example, a switch arm <b>114</b> that may be contacted by a stop <b>116</b>. Illustratively, the switch arm <b>114</b> may be mounted on a relatively stationary element of the apparatus <b>10</b> and the stop <b>116</b> may be mounted on a movable element, although this is not critical and the reverse may be utilized. The position of the switch arm <b>114</b> or the stop <b>116</b> may be adjustable so as to adjust the point along the path at which the stop engages the deactivating switch, and thus sets the initial position of the tire clamping assembly. Illustratively, the position of the stop <b>116</b> may be adjustable, and the stop may be mounted on the carriage assembly <b>92</b>, such as, for example, on one of the carriage plates. The stop <b>116</b> may be slidable along a portion of the carriage plate <b>95</b> to set the relative position of the initial position of the tire clamping assembly. In such an illustrative embodiment, the deactivating switch <b>112</b> may be mounted on the guide <b>104</b>, and may be attached to one of the guide plates <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>. The deactivating switch may comprise a limit switch that is actuated by physical contact with the switch, although other type of switches that sense proximity may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The tire indexing structure <b>80</b> may further include a tire shifting structure <b>120</b> that is configured to shift the tire with respect to the shearing apparatus <b>18</b> to adjust for tires of different radius or circumferential sizes. Typically, the tire shifting structure <b>120</b> may be adjusted when a tire having a different radius or circumference from the tire previously sheared is placed upon the apparatus <b>10</b>, and if tires of similar sizes are being sheared, then adjustment may not be desired. The tire shifting structure <b>120</b> may be configured to move the position of a tire in the tire clamping assembly <b>82</b> along the shear plane to suitably position the tire for optimum effect by the shearing apparatus, such as by locating the tire closer to the guide elements <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>. Through the tire shifting structure <b>120</b>, the upright members <b>88</b> of the clamping assembly <b>82</b> may be moved closer to and further away from the one or more guide elements <b>28</b> to accommodate relatively larger and smaller tire.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Illustratively, the tire shifting structure may include a track <b>122</b> on which the guide <b>104</b> is movable, and the carriage and tire clamping assembly may be movable on the track with the guide. The track <b>122</b> may extend substantially parallel to the shear plane <b>18</b> to provide movement of these assemblies and structures in a similar direction. In some embodiments, the track <b>122</b> may include a pair of spaced channel elements <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> that are mounted on the frame and along which a slider element <b>126</b> is movable. Portions of the guide <b>104</b> may be mounted and the slider element <b>126</b> to be moved by movement of the slider element along the channel elements <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>. The tire shifting structure <b>120</b> may also include a shift actuator <b>130</b> that is configured to move the slider element <b>126</b> along the track, and in turn move portions of the guide in a direction generally parallel to the shear plane <b>18</b>. Illustratively, extension of the shift actuator <b>130</b> may move portions of the guide <b>104</b> away from the one or more guide elements <b>28</b> and retraction of the actuator <b>130</b> may move the guide portions closer to the guide elements.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The tire indexing structure <b>80</b> may also include means for shifting the path along with the guide moves to adjust for tire of different radii or circumferences. The tire indexing structure may include a path adjustment structure <b>132</b> that rotates at least a portion of the path that the guide moves along. In some embodiments, the adjustment of the path may be accomplished by rotating the guide <b>104</b> about a substantially vertical axis, such as an axis that passes through a support post <b>100</b> on which portions of the guide <b>104</b> are mounted on the slider element <b>126</b>. Illustratively, the path adjustment structure <b>132</b> may include an adjustment actuator <b>134</b> that is connected to the slider element <b>126</b> of the tire shifting structure <b>120</b> and to a location on the guide <b>103</b>, such as on one of the guide plates <b>107</b>, such that extension of the actuator <b>134</b> rotates the guide <b>104</b> about the support post <b>100</b> in an outward direction from the shear plane <b>18</b>, and retraction rotates the guide <b>104</b> about the support port in an inward direction toward the shear plane.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In use, the operator may calculate the portion of the circumference of a tire to be sheared from the remainder of the tire, and this calculation may be based upon weight or size restrictions as well as virtually any other factor desired. Based upon the size and type of tire, and the size or weight of the tire portions desired, the operator may utilize software or web-based solutions that determine the portion of the circumference of the tire that may be included in each segment sheared from the remainder. The operator may use this information to adjust the adjustment assembly <b>110</b> of the tire indexing structure <b>80</b> to a position that is appropriate to provide the desired segment size. Movement of the stop <b>116</b> may move the location of the initial position to correspond to the distance that the tire is to be advanced through the shear plane, and correspondingly the size of the tire portion to be removed from the remainder of the tire.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Through the actuation of separate controls, or through an automated control system, the clamps of the tire clamping assembly may be moved to the release position and the tire positioned on the apparatus such that a portion of the tire is ready to be moved through the shear plane. The clamps may be moved from the release position to the clamp position to secure the tire. The carriage assembly may be moved along the path defined by the guide such that the tire clamping assembly moves from the initial position to the final position, thereby moving a portion of the tire to the side of the clamps through the shear plane a distance sufficient so that a suitably sized portion of the tire extends through the shear plane of the shearing assembly. The upper shear blade may be moved from the open position into the shear position, thereby shearing or cutting off the portion of the tire that was moved through the shear plane, and was located on the side of the shear plane opposite of the tire indexing structure. The sheared portion of the tire falls away from the remainder of the tire, and the process may be repeated beginning with the tire clamping moving to the release position prior to the tire clamping assembly moving from the final position to the initial position which was set by the adjustment assembly, so that the operation is easily and quickly repeatable for producing tire pieces of the same size cut after cut, until the adjustment assembly is readjusted to produce tire pieces of a different size.</p>
