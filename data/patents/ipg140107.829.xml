<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of seed planting in a &#x201c;serpentine&#x201d; pattern called the wave planter is demonstrated. It consists of a manner of placing the seeds that essentially results in equally spaced rows of seeds placed in a serpentine-like layout or wave instead of a straight row. The preferred method creates a wave pattern equidistant from the next, yet creates a substantial increase over the density of straight row planting devices and drills (e.g. parallel, essentially straight rows). The use of the wave pattern provide concrete and substantial benefits to the business and economics of farming through labor, energy, and maintenance savings over current planting methods which results in a new farming business method. The method may be accomplished by several devices. Some of the devices include an oscillating draw bar planter; oscillating tongue planter; elliptical row opener; steerable undercarriage for the planter and castor row openers under undercarriage.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This seed planting method and devices to accomplish relate to a special way to plant agricultural products such as soybeans, corn, rye, wheat and other similar produce that can benefit from a controlled spacing, high density planting. The method called a &#x201c;serpentine&#x201d; wave planting method and system is a new combination of existing and new machinery configured with unique features that provide an effective, practical and economical way to provide a device to plant high density rows of seeds. The preferred method creates a wave pattern equidistant from the next, yet creates a substantial increase over the density of straight row planting devices and drills&#x2014;eg parallel, essentially straight rows. The preferred machinery embodiment is an oscillating drawbar device that can easily and economically be used with present-day farming equipment with little modification. Other alternative embodiments of the machinery are also presented for consideration in providing the new wave method planting. Of paramount or at least equal importance is the benefit to the business of farming. The use of the wave pattern provide concrete and substantial benefits to the business and economics of farming through labor, energy, maintenance savings over current planting methods. Hence a new farming business method is achieved.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A. Introduction of the Problems Addressed</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For hundreds of years it has been a standard practice in the farming community to plant seed in essentially straight rows. However, planting in the newly conceived wave planting called &#x201c;serpentine&#x201d; has many advantages over the conventional accepted methods now in use. The wave planting devices permit the seed to be planted in a wave pattern but with a fully controlled spacing. This permits high density, but no deprivation or robbing of the nutrients, moisture or sunlight from adjoining plants. This method gives the ability to significantly increase the Leaf Area Index (LAI) as well as increase the overall crop density in a very well controlled manner.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Wave planting is much different from &#x201c;broadcasting&#x201d; or &#x201c;airborne&#x201d; applications in that multiple seeds do not lodge into adjoining seeds and compete for space, nutrients, moisture and sunlight&#x2014;hence preventing some seeds from fully developing and germinating into healthy plants. Wave planting has parallel rows and leave the serpentine foot print as the row openers move through the soil. Additionally, this method may be used, for example and not limitation, on 7 inch, 14 inch, 22 inch centers etc. so that various seed planting benefit from the method.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Higher production with less fuel, labor, land use and equipment maintenance (all equating to cost savings) provide substantial opportunities for this new wave method to help the overall business method associated with farming.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">B. Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Examples of prior devices include U.S. Pat. No. 4,030,428 issued to Truax (1977) and entitled &#x201c;Native grass seed drill&#x201d;. This invention teaches a device which is a grass seed drill particularly adapted for the planting of native grass type seeds which are characterized by a low density, irregular length and shape, and having a propensity to stick together. The method or devices contemplated and taught by the wave planter are not anticipated. Another example of art is shown by Ellinger in U.S. Pat. No. 4,031,962 (1977) and entitled &#x201c;Farm implement positioner&#x201d;. It is a positioner for automatically positioning a farm implement, such as a sugar beet harvester, in line with rows of crops such as sugar beets and for automatically maintaining the height of the implement relative to the ground surface. No method or means of wave planting is anticipated.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Younger in U.S. Pat. No. 4,084,522 (1978) shows a device entitled &#x201c;Apparatus and method for sowing second crop in standing crop&#x201d;. It teaches a device by which seeds of a second crop (e.g. soybeans) are sown in a standing grain crop (e.g. wheat). When the grain crop is ripe it is harvested by cutting with a combine at a level slightly above the top of the partially grown second crop. Seeding of the second crop is performed using a self-driven, preferably three-wheel vehicle carrying a grain drill box having flexible tubes which fit between the rows of grain and each of which discharges the seed into a gap between two downward-inward slanted discs which first cut a slit in the ground, then deposit the seed and finally cover the slit. The discs are supported and their depth controlled in such manner as to cause minimum interference with the grain. This invention relates to a new and improved apparatus and method for sowing a second crop in standing grain. No wave planting and resulting density o the same crop is taught.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A series of patents show planting drills for seed planting. These include: Bailey in U.S. Pat. No. 4,587,909 (1986) and entitled &#x201c;Agricultural drills&#x201d;; Dean et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4,811,795 (1989) and entitled &#x201c;Seed drills&#x201d;; Brown et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4,989,524 (1991) and entitled &#x201c;Dibber drills&#x201d;; Gentilhomme et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,386,125 (2002) and entitled &#x201c;Seed drill&#x201d;; Audigie in U.S. Pat. No. 6,651,569 (2003) and entitled &#x201c;Seed drill&#x201d;; and, Wilson in U.S. Pat. No. 7,357,087 (2008) and entitled &#x201c;Grain drill with accurate metering of the rate of planting of seed&#x201d;. All showed various seed drills with features, yet none showed or anticipated the wave planting method and device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A further example of planter is shown by Moore, Jr. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,323,720 (1994) and entitled &#x201c;Revegetation method&#x201d;. This teaches a method where mined lands are reseeded by dispensing grass, forb and shrub seed from a seed drill with seed-dispensing boxes connected to plural dispensing tubes which drop seed on the earth's surface and wherein at least one seed box is operable to dispense cool season grass seed through conventional opener assemblies into furrows formed thereby. No use with crops and wave planting is anticipated.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another recent example of a planter system is demonstrated by Ledermann, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,740,746 (1998) and entitled &#x201c;Seed material dispensing system for an agricultural planter&#x201d;. This teaches a particulate matter or seed dispensing system for an agricultural implement having a mobile frame with a plurality of row units mounted to the frame. The seed dispensing system includes an upright storage hopper that is adapted to be carried by the frame and has the capacity for holding a large quantity of particulate matter such as seed. A bin is adapted to be carried on each row unit for holding a quantity of particulate matter or seed. Notably, each bin holds substantially less than the quantity of particulate matter adapted to be held in the storage hopper. A metering unit is adapted to be arranged on each row unit proximate a furrow opener of the row unit. The metering unit is arranged in material receiving relation relative to a respective bin on each row unit. The dispensing system of the present invention further includes an apparatus for delivering particulate matter from the hopp. No wave pattern is suggested or anticipated.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Finally, a recent example of another planter system is demonstrated by Beck, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,994,039 (2006) and entitled &#x201c;Bulk seed handling and dispensing system&#x201d;. This teaches a bulk seed handler and dispenser is provided for transporting bulk seed containers and for dispensing the seed within the containers into planting equipment. The bulk seed handler and dispenser is comprised of a trailer having a plurality of bulk seed containers mounted thereon, each of which is in communication with individual hoppers. A horizontally disposed conveyor auger is in communication with each of the hoppers and is adapted to convey the seed from the hoppers to a transition box located at the forward end of the conveyor auger. A seed discharge auger has its lower end in communication with the transition box and extends upwardly and laterally therefrom. A discharge tube is connected to the upper end of the seed discharge auger which is maneuvered for placement adjacent planter unit hoppers. The density achieved by the wave planner device is not anticipated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The particular combinations of materials and features are unique and novel and are not anticipated by prior art. Likewise, use of the &#x201c;serpentine&#x201d; method with the example devices provides significant benefits compared to prior art planting devices. As far as known, there is no other wave planting methods or devices to accomplish this &#x201c;serpentine&#x201d; pattern of high density, controlled spacing seed planting. It is believed that this method and related devices are made with fewer parts with improved configurations and physical features to provide more functionality when compared to other currently planting devices or methods for seed planting or drilling.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A new method of seed planting in a wave pattern called the &#x201c;serpentine&#x201d; has been developed. It consists of essentially equally spaced rows that are placed in a serpentine like lay out or wave instead of a traditional straight row. It may be accomplished by several machines and devices. For example and not limitation, some of the devices are summarized as follows. A complete description is below with the Detailed Description.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0061">The preferred embodiment of wave producing machine <b>70</b> is comprised of a means to produce lateral movement of the draw bar <b>71</b> such as a cylinder and control system; a means to moveably secure the means for lateral movement to a pulling vehicle such as a tractor <b>81</b> or the like; a moveable drawbar means <b>72</b>-<b>74</b> secured to the cylinder and the tractor; a planting device <b>80</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>90</b> comprised of at least one row opener; and a means to connect the drawbar to the planter device and row openers.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> A is the new wave method planting system illustrated <b>31</b> beside traditional straight row <b>32</b> drill planting. The wave method planting is a serpentine-like movement of the row openers through the soil. This method has been developed for the specific use in planting seeds in a serpentine row, also defined as winding, wave, resembling a snake, curving, meandering, twisting or bending. One of many devices may be used. These devices shall deposit seeds with the correct spacing according to the individual plant requirements. For example, corn is planted normally wider than soybeans, etc. The wave planting method works for various seeds such as but not limited to corn, beans, wheat, oats, rye, etc. The rows shall be parallel to each other. This method will put rows into the soil that are equally spaced apart so there will be no root encroachment or one seed stealing the space, sunlight, moisture or nutrients from other seeds. Various devices may be used to accomplish a wave planting method. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> B through <b>1</b> D are example devices used to achieve the wave. An oscillating drawbar wave planting device <b>70</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> B. An oscillating tongue wave planting device <b>50</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> C and an elliptical disc row opener <b>40</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> D. All are described below in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> A through <b>2</b> E are sketches of the oscillating drawbar device <b>70</b> to create a wave planting method <b>31</b>. This device <b>70</b> attaches directly to the tractor <b>81</b> three point system or be mounted to the tractor frame <b>72</b>-<b>74</b>. The device <b>70</b> is actuated by using a means <b>71</b> such as an hydraulic cylinder, an hydraulic motor, PTO (Power Take Off), ground driven or other means. The purpose of the device <b>70</b> is to transmit a force directly to the drawbar <b>75</b> that results in a side to side movement <b>76</b>. A planting device or implement <b>80</b>, <b>90</b> is then directly attached to the drawbar <b>75</b> by its tongue <b>53</b> which follows the movement <b>76</b> of the drawbar <b>75</b>. As the drawbar <b>75</b> moves side to side <b>76</b>, the planter/implement <b>80</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>90</b> follows the motion and creates the wave planting footprint <b>33</b> and pattern. Most existing farm equipment could be easily adapted to this device and configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a typical model oscillating tongue device <b>50</b> to permit wave planting <b>33</b>. Here the seed receptacle <b>51</b> sits above a standard set of round row openers <b>52</b>. The tongue <b>53</b> has a control means (not shown) that engages a means to oscillate <b>54</b> (such as an hydraulic cylinder, an hydraulic motor, PTO (Power Take Off). As the tongue moves, the unit <b>50</b> is pulled side to side and creates the wave planting method <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> A through <b>4</b> F are operational steps <b>55</b>A through <b>55</b>F in using the oscillating tongue device <b>50</b> to permit wave planting <b>31</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> G is an example of the wave planting results <b>33</b>. One notes the model device <b>51</b> in the picture.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref> A through <b>5</b> F are various simulated steps <b>57</b>A through F in using the model oscillating tongue model device <b>51</b> behind a pulling force <b>81</b> to permit oscillating wave planting <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> are primarily operational may be seen below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref> A through <b>7</b> C are sketches of a model of an elliptical disc device <b>40</b> used to achieve wave planting <b>31</b>. This elliptical row opener device <b>40</b> has been designed for the specific use in planting seeds in a serpentine row <b>31</b>. This device shall deposit seeds with the correct/equal spacing according to it's requirements, corn, beans, wheat, oats, rye, etc. The rows shall be parallel to each other. The advantage of a planter <b>40</b> with serpentine wave planting <b>31</b> capability will be higher production from the same acreage compared to a conventional straight line planter <b>80</b>. The higher production will be determined by the wave length or frequency of the serpentine/wave planted row in the soil. This frequency of planting is set at a given constant, say 4 inches, like a straight row planter <b>80</b>. The distance that the row opener <b>40</b> travels is determined by the angle to the frame &#x3a6;, the length of the ellipse major and minor axis determined in part by the angle of the ellipse. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref> A through <b>7</b> C, the parts of the elliptical planter <b>40</b> are described. A model planter <b>40</b> is shown with the seed chute <b>41</b> the simulated frame <b>42</b>, the splines <b>47</b>, a cover means <b>48</b> and a mounting shaft <b>43</b>. These are similar to a round disk row opener <b>80</b> yet with angles and diameters at differing configurations. One notes the aperture <b>44</b> in the disk plane <b>46</b> and that the ellipse center <b>43</b>A of the elliptical plane <b>46</b> is eccentric to the shaft <b>43</b> (distance from <b>43</b> to <b>43</b>A). A practical application anticipates the spline feature to be a stamped or manufactured wave structure <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> are sketches/drawings <b>40</b>A of original elliptical disc <b>40</b> concept. The components are similar to those described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref> A through <b>11</b> C are prototype sketches of straight disc <b>80</b> and elliptical disc <b>40</b> row openers. These were among the analysis tools used to confirm the patterns and results of the new wave planting methods <b>31</b>,<b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref> A through <b>12</b> C example results for straight disc planters <b>80</b> and elliptical disc planters <b>40</b>. Note the uniform spacing for the straight rows <b>32</b> and the spacing for the wave planters <b>31</b>. The length of the row for the wave method <b>31</b> is significantly longer and provides opportunity for more seed per row and per acre. This is discussed and exemplified below.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref> A through <b>13</b> D are sketches of the steerable undercarriage wave planting device <b>60</b>. This planter <b>60</b> is designed to sow seed also in a wave fashion <b>33</b> or conventional straight fashion <b>32</b> line series of rows. This will be achieved by towing a device <b>60</b> that attaches to a tractor <b>81</b> by using parallel towing bars <b>61</b> that will keep the device <b>60</b> parallel to the mounting bracket <b>61</b> attached to the tractor <b>67</b>. The main wheels of this device will be steerable <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>B and operate through the use of a hydraulic actuator or other means to steer the device in such a way as to create a wave footprint <b>33</b> in the soil while planting seed. By using an on board computer or ground driven device the frequency of oscillation can be altered from straight line <b>32</b> to a wave pattern <b>33</b> as required for a particular application. A second set of castor wheels <b>65</b>, <b>65</b>B will be attached to the planter <b>60</b> for lifting at the end of a row allowing the device to be turned 180 degrees for the next series of rows. When the wheels <b>65</b>B are in the raised position the device <b>60</b> will be controlled by the steerable wheels <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>B and when the castor wheels <b>65</b> are lowered the device will be allowed to turn by raising the steerable wheels <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>B off the ground. Planting will be achieved by using a series of castor type row openers <b>93</b> that move in harmony with the steerable wheels <b>65</b>, <b>65</b>B, there is an alternative to having a second set of wheels for turning however. By using the main carriage wheels in a way that would lift the device at the row end and would go into a &#x201c;castor mode&#x201d; and at the same time neutralize the steering actuator device. When the planter <b>60</b> has completed the turn and lowered the steering would be activated to continue planting.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref> A through <b>14</b> C are concept sketches of the steerable undercarriage wave planting device <b>60</b>. The components are the same as discussed for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. One notes the steered wheels <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>B in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref> A and B.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref> A through <b>15</b> C are sketches and models of an oscillating wave planter <b>90</b> with castor type row openers <b>93</b>. This device <b>90</b> would be similar to the steerable version <b>60</b> yet would not require the steering option. The Wheels <b>65</b> would be used to lift the device and would not be steerable. The wave footprint <b>33</b> would be achieved by the entire planting mechanism oscillating independently from the under carriage. parallel tow bars <b>61</b> are not required because the device would attach directly to the tractor drawbar. This planter would also be capable of wave or straight line planting. One notes the prototype <b>92</b>, the castor row openers <b>93</b>, and the main frame <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref> A through <b>16</b> C are concept sketches of an oscillating wave planter <b>90</b> with castor type row openers <b>93</b>. Other components are like those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref> A through <b>17</b> D are simulations of the planting results from a straight row opener <b>80</b>, oscillating <b>51</b> and elliptical row opener <b>40</b> planting devices. These comparison sketches show the straight row pattern <b>32</b> and the wave patterns <b>31</b>,<b>33</b> of the devices described above.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref> A through <b>18</b> C are sketches of a tractor <b>81</b> from a front and rear <b>84</b> views for reference to current art. The rear view <b>84</b> allows one to easily see the ability to practically connect these various devices to current model vehicles and pulling means such as a tractor <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0078">All of the details mentioned here are exemplary and not limiting. Materials used to create the various row openers and parts described above are not limited to traditional materials. However, there are currently metals (steel and steel alloys, iron, plastics, composite materials, synthetic materials, rubber and the like that are readily available to machine, cast, form or fabricate the above devices. It is anticipated that other durable and lightweight materials may be used as they are developed in the making of these and similar devices for the use in wave planting methods in the farming industry. Other components specific to describing a Controlled Spacing, High Density &#x201c;Serpentine&#x201d; Wave Planting Method; example devices to accomplish the method; and farming business methods may be added as a person having ordinary skill in the field of the farming industry and related equipment and methods well appreciates.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">OPERATION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0079">The wave method and devices are described above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> describe more of the operation and are discussed further below.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> A through <b>4</b> F are operational steps <b>55</b>A through <b>55</b>F in using the oscillating tongue device <b>50</b> to permit wave planting <b>31</b>, <b>33</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> G is an example of the wave planting results <b>33</b>. One notes the model device <b>51</b> in the picture. The general device <b>50</b> moves side to side as the means <b>54</b> is controlled and extends, thus moving the planter <b>51</b> from side to side.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref> A through <b>5</b> F are various simulated steps <b>57</b>A through F in using the model oscillating tongue model device <b>51</b> behind a pulling force <b>81</b> to permit oscillating wave planting <b>33</b>. The wave pattern <b>33</b> is slightly different than the one created by the elliptical means <b>40</b> since the turning is not as exact between the cylindrical motion <b>50</b>, <b>70</b> versus the tangential point of the elliptical row opener <b>40</b>. There is still a significant increase in seed density.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref> A through <b>6</b> E are additional simulated steps similar to those described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in using the model oscillating tongue model device <b>51</b> behind a pulling force <b>81</b> to permit oscillating wave planting <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> A and <b>8</b> B are sketches of the elliptical disc planter <b>40</b>A and the change of the elliptical disc plane <b>46</b>. The movement <b>49</b> of the tangent T as well as the major M<b>1</b> and minor axes M<b>2</b> are shown in the sketches. One notes that the height D of the shaft <b>43</b> remains essentially constant. The overall movement of the tangential point T provides a footprint with a much longer distance since the circumference of the elliptical row opener <b>40</b> is longer than a standard round row opener <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> A through <b>9</b> I are sketches of the elliptical planter <b>40</b> at different times and angles &#x3b1; as it cycles through one revolution of the device. The distance from the tangent T at ground intersection remains a constant <b>2</b>D from the frame plane. As the device turns, the major axis M<b>1</b> causes the planter <b>40</b> to extend out, but the angle &#x3b1; Also changes in order to keep the shaft height D constant above the ground. As the row opener <b>40</b> turns, a longer circumference of the ellipse is transcended and hence a larger distance for dropping seed. Since the axis and angle both move, a wave pattern <b>31</b> results.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> provide a phenomena of a longer circumference with more places to plant seeds&#x2014;yet keep them spaced at an equal distance. This is summarized as Seed deposit comparison for a conventional planter and three angular ellipses. For the Conventional straight line planter <b>80</b> leaving a straight row foot print <b>32</b>, by using a 12&#x2033; diameter round row opener with a circumference of 37.699&#x2033; and a seed deposit rate of one seed every 4&#x2033; the planter <b>80</b> will plant 9.42 seeds per revolution. It will require 66 revolutions to travel <b>208</b>&#x2032; which is the length of one side of a square acre plus or minus. At this rate it will deposit 621.72 seeds per row. With the rows being 7&#x2033; on center, there will be 356 rows per acre and total seed deposit of 221,076 seeds per acre. For a planter with elliptical row openers <b>40</b>, one must decide the ratios of the Major axis to minor axis. The range is infinite but one can see the pattern by looking at three examples (and not limitations). By using a 60 degree elliptical disc with a minor axis of 12&#x2033; and a major axis of 13.68&#x2033;, the foot print in the soil would be 40.32&#x2033; per revolution. Based on the same seed deposit of every 4&#x2033; this device would deposit 1008 seeds per revolution or 665.28 seeds per row for a total of 236,839 per acre. This is an increase of 7 percent over the conventional straight line planter <b>80</b>. By using a 45 degree elliptical disc row opener with a minor axis of 12&#x2033; and a major axis of 16.44&#x2033; the foot print in the soil would be 44.64&#x2033; per revolution. Based on the same seed deposit of every 4&#x2033; this device would deposit 11.16 seeds per revolution or 736.56 seeds per row for a total of 262215 per acre based on 356 rows per acre. This is an increase of 19 percent over the conventional straight planter <b>80</b>. Using a 30 degree elliptical disc row opener with a minor axis of 12&#x2033; and a major axis of 23.28&#x2033; the foot print in the soil would be 55.32&#x2033; per revolution or 13.86 seeds per revolution. Based on 66 revolutions per row for 356 rows per acre the total seed deposit would be 324,949 seeds per acre this would be an increase of 47 percent over the conventional straight line planter <b>80</b>. The seed numbers are based on 4&#x2033; spacing of seeds in 7&#x2033; rows that are 208&#x2032; long and 356 rows required per acre each acre measuring 208&#x2032;&#xd7;208&#x2032; the row spacing could be 18&#x2033;&#x2dc;24&#x2033;&#x2dc;30&#x2033;etc. The percentage of increase would remain the same, it all has to do with a longer row in the same space. The other planting methods we discussed would all have similar numbers relatively an increase in crop production. This is summarized in a Table D as:</p>
