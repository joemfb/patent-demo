<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is on the basis of Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-210250, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a wiring harness arranged in a vehicle or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1 listed below discloses a wiring harness technique suggested by the applicant of the present application. In particular, a structure for preventing a slack of the wiring harness which affects transportability of the wiring harness. Preventing a slack causes a prevention of damage at an end of the wiring harness, and improves the transportability.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">[Patent Document 1] Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2003-291747</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If the slack is prevented by applying the disclosed technique of Patent Document 1, the end of the wiring harness (i.e. connector) can be prevented from being damaged. However, in case of a long wiring harness, there is a possibility to damage the wiring harness other than the end part of the wiring harness (connector) during from production of the wiring harness, through transportation to a car maker, to arranging in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a long wiring harness, for example, there is a wiring harness for a hybrid vehicle or an electric car extending from a front side of an inner vehicle body of the vehicle through an under floor of the vehicle at an outside of a vehicle frame to a rear side of the inner vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a wiring harness of which end part and the other parts are hard to be damaged.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMERY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to attain the object, according to the present invention, there is provided a wiring harness including: a circular portion as a buffer formed by turning a corrugate tube in a U-shape and by detachably holding an end of the wiring harness or a neighbor of the end of the wiring harness at a middle of the wiring harness.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, the buffer performance depends on flexibility and resiliency of a corrugate tube and on a circular shape formed between a holding position and the end side of the wiring harness. In the present invention, the circular portion is used as a buffer. The buffer is formed, for example, during from production of wiring harness, through transportation to a carmaker, to arranging in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, owing to the buffer, the wiring harness of the present invention is harder to be damaged than the conventional wiring harness.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the wiring harness further includes: a retainer or a binding member as a wiring harness accessory provided at the middle of the wiring harness for detachably holding the end of the wiring harness or the neighbor of the end of the wiring harness.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Therefore, using a retainer as a wiring harness accessory reduces the number of parts of the wiring harness. On the other hand, using the banding member repeatedly reduces the cost of the wiring harness.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, the wiring harness of the present invention is not only hard to be damaged, but also cost-effective.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the wiring harness further including:</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">a plurality of high-voltage electrical power lines extending from a front side of an inner vehicle body of a hybrid vehicle or an electric vehicle through an under floor of the vehicle at an outside of a vehicle frame to a rear side of the inner vehicle body for connecting a battery and an inverter or for connecting a motor and an inverter;</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">a protector for protecting together middle parts of the high-voltage electrical power lines; and</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">the corrugate tube composing the buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, the buffer is applied to a long wiring harness for a hybrid vehicle or an electric vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Thus, the long wiring harness of the present invention is hard to be damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading of the following detailed description along with the accompanied drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A wiring harness according to the present invention will be explained with reference to figures.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A wiring harness of this embodiment is used in a hybrid vehicle or an electric vehicle. Hereafter, a case that the wiring harness is used in the hybrid vehicle is explained. (In a case of the electric vehicle, a structure, a configuration, and an effect of the wiring harness are basically the same.)</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a reference numeral <b>1</b> indicates a hybrid vehicle. The hybrid vehicle <b>1</b> mixes driving forces of an engine <b>2</b> and a motor <b>3</b>. A battery <b>5</b> supplies an electric power to the motor <b>3</b> via an inverter <b>4</b>. In this embodiment, the engine <b>2</b>, the motor <b>3</b>, and the inverter <b>4</b> are mounted on a front side of an inner vehicle body where front wheels are disposed. Further, the battery <b>5</b> is mounted on a rear side of the inner vehicle body where rear wheels are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A reference numeral <b>8</b> indicates a vehicle body frame. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an upper side of the vehicle body frame <b>8</b> indicates a vehicle upper floor <b>9</b>. Further, a lower side of the vehicle body frame <b>8</b> indicates a vehicle under floor <b>10</b>. A reinforcement <b>11</b> having a substantially convex section for reinforcing a vehicle body is arranged in the under floor <b>10</b>. The reinforcement <b>11</b> extends from a front side to the rear side of the vehicle. A reference numeral <b>12</b> at a front side <b>6</b> of the inner vehicle body indicates a commonly-known electric junction box such as a relay box. Further, a reference numeral <b>13</b> at a rear side <b>7</b> of the inner vehicle body indicates a commonly-known low-voltage battery. (An arrangement of the low-voltage battery <b>13</b> is shown as an example.)</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this embodiment, the motor <b>3</b> includes a motor and a generator. Further, the inverter <b>4</b> includes an inverter and a converter. The inverter <b>4</b> is an inverter assembly and includes an inverter for an air conditioner, an inverter for a generator, and an inverter for a motor. The battery <b>5</b> is a Ni-MH system, a Li-ion system or the like, and is a battery module. Incidentally, a capacitor can be used instead of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A wiring harness <b>21</b> produced according to a method of the present invention connects the inverter <b>4</b> and the battery <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The wiring harness <b>21</b> according to the present invention includes: a plurality of high-voltage electrical power lines <b>22</b> for electrically connecting the inverter <b>4</b> and the battery <b>5</b>; a flat corrugate tube <b>23</b> (protecting member) for protecting together the high-voltage power lines <b>22</b>; a protector <b>24</b> (wiring harness accessory) for fixing the wiring harness to the vehicle body; a plurality of corrugate tubes <b>25</b> interposed between an end of the flat corrugate tube <b>23</b> (later-described one opening and the other opening) and an end of the wiring harness (later-described connector).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, the wiring harness <b>21</b> also includes a plurality of commonly-known low-voltage electric wires <b>26</b>. (In this embodiment, because the low-voltage battery <b>13</b> is disposed at the rear side <b>7</b> of the inner vehicle body, the wiring harness <b>21</b> includes the low-voltage electric wires <b>26</b>. In this embodiment, the low-voltage battery <b>13</b> is a battery module.)</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The wiring harness <b>21</b> extends from the front side <b>6</b> of the inner vehicle body via the vehicle under floor <b>10</b> to the rear side <b>7</b> of the inner vehicle body. The wiring harness <b>21</b> penetrates the vehicle body frame <b>8</b>. Hereunder, components of the wiring harness <b>21</b> will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The high-voltage power lines <b>22</b> are commonly-known power cables each having a circular section and a predetermined diameter. The high-voltage power lines <b>22</b> are wider than the low-voltage electric wires <b>26</b>. A conducting body disposed at the center of the high-voltage power line <b>22</b> is made of copper, copper alloy, aluminum or the like. In this embodiment, two high-voltage power lines <b>22</b> are provided. Further, a connector <b>27</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) having terminal fittings for connecting to electric components is disposed at ends of the high-voltage power lines <b>22</b>. Incidentally, the high-voltage power lines <b>22</b> may include a braided wire for shielding the high-voltage power lines <b>22</b>. (A braided wire may shield together a plurality of the high-voltage power lines <b>22</b>.)</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The low-voltage electric wires <b>26</b> are protected by the flat corrugate tube <b>23</b> together with the high-voltage power lines <b>22</b>. One ends of the low-voltage electric wires <b>26</b> are connected to the electric junction box <b>12</b>, and the other ends of the low-voltage electric wires <b>26</b> are connected to the low-voltage battery <b>13</b>. A connector (not shown ) for connecting to the electric junction box <b>12</b> and terminal fittings <b>28</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for connecting to the low-voltage battery <b>13</b> are disposed at ends of the low-voltage electric wires <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the flat corrugate tube <b>23</b> for protecting the high-voltage power lines <b>22</b> and the low-voltage electric wires <b>26</b> has a noncircular (here, ellipse) section, and is made of insulating synthetic resin. The flat corrugate tube <b>23</b> is formed in an accordion shape having hills and valleys extending alternately along an axis of the flat corrugate tube <b>23</b>. Incidentally, in this embodiment, the flat corrugate tube <b>23</b> is used. However, the present invention is not limited to this. A corrugate tube having a circular section can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The flat corrugate tube <b>23</b> is formed in a seamless shape having no slit in the axial direction thereof. The high-voltage power lines <b>22</b> and the low-voltage electric wires <b>26</b> are inserted into the flat corrugate tube <b>23</b> from one opening toward the other opening of the flat corrugate tube <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this embodiment, a common corrugate tube having a slit is not used. Because there is a possibility that splashing water enters the corrugate tube through the slit when a vehicle runs. Further, there is a possibility that the slit is open when the corrugate tube having the slit is bent, and a skipping stone may affect a wiring condition of the wiring harness when the vehicle runs.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the protector <b>24</b> is used as a fixing member to fix the wiring harness <b>21</b> onto the vehicle body. (A commonly-known clip may be used.) The protector <b>24</b> is made of insulating synthetic resin, and assembled at, for example, a neighbor of an end of the flat corrugate tube <b>23</b>. A retainer <b>29</b> for holding a neighbor of an end of the wiring harness is formed on the protector <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The retainer <b>29</b> is resilient, and formed in a hook shape in this embodiment. (The shape of the retainer is shown as an example.)</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as described the above, the corrugate tubes <b>25</b> are interposed from the end of the flat corrugate tube <b>23</b> to the connector <b>27</b> as a later-described end of the wiring harness, and the terminal fittings <b>28</b>. The corrugate tubes <b>25</b> are made of insulating synthetic resin, and one of the corrugate tube <b>25</b> protects the high-voltage power lines <b>22</b>, and the other protects the low-voltage electric wires <b>26</b>. The corrugate tubes <b>25</b> are flexible and resilient. Further, the corrugate tube <b>25</b> has an accordion shape, and has a circular section.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Here, parts of the wiring harness <b>21</b> are defined as below. A part where the corrugate tubes <b>25</b> are provided is defined as an end side of the wiring harness <b>30</b>. A part where the connector <b>27</b> and the terminal fittings <b>28</b> are provided is defined as an end of the wiring harness <b>31</b>. A neighbor of the end of the wiring harness <b>31</b> is defined as a neighbor of an end of the wiring harness <b>32</b>. A part where the flat corrugate tube is provided is defined as a middle of the wiring harness <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a buffer <b>34</b> for preventing the wiring harness <b>21</b> from being damaged during from production of wiring harness, through transportation to a carmaker, to arranging in a hybrid vehicle <b>1</b> is formed in the wiring harness <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The buffer <b>34</b> is formed by turning the end side of the wiring harness <b>30</b> in a U-shape, and by detachably holding the neighbor of the end of the wiring harness <b>32</b> with the retainer <b>29</b> of the protector <b>24</b> provided on the middle of the wiring harness <b>33</b>. A circular shape of the buffer <b>34</b> works as a buffer. The buffer <b>34</b> works as a buffer with the flexibility and the resiliency of the corrugate tubes <b>25</b>, and with a circular shape between the holding position and the neighbor of the end of the wiring harness <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Regarding the buffer <b>34</b>, for example, a detachable bonding member such as a surface fastener can be used instead of the retainer <b>29</b>. In the buffer <b>34</b>, a reference numeral <b>35</b> indicates taping.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As above described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, according to the present invention, by forming the buffer <b>34</b>, a slack of the end of the wiring harness <b>31</b> is prevented. Therefore, the end of the wiring harness <b>31</b> is prevented from being damaged. Portability of the wiring harness <b>21</b> is improved. Further, owing to the buffer <b>34</b>, parts other than the end of the wiring harness <b>31</b> also are hard to be damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The buffer <b>34</b> of the present invention can be adopted to a typical wiring harness other than those of a hybrid vehicle <b>1</b> or an electric vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although the present invention has been fully described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, unless otherwise such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the present invention hereinafter defined, they should be construed as being included therein.</p>
