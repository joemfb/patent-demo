<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A rotor drive mechanism and pump apparatus according to the present invention may cause an external screw type rotor of a uniaxial eccentric screw pump to rotate and carry out a revolution movement. The rotor drive mechanism further comprises a shaft sealing structure configured such that a gap between an outer peripheral portion of an end portion of the revolution shaft is located on the external screw type rotor side and an inner peripheral portion of the casing in the pump apparatus is sealed. The rotor drive mechanism provides for a reduced amount of heat and vibrations to be generated when the rotor is rotated at high speed and further allows for lowering of contact pressure between an outer surface of the rotor and an inner surface of a stator inner hole.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One example of conventional pump apparatuses will be explained in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (see Patent Document 1 for example).

The uniaxial eccentric screw pump <b>2</b> is configured such that the external screw type rotor <b>3</b> is inserted in an internal screw hole <b>5</b><i>a </i>of a stator <b>5</b>. By rotating the rotor <b>3</b> in a predetermined direction, a fluid, such as a liquid, can be suctioned from a suction port <b>6</b> for example, held in a space between the rotor <b>3</b> and the stator <b>5</b>, transferred, and then discharged from a discharge port <b>7</b>. At this time, the rotor <b>3</b> carries out an eccentric rotational movement, i.e., rotates while carrying out a revolution movement about a central axis <b>8</b> of the stator inner hole <b>5</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The rotor drive mechanism <b>4</b> causes the rotor <b>3</b> to carry out the eccentric rotational movement.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">The rotor drive mechanism <b>4</b> included in the conventional pump apparatus <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is configured such that the rotation of the input shaft <b>9</b> is transferred to the output shaft <b>11</b> via the first outer gear <b>10</b>, the second outer gear <b>13</b>, the third outer gear <b>16</b>, and the inner gear <b>17</b> to cause the rotor <b>3</b> to rotate and carry out the revolution movement. As above, the rotor drive mechanism <b>4</b> includes a large number of gears. Therefore, in a case where the rotor <b>3</b> is rotated at high speed, the rotor drive mechanism <b>4</b> generates heat to increase in temperature and generates comparatively high vibrations by, for example, frictions between gears.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">In accordance with the conventional pump apparatus <b>1</b>, power for the revolution movement and rotation movement of the rotor <b>3</b> is obtained from the single input shaft <b>9</b>. Therefore, it is difficult to adjust a positional relation between a revolution position of the rotor <b>3</b> and a rotation position of the rotor <b>3</b>. On this account, a contact pressure between an outer surface of the rotor <b>3</b> and an inner surface of a stator inner hole <b>5</b><i>a </i>when the rotor <b>3</b> rotates cannot be adjusted to be lower than a current contact pressure, for example. Purposes of lowering the contact pressure between the outer surface of the rotor <b>3</b> and the inner surface of the stator inner hole <b>5</b><i>a </i>are to reduce the power for causing the rotor to rotate and carry out the revolution movement and to reduce abrasions caused by the contact between the outer surface of the rotor <b>3</b> and the inner surface of the stator inner hole <b>5</b><i>a</i>. A further purpose is to use the rotor <b>3</b> rotating at high speed by reducing the power and the abrasions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">The present invention was made to solve the above problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a rotor drive mechanism and a pump apparatus, each of which realizes that the rotor rotating at high speed can be used by reducing the amount of heat and vibrations generated when the rotor is rotated at high speed and by lowering the contact pressure between the outer surface of the rotor and the inner surface of the stator inner hole or preventing the outer surface of the rotor and the inner surface of the stator inner hole from contacting each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">A rotor drive mechanism according to the present invention is capable of causing an external screw type rotor of a uniaxial eccentric screw pump to rotate and carry out a revolution movement, the uniaxial eccentric screw pump being configured such that the external screw type rotor is attached to an inner hole of an internal screw type stator, wherein the external screw type rotor is able to be driven by a rotation speed control driving portion to rotate and is driven by a revolution speed control driving portion to carry out the revolution movement.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">In accordance with the rotor drive mechanism of the present invention, the external screw type rotor can be rotated at an appropriate speed and phase by the control of the rotation speed control driving portion and can carry out the revolution movement at an appropriate speed and phase by the control of the revolution speed control driving portion. Thus, the rotor can be caused to rotate and carry out the revolution movement about the stator inner hole at a desired speed and phase (the rotor can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement). For example, a rotation direction of the rotor and a revolution direction of the rotor can be set to be opposite to each other. A space formed by the outer surface of the rotor and the inner surface of the stator inner hole moves from one opening of the stator inner hole to the other opening of the stator inner hole by the eccentric rotational movement of the rotor. Therefore, the fluid can be transferred in this direction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">Moreover, the positional relation between the rotation position of the rotor and the revolution position of the rotor is adjusted by the rotation speed control driving portion and the revolution speed control driving portion (respective phases of the rotation position of the rotor and the revolution position of the rotor are adjusted by the rotation speed control driving portion and the revolution speed control driving portion). In addition, the rotation speed control driving portion and the revolution speed control driving portion are driven at a desired rotating speed. With this, the rotor can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement along a desired path. Thus, the rotor and the stator inner hole can be formed such that the outer surface of the rotor and the inner surface forming the stator inner hole do not contact each other or contact each other at appropriate contact pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">In the rotor drive mechanism according to the present invention claim <b>1</b>, the rotor drive mechanism includes: a rotation shaft configured to have a central axis at a certain position that is rotatably supported; and a revolution shaft configured to: be supported so as to be able to revolve about a certain central position and rotate; and have one end portion coupled to the rotation shaft via a power transmission portion and the other end portion coupled to the external screw type rotor, wherein the rotation shaft is rotated by the rotation speed control driving portion, and the revolution shaft is revolved by the revolution speed control driving portion to carry out an eccentric rotational movement.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">In accordance with the rotor drive mechanism herein, when the rotation speed control driving portion is driven, the power of the rotation speed control driving portion can be transferred to the revolution shaft via the rotation shaft and the power transmission portion to rotate the revolution shaft. Then, when the revolution speed control driving portion is driven, the revolution shaft can be caused to carry out the revolution movement. With this, the revolution shaft can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement, and therefore, the rotor coupled to the revolution shaft can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">In the rotor drive mechanism according to the present invention claim <b>2</b>, the rotor drive mechanism further includes an eccentric supporting portion rotatably provided on a casing to be rotated by the revolution speed control driving portion, wherein the revolution shaft is rotatably provided in the eccentric supporting portion so as to be eccentrically located with respect to a central axis of the eccentric supporting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">In accordance with the rotor drive mechanism herein, the eccentric supporting portion can support the revolution shaft such that the revolution shaft is rotatable, and the revolution shaft can be caused to carry out the revolution movement by the rotation of the eccentric supporting portion. Thus, the eccentric supporting portion can support the revolution shaft such that the revolution shaft can carry out the eccentric rotational movement.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">In the rotor drive mechanism described herein, the rotor drive mechanism is configured such that the power transmission portion is a flexible joint or an Oldham coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">In accordance with the rotor drive mechanism according to the present invention, a rotation center of the rotation shaft and a rotation center of the revolution shaft do not coincide with each other, but a rotational power of the rotation shaft can be transferred to the revolution shaft via the power transmission portion. By using the flexible joint as the power transmission portion, the power transmission portion can be simplified in configuration and reduced in weight. By using the Oldham coupling as the power transmission portion, a synchronization error between the rotation of the rotation shaft and the rotation of the revolution shaft can be reduced. With this, the rotation position of the rotor and the revolution position of the rotor during the eccentric rotational movement can be caused to accurately coincide with a predetermined positional relation. As a result, the rotor can be caused to accurately carry out the eccentric rotational movement such that the outer surface of the rotor and the inner surface forming the stator inner hole do not contact each other with a predetermined gap therebetween or contact each other at appropriate contact pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">In one embodiment, the rotor drive mechanism is configured such that each of the rotation speed control driving portion and the revolution speed control driving portion is an electric servo motor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">By using an electric servo motor as each of the rotation speed control driving portion and the revolution speed control driving portion, the speed and phase of the rotation of the rotor and the speed and phase of the revolution of the rotor can be easily and accurately controlled. Thus, the outer surface of the rotor and the inner surface forming the stator inner hole can be accurately adjusted or changed such that the outer surface of the rotor and the inner surface forming the stator inner hole do not contact each other or contact each other at appropriate contact pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">The rotor drive mechanism further includes a pump apparatus and a uniaxial eccentric screw pump configured to be rotated by the rotor drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">Therefore, the external screw type rotor can be rotated at an appropriate speed and phase by the control of the rotation speed control driving portion and can carry out the revolution movement at an appropriate speed and phase by the control of the revolution speed control driving portion. By causing the rotor to carry out a desired eccentric rotational movement, the space formed by the outer surface of the rotor and the inner surface of the stator inner hole can be moved from one opening of the stator inner hole to the other opening of the stator inner hole. Thus, the fluid can be transferred in this direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">The pump apparatus may be configured such that the rotor drive mechanism rotates the external screw type rotor with the external screw type rotor not contacting an inner surface of the inner hole of the internal screw type stator.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">The rotor can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement with the rotor not contacting the inner surface of the stator inner hole. Therefore, for example, in a case where a fluid containing fine particles is transferred, the gap between the rotor and the stator inner surface can be set such that the fine particles are not grated by the rotor and the stator inner surface, and the fine particles can be transferred while maintaining the original shapes of the fine particles. Moreover, abrasion powder generated in a case where the rotor and the stator inner surface contact each other does not get mixed in the transfer fluid, and a noise is not generated by the friction between the rotor and the stator inner surface. Moreover, the gap between the outer peripheral surface of the rotor and the inner peripheral surface of the stator inner hole can be set to an appropriate size depending on the property of the transfer fluid (for example, a fluid containing fine particles or slurry). With this, depending on various properties of fluids, the pump apparatus can transfer and fill the fluid with high flow rate accuracy and a long operating life. Further, since the rotor can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement with the rotor not contacting the inner surface of the stator inner hole, the rotor can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement at a comparatively high speed, so that a comparatively high transfer ability can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">The pump apparatus further includes a shaft sealing structure configured such that a gap between an outer peripheral portion of an end portion of the revolution shaft which end portion is located on the external screw type rotor side and an inner peripheral portion of the casing in the pump apparatus is sealed by at least a diaphragm.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">In accordance with the pump apparatus according to the present invention, when the revolution shaft is driven by the revolution speed control driving portion to carry out the revolution movement, the diaphragm of the shaft sealing structure freely deforms with respect to the revolution movement of the revolution shaft. Therefore, a gap between the outer peripheral portion of the end portion of the revolution shaft which end portion is located on the external screw type rotor side and the inner peripheral portion of the casing in the pump apparatus can be surely sealed by an extremely simple configuration. Therefore, in accordance with the shaft sealing structure, the fluid in the pump apparatus can be sealed in a comparatively small space. With this, cleaning of the pump apparatus can be simplified, and the amount of fluid remaining in the pump apparatus can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">Furthermore the pump apparatus is configured such that: the shaft sealing structure includes a circular coupling portion having an insert hole through which the revolution shaft is rotatably inserted; a gap between an inner peripheral portion of the circular coupling portion and an outer peripheral portion of the revolution shaft is sealed by a sealing portion; and a gap between an outer peripheral portion of the circular coupling portion and the inner peripheral portion of the casing is sealed by the diaphragm.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">In accordance with the pump apparatus according to the present invention, an annular gap between the outer peripheral portion of the rotating revolution shaft and the inner peripheral portion of the circular coupling portion can be sealed by the sealing portion of the shaft sealing structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">In accordance with the rotor drive mechanism and the pump apparatus described, the external screw type rotor can be caused to rotate and carry out the revolution movement at an appropriate speed and phase by the control of the rotation speed control driving portion and the revolution speed control driving portion, i.e., the external screw type rotor can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement. Therefore, it is possible to omit gears used to cause the rotor to carry out the eccentric rotational movement or to reduce the number of gears. With this, even in a case where the rotor is caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement at high speed, it is possible to prevent the rotor drive mechanism from generating heat and increasing in temperature and to prevent the rotor drive mechanism from generating comparatively high vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">Since the rotation movement of the rotor and the revolution movement of the rotor are respectively carried out by the rotation speed control driving portion and the revolution speed control driving portion, the positional relation between the rotation position of the rotor and the revolution position of the rotor can be freely adjusted. Therefore, the rotor can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement along a desired certain path such that, for example, the outer surface of the rotor and the inner surface of the stator inner hole do not contact each other. A gap between the rotor and the stator inner surface is formed such that, for example, when transferring the transfer fluid containing fine particles, the fine particles are not grated by the rotor and the stator inner surface. With this, the transfer fluid can be transferred while maintaining the original shapes of the fine particle, i.e., maintaining the quality of the fine particles.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">The rotor can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement such that the outer surface of the rotor and the inner surface of the stator inner hole do not contact each other or contact each other at appropriate contact pressure. Therefore, it is possible to prevent or suppress the abrasion of the rotor and the stator and also possible to reduce the power used to rotate the rotor.</p>

A gap between an outer peripheral surface of the end portion of the revolution shaft <b>36</b> and an inner peripheral surface of the circular coupling portion <b>49</b> is sealed by a sealing portion <b>50</b>. To be specific, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sealing portion <b>50</b> slidably contacts the outer peripheral surface of the end portion of the revolution shaft <b>36</b> and the end surface of the circular coupling portion <b>49</b> to seal these contact portions.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0100">A gap between an outer peripheral surface of the circular coupling portion <b>49</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the pump casing <b>30</b> is sealed by a diaphragm <b>51</b>. The circular coupling portion <b>49</b> is rotatably attached to an end portion of the revolution shaft <b>36</b> via a bearing <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0101">In accordance with the revolution shaft sealing structure <b>28</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the end portion of the revolution shaft <b>36</b> carries out the eccentric rotational movement to carry out the revolution movement, the diaphragm <b>51</b> freely deforms with respect to the revolution movement of the end portion of the revolution shaft <b>36</b>. Therefore, a gap between the end portion of the revolution shaft <b>36</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the pump casing <b>30</b> forming the accommodating space <b>48</b> can be surely sealed by an extremely simple configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0102">Therefore, in accordance with the revolution shaft sealing structure <b>28</b>, the fluid in the pump apparatus <b>21</b> can be sealed in the comparatively small accommodating space <b>48</b>. With this, cleaning of the pump apparatus <b>21</b> can be simplified, and the amount of fluid remaining in the pump apparatus <b>21</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0103">An annular gap between the outer peripheral surface of the end portion of the rotating revolution shaft <b>36</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the circular coupling portion <b>49</b> can be sealed by the sealing portion <b>50</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent a transfer fluid, transferred by the uniaxial eccentric screw pump <b>23</b>, from flowing into the rotor revolution drive mechanism <b>25</b> and the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b>, and also possible to prevent, for example, lubricant in the rotor revolution drive mechanism <b>25</b> from flowing into the stator <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0104">Next, operations when transferring the transfer fluid using the pump apparatus <b>21</b> including a rotor drive mechanism <b>53</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> will be explained. By driving the rotation speed control driving portion <b>26</b> of the pump apparatus <b>21</b>, the external screw type rotor <b>22</b> can be rotated while controlling the external screw type rotor <b>22</b> at an appropriate rotating speed and phase. In addition, by driving the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b>, the external screw type rotor <b>22</b> can be caused to carry out the revolution movement while controlling the external screw type rotor <b>22</b> at an appropriate angular speed and phase. Thus, the rotor <b>22</b> can be caused to rotate at a desired rotating speed and phase while carrying out the revolution movement about the central axis O (the inner hole <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the stator <b>29</b>) along a predetermined certain path at a desired angular speed and phase, i.e., the rotor <b>22</b> can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement. In the eccentric rotational movement, for example, if the rotor <b>22</b> revolves once in the normal direction, it rotates once in the reverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0105">By the eccentric rotational movement of the rotor <b>22</b>, a space formed by the outer surface of the rotor <b>22</b> and the inner surface of the stator inner hole <b>29</b><i>a </i>moves in a direction from the second opening <b>35</b> side to the first opening <b>34</b> side for example. Therefore, the transfer fluid can be transferred in this direction. Thus, the transfer fluid can be suctioned from the second opening <b>35</b> and discharged from the first opening <b>34</b>. By reversely rotating the rotation speed control driving portion <b>26</b> and the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b>, the transfer fluid can be suctioned from the first opening <b>34</b> and discharged from the second opening <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0106">Moreover, the positional relation between the rotation position of the rotor <b>22</b> and the revolution position of the rotor <b>22</b> is adjusted by the rotation speed control driving portion <b>26</b> and the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b> (respective phases of the rotation position of the rotor <b>22</b> and the revolution position of the rotor <b>22</b> are adjusted by the rotation speed control driving portion <b>26</b> and the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b>). In addition, the rotation speed control driving portion <b>26</b> and the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b> are driven at a desired rotating speed. With this, the rotor <b>22</b> can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement along a desired path. Thus, the rotor <b>22</b> and the inner hole <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the stator <b>29</b> can be formed such that the outer surface of the rotor <b>22</b> and the inner surface forming the inner hole <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the stator <b>29</b> do not contact each other or contact each other at appropriate contact pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0107">As a method for setting the pump apparatus <b>21</b> such that the outer surface of the rotor <b>22</b> and the inner surface of the stator inner hole <b>29</b><i>a </i>do not contact each other or contact each other at appropriate contact pressure by using the rotor <b>22</b> and the stator <b>29</b> and adjusting the positional relation between the rotation position of the rotor <b>22</b> and the revolution position of the rotor <b>22</b>, i.e., that the rotor <b>22</b> is caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement along a desired path by using the rotor <b>22</b> and the stator <b>29</b> and adjusting the positional relation between the rotation position and revolution position of the rotor <b>22</b>, there is a method for: detecting load torques applied to the rotation speed control driving portion <b>26</b> and the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b> when these driving portions are driven; selecting the rotating speed and phase of the rotor portion <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the rotation speed control driving portion <b>26</b> and the rotating speed and phase of the rotor portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b> such that each of the load torques becomes the smallest or appropriate; and setting the selected rotating speeds and phases in the pump apparatus <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0108">Further, the rotor drive mechanism <b>53</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is configured such that the rotation speed control driving portion <b>26</b> and the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b> can cause the external screw type rotor <b>22</b> to carry out the eccentric rotational movement, i.e., to rotate and carry out the revolution movement at an appropriate speed and phase. Therefore, it is possible to omit gears used to cause the rotor <b>22</b> to carry out the eccentric rotational movement or to reduce the number of gears. With this, even in a case where the rotor <b>22</b> is caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement at high speed, it is possible to prevent the rotor drive mechanism <b>53</b> from generating heat and increasing in temperature and to prevent the rotor drive mechanism <b>53</b> from generating comparatively high vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0109">Since the rotation movement of the rotor <b>22</b> and the revolution movement of the rotor <b>22</b> are respectively carried out by the rotation speed control driving portion <b>26</b> and the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b>, the positional relation between the rotation position of the rotor <b>22</b> and the revolution position of the rotor <b>22</b> (respective phases of the rotation position of the rotor <b>22</b> and the revolution position of the rotor <b>22</b>) can be freely adjusted. Therefore, the rotor <b>22</b> can be caused to carry out the eccentric rotational movement along a desired certain path such that, for example, the outer surface of the rotor <b>22</b> and the inner surface of the stator inner hole <b>29</b><i>a </i>do not contact each other.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0110">To be specific, for example, the rotor <b>22</b> and the stator <b>29</b> can be formed such that when transferring the fluid containing fine particles, the fine particles are not grated by the rotor <b>22</b> and the inner surface of the stator <b>29</b>. With this, the transfer fluid can be transferred while maintaining the original shapes of the fine particles. Examples of the fine particles are comparatively soft powder bodies, capsule-like bodies, and saclike bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0111">Moreover, abrasion powder generated in a case where the rotor <b>22</b> and the inner surface of the stator <b>29</b> contact each other does not get mixed in the transfer fluid, and a noise is not generated by the friction between the rotor <b>22</b> and the inner surface of the stator <b>29</b>. Moreover, the gap between an outer peripheral surface of the rotor <b>22</b> and an inner peripheral surface of the stator <b>29</b> can be set to an appropriate size depending on the property of the transfer fluid (for example, a fluid containing fine particles or slurry). With this, depending on various properties of fluids, the pump apparatus <b>21</b> can transfer and fill the fluid with high flow rate accuracy, low pulsation, and a long operating life. Further, since the rotor <b>22</b> and the stator <b>29</b> can be rotated with the rotor <b>22</b> and the stator <b>29</b> not contacting each other, the rotor <b>22</b> can be rotated at a comparatively high speed by low torque, so that a comparatively high transfer ability can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0112">By forming the inner surface of the stator inner hole <b>29</b><i>a </i>and the outer surface of the rotor <b>22</b> such that the inner surface of the stator inner hole <b>29</b><i>a </i>and the outer surface of the rotor <b>22</b> contact each other at appropriate contact pressure and rotating the rotor <b>22</b>, the efficiency of transferring the transfer fluid by the pump apparatus <b>21</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0113">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, although the central axis O of the rotation of the rotation shaft <b>46</b> and the central axis A of the rotation of the revolution shaft <b>36</b> do not coincide with each other, the rotational power of the rotation shaft <b>46</b> can be transferred to the revolution shaft <b>36</b> via the power transmission portion <b>47</b>. By using a flexible joint as the power transmission portion <b>47</b>, the power transmission portion <b>47</b> can be simplified in configuration and reduced in weight.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0114">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, by using the electric servo motor as each of the rotation speed control driving portion <b>26</b> and the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b>, the speed and phase of the rotation movement of the rotor <b>22</b> and the speed and phase of the revolution movement of the rotor <b>22</b> can be easily and accurately controlled. With this, the outer surface of the rotor <b>22</b> and the inner surface forming the inner hole <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the stator <b>29</b> can be accurately adjusted and changed such that these surfaces do not contact each other or contact each other at appropriate contact pressure. Moreover, by using the hollow servo motor, the rotor rotation drive mechanism <b>27</b> and the rotor revolution drive mechanism <b>25</b> can be respectively stored in the rotation speed control driving portion <b>26</b> and the revolution speed control driving portion <b>24</b>. Thus, the pump apparatus <b>21</b> can be simplified in configuration and reduced in size.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0115">Next, the rotor drive mechanism according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention and the pump apparatus including the rotor drive mechanism will be explained in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.
