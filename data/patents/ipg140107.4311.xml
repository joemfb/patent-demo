<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0038583 filed on Apr. 26, 2010, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the inventive concept relate to stacked semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to stacked semiconductor devices capable of selecting between multiple, stacked chips.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The development of multifunctional, physically smaller electronic devices has motivated the development and design of highly integrated, multifunctional semiconductor devices. To facilitate high integration density and the multi-functionality of contemporary semiconductor devices, so-called &#x201c;multi-chip packaging&#x201d; (MCP) techniques have developed. MCP essentially allows a plurality of chips to be assembled and packaged into a single semiconductor device. MCP semiconductor devices may be divided into single-layer and multi-layered devices. Single-layer MCP semiconductor devices configure their constituent plurality of chips in a two dimensional (X and Y directions) arrangement. Multi-stage MCP semiconductor devices, also referred to as &#x201c;stacked semiconductor devices&#x201d; configured a plurality of chips in a three dimensional (X, Y and Z directions) arrangement. Within this description, the Z direction may be arbitrarily identified with a vertical stacking of the plurality of chips.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Certain conventional stacked semiconductor devices are configured to receive/provide input/output signals using interconnecting input/output (I/O) terminals. Wire bonding internal to the MCP may be used to connect I/O terminals of the plurality of stacked chips. Alternately, the I/O terminals for the plurality of chips may be connected using wire-bonding external to the MCP. However, the use of the wire-bonding increases inductance, so that the semiconductor device suffers from a decrease in performance an increase in size, and an increase in power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To make up for the above-described shortcomings, a wafer-level processed stack package (WSP) technique has been developed. In the WSP technique, circuits of the plurality of stacked chips are directly connected through via holes vertically penetrating each chip on a wafer level. These via holes may be formed using a laser, and may subsequently be filled with conductive material(s) to form so-called &#x201c;through-silicon vias (TSVs)&#x201d;. Thus, since the stacked semiconductor devices using the WSP technique are configured to directly inter-connect the plurality of chips without the need for wires, it is possible to enhance the performance of the stacked semiconductor device. The vertical distance between the chips can also be reduced, so that it is possible to remarkably reduce the thickness of the stacked semiconductor device. In addition, it is possible to reduce a (X-Y) mounting area required for disposition of the stacked semiconductor device on a board or substrate. That is, the stacked semiconductor devices enjoy greatly enhanced integration density and improved performance with reduced power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, since the plurality of chips forming a stacked semiconductor device are so-closely stacked and tightly inter-connected, it is very difficult to directly connect any given chip in the stacked plurality of chips to an external apparatus. Therefore, it is not easy to externally select a particular chip from the stacked plurality of chips. Thus, a method of more readily enabling the selection of each chip in a stacked plurality of chips is needed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. The inventive concepts may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as being limited to only the illustrated embodiments. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough and complete and fully conveys the inventive concept to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the size and relative size of various regions, layers, features and components may be exaggerated for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. Throughout the written description and drawings, like reference numbers and labels are used to denote like or similar elements. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;vertical&#x201d;, &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d;, &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element's or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the present inventive concept. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures). As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this inventive concept belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Within a stacked semiconductor device, each chip in the constituent plurality of stacked chips should have different identification designation (or code), so that each respective chip may be effectively selected from its peers. When the stacked chips have the different identification codes, an external apparatus may select one chip from the stacked plurality of chips using a chip selection signal, a chip selection code, and/or a chip selection address corresponding to the identification code. That is, when the identification code of a specific chip matches a designation (or selection) provided by a chip selection signal, chip selection code, and/or the chip selection address provided by the external apparatus, the corresponding chip may be selected. However, it is often inefficient to merely design a plurality of stacked chips such that each respective chip has a different identification code. For example, problems remain with respect to efficiently communicating a chip selection signal, chip selection code, and/or chip selection address to a particular chip.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Stacked semiconductor devices according to certain embodiments of the inventive concept may be designed with a reduced number of TSVs, and yet individual chips may have a similar configuration while facilitating the selection of any given chip from the plurality of chips having different identification codes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">(FIG.) <b>1</b> is a cross-sectional view of a stacked semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the inventive concept. Six (6) chips (respectively designated CH<b>10</b>, CH<b>11</b>, CH<b>12</b>, CH<b>13</b>, CH<b>14</b> and CH<b>15</b> and assumed to have different identification codes) are shown in the illustrated stacked semiconductor device, but those skilled in the art will recognize that this number of chips is merely exemplary.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the chips CH<b>10</b> to CH<b>15</b> includes a plurality of layers TL (an upper layer) and SL (a lower layer). (Note; that the respective chips have been flipped during assembly). Although the layers TL and SL are simply illustrated by one line in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the layers TL and SL may include one or more particular region(s) in which circuitry is formed. In other words, various devices, regions, components and related connection lines may be formed in each of the layers TL and SL.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The upper layer TL is formed on one surface of each of the chips CH<b>10</b> to CH<b>15</b>. A plurality of upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>) disposed on the upper layer TL are electrically connected to an adjacent chip or an external printed circuit board (PCB) (not shown) by bumps (B<b>101</b>, B<b>102</b>, B<b>103</b>) to (B<b>151</b>, B<b>152</b>, B<b>153</b>). In this context, the term &#x201c;adjacent chip&#x201d; identifies a neighboring (above or below) chip relative to another chip in the stacked plurality of chips. The lower layer SL is formed under the upper layer TL and includes a plurality of lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>). The upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>) may be electrically connected to the lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>) by connection lines, such as metal lines, and receive/transmit various signals from/to each other. Also, the lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>) may be electrically connected to an adjacent chip or an external PCB (not shown) by TSVs (T<b>101</b>, T<b>102</b>, T<b>103</b>) to (T<b>151</b>, T<b>152</b>, T<b>153</b>) and the bumps (B<b>101</b>, B<b>102</b>, B<b>103</b>) to (B<b>151</b>, B<b>152</b>, B<b>153</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the respective chips CH<b>10</b> to CH<b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the TSVs (T<b>101</b>, T<b>102</b>, T<b>103</b>) to (T<b>151</b>, T<b>152</b>, T<b>153</b>) are connected to the lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>) and thus to the adjacent chip by the bumps B<b>111</b> to B<b>153</b>. Since <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates only the identification code generator, it is illustrated that the TSVs (T<b>101</b>, T<b>102</b>, T<b>103</b>) to (T<b>151</b>, T<b>152</b>, T<b>153</b>) are in contact with only the lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>). However, the upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>) may also be electrically connected to the adjacent chip by the TSVs (T<b>101</b>, T<b>102</b>, T<b>103</b>) to (T<b>151</b>, T<b>152</b>, T<b>153</b>) and the bumps (B<b>101</b>, B<b>102</b>, B<b>103</b>) to (B<b>151</b>, B<b>152</b>, B<b>153</b>) in circuit portions other than the identification code generator.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In general, in a semiconductor chip manufacturing process, the TSVs (T<b>101</b>, T<b>102</b>, T<b>103</b>) to (T<b>151</b>, T<b>152</b>, T<b>153</b>) connected to the lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>) are formed using a via-middle process of forming the TSVs first and then the lower layer SL, while the TSVs connected to the upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>) are formed using a via-last process of forming the lower layer SL first and then the TSVs.</p>

In the face-down stacked semiconductor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>) disposed on the lowest chip CH<b>10</b> may be electrically connected to the PCB through the bumps (B<b>101</b>, B<b>102</b>, B<b>103</b>) to (B<b>151</b>, B<b>152</b>, B<b>153</b>), and the upper electrodes (Q<b>111</b>, Q<b>112</b>, Q<b>113</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>) of the remaining chips CH<b>11</b> to CH<b>15</b> may be electrically connected to the TSVs T<b>101</b> to T<b>153</b> of the chips CH<b>10</b> to CH<b>14</b> disposed underneath the upper electrodes (Q<b>111</b>, Q<b>112</b>, Q<b>113</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>) of the remaining chips CH<b>11</b> to CH<b>15</b> by the bumps (B<b>111</b>, B<b>112</b>, B<b>113</b>) to (B<b>151</b>, B<b>152</b>, B<b>153</b>), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the six chips CH<b>10</b> to CH<b>15</b> includes the TSVs corresponding to the half of the number of the stacked chips, that is, the three TSVs (T<b>101</b>, T<b>102</b>, T<b>103</b>) to (T<b>151</b>, T<b>152</b>, T<b>153</b>), respectively, to generate the identification code. The TSVs (T<b>101</b>, T<b>102</b>, T<b>103</b>) to (T<b>151</b>, T<b>152</b>, T<b>153</b>) are connected to the respective lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>) corresponding to the lower layer SL. Further, each of the six chips includes one of the inverters IV<b>10</b> to IV<b>15</b> formed on the upper layer TL or the lower layer SL.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the respective chips CH<b>10</b> to CH<b>15</b>, the plurality of upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>) are configured to be matched with the plurality of lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>) on a one-to-one basis. Among the upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>), the upper electrodes Q<b>103</b>, Q<b>113</b>, Q<b>123</b>, Q<b>133</b>, Q<b>143</b>, and Q<b>153</b> disposed on one side of the respective chips are electrically connected to lower electrodes P<b>101</b>, P<b>111</b>, P<b>121</b>, P<b>131</b>, P<b>141</b>, and P<b>151</b> disposed on at the other side of the respective chips by the connection lines. The remaining upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>) are electrically connected to the adjacent lower electrodes (P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>) of the corresponding lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>) by the connection lines. That is, the upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>) are configured to be rotated in unit of one electrode, and be connected to the lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>). Since the upper and lower electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>) and (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>) correspond to bits of the respective identification codes, so that the identification codes applied to the upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>) are rotated in unit of 1 bit, and are applied to the lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The inverters IV<b>10</b> to IV<b>15</b> invert signals applied from ones Q<b>103</b>, Q<b>123</b>, Q<b>133</b>, Q<b>143</b>, and Q<b>153</b> of the upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>), and apply the inverted signals to the lower electrodes P<b>101</b>, P<b>111</b>, P<b>121</b>, P<b>131</b>, P<b>141</b>, and P<b>151</b>, respectively. Thus, the plurality of chips CH<b>10</b> to CH<b>15</b> invert one of the bits of the identification codes applied from an adjacent chip or PCB to the upper electrodes (Q<b>101</b>, Q<b>102</b>, Q<b>103</b>) to (Q<b>151</b>, Q<b>152</b>, Q<b>153</b>), rotate the inverted identification codes in unit of 1 bit, and apply the rotated identification codes to the lower electrodes (P<b>101</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>103</b>) to (P<b>151</b>, P<b>152</b>, P<b>153</b>), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this case, the bits inverted by the inverters IV<b>10</b> to IV<b>15</b> in the respective stacked chips CH<b>10</b> to CH<b>15</b> have the same position. In other words, the inverters IV<b>10</b> to IV<b>15</b> are disposed at the same position in the respective chips CH<b>10</b> to CH<b>15</b>. Thus, the plurality of chips CH<b>10</b> to CH<b>15</b> may be designed to have the same general layout configuration.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Table 2 shows that, although the identification codes having different levels are applied from the PCB to the lowest bumps B<b>101</b> to B<b>103</b>, the stacked chips have different identification codes.

That is, as shown in Table 2, all identification codes applied from the PCB to the lowest bumps B<b>101</b> to B<b>103</b> may not have the same level. The identification code applied to the lower layer SL, rather than the identification code applied to the upper layer TL, may be used as the identification code of each chip.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While the stacked semiconductor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has a structure in which the six (6) chips are stacked, the stacked semiconductor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> more generally illustrates a structure in which an arbitrary number of chips &#x201c;n&#x201d; (e.g., CH<b>20</b> to CH<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1), where n is a natural number). Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a face-down stacked semiconductor device in which each chip is shown with only an identification code generator.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, since the stacked plurality of &#x201c;n&#x201d; chips CH<b>20</b> to CH<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1) are provided, the stacked chips CH<b>20</b> to CH<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1) may include &#x201c;j&#x201d; TSVs used to generate chip identification codes (e.g., T<b>201</b> to T<b>20</b><i>j </i>through (T<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1)1 to T<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1)j, respectively where &#x201c;j&#x201d; is the minimum natural number greater than or equal to n/2). Also, the upper electrodes (Q<b>201</b> to Q<b>20</b><i>j</i>) through (Q<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1)1 to Q<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1)j) of the respective chips CH<b>20</b> to CH<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1) are rotated by a unit of 1 bit and are connected to the TSVs (T<b>201</b> to T<b>20</b><i>j</i>) through (T<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1)1 to T<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1)j) through lower electrodes (P<b>201</b> to P<b>20</b><i>j</i>) to (P<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1)1 to P<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1)j).

That is, one bit of the identification code applied to an upper layer TL may be inverted, rotated by a unit of 1 bit, and then applied to a lower layer SL.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the stacked semiconductor device, which may further include an interface chip IFC<b>2</b> in addition to the stacked plurality of &#x201c;n&#x201d; chips. The interface chip IFC<b>2</b> may be used to connect a PCB (not shown) and enable communication of various signals between the plurality of stacked chips CH<b>20</b> to CH<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1) and the PCB. According to circumstances, the interface chip IFC<b>2</b> may further include an additional controller to control the plurality of stacked chips CH<b>20</b> to CH<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1). For example, when all the stacked chips CH<b>20</b> to CH<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1) are memory chips, it is inefficient for the chips CH<b>20</b> to CH<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1) to have respective controllers. Thus, each of the stacked chips CH<b>20</b> to CH<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1) may include only a memory cell array and related minimal control circuitry, and a common control circuit for the plurality of chips CH<b>20</b> to CH<b>2</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1) may be installed in the interface chip IFC<b>2</b>, thereby increasing memory integration density. The common control circuit may include a clock generator and a power supply voltage supplier. Since the interface chip IFC<b>2</b> may have one of various internal circuit configurations, the internal circuit configuration of the interface chip IFC<b>2</b> is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the stacked semiconductor device according to the certain embodiments of the inventive concept are capable of generating different identification codes assigned to respective chips in the stacked plurality of chips using an arrangement of TSVs corresponding to the one-half the number of stacked chips.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one possible example of a connection layout for each one of the chips of the stacked semiconductor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For purposes of more particularly describing the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is further assumed that n=8 for the stacked semiconductor memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, a competent identification code generator <b>10</b> may include four (4) TSVs and be configured to generate a 4-bit identification code IDi. That is, the identification code generator <b>10</b> may receive a 4-bit identification code IDi&#x2212;1 through constituent upper electrodes, rotate the 4-bit identification code IDi&#x2212;1 by a logical unit (or value) of 1 bit, invert one bit of the resulting rotated identification code, and then apply the resulting inverted rotated identification code IDi to constituent lower electrodes. In this manner, the respective chips in the stacked plurality of chips may be effectively distinguished during chip selection functions using an identification code IDi promulgated through the TSV-enabled identification code generator <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Each chip within a stacked plurality of chips may be similar configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to include a chip-enable signal generator comprising the TSV-enabled identification code generator <b>10</b>. In the above-described face-down stacked semiconductor device, the identification code generator <b>10</b> of each chip receives an identification code IDi&#x2212;1 (or a &#x201c;previous&#x201d; identification code IDi&#x2212;1) promulgated &#x201c;up&#x201d; from either a lower adjacent chip or a lower disposed PCB, rotates the previous identification code IDi&#x2212;1 by a unit of 1 bit and inverts one bit of the rotated previous identification code to generate a &#x201c;current&#x201d; identification code IDi. This current identification code&#x2014;now associated with the subject chip in the stacked plurality of chips by operation of the identification code generator <b>10</b>&#x2014;is now applied to an above adjacent chip disposed above an upper stage of the subject chip. In effect, the current identification code for a lower adjacent chip becomes a corresponding previous identification code for an upper adjacent chip in the stack. Also, since the TSVs are connected to the upper electrodes in a chip selection code transmitter <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the chip selection code transmitter <b>20</b> may receive a chip selection signal CS[0:7] from a lower disposed PCB or a lower adjacent chip, and transmits the chip selection signal CS[0:7] to an upper adjacent chip without necessarily converting the chip selection signal CS[0:7]. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, since the chip selection signal CS[0:7] is applied with a number of bits equal to the number of stacked chips, a 8-bit chip selection signal CS[0:7] is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, since the TSVs within the chip selection code transmitter <b>20</b> should transmit the chip selection signal CS[0:7], the number of TSVs is equal to the number of stacked chips. Also, the chip selection signal CS[0:7] may be use to apply an additional external signal or code, or may be used to apply an address. For example, when the semiconductor device is a memory device, the chip selection signal CS[0:7] may be included in a bank address, a low address, or a column address when applied, or be applied in the type of a chip enable signal or a clock enable signal. Thus, the chip selection signal CS[0:7] may be applied in many different forms to provide different control signal types. In addition, the chip selection signals CS<b>0</b> to CS<b>7</b> may be decoded by the PCB or the interface chip IFC<b>2</b>, and applied to the respective chips. More particularly, in the stacked semiconductor device in which the 8 chips are stacked, the chip selection signal CS[0:7] may be applied to the PCB or the interface chip IFC<b>2</b> through a 3-bit signal line, and be decoded by the PCB or interface chip IFC<b>2</b> while only one of the bits of the chip selection signal CS[0:7] is simultaneously enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an identification code decoder <b>30</b> receives the current identification code IDi from the identification code generator <b>10</b>, decodes the current identification code IDi, and outputs a resulting 8-bit chip code CID<b>0</b> to CID<b>7</b> to a selection signal generator <b>50</b>. The selection signal generator <b>50</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, may include a plurality of selection signal transmitters <b>150</b> to <b>157</b> that transmit the corresponding chip selection signals CS<b>0</b> to CS<b>7</b> as selection signals (SEL).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In each of the chips CHi in a stack of &#x201c;i&#x201d; chips, the identification code decoder <b>30</b> may enable one of the chip codes CID<b>0</b> to CID<b>7</b>, and simultaneously only one of the chip selection signals CS<b>0</b> to CS<b>7</b> may be enabled and applied. When the enabled one of the chip codes CID<b>0</b> to CID<b>7</b> matches the enabled one of the chip selection signals CS<b>0</b> to CS<b>7</b>, the selection signal SEL is enabled. When the selection signal SEL is enabled, the corresponding chip is enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The selection signal transmitters <b>150</b> to <b>157</b> include transmission gates TG<b>0</b> to TG<b>7</b> and inverters <b>10</b> to <b>17</b>, respectively. The inverters <b>10</b> to <b>17</b> invert the corresponding chip codes CID<b>0</b> to CI<b>7</b> and apply the inverted chip codes to gates of PMOS transistors of the corresponding transmission gates TG<b>0</b> to TG<b>7</b>. The chip codes CID<b>0</b> to CID<b>7</b> are applied to gates of NMOS transistors of the transmission gates TG<b>0</b> to TG<b>7</b>. Thus, the transmission gates TG<b>0</b> to TG<b>7</b> transmit the corresponding chip selection signals CS<b>0</b> to CS<b>7</b> when the corresponding chip codes CID<b>0</b> to CID<b>7</b> are enabled. Although not shown, the plurality of selection signal transmitters <b>150</b> to <b>157</b> may further include buffers, which receive the corresponding chip selection signals CS<b>0</b> to CS<b>7</b>, buffer the received chip selection signals CS<b>0</b> to CS<b>7</b>, and apply the buffered signals to the transmission gates TG<b>0</b> to TG<b>7</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Additionally and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, since only an output signal of one of the plurality of transmission gates TG<b>0</b> to TG<b>7</b> is enabled, the selection signals SEL serve to simply connect output signals of the plurality of transmission gates TG<b>0</b> to TG<b>7</b>.

Further, the selection signal generator <b>50</b> may further include another logic gate configured to generate the selection signals SEL according to enabling levels of the chip codes CID<b>0</b> to CI<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another possible example of chips within the stacked semiconductor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

In other words, the number of TSVs for the chip selection signals CS<b>0</b> to CS<b>7</b> may be reduced. Also, the chip selection code transmitter <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> of each of the chips CHi receives a chip selection code CSCD[0:2] and transmits the chip selection code CSCD[0:2] to an adjacent chip CHi+1. As the number of TSVs of the chip selection code transmitter <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> is reduced, the chip selection code CSCD[0:2] is applied with the number of bits smaller than that of the chip selection signal CS[0:7]. Each of the plurality of chips CHi includes a selection signal decoder <b>40</b>, which decodes the chip selection code CSCD[0:2] to generate chip selection signals CS<b>0</b> to CS<b>7</b>. Therefore, the chip of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes the selection code decoder <b>40</b> to enable the chip selection signals CS<b>0</b> to CS<b>7</b> instead of reducing the number of TSVs of the chip selection code transmitter <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, since the identification code generator <b>10</b>, the identification code decoder <b>30</b>, and the selection signal generator <b>50</b> have the same configuration as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a description thereof will be omitted.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Table 3 shows the identification codes for the stacked chips CH<b>30</b> to CH<b>37</b> when high-level identification codes are applied from the PCB to the lowest bumps B<b>301</b> to B<b>303</b>. Also, it is assumed that each of the chips CH<b>30</b> to CH<b>37</b> uses a signal applied to the upper layer TL as the identification code.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in Table 3, the semiconductor device in which the eight chips CH<b>30</b> to CH<b>37</b> are stacked may generate the identification codes, which are different from one another, using only three TSVs. However, for simple design, the identification code generators of the eight stacked chips CH<b>30</b> to CH<b>37</b> may be typically designed to have the same configuration. Thus, although it is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that only the seventh chip CH<b>36</b> includes the option inverter IV<b>36</b>-<b>1</b>, all the chips CH<b>30</b> to CH<b>37</b> may include the respective option inverters, among which the unused ones may be disabled using a fuse process, a laser process, and a process of forming additional TSVs.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, since the semiconductor device including the eight chips CH<b>30</b> to CH<b>37</b> is described by way of an example, only one option inverter IV<b>36</b>-<b>1</b> is further enabled. However, when the number of stacked chips is increased, the number of enabled option inverters may also be increased. If necessary, at least two option inverters may be further enabled in one chip.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the number of stacked chips is 2<sup>m</sup>, the option inverter of the (2p*m+1)-th chip may be enabled (where p is a natural number). That is, although it is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that the option inverter IV<b>36</b>-<b>1</b> of the seventh chip is enabled, when 16 chips are stacked, the option inverter of the ninth chip (when 16=2<sup>4</sup>, 2*4+1=9) may be enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Consequently, the stacked semiconductor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> requires an additional process for enabling the option inverter, but it can minimize the number of TSVs configured to generate the identification codes.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the present inventive concept, the stacked semiconductor devices of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> may have the same configuration as the stacked semiconductor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> when the number of stacked chips is 4 or less.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Although it is illustrated for clarity that the length of the TSVs is less than the distance between the upper layer and the lower layer, the distance between the upper and lower layers and the length of the TSVs may be variously embodied.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Therefore, in the stacked semiconductor device according to embodiments, although a plurality of chips are designed to have the same configuration, the number of TSVs may be reduced and the plurality of chips may have the identification codes different from one another. Thus, the stacked semiconductor device may select each of the stacked chips.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The foregoing is illustrative of embodiments and is not to be construed as limiting thereof. Although a few embodiments have been described, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this inventive concept as defined in the claims. Therefore, it is to be understood that the foregoing is illustrative of various embodiments and is not to be construed as limited to the specific embodiments disclosed, and that modifications to the disclosed embodiments, as well as other embodiments, are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
