<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A flamer may be used to sterilize poultry litter, soil, concrete, etc. The stationary or mobile flamer disclosed comprises a hood to contain the heat, an external frame, and burners. A fuel tank may be carried on the flamer or on a tractor. An additional embodiment provides for mounting the flamer on wheels, permitting the unit to be towed by a truck, four-wheeler, tractor, etc. The burners are adjustable as to angle, and fueling rate. A pressure in the fuel system is controlled by selectively switching between the liquid and vaporous components of the fuel. By limiting how low the pressure may fall, the flow of fuel from the tank to the torches is more consistent.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates generally to a flamer. More particularly the present invention relates to a fuel supply pressure controller for a stationary or mobile flamer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Poultry litter may be sterilized by chemical means. As usual, the issue becomes that of chemical retention and the effect of the chemicals on the environment. Poultry litter may also be sterilized by flame heat, as disclosed by Mackenzie in U.S. Pat. No. 3,962,044. Because he discloses stationary equipment for litter sterilization, the method of Mackenzie '044 requires a significant investment in machinery to handle the litter for sterilization. Space for the machinery and appropriate shelter is also necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A tractor drawn flamer was disclosed by Pivonka in U.S. Pat. No. 6,014,835 for the purpose of flame cultivation. Because of its open-flame design, the flamer of Pivonka '835 is not suitable for sterilization purposes. Because the use of the Pivonka '835 flamer for sterilization was not considered, there was no motivation to make the flamer enclosed for sterilization.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Handheld torches and flamers are available, again especially for weed control and ice melting. These flamers are not suitable for the large task of sterilizing large amounts of poultry litter or soil, etc. due to their small coverage and the weight that must be supported or drawn by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Propane, commonly called Liquified Petrolium (LP), is usually the fuel used for flamers such as those used to sterilize poultry litter. The equilibrium pressure inside a propane tank containing a saturated mixture of liquid and vaporous propane is strictly a function of the temperature of these contents. However, during periods of heavy fuel usage, the pressure inside the tank may fluctuate due to finite times required for boiling off of the liquid into vapor and variations in temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The rate flow of the fuel for a flamer is a function of the tank pressure. When the tank pressure varies, the fuel flow rate varies as well. Flaming, then, regardless of the purpose, may suffer in quality as long as the tank pressure is permitted to vary.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A tractor drawn flamer was disclosed by Pivonka in U.S. Pat. No. 6,014,835, which is hereby incorporated by reference. This tractor drawn flamer is used for flame cultivation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A tractor drawn or mounted flamer was disclosed by Pivonka in U.S. Patent Application 2005/0084409 (Ser. No. 10/687,854), which is hereby incorporated by reference. This tractor drawn flamer is used for flame sterilization of poultry litter.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Neither of the above mobile flamers make use of a pressure control system.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">There is therefore a need for a fuel pressure control system to use in conjunction with stationary and mobile flamers.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An object of the present invention is to provide control of the fuel supply pressure for a flamer. Such stationary and mobile flamers may be used, for instance, to sterilize materials such as poultry litter, soil, and pavement; or for weed eradication, or softening asphalt. Tractors are ubiquitous in the agricultural industry. Because of tractors' versatility, implements are often made to mount to a tractor or be drawn behind a tractor. Heat has long been used for sterilization. So is it possible to utilize a tractor for transporting a mobile flamer to provide heat for sterilization. Such a flamer is mounted on the tractor&#x2014;preferably on a three-point hitch or quick coupler. An additional embodiment of the present invention is represented by a flamer on wheels or skids and drawn behind a vehicle as a trailer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The fuel supply pressure control system of the present invention provides a way to keep the fuel tank pressure near a predetermined value even during heavy fuel usage. To effect this control, fuel feed is selected from the vaporous and liquid components of the fuel. When vapor is being drawn from the tank, an equal amount of liquid must boil off to replace the vapor removed, plus a small volume equal to the volume of liquid converted to vapor. In contrast, when liquid is drawn off the fuel tank, the volume of liquid is much smaller than the volume of the same mass of liquid, i.e. the volume of the liquid is much smaller that the volume of the vapor. So the volume of vapor that must boil off in the tank to maintain the fuel tank pressure is greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The fuel supply pressure control system of the present invention preferably makes use of a pressure switch, set to make or change contacts at a predetermined pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">This is the pressure set point for the fuel supply. As long as the pressure is greater than the pressure set point, the flamer will utilize vaporous fuel. If the fuel supply pressure drops to or below the pressure set point, the contacts in the pressure switch will change, closing a vapor solenoid valve and opening a liquid solenoid valve, and liquid will be utilized by the flamer. The liquid fuel is vaporized after leaving the fuel supply tank. As the fuel travels toward the flamer torches, the pressure rises toward ambient. Boiling of the liquid fuel will result when it reaches the vaporizing portion of the torches, as the fuel attempts to reach an equilibrium state. Hence, at the torches, the fuel burned is vaporous, regardless of which solenoid valve is open at the time.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A perspective view of one embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. A side view and a rear view are seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, respectively. A mobile flamer <b>100</b> is shown mounted on an implement hitch <b>105</b> of a tractor <b>110</b>. Fuel may, optionally, be carried on the flamer in a fuel tank <b>120</b>. In a second embodiment, the fuel may be separate from the flamer <b>100</b>, for instance, carried on the tractor in a tractor-mounted fuel tank <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A hood for the flamer <b>100</b> comprises an external frame <b>130</b> and skin <b>140</b>. Because the frame is external to the skin <b>140</b>, the frame is exposed to less radiant heat transfer, reducing the problems such as oxidation and fatigue caused by high temperatures and thermal cycling. In addition, the flamer <b>100</b> can be insulated while maintaining a reflective surface inside the flamer because frame <b>130</b> members are not in the way.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The skin <b>140</b> substantially contains the high temperature gases, protecting the surroundings and concentrating the heat to the material to be sterilized.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Adjustable skids <b>150</b> are used to maintain an appropriate height above the litter or other material <b>700</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to be sterilized. The weight of the flamer <b>100</b> may be shifted between the tractor hitch <b>105</b> and the skids <b>150</b>, as needed. The flamer <b>100</b> is picked up with the tractor hitch <b>105</b> and carried off the surface for transport, cooling, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An additional embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> wherein the flamer <b>100</b> is carried on wheels <b>510</b> and drawn behind the tractor <b>110</b> by its tongue <b>520</b>. The wheels may be drawn up, allowing the flamer <b>100</b> to rest on its skids <b>150</b> when in use. One advantage to this embodiment is that the flamer <b>100</b> may be towed behind any of a multitude of vehicles such as a truck, four-wheeler, or tractor.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The underside of the tractor-mounted flamer <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. A plurality of burners <b>610</b> are arrayed across the front of the flamer <b>100</b>, the angles of which are adjustable, as shown by the dashed lines. A barrier <b>620</b> may optionally be provided to assist in concentrating the heat, containing the gases, and protecting the surroundings. An additional option is shown as a set of rake teeth <b>630</b> to loosen and stir the material <b>700</b> being sterilized.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The mobile flamer <b>100</b> of the present invention is shown in operation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The surface material <b>700</b> being sterilized may be poultry litter, other livestock manure, soil, concrete, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A schematic of the piping and instrumentation of the flamer fuel supply pressure control system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Propane is stored in the fuel supply tank <b>120</b>. A vapor fuel line <b>805</b> and a liquid fuel line <b>810</b> are plumbed into the fuel supply tank <b>120</b>. Note that this schematic is valid for mobile and stationary flamers.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Various pressure gages <b>815</b> are provided to give insight into the current operation of the fuel system. The pressure gages <b>815</b> may be electronic and the readings displayed at a central location. The pressure gage readings may also be incorporated into a sophisticated control system.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Pressure relief valves <b>820</b> are provided at various locations throughout the fuel system. The pressure relief valves <b>820</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> expel overpressured fuel into the atmosphere. Another configuration would have the overpressured fuel piped to torches <b>825</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The fuel supply control system <b>800</b> is shown inside the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The fuel supply control system <b>800</b> comprises a vapor line solenoid valve <b>830</b> and a liquid line solenoid valve <b>835</b>. These valves are controlled by a pressure switch <b>840</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A second example of a flamer fuel system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In this example, a shutoff valve <b>910</b> is used to positively shut the flamer <b>100</b> down so no fuel flows.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Examples of the electrical relationships between the pressure switch <b>840</b> and the solenoid valves <b>830</b>, <b>835</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. In both these circuits, a battery <b>1010</b> is connected to the pressure switch <b>840</b> via an on/off switch <b>1020</b> which provides a shutdown of the flamer <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is especially suited for the piping shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the pressure switch <b>840</b> comprises a single pole double throw pressure switch. The solenoid valves <b>830</b>, <b>835</b> are normally closed valves, requiring electrical excitation to open. When the fuel source pressure decreases to the preset pressure set point, the pressure switch <b>840</b> is actuated, thereby changing the pole to which the battery <b>1010</b> is connected. At high pressures, the vapor solenoid valve <b>830</b> is open while the liquid solenoid valve <b>835</b> is closed. When the pressure drops to the pressure set point and the pressure switch <b>840</b> is actuated, the liquid solenoid valve <b>835</b> opens and the vapor solenoid valve <b>830</b> closes.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is suited for use with the plumbing illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the pressure switch <b>840</b> comprises a single pole single throw pressure switch. The vapor solenoid valve <b>830</b> is a normally open valve, while the liquid solenoid valve <b>835</b> is a normally closed valve, requiring excitation to close. When the fuel source pressure decreases to the preset pressure set point, the pressure switch <b>840</b> is actuated, thereby energizing both solenoid valves <b>830</b>, <b>835</b>. At high pressures, when neither valve is energized, the vapor solenoid valve <b>830</b> is open while the liquid solenoid valve <b>835</b> is closed. When the pressure drops to the pressure set point and the pressure switch <b>840</b> is actuated, providing connection to the solenoid valves <b>830</b>, <b>835</b>, the liquid solenoid valve <b>835</b> opens and the vapor solenoid valve <b>830</b> closes.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Because the vapor solenoid valve <b>830</b> is a normally open valve and thus, fuel may flow at any time, the additional, shutoff solenoid valve <b>910</b> is needed to provide secure shutoff of the fuel. This shutoff solenoid valve <b>910</b> is a normally closed valve, hence is closes when no power is provided to it. Note that the secure shutoff solenoid valve <b>910</b> may be used with the normally closed solenoid valves <b>830</b>, <b>835</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref> as well, providing redundant shutoff and the associated safety.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Other wiring configurations are possible, and the present invention is not limited to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Regardless of whether the fuel is from the liquid or vapor fractions of the tank <b>120</b>, the fuel pressure is dropped through a pressure regulator <b>845</b>. A shutoff solenoid valve <b>850</b> is used to turn the flamer <b>100</b> off except for a small flame, the fuel for which is provided through a needle valve <b>855</b>, bypassing the shutoff solenoid valve <b>850</b>. The small flame permits the torches <b>825</b> to be refired at any time.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a logic diagram is shown for the flamer fuel supply pressure control system <b>800</b>. The fuel supply pressure <b>1210</b> is compared to a predetermined pressure set point in a comparator block <b>1220</b>. This comparison is preferably carried out mechanically in the pressure switch <b>840</b>. If the fuel supply pressure <b>1210</b> is greater than or equal to the pressure set point, p<sub>sp</sub>, the vapor solenoid valve <b>830</b> is open and vaporous fuel is used <b>1230</b> by the flamer <b>100</b>. If the fuel supply pressure <b>1210</b> is less than the pressure set point, p<sub>sp</sub>, the liquid solenoid valve <b>835</b> is open and liquid fuel is used <b>1240</b> by the flamer <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Note that appropriate hysteresis is required in the pressure switch <b>840</b> to avoid rapid switching between liquid and vaporous fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A second embodiment of the present invention includes the flamer fuel pressure control system <b>1300</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>. In this embodiment, an electronic controller <b>1310</b>, either analog or digital, accepts a flow signal from a flow transmitter <b>1320</b> and a pressure signal from a pressure transmitter <b>1340</b>. Measurement and/or calculation of these values are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The electronic controller <b>1310</b> uses these signals to calculate an output for each of two control valves <b>1330</b>, <b>1335</b>. The flow of vapor is continuously controlled by the vapor control valve <b>1330</b>, while the flow of liquid is continuously controlled by the liquid control valve <b>1335</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The electronic controller <b>1310</b> is detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The flow and pressure signals, from the associated transmitters <b>1320</b>, <b>1340</b> are shown input into the electronic controller <b>1310</b>. A flow set point <b>1410</b> is also available to the electronic controller <b>1310</b>, adjustable by an operator. The pressure set point <b>1420</b> may be predetermined by an operator, or it may be calculated as a function of a tank temperature signal from a temperature sensor <b>1350</b>, also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In the usual fashion, as understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, errors, &#x3b5;<sub>f</sub>, and &#x3b5;<sub>p </sub>for each of the controlled variables, f and p, are calculated in the respective calculation blocks <b>1430</b>, <b>1440</b>. These are utilized in a control algorithm or algorithms <b>1450</b> such as a pair of Proportional Integral Differential (PID) loops with decoupling between the loops, or a multivariable algorithm such as a matrix control algorithm. These algorithms, as well as others, are well known in the art. The present invention is not limited to a particular automatic control algorithm <b>1450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Outputs of the control algorithm <b>1450</b> include valve position set points <b>1460</b>, <b>1470</b> for each of the two control valves <b>1330</b>, <b>1335</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The above embodiments are the preferred embodiments, but this invention is not limited thereto. It is, therefore, apparent that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.</p>
