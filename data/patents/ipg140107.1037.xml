<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A miniature component carrier includes a thin, resilient mask through which are formed multiple spaced-apart apertures each of which is sized and shaped to compliantly receive and hold a miniature component in a controlled orientation during termination processing such that the side margins of the aperture primarily contact and grip the corner regions of the miniature component. At least some of the apertures have side margins that form rhomboidal or elliptical apertures. The shape and size of the multiple spaced-apart apertures confine within an operational tolerance contact between the side margins of the aperture and the side or end wall surfaces of the electronic component. This reduces mechanical damage to the side and end wall surfaces that results from their contact with the side margins during receipt and gripping of the miniature component in the aperture.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates to a carrier for miniature components and, in particular, to a miniature component carrier having dimensionally precise slots shaped to grip the corners of a miniature electronic component and hold it in a controlled orientation without damaging the electrically conductive portions of the electronic component.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Computers and other electronic equipment are becoming more powerful and can perform a wider range of tasks. These increases in power and applicability result at least in part from an increase in the number of miniature electronic components included in each computer or other piece of electronic equipment. To help minimize the sizes of the computers and other electronic equipment and to facilitate their operation at higher speeds, electronic circuits used in computers and other electronic equipment include miniature electronic components positioned in high density packing arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One such miniature electronic component, a solid state capacitor, is a tiny rectangular &#x201c;chip&#x201d; that is smaller than a grain of rice. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a capacitor chip <b>10</b> that has a solid enclosed body <b>12</b> of square or rectangular cross section and made of ceramic or other dielectric material. Body <b>12</b> includes opposed upper and lower surfaces <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> spaced apart by a body thickness <b>18</b> and bound by opposed side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and opposed end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. The linear region along which two edges of any of the surfaces (e.g., upper, lower, side wall, or end wall surfaces) meet and form an angle is called a corner region <b>32</b>. Capacitor chip <b>10</b> includes multiple linear corner regions <b>32</b>, such as, for example, (1) corner regions <b>32</b> defined by the intersection of an edge of upper surface <b>14</b> with an edge of one of side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> or one of end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, (2) corner regions <b>32</b> defined by the intersection of an edge of lower surface <b>16</b> with an edge of one of side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> or one of end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, and (3) corner regions <b>32</b> defined by the intersection of an edge of one of side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> with an edge of one of end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Linear corner regions <b>32</b> may also include the point at which three edges meet, such as, for example, the point at which an edge of upper surface <b>14</b> meets with an edge of each of side wall surface <b>22</b> and end wall surface <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Capacitor chip <b>10</b> contains within body thickness <b>18</b> multiple spaced-apart metal plates (not shown). One terminal end of each of alternate metal plates is connected to the exterior of body <b>12</b> and is adapted by a metallizing process to form a pair of spaced-apart mutually opposed electronic contact surfaces or ends <b>36</b>. One or more of contact surfaces <b>36</b> of capacitor chip <b>10</b> are striped with a solderable paste that is dried and then fired to produce surfaces that can later be soldered directly onto a circuit board. This process is commonly referred to as &#x201c;termination.&#x201d; U.S. Pat. No. 5,226,382 describes a machine for placing a stripe or trace of solderable paste on the contact surfaces of a chip and drying the paste so that the paste can later be fired. This machine uses a metal carrier belt or tape in which slotted rubber masks are formed. Apertures in the masks receive chips in position for processing, such as covering opposed ends of the chips with solderable paste.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A relatively new miniature electronic component, an integrated passive component (IPC) or array chip, is composed of multiple circuit components fit into a single array chip that is simultaneously solderable to one of a number of different electronic circuits. This device is called an &#x201c;array chip&#x201d; because it comprises a plurality or array of circuit components, such as four or five separate capacitors stacked together in a single chip. U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,331 describes a machine for placing stripes of solderable paste on the contact surfaces of a chip array.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a typical array chip <b>40</b> with its side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> covered with stripes <b>42</b> of solderable paste. Optionally, end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may be covered with stripes <b>42</b> of solderable paste (not shown). Array chip <b>40</b> has overall dimensions such as 3.2 mm (0.125 in) long and 1.5 mm (0.060 in) wide upper and lower surfaces <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>; 1.5 mm (0.060 in) wide and 0.8 mm (0.031 in) high opposed end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>; and 0.8 mm (0.031 in) high and 3.2 mm (0.125 in) long opposed side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Where both end wall surfaces and side wall surfaces include stripes <b>42</b> of solderable paste, formation of stripes <b>42</b> on end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may occur before or after formation of stripes <b>42</b> on side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows that installing array chip <b>40</b> into an electronic circuit entails placing separate solderable paste stripes <b>42</b> along opposite wall surfaces, such as side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> (as shown) or end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> (not shown), and soldering paste stripes <b>42</b> to copper traces <b>44</b> formed on a circuit board <b>46</b>. The width of each stripe <b>42</b> is typically set at 0.38&#xb1;0.18 mm (0.015&#xb1;0.007 in), with a 0.3&#xb1;0.18 mm (0.012&#xb1;0.007 in) turn-down edge at the end of each stripe <b>42</b> along the adjacent wall as shown on respective upper and lower surfaces <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. As with other electronic components, after the paste is applied, it is subjected to a heat-drying cycle to set the paste and thereafter to a firing cycle to fuse the paste on array chip <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The small size of an array chip and the small differences between its width and height dimensions raise the importance of handling the array chip and its insertion into the mask of a carrier belt or tape. The multiple stripes are placed on only the appropriate circuit board surfaces, and their placement is accomplished with extreme accuracy. Splashing of the paste onto other surfaces of the array chip would provide a site for a short circuit and thereby significantly degrade electronic equipment function. Accordingly, a feed device places the array chip onto the carrier belt in a correct position and location, and the array chip is handled correctly so that the appropriate surface is exposed in proper orientation to receive the paste stripes within a specified accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Typically, miniature component carriers that transport miniature electronic components and present them for processing include an endless belt or tape that carries multiple miniature electronic components, such as capacitor chips <b>10</b> and array chips <b>40</b>. The endless tape is formed with a plurality of transversely oriented, elongated apertures arranged centrally between and uniformly spaced apart along the marginal edges of the tape. Each of the apertures is adapted to receive in coplanar fixed registration a thin, resilient mask having at least one aperture, and preferably multiple apertures, of a size and shape to compliantly receive and hold the miniature components in a specific orientation so that the surfaces intended for termination extend outwardly from the mask. The term &#x201c;mask&#x201d; is used in the art to define an element made of silicone rubber, or other resilient material, that surrounds and partly encloses an electronic component during some stage of its fabrication process. The purpose of a mask is to provide a generally elongated, resilient-walled holder in which an electronic component may be temporarily held during the process of metallizing its opposite ends.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an exemplary endless belt-type component carrier having a flexible metal tape <b>50</b> formed of stainless steel or other high-strength metal. Tape <b>50</b> is approximately 0.13 mm (0.005 in) thick and about 5.1 cm (2.0 in) wide and is of an &#x201c;endless&#x201d; variety in that it has no beginning or end but is maneuvered about a series of pulleys and sprocket wheels between various processing stations, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,226,382. Tape <b>50</b> is defined by multiple spaced-apart, mutually parallel side margins <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> and includes a series of pilot or sprocket holes <b>56</b> that serve as drive perforations to receive drive stubs of drive sprocket wheels (not shown). Sprocket holes <b>56</b> are disposed adjacent to at least one and preferably both of side margins <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> and are uniformly spaced along the length of tape <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, tape <b>50</b> is formed with a variety of first apertures <b>60</b> of different shape and size into which a thin, resilient mask <b>66</b> can be inserted. Each of first apertures <b>60</b> is adapted to receive in coplanar fixed registration mask <b>66</b>, which includes one or more second apertures <b>74</b> and preferably a series of second apertures <b>74</b> of sizes and shapes to compliantly receive multiple electronic components in specific orientation so that their end surfaces intended for termination extend outwardly from mask <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">First apertures <b>60</b> are preferably formed in discrete patterns and are preferably spaced centrally between and uniformly along the marginal edges of tape <b>50</b>. First apertures <b>60</b> are typically a series of closely spaced round openings as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a series of elongated rectangular openings as shown in the end portions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, or a series of elongated openings in repeated patterns in a side-by-side arrangement as shown in the center portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In a configuration of other than round holes, first apertures <b>60</b> are generally defined by a pair of spaced-apart, elongated side edges <b>62</b> bound by a pair of short-end edges <b>64</b>. Each of first apertures <b>60</b> receives a mask <b>66</b> that is of a size and shape to remain fixed to tape <b>50</b> and to carry multiple electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Mask <b>66</b> is preferably formed of silicone rubber, but may be formed of any conventional elastomeric material having sufficient elasticity to receive and grip a miniature component in a controlled orientation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> show that mask <b>66</b> is defined by a pair of spaced-apart top and bottom exterior surfaces <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> that, when mask <b>66</b> is fixed in place on tape <b>50</b>, lie coplanar with and, respectively, above and below the surfaces of tape <b>50</b>. In its simplest form, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each mask <b>66</b> is cast in place about a first aperture <b>60</b> so that a plurality of masks <b>66</b> may be arranged in a pattern parallel or transverse to the longitudinal axis of tape <b>50</b>. One or more second apertures <b>74</b> of a size smaller than that of first aperture <b>60</b> are formed in each mask <b>66</b> to keep the metal core of tape <b>50</b> out of contact with the electronic component. The size of second apertures <b>74</b> is slightly smaller than that of the electronic component in at least one direction so that the electronic component can be positionally accepted and resistively grasped during advancement of the electronic component from one processing stage to another. Mask <b>66</b> is defined by, in addition to respective top and bottom surfaces <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, a pair of opposed elongated slots <b>76</b> positioned intermediate of respective top and bottom surfaces <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> for receipt of elongated side edges <b>62</b> of first aperture <b>60</b> formed in tape <b>50</b>. The length of removable mask <b>66</b> is less than the width of tape <b>50</b> and is preferably less than the distance between adjacent sprocket holes <b>56</b>.</p>

Second apertures <b>74</b>&#x2032; are formed in a single row in each mask <b>66</b>&#x2032; along the width of carrier tape <b>50</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>7</b>B, and <b>9</b> show masks <b>66</b> having second apertures <b>74</b> of different geometries. Mask <b>66</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> includes a series of closely spaced second apertures <b>74</b> of round shape. These second apertures <b>74</b> include a single, closed curvilinear side margin <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Mask <b>66</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> includes two second apertures <b>74</b> of &#x201c;sawtooth&#x201d; shape, each of which is capable of holding multiple electronic components. Each sawtooth-shaped second aperture <b>74</b> is an elongated aperture having multiple side margins <b>78</b> that form multiple resilient teeth <b>82</b> that extend into second aperture <b>74</b>, as is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,226,382. The arrangement of side margins <b>78</b> of sawtooth-shaped second aperture <b>74</b> forms multiple individual openings <b>80</b>, each of which is capable of holding a single electronic component.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Mask <b>66</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> includes multiple second apertures <b>74</b> of a &#x201c;dog bone&#x201d; or &#x201c;bow tie&#x201d; shape and including opposed side margins <b>88</b> separated along their lengths by longer distances at opposite ends <b>90</b> and by a shorter distance at a medial location <b>92</b> between ends <b>90</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the slot distances become gradually smaller from opposite ends <b>90</b> to medial location <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An array electronic component is held in the second aperture under compression by an interference fit. For example, a 0.05 mm (0.002 in) desired interference fit nominally requires a &#xb1;0.025 mm (&#xb1;0.001 in) second aperture tolerance range, and a 0.51 mm (0.02 in) thick array electronic component typically requires a 0.43-0.48 mm (0.017-0.019 in) second aperture. A less than &#x2212;0.025 mm (&#x2212;0.001 in) second aperture width tolerance results in a second aperture that is too tight, causing the silicone rubber nubs of the second aperture to deflect (rather than compress) and thereby cant the array electronic component held in the second aperture. A second aperture opening width of greater than 0.025 mm (0.001 in) lets the component fall out of the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When loaded, individual electronic components must be centered in two directions (horizontally and vertically) within a second aperture. Currently available loading techniques require two processing steps to correctly position an electronic component within each second aperture. First, an electronic component is loaded into a second aperture such that the electronic component is centered in only one direction, typically horizontally. Second, the electronic component is centered between the top and bottom exterior surfaces of the mask. Exemplary secondary operations include, for example, (1) exposing the electronic component to a high-pressure gust of air that forces the electronic component into the desired alignment and (2) mechanically pushing the electronic component into the desired alignment, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,863,331 and 5,226,382. Both of these exemplary secondary operations involve contact with the loaded electronic component. Further, because of the tight fit of the electronic component in the second aperture, a significant amount of force is required to center the electronic component. Consequently, the secondary operation often results in mechanical damage to the loaded component. Further, the secondary operation is an additional processing step that requires the use of additional machinery and increases processing time for each electronic component.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Also, some of the prior art second aperture geometries, e.g., the sawtooth formation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, do not consistently hold electronic components in the desired orientation, causing them to move during processing and thereby reducing the overall yield of usable electronic components. With specific reference to the sawtooth formation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, this is so because each of the individual openings that comprise the elongated second aperture have incongruous side margins and thus lack sufficient aperture side margin grip to tightly and securely hold multiple electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, because the second apertures are shaped such that the sides of the electronic component tightly contact the side margins of the second aperture, the electrically conductive portions of the electronic components can be damaged during processing. Further, removing the terminated electronic components from the second apertures as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,331 requires a significant amount of force because of the tight fit necessary to hold the electronic component in the desired orientation during processing. This force can mechanically damage the terminated electronic component, thereby reducing the overall yield of usable electronic components. Further, during the receipt, gripping, positioning, and ejection processes, the terminated electronic component may be subject to smearing of the conductive stripes <b>42</b> as the electronic components slide along the side margins of the second aperture, which degrades the finished component's performance.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the case of using a round second aperture <b>74</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the side margins of the second aperture tightly contact the side and end wall surfaces of the electronic component, and any previously formed electrically conductive stripes on the electronic components can be damaged during receipt of the electronic component into the second aperture. Further, the method of removing the terminated electronic components from the second apertures described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,331 requires a significant amount of force because of the tight fit necessary to hold the electronic component in the desired orientation during processing. Application of this force can result in mechanical damage to the terminated electronic component, thereby reducing the overall yield of usable electronic components. Further, the terminated electronic component may be subject to smearing of the conductive stripes as they slide along the side margins of the second aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">What is needed, therefore, is a mask including miniature component apertures capable of receiving in a single step miniature electronic components and of gripping them in a controlled orientation during termination of the ends of the electronic components without damaging their electrically conductive portions.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A miniature electronic component carrier capable of receiving and holding multiple miniature components includes a thin, resilient mask through which are formed multiple spaced-apart apertures each of which has a periphery that is sized and shaped to compliantly receive and grip a miniature electronic component in a controlled orientation during termination processing. This controlled orientation ensures that the electronic component surfaces intended for termination (e.g., the upper and lower surfaces of a chip capacitor and the side wall surfaces of a chip array) extend outwardly from the mask. In some embodiments, the apertures have peripheries that form rhomboidal or elliptical apertures. The shapes of the peripheries of these apertures facilitate placement of a miniature electronic component in each aperture such that component holding regions of the periphery of the aperture contact and grip primarily the corner regions of the miniature electronic component. The shapes and sizes of the peripheries of the multiple spaced-apart apertures confine gripped electronic components by contact within an operational tolerance with any one of the side and end wall surfaces of the electronic components to prevent mechanical damage to the side and end wall surfaces resulting from their contact with the peripheries during receipt, gripping, positioning, and ejection of the miniature electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Some embodiments of the miniature electronic component carrier may also include one or more relief openings that extend from or are adjacent to the apertures. The relief openings facilitate temporary deformation of the resilient mask during receipt and gripping of a miniature electronic component. One exemplary type of relief opening is a slot that extends outwardly from a vertex of a rhomboidal aperture. Another exemplary type of relief opening includes one or more relief opening side margins that form a square, rectangular, circular, triangular, elliptical, trapezoidal, curved, or semicircular relief opening. This type of relief opening is positioned adjacent to a side margin of a rhomboidal or elliptical aperture.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When used in reference to a mask, the term &#x201c;apertures&#x201d; refers to the above-described second apertures. Preferred embodiments of a miniature component carrier include a thin, resilient mask through which are formed multiple spaced-apart apertures each of which has a periphery that is sized and shaped to compliantly receive and grip the corner regions of a miniature electronic component. Gripping the corner region limits contact between component holding regions of the periphery of each aperture and the side and end wall surfaces of each gripped electronic component. Limiting such contact reduces mechanical damage to the side and end wall surfaces resulting from their contact with the periphery during receipt, gripping, positioning, and ejection of the miniature component. The shape and size of each aperture also ensures that the electronic component gripped and held by the aperture maintains a controlled orientation during termination processing. This controlled orientation ensures that the surfaces intended for termination (i.e., the upper and lower surfaces of a capacitor chip and the side wall surfaces of an array chip) extend outwardly from the mask. Exemplary aperture shapes that facilitate receipt and grip of the corner regions of a miniature electronic component include substantially rhomboidal and elliptical apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a mask <b>100</b> that includes multiple apertures of various geometries. Skilled persons will recognize that, in practice, masks for use in miniature component carriers typically include multiple apertures having a single geometry. The depiction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> of a carrier tape having apertures of various geometries is meant to show some exemplary embodiments of apertures that may be formed in mask <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A leftmost aperture <b>104</b><sub>1 </sub>in mask <b>100</b> has four linear side margins <b>102</b> that form a rhomboidal aperture <b>104</b> having four vertices <b>105</b>. The term &#x201c;rhomboidal&#x201d; refers to a parallelogram with unequal adjacent sides, such as a rhombus, diamond, or rhomboid. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is an enlarged plan view of an electronic component <b>106</b> seated within rhomboidal aperture <b>104</b><sub>1 </sub>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. A portion of each aperture side margin <b>102</b> forms a linear holding region <b>108</b> where aperture side margin <b>102</b> contacts a corner region <b>110</b> of electronic component <b>106</b>. As stated above, corner region <b>110</b> is a linear region along which two edges of any of the surfaces (e.g., upper, lower, side wall, or end wall surfaces) of electronic component <b>106</b> meet and form an angle. Corner region <b>110</b> may include the point at which three of the edges meet, such as, for example, the point at which an edge of the upper surface meets an edge of a side wall surface and an edge of an end wall surface. In addition to contacting corner region <b>110</b>, holding region <b>108</b> may contact a minimal portion (e.g., 7%) of side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and/or end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of electronic component <b>106</b>. The 7% overlap of holding region <b>108</b> and side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and/or end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> represents an operational tolerance beyond which undesirable damage to the side and end wall surfaces of the electronic component may result. An overlap of greater than 7% will result in excessive interference between holding region <b>108</b> and stripes <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When seated in rhomboidal aperture <b>104</b><sub>1</sub>, electronic component <b>106</b> places mechanical stress or pressure on holding regions <b>108</b> of side margins <b>102</b>. To reduce the amount of mechanical stress on holding regions <b>108</b>, relief openings <b>114</b> provided in mask <b>100</b> facilitate temporary deformation of mask <b>100</b> during receipt and gripping of miniature electronic component <b>106</b>. Apertures <b>104</b><sub>2</sub>-<b>104</b><sub>9 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> include relief openings <b>114</b>. Relief openings <b>114</b><sub>s </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> are slots that extend outwardly from at least one of vertices <b>105</b> of rhomboidal aperture <b>104</b>. The length of each slot-type relief opening <b>114</b><sub>s </sub>is preferably between about 10% and 100% of the length of one of side margins <b>102</b>. In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, slot-type relief openings <b>114</b><sub>s </sub>include a bulbous hole <b>118</b>. Slot-type relief openings <b>114</b><sub>s </sub>may be formed without bulbous hole <b>118</b>. Although each of apertures <b>104</b><sub>2</sub>-<b>104</b><sub>9 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> includes multiple slot-type relief openings <b>114</b><sub>s</sub>, some embodiments of aperture <b>104</b> may include only a single slot-type relief opening <b>114</b><sub>s</sub>. In embodiments where an even number of slot-type relief openings <b>114</b><sub>s </sub>are present, they preferably extend from opposed vertices <b>105</b> of aperture <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A rightmost aperture <b>120</b><sub>10 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> includes curved side margins <b>102</b>, and <b>102</b><sub>2 </sub>that are of convex shape curving outward relative to the aperture interior and are portions of a single, closed curvilinear side margin <b>102</b> that forms an elliptical aperture <b>120</b> having a major axis <b>122</b> and a minor axis <b>124</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). Elliptical aperture <b>120</b><sub>10 </sub>has sufficient eccentricity to confine within the operational tolerance described above contact between side margins <b>102</b> of aperture <b>120</b> and side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of electronic component <b>106</b>. Some embodiments of elliptical apertures <b>120</b> are of a rhomboidal-ellipsis shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is an enlarged diagram of electronic component <b>106</b> seated within elliptical aperture <b>120</b><sub>10 </sub>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Portions of side margin <b>102</b> of elliptical aperture <b>120</b> form holding regions <b>108</b> where aperture side margin <b>102</b> contacts corner region <b>110</b> of electronic component <b>106</b>. As stated above, in addition to contacting corner region <b>110</b>, holding region <b>108</b> may contact a minimal portion (e.g., 7%) of side wall surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and/or end wall surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of electronic component <b>106</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Apertures <b>104</b> and <b>120</b> may be formed in mask <b>100</b> by laser processing, molding, and die punching. One exemplary method of laser processing is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/678,951, which is assigned to the assignee of the present application. In this method of laser processing, an ultraviolet (UV) laser beam is directed to cut through a component carrier mask made of thin elastomeric material to form apertures having the desired shape and size. A preferred embodiment uses a UV laser beam to form by ablation multiple apertures in a resilient mask made of elastomeric material. Ablation of the elastomeric material, which is preferably silicone rubber, ensures formation of apertures of the required shape and dimensional quality. The absorption of conventional elastomeric materials, including silicone rubber, at the UV laser ablation wavelength region (shorter than about 400 nm) is insufficiently strong to cut apertures at commercially acceptable throughput rates. To overcome this drawback, preferred methods of UV laser processing entail introducing a light absorptivity enhancement material into the silicone rubber to form a flexible support blank that operationally adequately absorbs light within a laser ablation wavelength region, and using a UV laser beam to cut the apertures. Iron oxide and titanium dioxide are preferred dye dopants that function as light absorptivity enhancement materials.</p>
