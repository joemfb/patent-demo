<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to primary and secondary electrochemical energy storage systems, particularly to such systems as battery cells, which use materials that take up and release ions as a means of storing and supplying electrical energy.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lithium rechargeable batteries are the premier energy storage device for portable electronics applications. However, a significant need remains for the improvement of the energy density of the cells. The main limiting factor to the realization of such energy density increase is the positive electrode materials.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">All lithium secondary batteries utilize positive electrodes of intercalation compounds which retain their crystal structure upon lithium insertion. The host structure remains intact even though the lattice may expand, contract or distort slightly upon Li<sup>+</sup> insertion. The transition metals present in all of the intercalation compounds are capable of multiple electron transfer and thus higher capacity, however, the limited lithium vacancies inhibit the incorporation of more lithium and thus the charge transfer of more electrons to the structure. Further, the covalency of the transition metal dichalcogenide bond reduces the voltage of the reaction. The most popular transition metal dichalcogenides have a common crystal structure and form a group of layered, highly anisotropic compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In contrast to the intercalation process, the conversion process enables full utilization of all the redox potentials of the host metal as it reduces fully to the metallic state. In the specific case of metal fluorides, this transition behaves quasi-ion-like with redox potentials approaching that of free ions in solution due to the fact that metal fluoride compounds are highly ionic. The metal fluoride conversion reaction leads to LiF and metal (Me) products which are on the scale of 2-5 nm. Reversibility and thus reformation of the MeF<sub>x </sub>structure can occur on the following charge due to the extremely small diffusion distances between these thermodynamically very stable reaction products. The practical result is the theoretical improvement of the specific capacity of the positive electrode from 274 mAh/g for layered intercalation compounds to &#x3e;700 mAh/g for the reversible conversion metal trifluorides. This may be represented according to formula [1]:
<br/>

</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The physical proof of the ability of fluorides to reversibly convert has been demonstrated by the separate but parallel efforts of Hong (Li, H., et al. <i>Adv. Mater. </i>15:736-739. 2003) and Badway (Badway, F., et al. <i>J Electrochem. Soc. </i>150(10):A1318-A1327. 2003; Badway, F., et al. <i>J Electrochem. Soc. </i>150(9):A1209-A1218. 2003). Hong's work involved the use of a TiF<sub>3 </sub>compound. Reversible conversion was confirmed through the use of Raman spectroscopy which suggested the reformation of TiF<sub>3 </sub>while the electrochemical data showed multiple cycle reversibility. Badway's approach focused on higher voltage metal fluorides which typically are more insulating. FeF<sub>3</sub>, FeF<sub>2</sub>, NiF<sub>2 </sub>and CoF<sub>2 </sub>nanocomposites were fabricated with conductive carbon matrices in order to enable their electrochemical properties. These nanocomposites were of relatively low surface area with nanocrystalline regions of MeF<sub>x </sub>(10-30 nm) encapsulated by an amorphous carbon matrix. Specific capacities in excess of 600 mAh/g and 400 mAh/g were demonstrated at 70&#xb0; C. for FeF<sub>3 </sub>and NiF<sub>2</sub>, respectively. This approach has lead to the realization of the theoretical voltage of a wide variety of compounds including FeF<sub>3</sub>, FeF<sub>2</sub>, NiF<sub>2</sub>, CoF<sub>2</sub>, as well as CrF<sub>3</sub>, CrF<sub>2 </sub>and BiF<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The utilization of nanocomposites realizes near theoretical specific capacity with theoretical volumetric energy densities approaching that of CF<sub>x</sub>. The exceptional rate capability of these materials and their reversibility has been shown to occur through the use of in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Reversibility was further shown by prefabricating 3LiF+Fe nanocomposites and cycling, thereby liberating lithium during the first charge to be utilized in a Li-ion configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many of the MeF<sub>3 </sub>structures are related to PdF<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;ReO<sub>3 </sub>structures based on a primitive cubic cell unit that consists of corner shared MeF<sub>6 </sub>octahedrons and empty &#x201c;A&#x201d; sites. There is little to prevent shearing of these crystal structures hence there is a large range of crystallographic distortions upon moving from the ReO<sub>3 </sub>structure to the PdF<sub>3 </sub>structure. These structures form vacant octahedral interstices that allow the diffusion of lithium ions. Cation vacancies allow many MeF<sub>3 </sub>materials to support intercalation and thereby form Li<sub>x</sub>MeF<sub>3 </sub>compounds such as TiF<sub>3</sub>, FeF<sub>3</sub>, and VF<sub>3 </sub>(Arai, H., et al., <i>J Power Sources. </i>68:716. 1997). It has been demonstrated in other works that the MeF<sub>3 </sub>compounds supported a 1e<sup>&#x2212;</sup> intercalation region followed by the 2e<sup>&#x2212;</sup> conversion reaction resulting in the following reaction [2]:

</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the case of FeF<sub>3 </sub>nanocomposites, the intercalation mechanism was found to be quite fast and very reversible.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Studies have reported the synthesis of metal fluoride nanocomposite electrode materials utilizing a novel mechanochemical induced reaction. High energy milling of the insulating CF<sub>1 </sub>and MeF<sub>2 </sub>compounds resulted in a solid state redox reaction with the oxidation of the MeF<sub>2 </sub>compound into MeF<sub>3</sub>. This reaction was induced by the oxidation of the MeF<sub>2 </sub>compound to MeF<sub>3 </sub>by the oxidizing power of HT (high temperature fabricated) CF<sub>1</sub>. The resulting product was a fine nanocomposite of MeF<sub>3 </sub>in a matrix of conducting carbon that may be represented according to the following reaction [3]:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CF<sub>1</sub>+MeF<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;C+MeF<sub>3</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;[3]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The mechanochemical induced oxidation reaction was successfully carried out for the reaction CrF<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;CrF<sub>3 </sub>and FeF<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;FeF<sub>3</sub>. Such materials exhibited good reversibility and excellent capacities in excess of 600 mAh/g and 500 mAh/g, respectively. This technique worked for all metal fluorides with Me<sup>2+</sup>&#x2192;Me<sup>3+</sup> redox levels below that of the theoretical oxidizing power of CF<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Previous methodologies for the fabrication of iron fluoride nanocomposites with the highest specific energy density consisted of the high energy milling of various iron fluoride components with a conductive matrix, such as carbon. Although such nanocomposites have imparted marked improvements in energy density relative to existing materials, significant improvement in the rate capability (power density) of the material is needed. Additionally, improvement in the cycling efficiency of the material such that the material can be discharged and charged repeatedly with very little cycle to cycle capacity fade also is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One novel approach is the use of oxyfluoride materials of iron as the active electrode materials. Although such materials have been isolated before, none have been examined as possible electrode materials for lithium batteries. Although Brink et al. (F. J. Brink, R. L. Whiters and J. G. Thompson, J. Solid State Chem., 155, 359-365. 2000) previously reported the solid state synthesis of FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x </sub>solid-solutions utilizing FeF<sub>2 </sub>and FeOF precursors, a significant disadvantage of this fabrication technique is that it requires the preliminary synthesis of FeOF, which cannot be formed below 925&#xb0; C. Moreover, synthesis of the FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x </sub>solid-solutions was performed under controlled atmosphere and very high temperatures (850&#xb0; C. for 3 hours) that resulted in the formation of macrocrystalline compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention provides herein a new positive electrode material for electrochemical energy storage and a solution fabrication process for the synthesis of nanostructured iron (oxy)fluoride materials from iron metal and fluorosilicic acid (H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>) aqueous solutions. The solution synthesis rationale comprises the fabrication at low temperature of nanostructured iron (oxy)fluoride materials FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-y</sub>, with compositions ranging over the entire range from FeF<sub>2 </sub>to FeOF, utilizing inexpensive, commercially available precursors. The formation of a FeSiF<sub>6 </sub>hydrate intermediate and its subsequent anneal in air are steps critical for the formation of the (oxy)fluoride materials.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Solution Fabrication Process Methodology</heading>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Nanostructured iron (oxy)fluoride materials of tunable oxygen content were fabricated through a solution fabrication process from iron metal and fluorosilicic acid (H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>) aqueous solutions. Briefly, iron metal (10 grams) in powder form was dissolved in 141 grams of a 20-25 wt % fluorosilicic acid in water solution. The mixture was placed at 40-45&#xb0; C. overnight to allow the reaction of the metal with the fluorosilicic acid. After filtering the excess iron metal, the resulting green solution was placed in air at 110&#xb0; C. until a dry powder formed. An alternative route consisted in drying the solution for 2-3 hours at 200&#xb0; C. (e.g., on a stirring hotplate) prior to drying at 110&#xb0; C. The latter process reduced the processing time considerably. Both routes resulted in the synthesis of a FeSiF<sub>6 </sub>hydrate compound in the powder form.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> shows an illustrative x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for the rhombohedral R-3m FeSiF<sub>6</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O compound which completely transforms into tetragonal P4<sub>2</sub>/mnm FeF<sub>2 </sub>and FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x</sub>, with (110), (101), (111), (210), (211) and (220) diffraction peaks, when subsequently heat treated at 200&#xb0; C. for 4 hours in argon and air respectively. While both the FeF<sub>2 </sub>and the FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x </sub>compounds crystallize in the rutile-type structure, all the (hk1) diffraction peaks of the oxyfluoride compound were found to be shifted towards larger angles compared to pure fluoride.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Table 1 shows the unit cell volume and lattice parameters of compounds of the present invention. The lattice parameters of the FeF<sub>2 </sub>obtained by the solution process after heat-treatment with argon agree well with those of a commercial sample (Table 1). In contrast, the materials synthesized in air, which exhibited (hk1) Bragg reflections shifted towards larger angles revealed a decrease of the tetragonal a- and more particularly of the c-lattice parameter (Table 1). The contraction of the rutile-type unit cell of the FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x </sub>compound obtained in air compared to FeF<sub>2 </sub>obtained in argon stems from the oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> into Fe<sup>3+</sup>, which is smaller in size, concurrent with the direct substitution of O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> into the fluoride anion sublattice. Since both the O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> and F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> anions have similar size, substitution may occur randomly throughout the entire anion sublattice.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> illustrates the importance of the air heat-treatment of the FeSiF<sub>6 </sub>hydrate in order to obtain iron oxyfluorides of non-negligible oxygen content. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> shows the structural patterns obtained after annealing the commercial and solution-based (i.e. obtained by annealing the FeSiF<sub>6 </sub>hydrate intermediate in argon) FeF<sub>2 </sub>in air at 200&#xb0; C., compared to the compound generated upon direct heat-treatment (in air) of FeSiF<sub>6 </sub>hydrate under similar conditions. Both types of FeF<sub>2 </sub>samples maintained the initial structural characteristics of FeF<sub>2 </sub>with little or no variation of the unit cell volume upon annealing in air. Increasing the duration of the heat-treatment to 24 hours did not affect the FeF<sub>2 </sub>structure significantly. The only change observed in the commercial sample consisted in the generation of small amounts of the Fe<sub>1.9</sub>F<sub>4.95 </sub>0.95H<sub>2</sub>O hydrate. In contrast, the FeSiF<sub>6</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O compounds directly annealed in air showed significant volume contraction (Table 1). The latter is brought about by a decrease in c-lattice parameter consistent with the shift of (hk1) diffraction peaks towards larger angles associated to the introduction of significant amounts of oxygen into the fluoride structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Effect of Annealing Temperature, Time and Atmosphere on the Iron (Oxy)Fluoride Composition: X-Ray Diffraction</heading>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The solution fabrication process described herein was utilized to synthesize FeF<sub>2 </sub>compound. This FeF<sub>2 </sub>compound was distinct from commercially obtained FeF<sub>2</sub>. When synthesized under argon (Ar), the synthesized FeF<sub>2 </sub>compound showed no evidence of any second phase while the FeF<sub>2 </sub>obtained from the commercial source contained small amounts of a Fe<sub>2</sub>F<sub>5</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O hydrate. Further, the broader diffraction peaks associated with the compound obtained by the solution fabrication process indicates that crystallite size (22 nm) of the newly fabricated material was one order of magnitude smaller than the commercial source (&#x3e;100 nm) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The crystallite size was determined with the Scherrer formula using the (110) diffraction peaks.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Upon annealing in air at temperatures as low as 150&#xb0; C., the FeSiF<sub>6 </sub>hydrate converts into a rutile-type tetragonal material of P4<sub>2</sub>/mnm space group similar to that of FeF<sub>2 </sub>(obtained upon annealing in Ar) but with all (hk1) derived diffraction peaks shifted towards larger angles as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the rutile structure was maintained at higher temperatures and/or longer annealing time but revealed a systematic increase in the shift of the (hk1) reflections. This shift could be controlled by adjusting the temperature and time of the heat-treatment in air. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the (hk1) peak systematic shift translated into a continuous decrease of the c-lattice parameter and more specifically of the c/a ratio of the rutile-type structure, as the decrease of the a-lattice parameter remained of much smaller scale. The c-lattice parameter decreased to 3.21 &#x212b; compared to 3.30 &#x212b; for pure FeF<sub>2 </sub>after only 1.5 hours at 200&#xb0; C. It further decreased to 3.12 &#x212b; after annealing in air for 24 hours. Lower c-lattice parameters were obtained with temperatures above 200&#xb0; C. than those obtained at 200&#xb0; C. with annealing times of up to 24 hours. For example, after 8 hours at 250&#xb0; C., the c-lattice parameter decreased to 3.04 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The oxygen content of the iron oxyfluoride materials synthesized by the solution fabrication process were evaluated utilizing the c-lattice parameters obtained by XRD analysis and the phase diagram established by Brink et al. (F. J. Brink, R. L. Whiters and L. Noren, <i>J. Solid State Chem., </i>161, 31-37 (2001)). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the iron oxyfluoride materials oxygen content plotted versus c-lattice parameters. The solution fabrication process allows the fabrication of FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x </sub>compounds where x spans over the entire x range (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) from pure FeF<sub>2 </sub>(when annealed in Ar for 4 hours) to pure FeOF (when annealed at 250&#xb0; C. for 8 hours). However, a slight decomposition of FeOF into Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and FeF<sub>3 </sub>resulted when the annealing temperature was raised to 300&#xb0; C. in air for 4 hours, as evidenced by the emergence of additional reflections of low intensity, which could be associated to both phases (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Broad and low intensity diffraction peaks combined with the similarity of the lattice parameters of FeF<sub>3 </sub>and &#x3b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which also crystallize in the same space group R-3c, make the distinction of both phases difficult.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Carbon-iron fluoride nanocomposites were fabricated by mechanical milling of activated carbon with (i) solution fabrication process derived FeF<sub>2</sub>, or (ii) commercial FeF<sub>2</sub>. The milling vessel was loaded and sealed either in a helium (He)-filled glove box or in a dry room with &#x3c;1% humidity (air). High energy milling in either air or He did not affect the iron fluoride core crystal structure significantly. The carbon-based nanocomposites maintained their initial tetragonal P4<sub>2</sub>/mnm system symmetry as demonstrated by XRD, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, milling induced a slight change in the lattice parameters correlated to the splitting of the (220) and (002) Bragg peaks in the 55&#xb0; 2&#x3b8; region. This phenomenon was more pronounced with the solution fabrication process derived FeF<sub>2</sub>, where the splitting stems from a small increase of the a-lattice parameter, which is concomitant with a small decrease of the c-lattice parameter (Table 2).</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Finally, milling resulted in the broadening of the diffraction peaks. This was associated with the reduction of the iron fluoride nanocrystalline regions down to 12-15 nm based on the Scherrer formula utilizing the (110) Bragg peak (Table 2) and was more significant with the initially macro structured commercial material.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The milling atmosphere did not affect significantly the bulk structure of the nanocomposites obtained from the solution fabrication process derived FeF<sub>2 </sub>and the commercial FeF<sub>2</sub>, however it had a significant impact on the materials electrochemical performance. The electrochemical testing was performed utilizing two-electrode coin cells (Hohsen, CR2032, 20 mm diameter and 3.2 mm thick) assembled in a He-filled dry box using a lithium foil counter electrode and glass fiber separators (GF/D, Whatman) saturated with 1M LiPF<sub>6 </sub>in ethylene carbonate:dimethyl carbonate electrolyte (50:50 in vol. %). The cells were cycled at 60&#xb0; C. under a constant current of 50 mA/g between 1.5 and 4.5V. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> where the discharge capacity, of the nanocomposites which include 15% activated carbon, is plotted as a function of cycle number, while all samples exhibited poor cycle life, improved cycling stability was observed for the nanocomposites milled in air compared to the nanocomposites milled in He. Such improvement was observed regardless of the iron fluoride (FeF<sub>2</sub>) source, i.e., whether commercial or solution fabrication process derived.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">A small increase in Brunauer, Emmet and Teller (BET) surface area was observed for the nanocomposites obtained after milling in air compared to milling in He using both FeF<sub>2 </sub>sources (Table 2). Without being limited by theory, these results suggest that a change in the materials surface morphology and chemistry most likely occurred during milling in air and further suggests that the surface chemistry, rather than bulk chemistry, is the origin of the improved stability observed for the nanocomposites fabricated by milling in air. Thus, the formation of a thin surface layer of iron oxide or oxyfluoride may be beneficial to cycling stability.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Carbon-iron oxyfluoride nanocomposites were fabricated utilizing iron (oxy)fluoride materials derived from the solution fabrication process. The iron (oxy)fluoride materials (FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x</sub>) were of various compositions and included those over the entire range from pure FeF<sub>2 </sub>to FeOF. These iron (oxy)fluorides were milled with 15 wt % activated carbon (ASupra&#xae;, Norit) for 1 hour. A total of 1 gram of material was loaded into hardened steel milling cells in a dry room with less than 1% humidity.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Milling in air did not affect the iron (oxy)fluoride core structure significantly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows XRD data illustrating that all the carbon-based nanocomposites retained the tetragonal P4<sub>2</sub>/mnm system symmetry of the initial iron oxyfluoride. The change of the c-lattice parameters upon milling was non-statistically significant. Based on the phase diagram reported by Brink et al. (F. J. Brink, R. L. Whiters and L. Noren, <i>J. Solid State Chem., </i>161:31-37. 2001), the oxygen content of the FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x </sub>oxyfluoride-based nanocomposites spanned from x=0.28 to x=1 as the c-lattice parameters ranged from 3.212&#xb1;0.004 to 3.023&#xb1;0.013.</p>

Additionally, the slight broadening of the diffraction peaks, which was more significant in the case of the initially macro structured commercial FeF<sub>2</sub>, indicated that the iron (oxy)fluoride nanocrystalline regions of the resulting nanocomposites were reduced upon milling to 7-15 nm based on the Scherrer formula utilizing the (110) Bragg peaks.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Cathodes comprising the nanocomposites were tested in 2-electrode coin cells using a lithium metal counter electrode under constant current (50 mA/g) between 1.5V and 4.5V at 60&#xb0; C.

All oxyfluoride-based nanocomposites showed improved cycling stability compared to the FeF<sub>2</sub>-based nanocomposites.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The capacity retention was evaluated after 30 cycles by plotting the discharge capacity ratio of the 30<sup>th </sup>to the 2<sup>nd </sup>cycle versus the nanocomposite c-lattice parameters. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the introduction of oxygen into the fluoride structure (as opposed to the introduction of oxygen onto the surface as demonstrated in Example 1) was observed to have a beneficial impact on cycle life. The cycling efficiency rose from 40-50% for the commercial FeF<sub>2 </sub>and solution fabrication process derived FeF<sub>2 </sub>materials to 79-89% for the oxyfluoride materials. For comparison, a FeF<sub>3</sub>-based nanocomposite exhibited a 54.1% cycling efficiency when tested under the same protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">After the significant increase induced by minimal oxygen substitution, the data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> suggests a continuous increase of capacity retention with decreasing c-lattice parameter within the 3.21-3.09 &#x212b; range, which corresponds to an increase in oxygen content (x) from 0.28 to 0.75 in the FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x </sub>compounds (approximate values). Cycling stability was not improved further by increasing the oxygen content to produce pure FeOF. However, further cycle life improvement was achieved when oxidation, during the oxyfluoride fabrication, was pushed beyond pure FeOF, leading to the formation of small amounts of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and FeF<sub>3</sub>. The improvement in cycle life brought about by the introduction of oxygen into the oxyfluoride structure was achieved at the expense of initial discharge capacity.</p>

Example 2.5.2 describes air post-mill anneals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows XRD data from the nanocomposites. As observed for the air post-mill anneals, as the annealing temperature increased from 200&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C., the (101) and (211) peaks of the tetragonal FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x </sub>systematically shift towards larger (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). Thus, the oxygen post-mill anneal temperature increase leads to a systematic increase of the nanostructured oxyfluoride oxygen content.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x</sub>&#x2014;FeF<sub>3 </sub>based nanocomposites submitted to post-mill annealing in oxygen were tested versus lithium metal in 2-electrode coin cells. Cycling was performed at 60&#xb0; C. under a constant current of 50 mA/g between 1.5V and 4.5V. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a plot of discharge specific energy density versus cycle number under 4 conditions: (1) no post-mill; (2) 200&#xb0; C. for 2 hours; (3) 250&#xb0; C. for 2 hours; and (4) 300&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. The materials' capacity retention improved with the oxygen post-mill anneal at 200&#xb0; C. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). Post-mill anneals in oxygen performed at higher temperature are detrimental to the nanocomposites electrochemical performance.</p>

<heading id="h-0035" level="1">Cycling Over the 2.4-4.5V Range</heading>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In this embodiment, electrochemical testing was narrowed to the 2.4-4.5V range. Previous electrochemical testing was performed between 1.5 and 4.5V. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows the specific discharge energy density plotted versus the cycle number for (1) a nanocomposite fabricated from nanostructured FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x </sub>obtained by the solution fabrication process; (2) a nanocomposite fabricated from nanostructured FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x </sub>heated at 300&#xb0; C. for 2 hours (after milling); and (3) a macro-FeF<sub>2 </sub>based nanocomposite. Both nanocomposites (1) and (2) fabricated from the nanostructured FeO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>2-x </sub>exhibited much improved electrochemical performance compared to the macro-FeF<sub>2 </sub>based nanocomposite (3) in that they showed higher energy density and better capacity retention upon cycling.</p>

<heading id="h-0037" level="1">Manganese and Nickel Substitution</heading>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In this embodiment, manganese and nickel were added to metal iron in the solution fabrication process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows the XRD patterns of the nanocomposites obtained when (1) 10 wt % Mn-90 wt % Fe, (2) 25 wt % Mn-75 wt % Fe and (3) 50 wt % Mn-50 wt % Fe mixtures were added to the hexafluorosilicic acid aqueous solution. The XRD for the 100 wt % Fe sample was added for comparison. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows the patterns obtained with the addition of nickel to iron in similar proportions. All samples were obtained by milling the manganese or nickel substituted FeSiF<sub>6 </sub>hydrate annealed for 4 hours in air with 15 wt % activated carbon (ASupra) for one hour in air. The nanocomposites then were submitted to a 2 hour air anneal at 300&#xb0; C. after milling. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> show that all nanocomposites maintained the tetragonal P4<sub>2</sub>/mnm structure. As shown in Table 3, the systematic shift of the diffraction peaks towards smaller angle with the amount of added manganese is associated with an increase of tetragonal unit cell volume upon substitution of the larger Mn<sup>2+</sup> for Fe<sup>2+</sup> in the rutile-type structure. In the case of the addition of nickel, the structure volume change is less significant. In the nickel case a phase separation seems to occur forming a nanocomposite of iron oxyfluorides and nickel fluorides.</p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Without being limited by theory, in these examples, although a lithium phosphate based compound is utilized as a precursor, it is likely that after fabrication, various amounts of lithium phosphate, lithium iron phosphate, iron phosphate, iron fluorophosphates and lithium iron fluorophosphate may form through a chemical reaction between the iron fluoride/oxyfluoride and lithium phosphate compound. Further, similar improvement in electrochemical performance was observed with the use of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>and NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>precursors suggesting that the presence of iron fluorophosphates or iron phosphate formed as a result of the chemical reaction with iron fluoride/oxyfluoride lead to the improved cycling stability observed.</p>
