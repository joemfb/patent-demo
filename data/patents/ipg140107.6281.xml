<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings identify the same or similar elements.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An implementation described herein may relate to a video provisioning system (VPS). The VPS may enable a customer to purchase and consume a video asset using different types of user devices, including a set top box, a computer device, and/or a wireless mobile device. Furthermore, the VPS may enable the customer to consume (e.g., view) the purchased video asset using any number of different devices registered with the VPS. For example, the customer may view the video asset on a non-set top box device, such as a personal computer or a wireless mobile device, using a dedicated client application or using a browser application. A customer may use a browsing application (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) when a dedicated client application has not been installed on the customer's device or when a dedicated client application may not be available for the customer's particular device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An implementation described herein may relate to managing playback of a video asset, provided by the VPS, using a web browser application, where the video asset is encrypted using a first digital rights management (DRM) scheme and where a media player of the web browser application uses a second DRM scheme to authorize playback of the video asset. A license, associated with the second DRM scheme, may be generated based on DRM information associated with the first DRM scheme. The DRM information, associated with the first DRM scheme, may be stored in metadata associated with the video asset when the video asset is ingested by the VPS and stored in a catalog of video assets. The license, associated with the second DRM scheme, may be obtained by a user device from a license server using, for example, token based authentication. The license, associated with the second DRM scheme, may be used by a media player of a web browser application to decrypt the video asset. Thus, a video asset encrypted using the first DRM scheme may not need to be re-encrypted using a second DRM scheme in order to play the video asset with a media player that uses the second DRM scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one example, the video asset may be encrypted using Microsoft Windows Media&#xae; DRM (WMDRM) and a browser application may play video assets, purchased via the VPS, using a Microsoft Silverlight&#xae; media player that associated with a PlayReady&#xae; DRM scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An implementation described herein may further relate to managing a bookmark, associated with a video asset, during playback of the video asset using a browser application. A bookmark, associated with a video asset, may define a first location of the video asset at which the customer stopped playing the video asset. For example, the bookmark may identify that the customer stopped playing the video asset at 30 minutes from the beginning of the video asset. The bookmark may be stored in a video asset library associated the customer's VPS profile. If the customer uses a browser application to play the video asset, the VPS may convert a first bookmark to a first range header value and if the customer stops playing the video asset, the VPS may convert a second range header value to a second bookmark and store the second bookmark in the customer's VPS profile. A range header value may be a value included in a range header field of a header of a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) packet, where the range header value indicates an offset from a beginning of a resource associated with the HTTP packet. In one example, the range header value may be specified in terms of number of bytes.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term video asset, as used herein, may include VOD content, pay-per-view (PPV) video content, rented video content, free television content (e.g., from free television broadcasters, etc.), paid for television content (e.g., from pay television content providers), on-line video content (e.g., on-line television programs, movies, videos, etc.), advertising, games, music videos, promotional information (e.g., such as previews, trailers, etc.), etc. A video asset may be stored in one or more video files that contain video information that can be played on a user device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of an example environment in which the systems and/or methods, described herein, may be implemented. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, environment <b>100</b> may include a group of user devices <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . , <b>110</b>-J (where J&#x2267;1) (referred to herein collectively as &#x201c;user devices <b>110</b>&#x201d; and individually as &#x201c;user device <b>110</b>&#x201d;), a VPS <b>120</b>, a group of content providers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . , <b>130</b>-K (where K&#x2267;1) (referred to herein collectively as &#x201c;content providers <b>130</b>&#x201d; and individually as &#x201c;content provider <b>130</b>&#x201d;), a service provider network <b>140</b>, and a network <b>150</b>. Devices, systems, and/or networks of environment <b>100</b> may interconnect via wired connections, wireless connections, or a combination of wired and wireless connections.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">User device <b>110</b> may include a computation or communication device that is capable of communicating with service provider network <b>140</b>. For example, user device <b>110</b> may include a radiotelephone, a personal communications system (PCS) terminal (e.g., that may combine a cellular radiotelephone with data processing and data communications capabilities), a personal digital assistant (PDA) (e.g., that can include a radiotelephone, a pager, Internet/intranet access, etc.), a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a set top box, a digital video recorder (DVR), a personal gaming system, a smart phone, and/or another type of computation or communication device.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Stream manager <b>410</b> may authorize a particular stream of a video asset for a user. A user may be authorized to stream a particular number of video assets at a time in connection with the user's registered devices. For example, a user may be authorized for one stream for all user devices other than a set top box. Thus, if no user devices, other than a set top box, registered with the user's VPS account, are currently receiving a stream of a video asset, stream manager <b>410</b> may authorize a stream in response to receiving a request to stream a video asset.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">DRM manager <b>420</b> may implement token based authentication for providing a DRM license to user device <b>110</b>. For example, DRM manager <b>420</b> may provide a DRM token to a media player, of user device <b>110</b>, and the media player may use the DRM token to obtain a DRM license from license server <b>260</b>. Furthermore, DRM manager <b>420</b> may authorize license server <b>260</b> to issue a DRM license if the DRM license was requested with a valid DRM token.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Catalog server interface <b>430</b> may interact with catalog server <b>235</b>.

As another example, catalog server interface <b>430</b> may receive video asset information from catalog server <b>235</b> and may format the information into a format compatible with application server <b>210</b>. For example, catalog unit <b>430</b> may format the information into frames for a store front web page.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">License server interface <b>440</b> may interface license server <b>260</b> with DRM manager <b>420</b>. For example, license server interface <b>440</b> may receive a request from license server <b>260</b> to issue a DRM license for a video asset, may transform the request into a format compatible with DRM manager <b>420</b>, and may forward the request to DRM manager <b>420</b>. Moreover, license server interface <b>440</b> may receive an authorization to issue a DRM license from DRM manager <b>420</b>, may convert the authorization into a format compatible with license server <b>260</b>, and may forward the authorization to license server <b>260</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may include receiving a request to stream a video asset encrypted using a first DRM scheme (block <b>610</b>). For example, a user may purchase a video asset and information about the video asset may be stored in the user's library in the user's profile stored in profile server <b>245</b>. The user may access the library of purchased video assets and may request to consume a purchased video asset. For example, the user may navigate to a web page that displays the user's library of purchased video assets using browser application <b>500</b> and may click a &#x201c;watch now&#x201d; button associated with a video asset that the user has purchased.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A determination may be made as to whether a stream is authorized (block <b>620</b>). For example, stream manager <b>410</b> may determine whether to authorize streaming of the video asset by determining how many streams are currently associated with devices registered with the user and determining whether the number of stream is less than a maximum allowed number of streams. In one example, information about the number of current streams associated with the user's profile may be stored by stream manager <b>410</b> in a memory associated with application server <b>210</b>. In another example, the information about the number of current streams associated with the user's profile may be stored in the user's profile in a memory associated with profile server <b>245</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If it is determined that the stream is not authorized (block <b>620</b>-NO), the user may be informed that the stream is not authorized (block <b>630</b>). For example, stream manager <b>410</b> may send a message to user device <b>110</b>, informing the user that the maximum number of available streams has been reached and that an additional stream is not authorized. In one example, if the user profile is associated with a maximum number of available streams, stream manager <b>410</b> may inform the user that the streaming of the video asset is not available. In another example, if the user profile is associated with a maximum number of available streams, stream manager <b>410</b> may terminate another stream (e.g., an oldest stream) associated with the user's profile before authorizing streaming of the requested video asset.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">If it is determined that the stream is authorized (block <b>620</b>-YES), a download URL for the video asset may be provided (block <b>640</b>). For example, application server <b>210</b> may retrieve a URL associated with the requested video asset from a record associated with the video asset and stored in catalog server <b>235</b>. Application server <b>210</b> may provide the retrieved URL to browser application <b>500</b> of user device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A request may be received for a DRM token (block <b>650</b>) and a DRM token may be returned (block <b>660</b>). For example, user device <b>110</b> may determine that the retrieved URL is associated with a DRM file that may need to be decrypted and may, in response, request a DRM token from application server <b>210</b>. The request may include authentication credentials associated with the user. For example, the request may include a username and password associated with the user. Application server <b>210</b> may authenticate the user based on the received authentication credentials and, if the user is successfully authenticated, may generate a DRM token valid for a particular length of time (e.g., 60 seconds) and provide the generated DRM token to user device <b>110</b>. The DRM token may enable user device <b>110</b> to request a DRM license for the requested video asset.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A request may be received to issue a DRM license for the video asset from a license server (block <b>670</b>). For example, application server <b>210</b> may receive a request from license server <b>260</b> for an authorization to issue a DMR license, associated with a second DRM scheme, for the video asset encrypted using a first DRM scheme. For example, license server <b>260</b> may request authorization to issue a PlayReady license or another similar type of license.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A determination may be made as to whether the license authorization request is associated with a valid DRM token (block <b>680</b>).

Furthermore, DRM manager <b>410</b> may make sure that the DRM token has not expired. For example, DRM manager <b>410</b> may compare a time stamp included in the license authorization request with a time stamp associated with the issued DRM token to determine whether the DRM token is still valid or whether the DRM token has expired.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may include requesting to stream a video asset (block <b>710</b>) and an indication may be received that a stream is available (block <b>715</b>). For example, browser application <b>500</b> may send a request to stream a video asset to application server <b>210</b> in response to a user selecting a selection object associated with playback of a purchased video asset. For example, the user may navigate to a web page that displays the user's library of purchased video assets using browser application <b>500</b> and may click a &#x201c;watch now&#x201d; button associated with a video asset that the user has purchased.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A video asset URL may be requested (block <b>720</b>) and the video asset URL may be received (block <b>725</b>). For example, in response to receiving an indication that the stream is authorized, browser application <b>500</b> may request a URL associated with the video asset from application server <b>210</b> and may receive the requested URL.

For example, browser application <b>500</b> may receive an indication from CDN server <b>230</b> that the URL is associated with a DRM resource.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A DRM token may be requested (block <b>740</b>) and the DRM token may be received (block <b>745</b>). For example, DRM component <b>510</b> of media player <b>505</b> may request a DRM token from application server <b>210</b> by sending a request for a DRM token. The request may include information identifying a particular video asset (e.g., a video asset identifier, a vide asset name, a URL associated with the video asset, etc.) and information identifying a user requesting the DRM token (e.g., username and password). In one example, the username and password may be retrieved by media player <b>505</b> from a stored location (e.g., the user may have selected to save the username and password in a cache associated with browser application <b>550</b> during a previous authentication process). In another example, media player <b>505</b> may prompt the user to enter the username and password prior to sending the request for the DRM token. Media player <b>505</b> may request a DRM token from application server <b>210</b> in response to sending the request. The DRM token may be valid for a particular length of time (e.g., for 60 seconds from the time the DRM token was issued by application server <b>210</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The DRM token may be used to request a license from a license server (block <b>750</b>). For example, DRM component <b>510</b> of media player <b>505</b> may send a request to license server <b>260</b> to request a DRM license for the requested video asset. The request for the DRM license may include the received DRM token. License server <b>260</b> may use the DRM token to request authorization from application server <b>210</b> to issue a DRM license for the video asset.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A DRM license may be received for the video asset (block <b>755</b>) and the DRM license may be used to play the video asset in a web browser (block <b>760</b>). For example, DRM component <b>510</b> may receive a DRM license from license server <b>260</b> and may use the DRM license to decrypt the video asset file as the video asset file is received from CDN server <b>230</b>. For example, media player <b>505</b> may correspond to a Microsoft Silverlight player and the DRM license may correspond to a PlayReady license. The PlayReady license may be used by the Silverlight player to decrypt a movie that was encrypted using WMDRM, as the PlayReady license may have been generated by license server <b>260</b> based on a WMDRM key associated with the video asset.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Media player <b>505</b> may playback the video asset using a progressive download method. For example, media player <b>505</b> may download a portion of the video asset file, may decrypt the portion, and may initiate playback of the decrypted portion while a next portion of the video asset file is being downloaded. Thus, obtaining the DRM license and using a progressive download method may not require the use of streaming servers.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may include receiving a request, from a user, to stream a video asset (block <b>810</b>). For example, application server <b>210</b> may receive a request to stream a video asset that has been purchased by the user. A first bookmark, associated with the video asset, may be retrieved from the user's profile (block <b>820</b>). Application server <b>210</b> may determine whether a bookmark is associated with the video asset. For example, a user may have previously started to view the video asset and may have stopped viewing of the video asset at a particular location. Application server <b>210</b> may request bookmark information from profile server <b>245</b>. Profile server <b>245</b> may access a record, associated with the video asset, in a library of purchased video assets associated with the user and may determine whether a bookmark is stored in association with the video asset.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The first bookmark may be converted to a first range header value (block <b>830</b>). For example, application server <b>210</b> may convert the bookmark into a range header value based on the size of the file associated with the video asset. For example, assume the video asset file corresponds to a size of 2048 MB and the video asset is 90 minutes long. If the bookmark indicates that the user stopped playing the video asset at a location 30 minutes into the video asset, application server <b>210</b> may determine a ratio of the video asset length to the length indicated by the bookmark, and generate a range header value based on the ratio. Thus, application server <b>210</b> may convert the bookmark information to a range header value of 683/2048. The first range header value may be provided to a video asset player of a browser associated with the user (block <b>840</b>). For example, application server <b>210</b> may provide the first range header value to media player <b>505</b> of user device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A second range header value may be received from the video asset player of the browser associated with the user (block <b>850</b>). For example, the user may pause or stop playing the video asset at a later time and media player <b>505</b> may report a range header value associated with the location at which the playback of the video asset was stopped or paused. For example, if the video asset file corresponds to a size of 2048 MB, and the user stopped playing the video asset at a halfway point, application server <b>210</b> may receive a range header value of 1024/2048.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The second range header value may be converted to a second bookmark (block <b>860</b>) and the second bookmark may be stored in the user's profile (block <b>870</b>).

For example, if the video asset is 90 minutes long, and the second range header value corresponds to 1024/2048, the second range header value may be converted to a bookmark that indicates that playback stopped at a location of 45 minutes from the beginning of the video asset.</p>

Stream manager <b>410</b> of application server <b>210</b> may determine whether a stream is available and may indicate to user device <b>110</b> that a stream is available (signal <b>1025</b>). For example, a user may be authorized to have one active stream on a device other than a set top box. Thus, if the user does not have an active stream on any registered devices other than a set top box, application server <b>210</b> may indicate that a stream is available.</p>
