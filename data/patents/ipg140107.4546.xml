<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for updating system information in a terminal in which data is transmitted by means of superframes, includes: receiving system information, scheduling periodicity information of the system information and changing information indicating changing status of the system information transmitted by means of a superframe header (SFH) from a base station; and updating the system information based on the changing information, wherein the SFH comprises a primary SFH including the changing information and a secondary SFH including at least one subpacket containing the system information, the scheduling periodicity information indicating a transmission periodicity of the subpacket is transmitted by means of the primary SFH or a predetermined subpacket, and when the terminal detects that a changed system information transmitted by means of the subpacket is not scheduled as indicated in the scheduling periodicity information, the terminal wakes up until the changed system information is received.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For communication between a base station and a terminal in a broadband wireless communication system, system information requisite for communication must be transmitted from the base station to the terminal. The base station may transfer essential system information requisite for its communication with the terminal via a superframe header (SFH) and transfer additional system information via a broadcast message.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among the system information, the essential system information transferred via the SFH must be periodically updated for continuous communication between the base station and the terminal, and the terminal must periodically check whether or not the essential system information transferred from the base station has been changed, and perform decoding and updating on the system information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, with the system information not changed, if the terminal always decodes and updates the system information transferred via the SFH or the like, power of the terminal is unnecessarily consumed. In particular, if the terminal in a sleep mode or in an idle mode decodes and updates the system information transferred via the SFH, it would be ineffective in terms of power consumption of the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a more effective system information updating method is required to prevent power consumption of the terminal.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Embodiments of the present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, where those components are rendered the same reference number that are the same or are in correspondence, regardless of the figure number, and redundant explanations are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a basic frame structure.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the frame structure applied to the system of the present invention may include a frame of 5 ms as a basic element, and the frame, a basic single transmission unit, may be defined as an interval between preambles. The frame includes at least one subframe, and may include a plurality of transmission time intervals (TTI) each having a different size. The TTI is a basic unit of scheduling performed at a medium access control (MAC) layer. The TTI may be a radio resource allocation unit.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A superframe is configured with a plurality of frames. The superframe may be configured in the unit of, for example, 20 ms. When a superframe is configured, system configuration information and broadcast information for an initial fast cell selection and low latency service are set as a transmission unit, and in general, two to six frames form a single superframe. In addition, each frame in the unit of 5 ms includes a plurality of subframes, and each subframe includes a plurality of OFDM/OFDMA symbols. Each superframe includes a single superframe header (SFH) including a broadcast channel, and the SFH is positioned at a first subframe of the corresponding superframe. A substantial frame structure may be designed depending on the bandwidth of a system channel, a duplexing method, a cyclic prefix (CP) length, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a frame structure for a frequency division duplex (FDD) mode.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the FDD mode, downlink and uplink transmissions are discriminated on a frequency domain, and every subframe of each frame is available for downlink and uplink transmission. A terminal in the FDD mode may access an uplink subframe and, at the same time, receive a data burst via any of downlink subframe.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a superframe of 20 ms includes four frames (F<b>0</b>, F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b>, F<b>3</b>) with a length of 5 ms, and one frame F<b>2</b> includes eight subframes (SF<b>0</b>, SF<b>1</b>, SF<b>2</b>, SF<b>3</b>, SF<b>4</b>, SF<b>5</b>, SF<b>6</b>, SF<b>7</b>) with a length of 0.617 ms and an idle time interval of 62.86 &#x3bc;s. Each subframe may include seven OFDM symbols (S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, S<b>4</b>, S<b>5</b>, S<b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a frame structure for a time division duplex (TDD) mode.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a TDD mode, downlink and uplink transmissions are discriminated on a time domain, and an uplink transmission time interval is allocated following a downlink transmission time interval, so that data is transmitted and received via downlink and uplink.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one superframe of 20 ms includes four frames (F<b>0</b>, F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b>, F<b>3</b>) of 5 ms, and one frame F<b>2</b> includes eight subframes (SF<b>0</b>, SF<b>1</b>, SF<b>2</b>, SF<b>3</b>, SF<b>4</b>, SF<b>5</b>, SF<b>6</b>, SF<b>7</b>) with a length of 0.617 ms and an idle time interval of 62.86 &#x3bc;s. The frame F<b>2</b> includes D number of downlink frames and U number of uplink frames determined according to a ratio (D:U) of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL). When the ratio of DL and UL is 5:3, five subframes (SF<b>0</b>, SF<b>1</b>, SF<b>2</b>, SF<b>3</b>, SF<b>4</b>) are configured as downlink frames and three subframes (SF<b>5</b>, SF<b>6</b>, SF<b>7</b>) are configured as uplink frames. One idle symbol for discriminating DL and UL is inserted between the final downlink subframe SF<b>4</b> and the first uplink subframe SF<b>5</b> to indicate switching from the DL to UL. The gap inserted between the downlink and the uplink is called a transmit transition gap (TTG), and a gap inserted between uplink and downlink is called a receive transition gap (RTG), by which a transmission end and a reception end can discriminate a downlink transmission and an uplink transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Also, the final downlink subframe SF<b>4</b> includes five OFDM symbols and a final one idle symbol S<b>5</b>. The idle symbol S<b>5</b> serves as a TTG discriminating downlink (DL) and uplink (UL).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A superframe header (SFH) will now be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In a broadband wireless access system, an SFH transfers system information essential for communication between terminals and a base station to the terminals. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the SFH is positioned at the first subframe within a single superframe. The SFH may includes a primary SFH (P-SFH) delivering control information for receiving the SFH and a secondary-SFH (S-SFH) delivering essential system information such as network entry.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The S-SFH may include a plurality of subpackets (SP) according to a transmission frequency of system information, and preferably, the S-SFH includes three SPs (SP<b>1</b>, SP<b>2</b>, and SP<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The P-SFH is transmitted during every superframe, and an information element (IE) of the P-SFH includes information related to 4-bit-LSB information of a superframe number (SFN) and the S-SFH. The information element of the P-SFH mean a set of information related to the superframe number and the S-SFH. The information related to the S-SFH includes an S-SFH change count indicating the version of a currently transmitted S-SFH, an S-SFH scheduling information bitmap indicating what kind of S-SFH SP(s) are transmitted in a corresponding superframe, an S-SFH size indicating the number of LRUs allocated for an S-SFH transmission, an S-SFH number of repetitions indicating a transmission format of an S-SFH, an S-SFH SP change bitmap indicating what kind of S-SFH SP has been changed, and the like. The size of the S-SFH scheduling information bitmap and the S-SFH SP change bitmap fields is equal to the total number of SPs of the S-SFH.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The S-SFH delivers actual system information (which is called an information element of the S-SFH), and as described above, the delivered system information may be included in three subpackets according to their characteristics, each of which is called an S-SFH SPn (n=1, 2, 3). Each S-SFH SP information element (IE) has a different transmission period. When a transmission period of the SP<b>1</b> is T<sub>SP1</sub>, that of the SP <b>2</b> is T<sub>SP2</sub>, and that of the SP<b>3</b> is T<sub>SP3</sub>, the transmission periods of the subpackets may be represented by, for example, T<sub>SP1</sub>&#x3c;T<sub>SP2</sub>&#x3c;T<sub>SP3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">For continued communication with the base station, the terminals must update system information transferred via the S-SFH SPs. In this case, however, if decoding and updating an S-SFH IE although system information has not been changed will be ineffective in terms of power consumption of the terminals. Thus, the present invention proposes a method for effectively updating system information transferred via an S-SFH.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The terminal must detect an information error in a P-SFH received from the base station before updating system information delivered from the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a flow chart illustrating the process of detecting an information error in a P-SFH received by a terminal from a base station according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The P-SFH may include a 4-bit-LSB superframe number (SFN), an S-SFH change count (referred to as a &#x2018;CC&#x2019;, hereinafter), an S-SFH scheduling information bitmap, an S-SFH size, an S-SFH number of repetitions, an S-SFH SP change bitmap (referred to as a &#x2018;CB&#x2019;, hereinafter), as well as a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). In general, in order to check whether there is an error in the P-SFH transmitted via air interface, the terminal calculates a CRC value based on the received data. The terminal determines whether or not there is an error in information within the P-SFH according to the calculated CRC value.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Comparatively, however, the present invention proposes a process of additionally determining whether or not an error has occurred by using the 4-bit-LSB superframe number field within the P-SFH even when it is determined that there is no error in the general P-SFH error detection procedure through the CRC.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">First, the terminal decodes the received P-SFH (S<b>401</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The terminal primarily determines whether or not there is an error in the information within the P-SFH by decoding a CRC value included in the P-SFH (S<b>403</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the terminal determines that there is an error at the corresponding superframe according to the error generation determination result through the CRC checking, the superframe is processed as an error (S<b>417</b>), and if the terminal determines that there is no error at the corresponding superframe, the terminal successfully receives essential system information through an initial network registration (entry) process (DL synchronization), and calculates a superframe number (SFN).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The terminal determines whether or not the corresponding P-SFH has been properly transmitted without an error by checking the superframe number (SFN) within the P-SFH transmitted from the base station by comparing the calculated SFN (S<b>405</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If the terminal determines that there is an error at the information within the P-SFH, it may process the corresponding superframe as having an error and does not take any further operation (S<b>417</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the SFN within the P-SFH transmitted from the base station and the SFN calculated by the terminal are determined to be the same, the terminal determines that the corresponding superframe does not have an error (S<b>407</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">When the S-SFH is transmitted during the corresponding superframe, the terminal is able to calculate a CRC with respect to the S-SFH, and if the terminal determines that there is no error in the information within the S-SFH, it may take a normal action on the corresponding superframe.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The procedure of updating essential system information by the terminal using the S-SFH change count and the S-SFH SP change bitmap delivered via the P-SFH will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a method of changing a change count (CC) of an S-SFH and S-SFH subpacket (SP) change bitmap (CB) information transferred via a P-SCH when system information is changed according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the CC of the S-SFH delivered via the P-SFH can be changed whenever any of the values of the S-SFH subpacket (SP) IEs is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The CC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a change count indicating whether or not the essential system information delivered via the S-SFH has been changed or not, and SI is a scheduling information bitmap indicating a transmitted S-SFH SP in the corresponding superframe. Also, the CB of the S-SFH indicates a changing status of the S-SFH SP IEs in the corresponding superframe. Each bit of the CB indicates the changing status of the corresponding S-SFH SP IE. The bit #<b>0</b>, bit #<b>1</b> and bit #<b>2</b> are mapped to S-SFH SP<b>1</b> IE, S-SFH SP<b>2</b> IE and S-SFH SP<b>3</b> IE, respectively. If any of the value of an S-SFH SP IE is changed, the corresponding bit may be toggled or set to 1.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As illustrated, the CC, SI and CB information may be delivered via the P-SFH in the superframe. On the assumption that, the last stored CC value of a terminal is 25 and S-SFH SP<b>1</b> and SP<b>2</b> with unchanged system information are scheduled and transmitted by means of the superframe <b>1</b>, the last received CC of the P-SFH of the superframe <b>1</b> is the same as the last stored CC. The SI bitmap transmitted by means of the superframe <b>1</b> is set to be &#x2018;110&#x2019; to indicate the SPs of the scheduled S-SFH are SP<b>1</b> and SP<b>2</b>. The CB is &#x2018;000&#x2019; to indicate that the SP IEs remain unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as any system information transmitted via the S-SFH SPs is changed, the S-SFH CC increases in a superframe in which the changed S-SFH SP IE is first transmitted. Namely, the CC is increased from 25 to 27 in a superframe <b>2</b> at which the changed SP<b>1</b> and SP<b>2</b> are first transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In this case, because the counter is incremented according to the number of changed SPs and the information elements of two SPs are changed, the CC is 27 by incremented two counts.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Accordingly, in the P-SFH of the superframe <b>2</b>, the CC is changed to 27, the SI bitmap is set to be &#x2018;110&#x2019; to indicate the SPs of the scheduled S-SFH are SP<b>1</b> and SP<b>2</b>, and the CB is &#x2018;110&#x2019; to indicate the changed SP IEs are SP<b>1</b> and SP<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Also, system information has not been changed in a superframe <b>3</b> and only SP<b>1</b> is scheduled, so the CC at the P-SFH of the superframe <b>3</b> is maintained as 27, the SI bitmap is set to be &#x2018;100&#x2019; in order to indicate the SP of the scheduled S-SFH is SP<b>1</b>, and the CB is maintained to be &#x2018;110&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">According to another embodiment of the present invention, the CC may be increased by the number of a superframe (i.e., in the unit of superframe). Also, regardless of a transmission time point of the S-SFH SP IE, the CC may be increased in the superframe when the base station recognizes the necessity of changing for CC.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Hereinafter, a method of updating system information by the terminal upon receiving the change information will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> sequentially shows a process of updating system information according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The base station transmits a P-SFH IE including the S-SFH scheduling information bitmap (SI), the S-SFH change count (CC), and the S-SFH subpacket (SP) change bitmap (S-SFH SP CB) to the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Upon receiving the P-SFH IE from the base station, the terminal decodes the received P-SFH IE (S<b>601</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The terminal decodes the S-SFH change count (CC) and the S-SFH SP change bitmap (CB) information included in the P-SFH IE and determines whether to decode the S-SFH IE.</p>

And after performing decoding on every S-SFH IE, the terminal stores the changed S-SFH CC and the S-SFH SP CB (S<b>617</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Upon comparison of the CC, if the difference between the two values is 1 (CC difference=1), the terminal compares S-SFH CB which has been previously received and stored and the newly received S-SFH CB (S<b>609</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">According to the changed bitmap comparison result, the terminal determines that the S-SFH SP IE corresponding to the toggled bit position is the changed S-SFH SP IE and decodes and updates the corresponding SP IE (S<b>611</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Thereafter, the terminal stores the changed S-SFH CC and the S-SFH SP CB (S<b>617</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the difference between the stored S-SFH change count and the S-SFH change count of the currently received P-SFH is 2, if the same S-SFH SP is continuously changed (the value of the same bit position as the S-SFH SP change bitmap is toggled: 0&#x2192;1&#x2192;0), the terminal is able to know whether or not the S-SFH has been changed but cannot know which S-SFH SP has been changed. Thus, in the case where the terminal cannot know which S-SFH SP has been changed, it receives every S-SFH SP and checks whether the difference value of the S-SFH change count is 1 or 2 or larger, and determines it.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Like the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the base station transmits the P-SFH IE including the S-SFH scheduling information bitmap (SI), the S-SFH change count (CC) and the S-SFH subpacket (SP) change bitmap (S-SFH SP CB) to the terminal.

When the number of toggled bits is the same as the difference of the CC values, the terminal determines that the S-SFH SP IE corresponding to the toggled bit position is a changed S-SFH SP IE and decodes and updates the corresponding SP IE (S<b>711</b>). For example, if the difference value of S-SFH change count is 2, the stored CB is &#x2018;000&#x2019;, and the received CB is &#x2018;011&#x2019;, because the two bits among the bits of the S-SFH SP change bitmap have been toggled, the terminal determines that the number of toggled bits is the same as the difference of the CC values. Thereafter, the terminal decodes and updates the corresponding SP IEs (SP<b>2</b> and SP<b>3</b>). And the terminal stores the changed S-SFH CC and the S-SFH SP CB (S<b>719</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">If the number of toggled bits is not the same as the difference of the CC values, the terminal decodes and updates all S-SFH SP IEs.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the terminal may update the system information by using the scheduling periodicity information of each S-SFH SP along with the values of the CC and the CB.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The scheduling periodicity information of the S-SFH SP may be transferred to the terminal (<b>1</b>) through a P-SFH, (2) through a particular S-SFH SP in which scheduling periodicity information of different S-SFH SPs is transferred (namely, it includes period information of itself), (3) through a MAC management message (e.g., RNG-REQ/RSP, SBC-REQ/RSP, REG-REQ/RSP) transferred in a network entry procedure, or (4) by defining a fixed period in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The terminal can recognize a transmission period of each S-SFH SP explicitly through one of the foregoing four methods. Also the terminal can recognize the transmission period of each S-SFH SP implicitly upon receiving each S-SFH SP at least two times or more. The terminal determines that the information is valid until when the recognized transmission period information of each S-SFH SP is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a process of updating an S-SFH by a terminal in a sleep/idle mode according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">As illustrated, because the terminal is in an unavailable interval during the superframe <b>1</b> in which the changed S-SFH SP is transmitted, it cannot receive the changed S-SFH SP (<b>901</b>) at the superframe <b>1</b>. During the superframe <b>2</b>, the terminal is in a listening interval. And the terminal enters the unavailable interval at the superframe <b>3</b> and the superframe <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Thus, when the terminal in the sleep or idle state fails to receive all the changed S-SFH SP(s) during the listening interval, the corresponding terminal should wake up at a superframe next time when the corresponding S-SFH SP(s) are transmitted during the unavailable interval (power saving/sleep interval) by using the transmission period information of the changed S-SFH SP(s). Preferably, the terminal should wake up at a first superframe next time when the corresponding S-SFH SP(s) are transmitted. Namely, the terminal does not need to wake up at a superframe during which only the S-SFH SP(s) which do not need to be updated are transmitted by using the transmission period information of the changed S-SFH SP(s). After updating the S-SFH SP(s), the terminal may perform a different operation such as turning off power of one or more physical devices or not requiring communication with the base station during the remaining unavailable interval.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">If it is assumed that the value of CC and CB in the stored are 25 and &#x2018;000&#x2019; and the unavailable interval and the listening interval are determined as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the terminal can wake up at the superframe <b>2</b> to decode the P-SFH and recognize that the S-SFH SP <b>1</b> has been changed through the CC and CB in the corresponding superframe <b>2</b>. However, the changed S-SFH SP<b>1</b> is not transmitted during the superframe <b>2</b>, the corresponding listening interval. Thus, if the fact that the changed S-SFH SP<b>1</b> is transmitted during the superframe <b>4</b> according to the transmission period information of the S-SFH SP<b>1</b> is recognized, although the superframe <b>4</b> is included in the unavailable interval, the terminal wakes up at the corresponding superframe <b>4</b> and decodes and updates the corresponding S-SFH SP<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">If corresponding S-SFH SP(s) have not been received during the superframe, during which the corresponding S-SFH SP(s) were predicted to be transmitted within the unavailable interval by using the transmission period information of the changed S-SFH SP(s), then the terminal should maintain in an awake state until when it receives all the corresponding S-SFH SP(s), so the terminal should not be changed to a power saving state. If the terminal first receives the transmission period information of the S-SFH SPs before receiving the changed S-SFH SP(s), the terminal may use the corresponding transmission period in order to update the changed S-SFH SP(s).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Hereinafter, a method of transmitting the scheduling periodicity information which the terminal may detect each of transmitted S-SFH SPs effectively and updating system information using thereof will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">If the information regarding the transmission of S-SFH SPs informed to a terminal is only a transmission periodicity of each S-SFH SPs, the terminal should detect the transmission of each S-SFH SPs frequently to find the transmission of the S-SFH SPs. Also, the terminal should detect the transmission time of each S-SFH SPs at least one more times even though the system information transmitted through the S-SFH SPs are not changed, when the scheduling periodicity of each S-SFH SPs are changed. For the detection of the transmission time of each S-SFH SPs, the terminal should perform a scanning operation every superframe time, and those frequent scanning operation is ineffective to the terminal in sleep/idle state for power saving.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Present invention provides a method that a base station informs not only scheduling periodicity information but also transmission offset information of each S-SFH SPs to a terminal for effective detection of a transmission time of each S-SFH SPs. The scheduling information indicates a transmission interval of the S-SFH SP, and the offset information indicates the transmitted superframe of the S-SFH SP by the distance from the superframe transmitting the scheduling information. Each of the S-SFH SPs has its scheduling information and offset information which is configured by a table format. Below table 1 shows the scheduling periodicity information of each S-SFH SPs.</p>

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Transmission offset information may be configured as a simplified information, not the precise information according to another embodiment of the present invention.

The offset of S-SFH SP<b>1</b> is 0 to indicate that the first transmission time of the S-SFH SP<b>1</b> is in the first period roughly and the offset of S-SFH SP<b>2</b> is 1 to indicate that the first transmission time of the S-SFH SP<b>2</b> is in the second period roughly.

<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The terminal performing the operation of updating system information includes a transmitter <b>10</b>, a receiver <b>20</b>, a decoder <b>30</b>, a controller <b>40</b>, and a memory <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The receiver <b>20</b> receives data, system information and changing information indicating changing status of the system information transmitted by means of a superframe including a P-SFH and at least one of S-SFH SP from the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The changing information includes the change count (CC) and change bitmap (CB). As described above, the CC and CB may be transmitted at every superframe through the P-SFH from the base station and the terminal stores the CC and CB its memory <b>50</b>. Moreover, scheduling periodicity information indicating transmission periodicity of the subpacket may be transmitted by means of a predetermined subpacket or the P-SFH.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The decoder <b>30</b> decodes a P-SFH information element (IE) including a scheduling information bitmap, a change count, and a subpacket (SP) change bitmap of the S-SFH in the received superframe.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The controller <b>40</b> detects that changed system information transmitted by means of the subpacket is not scheduled as indicated in the scheduling periodicity information, the controller <b>40</b> controls a system operation mode as wake-up mode until the changed system information is received. Before receiving the S-SFH SP, if the terminal receives the scheduling periodicity information through the P-SFH or a specific S-SFH SP, it can use this information to update the changed system information transmitted through S-SFH SPs.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The controller <b>40</b> controls the operation of decoding and updating the information elements of S-SFH SP by comparing the change count and the change bitmap stored in the memory <b>50</b> and the received change count and the change bitmap. Also, the controller <b>40</b> compares the change count stored in the memory <b>50</b> and the received change count, and if there is no difference between the two values, the controller <b>40</b> does not decode the S-SFH information element, while if there is a difference between the two values, the controller <b>40</b> compares the SP change bitmap stored in the memory <b>50</b> and the received SP change bitmap.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">As described above, upon comparing the SP change bitmap stored in the memory and the received SP change bitmap, if the number of toggled bits is equal to the difference between the change count values, the controller <b>40</b> decodes S-SFH SPs corresponding to the positions of the toggled bits in the received superframe, and if the number of toggled bits is different from the difference between the change counts, the controller <b>40</b> decodes every S-SFH SP of the superframe. Or, when only the value of the bits corresponding to the changed S-SFH SP(s) is set to be 1 while the other remaining bits are set to be &#x2018;0&#x2019;, the controller <b>40</b> decodes S-SFH SPs having a bit value &#x2018;1&#x2019; in the received superframe.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">As described above, besides the above-described elements, the device according to the present invention basically includes software and hardware, for example, an output unit (display, speaker, etc.), an input unit (keypad, microphone, etc.), a memory, a transmission and reception unit (RF module, antenna, etc.), and the like, required for implementing the technical idea of the present invention. These elements are obvious to the skilled person in the art, so its detailed description will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the above-described method can be implemented by software, hardware or their combination. For example, the method according to the present invention can be stored in a storage medium (for example, an internal memory of a mobile terminal, a flash memory, a hard disk, etc.) and implemented by codes or commands in a software program that can be executed by a processor (e.g., an internal microprocessor of a mobile terminal).</p>
