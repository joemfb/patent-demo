<p id="p-0002" num="0001">A technical field of the disclosed invention relates to a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor and a manufacturing method of the semiconductor device. Note that semiconductor devices herein refer to general elements and devices which function by utilizing semiconductor characteristics.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A field-effect transistor is one of the most widely-used semiconductor elements. A variety of materials are used for field-effect transistors according to their uses. In particular, semiconductor materials including silicon are frequently used.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A field-effect transistor including silicon has characteristics satisfying the needs for a variety of uses. For example, single crystal silicon is used for an integrated circuit or the like which needs to be operated at a high speed, whereby the need is satisfied. Further, amorphous silicon is used for an object which needs to have a large area, such as a display device, whereby the need can be satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As described above, silicon is highly versatile and can be used for various purposes. However, in recent years, semiconductor materials have come to be expected to have higher performance as well as versatility. For example, in terms of improving performance of a large-area display device, in order to realize high-speed operation of a switching element, a semiconductor material which facilitates the increase in area of a display device and shows higher performance than amorphous silicon is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Under such conditions, a technique for a field-effect transistor (also called an FET) including an oxide semiconductor has attracted attention. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a transparent thin film field-effect transistor including a homologous compound InMO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>3</sub>(M is In, Fe, Ga, or Al, and m is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than 50).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, Patent Document 2 discloses a field-effect transistor in which an amorphous oxide semiconductor which contains In, Ga, and Zn and has an electron carrier density less than 10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>is used. Note that in this patent document, the ratio of In atoms to Ga atoms and Zn atoms in the amorphous oxide semiconductor is 1:1:m (m&#x3c;6).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, Patent Document 3 discloses a field-effect transistor in which an amorphous oxide semiconductor including a microcrystal is used for an active layer.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0011">Patent Document 3 discloses that a composition in a crystal state is InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is an integer less than 6). Further, Patent Document 3 discloses in Example 1 a case of InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>4</sub>. However, adequate characteristics have not been obtained in fact even when such oxide semiconductors are used.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">In view of the above-described problems, it is an object to provide a semiconductor device having a novel structure in which an oxide semiconductor layer having a novel structure is used.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">In an embodiment of the disclosed invention, a semiconductor device is formed using an oxide semiconductor layer which is purified and includes a crystalline region. The crystalline region is, for example, a region having electrical anisotropy or a region which prevents entry of an impurity.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">The following structures can be employed, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">An embodiment of the disclosed invention is a semiconductor device which includes an oxide semiconductor layer including a crystalline region over an insulating surface, a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer, a gate insulating layer covering the oxide semiconductor layer, the source electrode layer, and the drain electrode layer, and a gate electrode layer over the gate insulating layer in a region overlapping with the crystalline region. The crystalline region includes a crystal whose c-axis is aligned in a direction substantially perpendicular to a surface of the oxide semiconductor layer. Note that in this specification and the like, &#x201c;substantially perpendicular&#x201d; means being within &#xb1;10&#xb0; from a perpendicular direction.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">Another embodiment of the disclosed invention is a semiconductor device which includes a first gate electrode layer over an insulating surface, a first gate insulating layer covering the first gate electrode layer, an oxide semiconductor layer including a crystalline region over the first gate insulating layer, a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer, a second gate insulating layer covering the oxide semiconductor layer, the source electrode layer, and the drain electrode layer, and a second gate electrode layer over the second gate insulating layer in a region overlapping with the crystalline region. The crystalline region includes a crystal whose c-axis is aligned in a direction substantially perpendicular to a surface of the oxide semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">In addition, an insulating layer having a substantially same shape as the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer may be provided over the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer. Note that in this specification and the like, the expression &#x201c;substantially the same&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially same&#x201d; does not necessarily mean being exactly the same in a strict sense and can mean being considered as the same. For example, a difference made by a single etching process is acceptable. Further, the thickness does not need to be the same.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">In addition, a portion of the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer may include a material having low oxygen affinity.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">A region other than the crystalline region in the oxide semiconductor layer (e.g., a region other than a channel formation region) may have an amorphous structure.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">The difference in height of the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer may be 1 nm or less in the region overlapping with the gate electrode layer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">Another embodiment of the disclosed invention is a manufacturing method of a semiconductor device, which includes the steps of: forming an oxide semiconductor layer over an insulating surface; forming a conductive layer over the oxide semiconductor layer; forming a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer by etching the conductive layer; forming a crystalline region having c-axis aligned in a direction substantially perpendicular to a surface of the oxide semiconductor layer, by performing heat treatment; forming a gate insulating layer so as to cover the oxide semiconductor layer, the source electrode layer, and the drain electrode layer; and forming a gate electrode layer over the gate insulating layer in a region overlapping with the crystalline region.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">Another embodiment of the disclosed invention is a manufacturing method of a semiconductor device, which includes the steps of: forming a first gate electrode layer over an insulating surface; forming a first gate insulating layer so as to cover the first gate electrode layer; forming an oxide semiconductor layer over the first gate insulating layer; forming a conductive layer over the oxide semiconductor layer; forming a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer by etching the conductive layer; forming a crystalline region having c-axis aligned in a direction substantially perpendicular to a surface of the oxide semiconductor layer, by performing heat treatment; forming a second gate insulating layer so as to cover the oxide semiconductor layer, the source electrode layer, and the drain electrode layer; and forming a second gate electrode layer over the second gate insulating layer in a region overlapping with the crystalline region.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">In the above embodiment, the heat treatment may be performed at a temperature higher than or equal to 550&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 850&#xb0; C., preferably higher than or equal to 550&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 750&#xb0; C. When the conductive layer is etched, a part of the oxide semiconductor layer may be removed. An insulating layer having a substantially same shape as the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer may be formed over the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">A portion of the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer may be formed using a material having low oxygen affinity.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">An oxide semiconductor layer having an amorphous structure may be formed as the oxide semiconductor layer, and the amorphous structure may remain in a region other than the crystalline region (e.g., a region other than a channel formation region).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">Note that the term such as &#x201c;over&#x201d; or &#x201c;below&#x201d; in this specification and the like does not necessarily mean that a component is placed &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly under&#x201d; another component. For example, the expression &#x201c;a gate electrode layer over a gate insulating layer&#x201d; does not exclude the case where a component is placed between the gate insulating layer and the gate electrode layer. Moreover, the terms such as &#x201c;over&#x201d; and &#x201c;below&#x201d; are used only for convenience of description and can include the case where the vertical relation of components is reversed, unless otherwise specified</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">In addition, the term such as &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; or &#x201c;wiring&#x201d; in this specification and the like does not limit a function of a component. For example, an &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; can be used as part of a &#x201c;wiring&#x201d;, and the &#x201c;wiring&#x201d; can be used as part of the &#x201c;electrode&#x201d;. Furthermore, the term &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; or &#x201c;wiring&#x201d; can include the case where a plurality of &#x201c;electrodes&#x201d; or &#x201c;wirings&#x201d; is formed in an integrated manner.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">Functions of a &#x201c;source&#x201d; and a &#x201c;drain&#x201d; are sometimes interchanged with each other when a transistor of opposite polarity is used or when the direction of current flowing is changed in circuit operation, for example. Therefore, the terms &#x201c;source&#x201d; and &#x201c;drain&#x201d; can be used to denote the drain and the source, respectively, in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">Note that the term &#x201c;electrically connected&#x201d; in this specification and the like includes the case where components are connected through an &#x201c;object having any electric function&#x201d;. There is no particular limitation on an object having any electric function as long as electric signals can be transmitted and received between components that are connected through the object.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">Examples of an &#x201c;object having any electric function&#x201d; are a switching element such as a transistor, a resistor, an inductor, a capacitor, and an element with a variety of functions as well as an electrode and a wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">In an embodiment of the disclosed invention, a purified oxide semiconductor layer is used for a semiconductor device. The purification means at least one of removing hydrogen, which causes an oxide semiconductor to change to an n-type oxide semiconductor, from the oxide semiconductor layer as much as possible and reducing defects, which are caused by oxygen deficiency in the oxide semiconductor layer, by supply of oxygen that the oxide semiconductor layer lacks.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">The purification is conducted in order to obtain an intrinsic (i-type) oxide semiconductor layer. Since an oxide semiconductor generally has n-type conductivity, the off-state current is high. When the off-state current is high, switching characteristics are insufficient, which is not appropriate for semiconductor devices. Therefore, an oxide semiconductor layer is purified to change to an i-type or substantially i-type oxide semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">In an embodiment of the disclosed invention, an oxide semiconductor layer including a crystalline region is used in a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">Electrical characteristics are different between an oxide semiconductor layer including a crystalline region having electrical anisotropy and an oxide semiconductor layer without a crystalline region. For example, in an oxide semiconductor layer including a crystalline region having c-axis aligned in a direction substantially perpendicular to a surface of the oxide semiconductor layer, conductivity in a direction parallel to the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer is increased and an insulating property in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">Thus, when the oxide semiconductor layer including a crystalline region is used for a semiconductor device, the semiconductor device can have excellent electrical characteristics.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0065">In addition, an interlayer insulating layer <b>116</b> and an interlayer insulating layer <b>118</b> are provided over the transistor <b>150</b>.

<p id="p-0065" num="0066">For the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>, any of the following materials is used: four-component metal oxide such as an In&#x2014;Sn&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material; three-component metal oxide such as an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, an In&#x2014;Sn&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, an In&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, a Sn&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, an Al&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, and a Sn&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material; two-component metal oxide such as an In&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, a Sn&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, an Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, a Zn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;O-based material, a Sn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;O-based material, and an In&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;O-based material; single-component metal oxide such as an In&#x2014;O-based material, a Sn&#x2014;O-based material, and a Zn&#x2014;O-based material; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">In particular, an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor material has sufficiently high resistance when there is no electric field and thus off-state current can be sufficiently reduced. In addition, also having high field-effect mobility, the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor material is suitable for a semiconductor material used in a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">As a typical example of the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor material, an oxide semiconductor material represented by InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m&#x3e;0) is given. Using M instead of Ga, there is an oxide semiconductor material represented by InMO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m&#x3e;0). Here, M denotes one or more metal elements selected from gallium (Ga), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), and the like. For example, M may be Ga, Ga and Al, Ga and Fe, Ga and Ni, Ga and Mn, Ga and Co, or the like.

<p id="p-0068" num="0069">The oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>is preferably an oxide semiconductor layer which is purified by sufficiently removing an impurity such as hydrogen therefrom and supplying oxygen thereto. Specifically, the hydrogen concentration of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>is 5&#xd7;10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, preferably 5&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, more preferably 5&#xd7;10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less. Note that the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>which is purified by sufficiently reducing hydrogen concentration and supplying oxygen has a carrier density (e.g., less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>12</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably less than 1.45&#xd7;10<sup>10</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>) which is sufficiently lower than that of silicon to which an impurity element is added (approximately 1&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>). The transistor <b>150</b> with excellent off-state current characteristics can be obtained with the use of such an i-type or substantially i-type oxide semiconductor. For example, when the drain voltage V<sub>D </sub>is +1 V or +10 V and the gate voltage V<sub>G </sub>is set in the range of from &#x2212;5 V to &#x2212;20 V, the off-state current is 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>A or less. Note that the above hydrogen concentration of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>is measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0078">Hereinafter, the meaning of purification of an oxide semiconductor to cause the oxide semiconductor to be an intrinsic (i-type) oxide semiconductor, an advantage of using an oxide semiconductor in a semiconductor device, and the like will be briefly described.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">&#x3c;Realization of Intrinsic Oxide Semiconductor&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">Considerable research has been done on properties of oxide semiconductors, such as the density of states (DOS); however, the research does not include the idea of sufficiently reducing defective states themselves. According to an embodiment of the disclosed invention, a purified, intrinsic (i-type) oxide semiconductor is manufactured by removing water or hydrogen, which might be a cause of an increase in the DOS, from the oxide semiconductor. This is based on the idea of sufficiently reducing the DOS itself. Thus, excellent industrial products can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">Note that oxygen may be removed while hydrogen, water, or the like is being removed. Therefore, it is preferable to realize a further purified, intrinsic (i-type) oxide semiconductor in such a manner that oxygen is supplied to metal dangling bonds generated by oxygen deficiency so that the DOS due to oxygen deficiency is reduced. For example, an oxygen-excess oxide film is formed in close contact with a channel formation region and heat treatment is performed at a temperature of approximately 200&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C., typically 250&#xb0; C., whereby oxygen can be supplied from the oxide film and the DOS due to oxygen deficiency can be reduced. An inert gas may be switched to a gas including oxygen during the first to third heat treatments to be described below. Further, after the first to third heat treatments, oxygen can be supplied to the oxide semiconductor through a temperature decreasing process in an oxygen atmosphere or an atmosphere in which hydrogen, water, or the like is sufficiently reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">It can be considered that a factor causing deterioration of characteristics of an oxide semiconductor is a shallow level due to excess hydrogen at 0.1 eV to 0.2 eV below the conduction band, a deep level due to oxygen deficiency, or the like. The technical idea that hydrogen is thoroughly eliminated and oxygen is adequately supplied in order to eliminate such a defect would be right.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">An oxide semiconductor is generally considered as an n-type semiconductor; however, according to an embodiment of the disclosed invention, an i-type oxide semiconductor is realized by removing an impurity such as water or hydrogen and supplying oxygen which is a constituent element of the oxide semiconductor. In this respect, it can be said that an embodiment of the disclosed invention includes a novel technical idea because it is not an i-type semiconductor such as silicon which is obtained by adding an impurity element.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">&#x3c;Advantage in Process Over Other Semiconductor Materials&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">As a semiconductor material that can be compared to an oxide semiconductor, silicon carbide (e.g., 4H&#x2014;SiC) or the like can be given. An oxide semiconductor and 4H&#x2014;SiC have some common features. The carrier density is one example thereof. In accordance with Fermi-Dirac distribution, the density of minority carriers in an oxide semiconductor is estimated to be approximately 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. This value of the minority carrier density is extremely small in a manner similar to that of 4H&#x2014;SiC, which is 6.7&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;11</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. In comparison with the intrinsic carrier density of silicon (approximately 1.45&#xd7;10<sup>10</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>), it can be well understood that the degree is significantly low.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">In addition, the energy band gap of the oxide semiconductor is 3.0 eV to 3.5 eV, and the energy band gap of 4H&#x2014;SiC is 3.26 eV. Therefore, an oxide semiconductor and silicon carbide are similar in that they are both wide bandgap semiconductors.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">On the other hand, there is a significant difference between an oxide semiconductor and silicon carbide, that is, the process temperature. In general, heat treatment at 1500&#xb0; C. to 2000&#xb0; C. is required when using silicon carbide. At such a high temperature, a semiconductor substrate, a semiconductor element, or the like is damaged, and thus, it is difficult to form a semiconductor element using silicon carbide over a semiconductor element using a semiconductor material other than silicon carbide. On the other hand, an oxide semiconductor can be obtained through heat treatment at 850&#xb0; C. or lower, preferably 750&#xb0; C. or lower. Therefore, it is possible to form a semiconductor element using an oxide semiconductor after forming an integrated circuit using another semiconductor material.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">In the case of using an oxide semiconductor, there is an advantage that it is possible to use a substrate having low heat resistance such as a glass substrate, which is different from the case where silicon carbide is used. Moreover, there is also an advantage that high-temperature heat treatment is not required so that energy cost can be reduced sufficiently as compared to silicon carbide. Further, in silicon carbide, a crystal defect or a small amount of impurities which is introduced into the silicon carbide without intention is a factor causing carriers to be generated. In theory, a low carrier density equivalent to that of the oxide semiconductor of the present invention can be obtained in the case of silicon carbide; however, it is practically difficult to obtain a carrier density less than 10<sup>12</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>for the reasons given above. The same applies to a comparison between the oxide semiconductor and gallium nitride which is also known as a wide bandgap semiconductor.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">&#x3c;Electrical Conduction Mechanism of Transistor Including Oxide Semiconductor&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">An electrical conduction mechanism of a transistor including an oxide semiconductor will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Note that the following description is based on the assumption of an ideal situation for easy understanding and does not necessarily reflect a real situation. Note also that the following description is just a consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a transistor (thin film transistor) including an oxide semiconductor. An oxide semiconductor layer (OS) is provided over a gate electrode (GE1) with a gate insulating layer (GI) interposed therebetween. A source electrode (S) and a drain electrode (D) are provided thereover. An insulating layer is provided so as to cover the source electrode (S) and the drain electrode (D).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an energy band diagram (schematic diagram) of the A-A&#x2032; section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a black circle (&#x25cf;) and a white circle (&#x2218;) represent an electron and a hole and have electric charges (&#x2212;q, +q), respectively. With a positive voltage (V<sub>D</sub>&#x3e;0) applied to the drain electrode, the dashed line shows the case where no voltage is applied to the gate electrode (V<sub>G</sub>=0) and the solid line shows the case where a positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode (V<sub>G</sub>&#x3e;0). In the case where no voltage is applied to the gate electrode, carriers (electrons) are not injected to the oxide semiconductor side from an electrode because of high potential barrier, so that a current does not flow, which means an off state. On the other hand, when a positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode, potential barrier is lowered, and thus a current flows, which means an on state.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are energy band diagrams (schematic diagrams) of the B-B&#x2032; section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an on state in which a positive voltage (V<sub>G</sub>&#x3e;0) is applied to the gate electrode (GE1) and carriers (electrons) flow between the source electrode and the drain electrode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates an off state in which a negative voltage (V<sub>G</sub>&#x3c;0) is applied to the gate electrode (GE1) and minority carriers do not flow.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the relationships between the vacuum level and the work function of a metal (&#x3c6;<sub>M</sub>) and between the vacuum level and the electron affinity (&#x3c7;) of an oxide semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">At normal temperature, electrons in the metal are degenerated and the Fermi level is located in the conduction band. On the other hand, a conventional oxide semiconductor is an n-type oxide semiconductor, in which the Fermi level (E<sub>F</sub>) is away from the intrinsic Fermi level (E<sub>i</sub>) located in the middle of a band gap and is located closer to the conduction band. Note that it is known that part of hydrogen is a donor in an oxide semiconductor and is one factor causing an oxide semiconductor to be an n-type oxide semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">On the other hand, an oxide semiconductor according to one embodiment of the disclosed invention is an intrinsic (i-type) or substantially intrinsic oxide semiconductor which is obtained by removing hydrogen that is a factor for an n-type oxide semiconductor from an oxide semiconductor, and purifying the oxide semiconductor such that an element other than a main component of the oxide semiconductor (i.e., an impurity element) is prevented from being contained therein as much as possible. In other words, a feature is that a purified i-type (intrinsic) semiconductor, or a semiconductor close thereto, is obtained not by adding an impurity element but by removing an impurity such as hydrogen or water as much as possible. Thus, the Fermi level (E<sub>F</sub>) can be comparable with the intrinsic Fermi level (E<sub>i</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">It is said that the band gap (E<sub>g</sub>) of an oxide semiconductor is 3.15 eV and the electron affinity (&#x3c7;) is 4.3 V. The work function of titanium (Ti) included in the source electrode and the drain electrode is substantially equal to the electron affinity (&#x3c7;) of the oxide semiconductor. In that case, a Schottky barrier for electrons is not formed at an interface between the metal and the oxide semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095">At that time, the electron moves in the vicinity of the interface between the gate insulating layer and the purified oxide semiconductor (the lowest portion of the oxide semiconductor which is stable in terms of energy) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0096">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, when a negative potential is applied to the gate electrode (GE1), the value of current is extremely close to zero because holes that are minority carriers are substantially zero.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097">In such a manner, an intrinsic (i-type) or substantially intrinsic oxide semiconductor is obtained by being purified such that an element other than its main element (i.e., an impurity element) is contained as little as possible. Thus, characteristics of the interface between the oxide semiconductor and the gate insulating layer become obvious. For that reason, the gate insulating layer needs to be able to form a favorable interface with the oxide semiconductor. Specifically, it is preferable to use, for example, an insulating layer formed by a CVD method using high-density plasma generated with a power supply frequency in the range of the VHF band to the microwave band, an insulating layer formed by a sputtering method, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">When the oxide semiconductor is purified and the interface between the oxide semiconductor and the gate insulating layer is made favorable, in the case where the transistor has a channel width (W) of 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>&#x3bc;m and a channel length (L) of 3 &#x3bc;m, for example, it is possible to realize characteristics such as an off-state current of 10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>A or less and a subthreshold swing (S value) of 0.1 V/dec (with a 100 nm thick gate insulating layer).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">The oxide semiconductor is purified as described above so as to contain an element other than its main element (i.e., an impurity element) as little as possible, so that the thin film transistor can operate in a favorable manner.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">&#x3c;Resistance of Transistor Including Oxide Semiconductor to Hot Carrier Degradation&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0100">Next, the resistance of a transistor including an oxide semiconductor to hot carrier degradation will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Note that the following description is based on the assumption of an ideal situation for easy understanding and does not necessarily reflect a real situation. Note also that the following description is just a consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0101">Main causes of hot carrier degradation are channel hot electron injection (CHE injection) and drain avalanche hot carrier injection (DAHC injection). Note that only electrons are considered below for simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0102">CHE injection refers to a phenomenon in which electrons having gained energy higher than the barrier of a gate insulating layer in a semiconductor layer are injected into the gate insulating layer or the like. Electrons gain energy by being accelerated by a low electric field.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0103">DAHC injection refers to a phenomenon in which electrons generated by collision of electrons accelerated by a high electric field are injected to a gate insulating layer or the like. A difference between DAHC injection and CHE injection is whether or not they involve avalanche breakdown caused by impact ionization. Note that DAHC injection requires electrons having a kinetic energy higher than or equal to a band gap of a semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrate energy required for each hot carrier injection which is estimated from the band structure of silicon (Si) and an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor (IGZO). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> show CHE injection on the left side and DAHC injection on the right side.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0105">Regarding silicon, degradation caused by DAHC injection is more serious than that caused by CHE injection. This results from the fact that silicon has a narrow band gap and avalanche breakdown readily occurs therein. Because carriers (e.g., electrons) which are accelerated without colliding are very few in silicon, the probability of CHE injection is therefore low. On the other hand, avalanche breakdown increases the number of electrons capable of travelling over the barrier of the gate insulating layer, and this increases the number of electrons injected to the gate insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0106">Regarding an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, the energy required for CHE injection does not greatly differ from that in the case of silicon, and the energy required for DAHC injection is substantially equal to the energy required for CHE injection due to a wide band gap. In other words, the probability of DAHC injection is low.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0107">On the other hand, like silicon, carriers (e.g., electrons) which are accelerated without colliding are very few, and the probability of CHE injection is therefore also low. In other words, an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor has higher resistance to hot carrier degradation than silicon.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">&#x3c;Short-Channel Effect in Transistor Including Oxide Semiconductor&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0108">Next, a short-channel effect in a transistor including an oxide semiconductor will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Note that the following description is based on the assumption of an ideal situation for easy understanding and does not necessarily reflect a real situation. Note also that the following description is just a consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0109">The short-channel effect refers to degradation of electrical characteristics which becomes obvious with miniaturization of a transistor (a reduction in channel length (L)). The short-channel effect results from the effect of a drain on a source. Specific examples of the short-channel effect are a decrease in threshold voltage, an increase in subthreshold swing (S value), an increase in leakage current, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0110">Here, a structure capable of suppressing a short-channel effect is examined by device simulation. Specifically, four kinds of models each having a different carrier density and a different thickness of an oxide semiconductor layer were prepared, and the relationship between a channel length (L) and a threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) was checked. As the models, bottom-gate transistors were employed, in each of which the carrier density was 1.7&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and an oxide semiconductor layer had a thickness of 1 &#x3bc;m or 30 nm. Note that an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor was used for the oxide semiconductor layer, and a silicon oxynitride film with a thickness of 100 nm was used as a gate insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0111">Note that there is no significant difference in calculation results between a top-gate transistor and a bottom-gate transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> show calculation results. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the case where the carrier density is 1.7&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the case where the carrier density is 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. The results show that a short-channel effect can be suppressed in a transistor including an oxide semiconductor by a reduction in thickness of an oxide semiconductor layer. For example, in the case where the channel length is approximately 1 &#x3bc;m, even with an oxide semiconductor layer having sufficiently low carrier density, it can be understood that a short-channel effect can be sufficiently suppressed when the thickness of the oxide semiconductor layer is set to approximately 3 nm to 50 nm, preferably, 3 nm to 20 nm.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">&#x3c;Carrier Density of Oxide Semiconductor&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0113">A technical idea according to the disclosed invention is to make an oxide semiconductor layer as close as possible to an intrinsic (i-type) oxide semiconductor layer by sufficiently reducing the carrier density thereof. A method for calculating the carrier density and an actually measured carrier density of an oxide semiconductor layer will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0114">The carrier density of an oxide semiconductor layer can be obtained in such a manner that a MOS capacitor including an oxide semiconductor layer is manufactured and the results of C-V (capacitance-voltage) measurement (C-V characteristics) of the MOS capacitor are evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0115">The carrier density is measured according to the following steps (1) to (3): (1) to obtain C-V characteristics by plotting the relation between the gate voltage V<sub>g </sub>and capacitance C of the MOS capacitor; (2) to obtain a graph showing the relation between the gate voltage V<sub>g </sub>and (1/C)<sup>2 </sup>with the use of the C-V characteristics, and to obtain a differential value of (1/C)<sup>2 </sup>in a weak inversion region in the graph; and (3) to substitute the differential value obtained into Formula 1, which is shown below, representing the carrier density (N<sub>d</sub>). Note that e, &#x3b5;<sub>0</sub>, and &#x3b5; in Formula 1 represent elementary electric charge, vacuum permittivity, and relative permittivity of an oxide semiconductor, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0117">As a sample used for the measurement, a MOS capacitor having the following structure was used. The MOS capacitor includes a 300 nm thick titanium layer over a glass substrate, a 100 nm thick titanium nitride layer over the titanium layer, a 2 &#x3bc;m thick oxide semiconductor layer including an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor (a-IGZO) over the titanium nitride layer, a 300 nm thick silicon oxynitride layer over the oxide semiconductor layer, and a 300 nm thick silver layer over the silicon oxynitride layer.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0118">Note that the oxide semiconductor layer was formed using a target for depositing an oxide semiconductor including In, Ga, and Zn (In:Ga:Zn=1:1:0.5 [atomic ratio]) by a sputtering method.

<p id="p-0121" num="0122">Next, a manufacturing method of the transistor <b>150</b> which is an example of a structure of a semiconductor device will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0123">First, the insulating layer <b>102</b> is formed over the substrate <b>100</b>. Then, an oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is formed over the insulating layer <b>102</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0124">The substrate <b>100</b> may be any substrate that has an insulating surface and may be, for example, a glass substrate. The glass substrate is preferably a non-alkali glass substrate. As a material of the non-alkali glass substrate, a glass material such as aluminosilicate glass, aluminoborosilicate glass, barium borosilicate glass, or the like is used, for example. Alternatively, as the substrate <b>100</b>, an insulating substrate formed using an insulator such as a ceramic substrate, a quartz substrate, or a sapphire substrate, a semiconductor substrate which is formed using a semiconductor material such as silicon and whose surface is covered with an insulating material, or a conductive substrate which is formed using a conductor such as metal or stainless steel and whose surface is covered with an insulating material can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0125">The insulating layer <b>102</b> functions as a base and can be formed by a CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like. The insulating layer <b>102</b> is preferably formed so as to include silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, tantalum oxide, or the like. Note that the insulating layer <b>102</b> may have a single-layer structure or a stacked structure. There is no particular limitation on the thickness of the insulating layer <b>102</b>; the insulating layer <b>102</b> can have a thickness of 10 nm to 500 nm, for example. Here, the insulating layer <b>102</b> is not an essential component; therefore, a structure in which the insulating layer <b>102</b> is not provided is also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0126">If hydrogen, water, or the like is contained in the insulating layer <b>102</b>, hydrogen may enter the oxide semiconductor layer or extract oxygen from the oxide semiconductor layer, whereby characteristics of the transistor may be degraded. Therefore, it is desirable to form the insulating layer <b>102</b> so as to include as little hydrogen or water as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0127">In the case of using a sputtering method or the like, for example, it is desirable that the insulating layer <b>102</b> be formed in a state where moisture remaining in the treatment chamber is removed. In order to remove moisture remaining in the treatment chamber, an entrapment vacuum pump such as a cryopump, an ion pump, or a titanium sublimation pump is preferably used. A turbo pump provided with a cold trap may be used. From the treatment chamber evacuated with a cryopump or the like, hydrogen, water, or the like is sufficiently removed; thus, the concentration of an impurity in the insulating layer <b>102</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0128">When the insulating layer <b>102</b> is formed, it is desirable to use a high-purity gas in which an impurity such as hydrogen or water is reduced to a concentration of approximately several parts per million (preferably several parts per billion).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0129">The oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> can be formed using any of the following materials: four-component metal oxide such as an In&#x2014;Sn&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material; three-component metal oxide such as an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, an In&#x2014;Sn&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, an In&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, a Sn&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, an Al&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, and a Sn&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material; two-component metal oxide such as an In&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, a Sn&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, an Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based material, a Zn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;O-based material, a Sn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;O-based material, and an In&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;O-based material; single-component metal oxide such as an In&#x2014;O-based material, a Sn&#x2014;O-based material, and a Zn&#x2014;O-based material; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0130">In particular, an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor material has sufficiently high resistance when there is no electric field and thus off-state current can be sufficiently reduced. In addition, also having high field-effect mobility, the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor material is suitable for a semiconductor material used in a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0131">As a typical example of the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor material, an oxide semiconductor material represented by InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m&#x3e;0) is given. Using M instead of Ga, there is an oxide semiconductor material represented by InMO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m&#x3e;0). Here, M denotes one or more metal elements selected from gallium (Ga), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), and the like. For example, M may be Ga, Ga and Al, Ga and Fe, Ga and Ni, Ga and Mn, Ga and Co, or the like. Note that the above-described compositions are derived from the crystal structures that the oxide semiconductor material can have and are mere examples.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0132">In this embodiment, as the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b>, an amorphous oxide semiconductor layer is formed by a sputtering method using a target for depositing an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0133">As a target used for forming the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> by a sputtering method, a metal oxide target containing zinc oxide as its main component can be used, for example. Furthermore, a target for depositing an oxide semiconductor including In, Ga, and Zn has a composition ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:x:y (x is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2, and y is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 5). For example, a target having a composition ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1 [atomic ratio] (x=1, y=1) or a composition ratio of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=1:1:2[molar ratio]) may be used. Furthermore, as a target for depositing an oxide semiconductor, a target having a composition ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:0.5[atomic ratio] or a composition ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:2[atomic ratio] or In:Ga:Zn=1:0:1[atomic ratio] (x=0, y=1) may be used. In this embodiment, heat treatment is performed later in order to intentionally crystallize an oxide semiconductor layer; thus, a target for depositing an oxide semiconductor with which an oxide semiconductor layer which can easily be crystallized is preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0134">The relative density of an oxide semiconductor in a target for depositing an oxide semiconductor is 80% or more, preferably 95% or more, more preferably 99.9% or more. The use of a target for depositing an oxide semiconductor having high relative density makes it possible to form an oxide semiconductor layer with a dense structure.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0135">The atmosphere in which the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is formed is preferably a rare gas (typically, argon) atmosphere, an oxygen atmosphere, or a mixed atmosphere of a rare gas (typically, argon) and oxygen. Specifically, it is preferable to use a high-purity gas atmosphere, for example, from which an impurity such as hydrogen, water, a hydroxyl group, or hydride is removed to a concentration of approximately several parts per million (preferably, several parts per billion).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0136">In forming the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b>, for example, the substrate is held in a treatment chamber that is maintained under reduced pressure, and the substrate is heated to a temperature of 100&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C., preferably 200&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C. Then, a sputtering gas from which hydrogen and water are removed is introduced into the treatment chamber from which remaining moisture is removed, and the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is formed using metal oxide as a target. By forming the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> while heating the substrate, an impurity in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> can be reduced. Moreover, damage due to sputtering is reduced. In order to remove moisture remaining in the treatment chamber, an entrapment vacuum pump is preferably used. For example, a cryopump, an ion pump, a titanium sublimation pump, or the like can be used. A turbo pump provided with a cold trap may be used. From the treatment chamber evacuated with a cryopump or the like, hydrogen, water, or the like is sufficiently removed; therefore, the concentration of an impurity in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0137">For example, the conditions for forming the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> can be set as follows: the distance between the substrate and the target is 170 mm, the pressure is 0.4 Pa, the direct current (DC) power is 0.5 kW, and the atmosphere is an oxygen (100% oxygen) atmosphere, an argon (100% argon) atmosphere, or a mixed atmosphere of oxygen and argon. Note that a pulsed direct current (DC) power source is preferably used because dust (powder or flake-like substances formed at the time of the film formation) can be reduced and the film thickness can be uniform. The thickness of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is set in the range of 2 nm to 200 nm, preferably 5 nm to 30 nm. Note that the appropriate thickness of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> differs depending on the oxide semiconductor material to be used, the intended use, or the like; therefore, the thickness may be determined as appropriate in accordance with the material, the intended use, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0138">Note that before the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is formed by a sputtering method, reverse sputtering in which plasma is generated with an argon gas introduced is preferably performed so that a material attached to the surface of the insulating layer <b>102</b> is removed. Here, the reverse sputtering is a method by which ions collide with a surface to be processed so that the surface is modified, in contrast to normal sputtering by which ions collide with a sputtering target. An example of a method for making ions collide with a surface to be processed is a method in which high-frequency voltage is applied to the surface side in an argon atmosphere so that plasma is generated near a substrate. Note that an atmosphere of nitrogen, helium, oxygen, or the like may be used instead of an argon atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0139">Next, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is processed by a method such as etching using a mask; thus, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>having an island shape is formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0140">As a method for etching the oxide semiconductor layer, either dry etching or wet etching may be employed. It is needless to say that dry etching and wet etching can be used in combination. The etching conditions (e.g., an etching gas or an etchant, etching time, and temperature) are set as appropriate depending on the material so that the oxide semiconductor layer can be etched into a desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0141">As dry etching, a parallel plate reactive ion etching (RIE) method, an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching method, or the like can be used. Also in this case, etching conditions (e.g., the amount of electric power applied to a coiled electrode, the amount of electric power applied to an electrode on the substrate side, and the electrode temperature on the substrate side) need to be set as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0142">An example of an etching gas which can be used for dry etching is a gas containing chlorine (a chlorine-based gas such as chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>), boron trichloride (BCl<sub>3</sub>), silicon tetrachloride (SiCl<sub>4</sub>), or carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)). Moreover, a gas containing fluorine (a fluorine-based gas such as carbon tetrafluoride (CF<sub>4</sub>), sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>), or trifluoromethane (CHF<sub>3</sub>)), hydrogen bromide (HBr), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), any of these gases to which a rare gas such as helium (He) or argon (Ar) is added, or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0143">An example of an etchant which can be used for wet etching includes a mixed solution of phosphoric acid, acetic acid, and nitric acid, an ammonia hydrogen peroxide mixture (hydrogen peroxide solution of 31 wt %:ammonia solution of 28 wt %:water=5:2:2), or the like. An etchant such as ITO-07N (produced by KANTO CHEMICAL CO., INC.) may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0144">After that, heat treatment (first heat treatment) is preferably performed on the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>. Water (including a hydroxyl group), hydrogen, or the like contained in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be removed by the first heat treatment. For example, the temperature of the first heat treatment can be set higher than or equal to 300&#xb0; C. and lower than 550&#xb0; C., preferably higher than or equal to 400&#xb0; C. and lower than 550&#xb0; C. Note that the first heat treatment may double as second heat treatment (heat treatment for forming a crystalline region) to be performed later. In that case, the temperature of the heat treatment is preferably set higher than or equal to 550&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 850&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0145">For example, after the substrate <b>100</b> is introduced into an electric furnace including a resistance heater or the like, the heat treatment can be performed at 450&#xb0; C. for one hour in a nitrogen atmosphere. The oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>is not exposed to the air during the heat treatment so that entry of water or hydrogen can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0146">The heat treatment apparatus is not limited to the electric furnace and can be an apparatus for heating an object to be processed by thermal radiation or thermal conduction from a medium such as a heated gas. For example, a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) apparatus such as a gas rapid thermal annealing (GRTA) apparatus or a lamp rapid thermal annealing (LRTA) apparatus can be used. An LRTA apparatus is an apparatus for heating an object to be processed by radiation of light (an electromagnetic wave) emitted from a lamp such as a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a high pressure sodium lamp, or a high pressure mercury lamp. A GRTA apparatus is an apparatus for performing heat treatment using a high-temperature gas. As the gas, an inert gas that does not react with an object to be processed by heat treatment, for example, nitrogen or a rare gas such as argon is used.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0147">For example, as the first heat treatment, GRTA treatment may be performed as follows. The substrate is put in an inert gas atmosphere that has been heated to a high temperature of 650&#xb0; C. to 700&#xb0; C., heated for several minutes, and taken out of the inert gas atmosphere. The GRTA treatment enables high-temperature heat treatment in a short time. Moreover, the GRTA treatment can be employed even when the temperature exceeds the upper temperature limit of the substrate because the heat treatment can be achieved in a short time. In the case where a glass substrate is used, shrinkage of the substrate becomes a problem at a temperature higher than the upper temperature limit (strain point) but does not in the case of performing heat treatment in a short time. Note that the inert gas may be switched to a gas including oxygen during the treatment. This is because defects caused by oxygen deficiency can be reduced by performing the first heat treatment in an atmosphere including oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0148">Note that as the inert gas atmosphere, an atmosphere that contains nitrogen or a rare gas (e.g., helium, neon, or argon) as its main component and does not contain water, hydrogen, or the like is preferably used. For example, the purity of nitrogen or a rare gas such as helium, neon, or argon introduced into a heat treatment apparatus is set to 6N (99.9999%) or more, preferably 7N (99.99999%) or more (i.e., the impurity concentration is 1 ppm or less, preferably 0.1 ppm or less).</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0149">In any case, the transistor <b>150</b> with extremely excellent characteristics can be obtained with the use of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>which is an i-type or substantially i-type oxide semiconductor layer obtained by removing an impurity through the first heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0150">Note that the first heat treatment can be performed on the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> that has not yet been processed into the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>having an island shape. In that case, after the first heat treatment, the substrate <b>100</b> is taken out of the heating apparatus and a photolithography step is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0151">The first heat treatment can also be referred to as dehydration treatment, dehydrogenation treatment, or the like because it has the effect of removing hydrogen or water. The dehydration treatment or dehydrogenation treatment can be performed after the oxide semiconductor layer is formed, after a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer are stacked over the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>, or after a gate insulating layer is formed over the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer. Such dehydration treatment or dehydrogenation treatment may be performed once or plural times.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0152">Next, a conductive layer <b>108</b> is formed so as to be in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0153">The conductive layer <b>108</b> can be formed by a PVD method such as a sputtering method, or a CVD method such as a plasma CVD method. The conductive layer <b>108</b> can be formed using an element selected from aluminum, chromium, copper, tantalum, titanium, molybdenum, and tungsten, an alloy including any of these elements as a component, or the like. A material including one or more of manganese, magnesium, zirconium, and beryllium may be used. A material including aluminum and one or more elements selected from titanium, tantalum, tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, neodymium, and scandium may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0154">The conductive layer <b>108</b> may also be formed using a conductive metal oxide. As the conductive metal oxide, indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), an indium oxide-tin oxide alloy (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SnO<sub>2</sub>, which is abbreviated to ITO in some cases), an indium oxide-zinc oxide alloy (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;ZnO), or any of these metal oxide materials in which silicon or silicon oxide is included can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0155">The conductive layer <b>108</b> may have a single-layer structure or a stacked structure including two or more layers. For example, the conductive layer <b>108</b> may have a three-layer structure in which an aluminum film is stacked over a titanium film and a titanium film is stacked over the aluminum film or a three-layer structure in which an aluminum film is stacked over a molybdenum film and a molybdenum film is stacked over the aluminum film. Alternatively, the conductive layer <b>108</b> can have a two-layer structure in which an aluminum film and a tungsten film are stacked, a two-layer structure in which a copper film and a tungsten film are stacked, or a two-layer structure in which an aluminum film and a molybdenum film are stacked. It is needless to say that the conductive layer <b>108</b> may have a single-layer structure or a stacked structure including four or more layers. In the case of a single-layer structure, a single-layer structure of a titanium film is preferable. With the use of a single-layer structure of a titanium film, later etching for forming a favorable tapered shape can be realized. Here, a three-layer structure of a titanium film, an aluminum film, and a titanium film is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0156">Note that a material having a low ability to extract oxygen (a material having low oxygen affinity) may be used in a portion of the conductive layer <b>108</b> which is in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>. As such a material, titanium nitride, tungsten nitride, platinum, or the like can be given, for example. In a manner similar to the above, the conductive layer <b>108</b> may have either a single-layer structure or a stacked structure. In the case of the conductive layer <b>108</b> having a stacked structure, a two-layer structure of a titanium nitride film and a titanium film, a two-layer structure of a titanium nitride film and a tungsten film, a two-layer structure of a titanium nitride film and a copper-molybdenum alloy film, a two-layer structure of a tantalum nitride film and a tungsten film, a two-layer structure of a tantalum nitride film and a copper film, a three-layer structure of a titanium nitride film, a tungsten film, and a titanium film, or the like can be employed, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0157">In the case where the material having a low ability to extract oxygen as described above is used for the conductive layer <b>108</b>, a change of the oxide semiconductor layer to an n-type due to extraction of oxygen can be prevented; accordingly, an adverse effect on transistor characteristics caused by an uneven change to an n-type or the like can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0158">In the case of using a material having a high barrier property, such as a titanium nitride film or a tantalum nitride film described above, in a portion of the conductive layer <b>108</b> which is in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>, entry of an impurity into the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be prevented and an adverse effect on transistor characteristics can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0159">Next, the conductive layer <b>108</b> is selectively etched; thus, the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b </i>are formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>). Note that an insulating layer may be formed over the conductive layer <b>108</b>, and the insulating layer may be etched; thus, an insulating layer having substantially the same shape as the source or drain electrode layers may be formed over the source or drain electrode layers. In that case, capacitance between the source or drain electrode layers and the gate electrode layer (so-called gate capacitance) can be reduced. Note that the expression &#x201c;substantially the same&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially same&#x201d; does not necessarily mean being exactly the same in a strict sense and can mean being considered as the same. For example, a difference made by a single etching process is acceptable. Further, the thickness does not need to be the same.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0160">For light exposure in forming a mask used for etching, ultraviolet light, KrF laser light, or ArF laser light is preferably used. Particularly for light exposure in the case where the channel length (L) is less than 25 nm, light exposure for forming a mask is preferably performed with extreme ultraviolet light whose wavelength is several nanometers to several tens of nanometers, which is extremely short. In light exposure using extreme ultraviolet light, resolution is high and depth of focus is large. Therefore, the channel length (L) of a transistor which is formed later can also be made to be 10 nm to 1000 nm By a decrease in channel length by such a method, operation speed can be improved. In addition, the off-state current of a transistor including the above-described oxide semiconductor is small; thus, an increase in power consumption due to miniaturization can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0161">The materials and etching conditions of the conductive layer <b>108</b> and the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>are adjusted as appropriate so that the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>is not removed in etching of the conductive layer <b>108</b>. Note that in some cases, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>is partly etched in the etching step and thus has a groove portion (a depression portion) depending on the materials and the etching conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0162">In order to reduce the number of masks to be used and reduce the number of steps, an etching step may be performed with the use of a resist mask formed using a multi-tone mask which is a light-exposure mask through which light is transmitted to have a plurality of intensities. A resist mask formed with the use of a multi-tone mask has a plurality of thicknesses (has a stair-like shape) and further can be changed in shape by ashing; therefore, the resist mask can be used in a plurality of etching steps. That is, a resist mask corresponding to at least two kinds of different patterns can be formed by using one multi-tone mask. Thus, the number of light-exposure masks can be reduced and the number of corresponding photolithography steps can also be reduced, whereby a process can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0163">Next, heat treatment (second heat treatment) is performed on the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>. By the second heat treatment, the crystalline region <b>110</b> is formed in a region including a surface of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>). Note that the range of the crystalline region <b>110</b> varies depending on the material of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>, the conditions of the heat treatment, and the like. For example, the crystalline region <b>110</b> can be formed to the lower interface of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0164">For the second heat treatment, heat treatment similar to the first heat treatment can be employed. In other words, heat treatment using an electric furnace, heat treatment using heat conduction from a medium such as a heated gas, heat treatment using thermal radiation, or the like can be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0165">Note that it is preferable that oxygen be not contained in a treatment atmosphere. This is because oxidation of the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the like can be prevented when oxygen is not contained in a treatment atmosphere. As a specific atmosphere, an inert gas (nitrogen, a rare gas, or the like) in which hydrogen, water, or the like is sufficiently reduced can be employed, for example. The temperature is set higher than or equal to 550&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 850&#xb0; C., preferably higher than or equal to 550&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 750&#xb0; C. This is because a favorable crystal can be grown by performing the second heat treatment at a relatively high temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0166">Note that although the essential part of the invention does not require a particular upper limit of the heat treatment temperature, in the case where the substrate <b>100</b> has low heat resistance, the upper limit of the heat treatment temperature needs to be lower than the allowable temperature limit of the substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0167">In the case of employing GRTA treatment, the heat treatment period is preferably 1 minute to 100 minutes long. For example, GRTA treatment is preferably performed at 650&#xb0; C. for approximately 3 minutes to 6 minutes. By employing the above-described GRTA treatment, heat treatment can be performed in a short time; therefore, an adverse effect of heat on the substrate <b>100</b> can be reduced. That is, the upper limit of the heat treatment temperature can be increased in that case as compared to the case where heat treatment is performed for a long time. In addition, the crystalline region <b>110</b> can be easily formed in the region including the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0168">In the second heat treatment, it is preferable that hydrogen (including water) or the like be not contained in a treatment atmosphere. For example, the purity of an inert gas which is introduced into a heat treatment apparatus is set to 6N (99.9999%, that is, an impurity concentration is 1 ppm or lower) or more, preferably, 7N (99.99999%, that is, an impurity concentration is 0.1 ppm or lower) or more. Instead of the inert gas, an oxygen gas in which hydrogen (including water) or the like is sufficiently reduced, a N<sub>2</sub>O gas, an ultra-dry air (with a dew point of &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. or lower, preferably &#x2212;60&#xb0; C. or lower), or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0169">Note that the second heat treatment may be performed at any timing as long as it is performed after the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is formed. Therefore, it is possible to perform heat treatment which serves as both the first heat treatment and the second heat treatment, for example. In that case, either the first heat treatment or the second heat treatment is performed. In addition, the second heat treatment may be performed once or plural times.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0170">In the crystalline region <b>110</b> formed in such a manner, a crystal in an oxide semiconductor is aligned such that its c-axis is in a direction substantially perpendicular to the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer. Here, &#x201c;substantially perpendicular&#x201d; means being within &#xb1;10&#xb0; from a perpendicular direction.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0171">For example, in the case where an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor material is used for the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>, the crystalline region <b>110</b> can include a crystal represented by InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m: an integer), a crystal represented by In<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>7</sub>, or the like. Owing to the second heat treatment, such a crystal is aligned such that its c-axis is in a direction substantially perpendicular to the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0172">Here, the above-described crystal includes any of In, Ga, and Zn, and can be considered to have a stacked structure of layers parallel to a-axis and b-axis. Specifically, the above-described crystal has a structure in which a layer including In and a layer not including In (a layer including Ga or Zn) are stacked in the c-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0173">In the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor crystal, the conductivity of the layer including In in a direction parallel to a-axis and b-axis is favorable. This is due to the fact that electrical conductivity is mainly controlled by In in the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor crystal and the fact that the 5 s orbital of one In atom overlaps with the 5 s orbital of an adjacent In atom and thereby a carrier path is formed. In a direction perpendicular to the above-described layer (that is, the c-axis direction), an insulating property is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0174">By including the crystalline region <b>110</b> as described above, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>can have electrical anisotropy. In the above-described example, the electrical conductivity in a direction parallel to the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>is increased, and the insulating property in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>is increased. Therefore, with the use of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>including the crystalline region <b>110</b> as described above, a semiconductor device having favorable electrical characteristics can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0175">Note that it is preferable that an amorphous structure or the like remain below the crystalline region <b>110</b> because carriers flowing in the crystalline region <b>110</b> can be prevented from being affected by the interface with the insulating layer <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0176">Next, the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> is formed in contact with part of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>without exposure to the air (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>). The gate insulating layer <b>112</b> can be formed by a CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like. The gate insulating layer <b>112</b> is preferably formed so as to include silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, tantalum oxide, or the like. Note that the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> may have a single-layer structure or a stacked structure. There is no particular limitation on the thickness of the gate insulating layer <b>112</b>; the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> can have a thickness of 10 nm to 500 nm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0177">Note that an i-type or substantially i-type oxide semiconductor obtained by removing an impurity or the like (a purified oxide semiconductor) is highly susceptible to interface states or interface charges; therefore, the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> needs to have high quality.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0178">For example, a high-density plasma CVD method using a microwave (e.g., 2.45 GHz) is favorable in that the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> can be dense and have high withstand voltage and high quality. This is because a close contact between a purified oxide semiconductor layer and a high-quality gate insulating layer reduces interface states and produces desirable interface characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0179">It is needless to say that another method such as a sputtering method or a plasma CVD method can also be employed as long as a high-quality insulating layer can be formed as the gate insulating layer <b>112</b>. Moreover, it is possible to use an insulating layer whose quality, interface characteristics, or the like is improved with heat treatment performed after formation of the insulating layer. In any case, an insulating layer that has a reduced interface state density and can form a favorable interface with an oxide semiconductor layer, as well as having favorable film quality as the gate insulating layer <b>112</b>, is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0180">By thus improving characteristics of the interface with the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> and eliminating an impurity, particularly hydrogen, water, or the like, from an oxide semiconductor, it is possible to obtain a stable transistor whose threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) does not change with a gate bias-temperature stress test (BT test, e.g., at 85&#xb0; C. and 2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>V/cm for 12 hours).</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0181">After that, third heat treatment is preferably performed in an inert gas atmosphere or an oxygen atmosphere. The temperature of the heat treatment is set in the range of 200&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C., preferably 250&#xb0; C. to 350&#xb0; C. For example, the heat treatment may be performed at 250&#xb0; C. for 1 hour in a nitrogen atmosphere. The third heat treatment can reduce variation in electrical characteristics of the transistor. Further, by the third heat treatment, oxygen can be supplied to the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>. Note that in the case of aiming to supply oxygen to the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>, it is preferably to perform the third heat treatment after a silicon oxide film is formed as the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> by a sputtering method.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0182">Note that the third heat treatment is performed in this embodiment after the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> is formed; there is no particular limitation on the timing of the third heat treatment as long as it is performed after the second heat treatment. In addition, the third heat treatment is not an essential step.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0183">Next, the gate electrode layer <b>114</b> is formed over the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> in a region overlapping with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>(particularly in a region overlapping with the crystalline region <b>110</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>). The gate electrode layer <b>114</b> can be formed by forming a conductive layer over the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> and then selectively patterning the conductive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0184">The conductive layer can be formed by a PVD method such as a sputtering method, or a CVD method such as a plasma CVD method. The conductive layer can be formed using an element selected from aluminum, chromium, copper, tantalum, titanium, molybdenum, and tungsten, an alloy including any of these elements as a component, or the like. A material including one or more of manganese, magnesium, zirconium, and beryllium may be used. A material including aluminum and one or more elements selected from titanium, tantalum, tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, neodymium, and scandium may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0185">The conductive layer may also be formed using a conductive metal oxide. As the conductive metal oxide, indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), an indium oxide-tin oxide alloy (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SnO<sub>2</sub>, which is abbreviated to ITO in some cases), an indium oxide-zinc oxide alloy (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;ZnO), or any of these metal oxide materials in which silicon or silicon oxide is included can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0186">The conductive layer may have a single-layer structure or a stacked structure including two or more layers. For example, the conductive layer may have a single-layer structure of an aluminum film including silicon, a two-layer structure in which a titanium film is stacked over an aluminum film, or a three-layer structure in which a titanium film, an aluminum film, and a titanium film are stacked in this order. Here, the conductive layer is formed using a material including titanium and then processed into the gate electrode layer <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0187">Next, the interlayer insulating layer <b>116</b> and the interlayer insulating layer <b>118</b> are formed over the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> and the gate electrode layer <b>114</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref>). The interlayer insulating layers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> can be formed by a PVD method, a CVD method, or the like. The interlayer insulating layers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> can be formed using a material including an inorganic insulating material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride oxide, silicon nitride, hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, or tantalum oxide. Note that a stacked structure of the interlayer insulating layers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> is used in this embodiment, but an embodiment of the disclosed invention is not limited to this example. A single-layer structure or a stacked structure including three or more layers can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0188">Note that the interlayer insulating layer <b>118</b> is desirably formed so as to have a flat surface. This is because an electrode, a wiring, or the like can be favorably formed over the interlayer insulating layer <b>118</b> when the interlayer insulating layer <b>118</b> is formed so as to have a flat surface.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0189">Through the above steps, the transistor <b>150</b> having the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>including the crystalline region <b>110</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0190">By the method described in this embodiment, the crystalline region <b>110</b> can be formed in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>; accordingly, a semiconductor device having favorable electrical characteristics can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0191">By the method described in this embodiment, the hydrogen concentration of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>is 5&#xd7;10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less and the off-state current of the transistor is 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>A or less which is the measurement limit.

<p id="p-0193" num="0194">The transistor <b>150</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> includes the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>having a depression portion (a groove portion). Note that the depression portion is formed by etching at the time of forming the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the depression portion is formed in a region overlapping with the gate electrode layer <b>114</b>. The depression portion can reduce the thickness of the semiconductor layer in the channel formation region, thereby contributing to the prevention of a short-channel effect.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0195">The transistor <b>150</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> includes an insulating layer <b>109</b><i>a </i>and an insulating layer <b>109</b><i>b </i>which have substantially the same shape as the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>, over the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>. In this case, there is an advantage in that capacitance between the source or drain electrode layers and the gate electrode layer (so-called gate capacitance) can be reduced. Note that the expression &#x201c;substantially the same&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially same&#x201d; does not necessarily mean being exactly the same in a strict sense and can mean being considered as the same.

<p id="p-0195" num="0196">The transistor <b>150</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref> includes the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>having a depression portion (a groove portion) and also includes an insulating layer <b>109</b><i>a </i>and an insulating layer <b>109</b><i>b </i>which have substantially the same shape as the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>, over the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>.

In other words, the transistor <b>150</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> or <b>17</b>B includes a gate electrode layer <b>101</b><i>a </i>over a substrate <b>100</b>, an insulating layer <b>102</b> covering the gate electrode layer <b>101</b><i>a</i>, an oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>over the insulating layer <b>102</b>, a crystalline region <b>110</b> in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>, a source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and a source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b </i>electrically connected to the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>, a gate insulating layer <b>112</b> covering the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>, the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a</i>, and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>, and a gate electrode layer <b>114</b> over the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>). Here, the insulating layer <b>102</b> also functions as a gate insulating layer. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> illustrates the case where the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b </i>have a stacked structure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> illustrates the case where the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b </i>have a single-layer structure.

<p id="p-0214" num="0215">In a manner similar to the structures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>includes the crystalline region <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0215" num="0216">In addition, an interlayer insulating layer <b>116</b> and an interlayer insulating layer <b>118</b> are provided over the transistor <b>150</b>.

<p id="p-0216" num="0217">The details of each component are omitted here, for which the above embodiment can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0218">As in the structures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, with the use of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>which is purified and includes the crystalline region <b>110</b>, a semiconductor device having favorable electrical characteristics can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0219">In addition, the crystalline region <b>110</b> is stable as compared to the other region in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>, and thus can prevent entry of an impurity (e.g., moisture or the like) into the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="h-0019" num="0000">&#x3c;Manufacturing Method of Semiconductor Device&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0221">Next, a manufacturing method of the transistor <b>150</b> which is an example of a structure of a semiconductor device will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A to 19C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A to 20D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0222">First, a conductive layer <b>101</b> is formed over the substrate <b>100</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>). The details of the substrate <b>100</b> are omitted here, for which the above embodiment can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0223">The conductive layer <b>101</b> can be formed by a PVD method such as a sputtering method, or a CVD method such as a plasma CVD method. The conductive layer <b>101</b> can be formed using an element selected from aluminum, chromium, copper, tantalum, titanium, molybdenum, and tungsten, an alloy including any of these elements as a component, or the like. A material including one or more of manganese, magnesium, zirconium, and beryllium may be used. A material including aluminum and one or more elements selected from titanium, tantalum, tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, neodymium, and scandium may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0224">The conductive layer <b>101</b> may also be formed using a conductive metal oxide. As the conductive metal oxide, indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), an indium oxide-tin oxide alloy (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SnO<sub>2</sub>, which is abbreviated to ITO in some cases), an indium oxide-zinc oxide alloy (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;ZnO), or any of these metal oxide materials in which silicon or silicon oxide is included can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0225">The conductive layer <b>101</b> may have either a single-layer structure or a stacked structure including two or more layers. In an embodiment of the disclosed invention, since heat treatment at relatively high temperature is performed after formation of the conductive layer <b>101</b>, the conductive layer <b>101</b> is preferably formed using a material having high heat resistance. As the material having high heat resistance, titanium, tantalum, tungsten, molybdenum, or the like can be given, for example. Polysilicon whose conductivity is increased by addition of an impurity element or the like can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0226">Next, the conductive layer <b>101</b> is selectively etched; thus, the gate electrode layer <b>101</b><i>a </i>is formed. Then, the insulating layer <b>102</b> is formed to cover the gate electrode layer <b>101</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0227">For light exposure in forming a mask used for etching, ultraviolet light, KrF laser light, or ArF laser light is preferably used. Particularly for light exposure in the case where the channel length (L) is less than 25 nm, light exposure for forming a mask is preferably performed with extreme ultraviolet light whose wavelength is several nanometers to several tens of nanometers, which is extremely short. In light exposure using extreme ultraviolet light, resolution is high and depth of focus is large, which are suitable for miniaturization.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0228">The gate electrode layer <b>101</b><i>a </i>is a so-called back gate. With the gate electrode layer <b>101</b><i>a</i>, electric field in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be controlled, whereby electrical characteristics of the transistor <b>150</b> can be controlled. Note that the gate electrode layer <b>101</b><i>a </i>may be electrically connected to another wiring, electrode, or the like so that a potential is applied to the gate electrode layer <b>101</b><i>a</i>, or may be insulated so as to be in a floating state.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0229">Note that a &#x201c;gate electrode&#x201d; commonly means a gate electrode whose potential can be controlled intentionally; a &#x201c;gate electrode&#x201d; in this specification also means a gate electrode whose potential is not intentionally controlled. For example, the conductive layer which is insulated and in a floating state as described above is, in some cases, called a &#x201c;gate electrode layer.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0230">The insulating layer <b>102</b> functions as a base and also as a gate insulating layer. The insulating layer <b>102</b> can be formed by a CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like. The insulating layer <b>102</b> is preferably formed so as to include silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, tantalum oxide, or the like. Note that the insulating layer <b>102</b> may have a single-layer structure or a stacked structure. There is no particular limitation on the thickness of the insulating layer <b>102</b>; the insulating layer <b>102</b> can have a thickness of 10 nm to 500 nm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0231">If hydrogen, water, or the like is contained in the insulating layer <b>102</b>, hydrogen may enter the oxide semiconductor layer or extract oxygen from the oxide semiconductor layer, whereby characteristics of the transistor may be degraded. Therefore, it is desirable to form the insulating layer <b>102</b> so as to include as little hydrogen or water as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0232">In the case of using a sputtering method or the like, for example, it is desirable that the insulating layer <b>102</b> be formed in a state where moisture remaining in the treatment chamber is removed. In order to remove moisture remaining in the treatment chamber, an entrapment vacuum pump such as a cryopump, an ion pump, or a titanium sublimation pump is preferably used. A turbo pump provided with a cold trap may be used. From the treatment chamber evacuated with a cryopump or the like, hydrogen, water, or the like is sufficiently removed; thus, the concentration of an impurity in the insulating layer <b>102</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0233">When the insulating layer <b>102</b> is formed, it is desirable to use a high-purity gas in which an impurity such as hydrogen or water is reduced to a concentration of approximately several parts per million (preferably several parts per billion).</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0234">Note that the insulating layer <b>102</b> needs to have high quality in a manner similar to the gate insulating layer <b>112</b>. Therefore, the insulating layer <b>102</b> is preferably formed by a method that can be employed for the gate insulating layer <b>112</b>. The details are omitted here, for which the above embodiment can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0235">Next, an oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is formed over the insulating layer <b>102</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>). For also the details of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b>, the above embodiment can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0236">Next, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is processed by a method such as etching using a mask; thus, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>having an island shape is formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>). Here, it needs to be noted that the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>is formed in the region overlapping with the gate electrode layer <b>101</b><i>a</i>. For the details, the above embodiment can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0237">After that, heat treatment (first heat treatment) is preferably performed on the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>. Water (including a hydroxyl group), hydrogen, or the like contained in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be removed by the first heat treatment. For example, the temperature of the first heat treatment can be set higher than or equal to 300&#xb0; C. and lower than 550&#xb0; C., preferably higher than or equal to 400&#xb0; C. and lower than 550&#xb0; C. Note that the first heat treatment may double as second heat treatment (heat treatment for forming a crystalline region) to be performed later. In that case, the temperature of the heat treatment is preferably set higher than or equal to 550&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 850&#xb0; C. The details of the heat treatment are omitted here, for which the above embodiment can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0238">Next, a conductive layer <b>108</b> is formed so as to be in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>). Then, the conductive layer <b>108</b> is selectively etched; thus, the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b </i>are formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>). For the details of the conductive layer <b>108</b>, the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a</i>, the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>, the etching step, and the like, the above embodiment can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0239">Next, heat treatment (second heat treatment) is performed on the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>. By the second heat treatment, the crystalline region <b>110</b> is formed in a region including the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>). Note that the range of the crystalline region <b>110</b> varies depending on the material of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>, the conditions of the heat treatment, and the like. For example, the crystalline region <b>110</b> can be formed to the lower interface of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>. For the details of the second heat treatment and the like, the above embodiment can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0240">Next, the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> is formed in contact with part of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>without exposure to the air (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>). After that, the gate electrode layer <b>114</b> is formed over the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> in a region overlapping with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>(particularly in a region overlapping with the crystalline region <b>110</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref>). Then, the interlayer insulating layer <b>116</b> and the interlayer insulating layer <b>118</b> are formed over the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> and the gate electrode layer <b>114</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref>). For the details of the above steps, the above embodiment can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0241">By the method described in this embodiment, the crystalline region <b>110</b> can be formed in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>; accordingly, a semiconductor device having favorable electrical characteristics can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0242">By the method described in this embodiment, the hydrogen concentration of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>is 5&#xd7;10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less and the off-state current of the transistor is 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>A or less which is the measurement limit.

<p id="p-0244" num="0245">Next, modified examples of the semiconductor devices illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A to 19C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A to 20D</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A to 21C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A to 22C</figref>. Note that many components of the semiconductor devices illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A to 21C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A to 22C</figref> are similar to those of the semiconductor devices illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A to 19C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A to 20D</figref>; therefore, only different points will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0246">The transistor <b>150</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> includes the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>having a depression portion (a groove portion). Note that the depression portion is formed by etching at the time of forming the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the depression portion is formed in a region overlapping with the gate electrode layer <b>114</b>. The depression portion can reduce the thickness of the semiconductor layer in the channel formation region, thereby contributing to the prevention of a short-channel effect.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0247">The transistor <b>150</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref> includes an insulating layer <b>109</b><i>a </i>and an insulating layer <b>109</b><i>b </i>which have substantially the same shape as the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>, over the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>. In this case, there is an advantage in that capacitance between the source or drain electrode layers and the gate electrode layer (so-called gate capacitance) can be reduced. Note that the expression &#x201c;substantially the same&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially same&#x201d; does not necessarily mean being exactly the same in a strict sense and can mean being considered as the same.

<p id="p-0247" num="0248">The transistor <b>150</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref> includes the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a </i>having a depression portion (a groove portion) and also includes an insulating layer <b>109</b><i>a </i>and an insulating layer <b>109</b><i>b </i>which have substantially the same shape as the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>, over the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b</i>.

The effects resulting from the structure are similar to the effects obtained in the cases of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0249">The transistor <b>150</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> includes a conductive layer <b>107</b><i>a </i>and a conductive layer <b>107</b><i>b </i>formed of a material having a low ability to extract oxygen (a material having low oxygen affinity, such as titanium nitride, tungsten nitride, or platinum) in a region where the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b </i>are in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>106</b><i>a</i>. With the conductive layers having a low ability to extract oxygen as described above, a change to an n-type due to extraction of oxygen can be prevented; accordingly, an adverse effect on transistor characteristics caused by an uneven change to an n-type or the like can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0250">Note that the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the source or drain electrode layer <b>108</b><i>b </i>having a two-layer structure are employed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>; however, an embodiment of the disclosed invention is not limited to this structure. They may have a single-layer structure of a conductive layer formed of a material having a low ability to extract oxygen or a stacked structure including three or more layers.
