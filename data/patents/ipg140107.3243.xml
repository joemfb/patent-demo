<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a solid-state imaging device, a method for manufacturing a solid-state imaging device, and an electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electronic devices such as a digital video camera and a digital still camera include a solid-state imaging device. Such electronic devices include a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) type image sensor or a charge coupled device (CCD) type image sensor, for example, as the solid-state imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a solid-state imaging device, a plurality of pixels are arranged in matrix on an imaging surface of a semiconductor substrate. Each of the plurality of pixels is provided with a photoelectric conversion portion. A photodiode, for example, is provided as the photoelectric conversion portion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Among solid-state imaging devices, a CMOS type image sensor has a pixel which is provided with a semiconductor element such as a pixel transistor as well as the photoelectric conversion portion. As the pixel transistor, a plurality of transistors are provided to read out a signal charge produced by the photoelectric conversion portion and output the signal charge as an electric signal to a signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a solid-state imaging device, the photoelectric conversion portion receives light which is incident through an optical component such as a color filter, at a light receiving surface and photoelectrically converts the light so as to produce a signal charge.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, when color filters of three primary colors of red, green, and blue are arranged along an imaging surface in a manner to correspond to each pixel, the photoelectric conversion portion receives colored light which is colored by each of the color filters of the respective colors, in each pixel. That is, focusing on a pixel above which a red color filter is provided, the red color filter absorbs light of green and blue components in light which is incident as an object image and transmits only light of a red component therethrough, and the photoelectric conversion portion receives the transmitted light of the red component below the red color filter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The solid-state imaging device is demanded to be small-sized, and at the same time, to have increased number of pixels. Accordingly, a size of one pixel is made smaller, so that the pixel has more difficulty in receiving sufficient amount of light. Thus, it is not easy to improve image quality of a picked-up image.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to eliminate such defect, a &#x201c;stacked photoelectric conversion layer type&#x201d; is proposed. In the &#x201c;stacked photoelectric conversion layer type&#x201d;, photoelectric conversion portions of respective colors are not arranged in a direction along an imaging surface, but the photoelectric conversion portions which selectively receive light of respective colors are layered in a vertical direction with respect to the imaging surface. For example, three layers of photoelectric conversion films made of an organic material are stacked so as to sequentially receive light of each of the three primary colors included in incident light (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-335626, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2005-347356, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2005-353626, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2003-234460, and &#x201c;CMOS Image Sensor with Stacked Organic Photoelectric Conversion Layers&#x201d; by M. IHAMA et al., FUJIFILM RESEARCH &#x26; DEVELOPMENT (No. 52-2007), p. 3-6, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the &#x201c;stacked photoelectric conversion layer type&#x201d;, part of incident light is absorbed at a photoelectric conversion film which is provided at an upper side and is photoelectrically converted. Then, other part of the light which is not absorbed at the photoelectric conversion film provided at the upper side is absorbed by another photoelectric conversion film positioned below the above-mentioned film and is photoelectrically converted. For example, an uppermost photoelectric conversion film absorbs blue color light, an intermediate photoelectric conversion film absorbs green color light, and a lowermost photoelectric conversion film absorbs red color light. Then, photoelectric conversion is performed in each of the photoelectric conversion films so as to produce a signal charge.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, in the &#x201c;stacked photoelectric conversion layer type&#x201d;, not merely colored light of a single color but colored light of a plurality of colors is received at each pixel position. Accordingly, light utilization efficiency can be improved, whereby small-sizing can be easily realized. Specifically, a solid-state imaging device of the &#x201c;stacked photoelectric conversion layer type&#x201d; has light utilization efficiency of three times as much as a case where color filters of the three primary colors of red, green, and blue are arranged along an imaging surface, so that an area per pixel can be reduced to be one-third.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a CMOS type image sensor of the &#x201c;stacked photoelectric conversion layer type&#x201d;, semiconductor elements such as a transistor are formed in an integrated manner on a surface of a substrate so as to read out a signal charge produced in photoelectric conversion films which receive respective colored light.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, transistors for a plurality of colors (for example, three primary colors) are formed to be arranged on the surface of the substrate, increasing an area occupied by these transistors. Accordingly, it may be difficult to realize small-sizing.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to eliminate such defect, it is proposed to provide a readout circuit for reading out an electric charge immediately beneath a photoelectric conversion film of each color without providing transistors for a plurality of colors in an integrated manner on a surface of a substrate (refer to &#x201c;The latest trend in CMOS image sensors&#x201d; by J. OHTA et al., CMC Publishing Co., Ltd, April 2007, p. 119, for example).</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In each of the photoelectric conversion portions <b>201</b>RJ, <b>201</b>GJ, and <b>201</b>BJ, a voltage is applied between the pixel electrode (<b>211</b>GJ, for example) and the common electrode (<b>212</b>GJ, for example) and a signal charge is read out from each of the photoelectric conversion films (<b>210</b>GJ, for example) to each of the readout circuit portions (<b>202</b>GJ, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described above, in each of the photoelectric conversion portions (<b>201</b>GJ, for example), a voltage is applied to each of the photoelectric conversion films (<b>210</b>GJ, for example) between the pixel electrode (<b>211</b>GJ, for example) and the common electrode (<b>212</b>GJ, for example). That is, each of the photoelectric conversion films (<b>210</b>GJ, for example) turns to be in such a state that a reverse bias voltage is applied to a so-called pn-junction photodiode. Therefore, the voltage applied to the photoelectric conversion film (<b>210</b>GJ, for example) may adversely affect the TFT (<b>220</b>GJ, for example). Namely, a voltage applied to each of the organic photoelectric conversion layers (<b>210</b>GJ, for example) may produce a state same as the state that a voltage is applied to a gate of the TFT (<b>220</b>GJ, for example), causing a defect such as deterioration of image quality of a picked-up image.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In order to eliminate the above defect, it can be considered to distance the organic photoelectric conversion layer for sensing green light <b>210</b>GJ away from the TFT <b>220</b>GJ by thickening a film thickness of the interlayer insulation film SZ<b>2</b>G. However, the whole thickness is increased in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Therefore, light incident from an upper layer side may not be received by an organic photoelectric conversion layer of the desired pixel but may be received by an organic photoelectric conversion layer of an adjacent pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, light of a blue component included in incident light incident on a pixel is precisely received by the blue photoelectric conversion portion <b>201</b>BJ which is the uppermost layer. However, since the green photoelectric conversion portion <b>201</b>GJ and the red photoelectric conversion portion <b>201</b>RJ are disposed at a lower layer side, light of a green component or a red component may not be received by a pixel on which the light is incident but may be received by an adjacent pixel. Since the red photoelectric conversion portion <b>201</b>RJ is provided at the lowermost layer in the above case, this phenomenon notably occurs in a case of the light of the red component. With this phenomenon, a defect such as deterioration of image quality of a picked-up image may occur.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0123">In the solid-state imaging device <b>1</b> of the &#x201c;stacked photoelectric conversion layer type&#x201d; described above, when incident light is incident on each of the pixels P, a signal charge is sequentially produced in each of the photoelectric conversion portions <b>201</b>R, <b>201</b>G, and <b>201</b>B (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0124">The blue photoelectric conversion portion <b>201</b>B produces a signal charge corresponding to an amount of light of a blue component included in the incident light.

The red photoelectric conversion portion <b>201</b>R produces a signal charge corresponding to an amount of light of a red component included in the incident light.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0125">In each of the photoelectric conversion portions <b>201</b>R, <b>201</b>G, and <b>201</b>B, a voltage is applied between the pixel electrode (<b>211</b>G, for example) and the common electrode (<b>212</b>G, for example), and a signal charge is read out from each of the organic photoelectric conversion layers (<b>210</b>R, for example) to each of the readout circuit portions (<b>202</b>R, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0126">A detailed operation of reading out a signal charge which is produced in the green photoelectric conversion portion <b>201</b>G is described (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>

Then, a signal charge produced in the organic photoelectric conversion layer for sensing green light <b>210</b>G is read out by the green readout circuit portion <b>202</b>G through the contact CT.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0128">As described above, the voltage applied to the organic photoelectric conversion layer for sensing green light <b>210</b>G may produce such a state which is equal to the state that a voltage is applied to a gate of the TFT such as the reset transistor <b>22</b>, causing a defect such as deterioration of image quality of a picked-up image.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0134">Therefore, in the embodiment, the ground electrode (<b>230</b>G, for example) can prevent an occurrence of the state that unnecessary voltage other than a gate voltage is applied to the channel forming region of the TFT constituting each of the readout circuit portions <b>202</b>R, <b>202</b>G, and <b>202</b>B, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0135">Accordingly, the solid-state imaging device <b>1</b> according to the embodiment can suppress an influence of an external voltage on the readout circuit, so that an interlayer insulation film is not demanded to be formed thick. Consequently, color deviation can be suppressed and a stable operation can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0136">In addition, in the embodiment, the readout circuit <b>20</b> (the reset transistor <b>22</b>, for example) is formed to transmit light therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0137">Therefore, an amount of light incident on each of the photoelectric conversion portions <b>201</b>R, <b>201</b>G, and <b>201</b>B can be increased in the embodiment. Further, a degree of freedom of the layout of the readout circuit <b>20</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0138">Accordingly, advantageous effects such as improvement of image quality of a picked-up image can be offered in the embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0141">It is preferable that the film thickness of the interlayer insulation film SZ<b>3</b>G (dielectric film) be about 50 nm to about 200 nm, for example. Accordingly, the capacitor can accumulate signal charges produced in the photoelectric conversion film.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0142">Further, the semiconductor element constituting the readout circuit <b>20</b> is the TFT of the bottom-gate structure in the above embodiment, but the semiconductor element is not limited to this.
