<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-250153 filed on Nov. 8, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a packing container for packing an optical probe and a method of packing an optical probe, and also relates to a laser system and a checking method which use such a packing container.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, applications and researches of insertion into a blood vessel of an optical probe having a beam outgoing section at the tip thereof have come to be made. Since the optical probe is inserted into a blood vessel, its cleanliness (sanitariness) should be extremely higher than in the other uses in the past. It is also important to control the output intensity of a laser beam let go out from a beam outgoing section of the optical probe.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In use of such an optical probe, a beam incoming section of the optical probe is attached to a beam output port of a laser system, and the tip of the optical probe is inserted into a blood vessel. The laser system is provided with an optical power meter for measuring the output intensity of the laser beam outputted from the beam outgoing section of the optical probe. Before use, the operator bring the beam outgoing section of the optical probe close to the optical power meter, and checks the output intensity of the laser beam outputted from the beam outgoing section of the optical probe.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since the optical power meter is not sterilized, it is strictly undesirable to bring the beam outgoing section of the optical probe into proximity to or contact with the optical power meter. In view of this, normally, the beam outgoing section of the optical probe is inserted in an applicator having undergone a sterilizing treatment, and is mounted to the optical power meter of the laser system through the applicator.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The beam outgoing section of the optical probe may be brought into proximity to or contact with a filthy region of the laser system due to an operator's misoperation or the like. In addition, the applicator should be sterilized each time it is put to use, which worsens workability.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, it is desirable to provide a packing container, a method of packing an optical probe, a laser system, and a checking method by which the output intensity of a laser beam can be checked while securing cleanliness (hygiene) and without spoiling workability.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A packing container according to an embodiment of the present technology has a packing container body and a light-transmitting member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The packing container body includes a leading-out section which contains an optical probe having a first end section for incoming of a laser beam and a second end section for outgoing of the incoming laser beam, which leads out the first end section of the optical probe thus contained to the exterior and which is sealed, and a window section by which the laser beam going out from the second end section of the contained optical probe is led out to the exterior. The packing container body is preferably has air-tightness in such an extent that the cleanliness (sanitariness) of the sterilized optical probe can be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The light-transmitting member is for closing the window section therewith, and has a member which permits the laser light to pass therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this configuration, the laser beam let go out from the second end section is led to the exterior through the window section closed with the light-transmitting member. Therefore, during measurement of the laser beam, the second end section is prevented from being brought into proximity to or contact with the laser system or the like which constitutes a filthy region. In addition, the need for an applicator or the like is eliminated. Accordingly, the checking of the output intensity of the laser beam can be carried out while securing cleanliness reliably and without spoiling workability.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a packing container according to an embodiment of the present technology, the packing container body includes an optical probe containing box which has an open side and which is provided with the leading-out section and the window section, and a film member which closes the open side.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this configuration, the optical probe can be contained into the containing box through the open side, and the open side can be closed with the film member. Therefore, the optical probe can be easily contained into the packing container, and can be easily taken out of the packing container by breaking the film member. In addition, the form of the containing box ensures that at the time of secondary packing, a multiplicity of the packing containers can be stackedly contained into a corrugated fiberboard box or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a packing container according to an embodiment of the present technology, the optical probe containing box has a first surface provided with a positioning section for positioning of both the window section and an optical power meter of a laser system to which the window section and the packing container are mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this configuration, the window section is provided at the same surface as that for the positioning section for positioning in relation to the optical power meter of the laser system to which the packing container is mounted. Therefore, on the laser system side, also, the optical power meter can be set on the same surface on which the positioning section is disposed. Accordingly, checking of the output intensity of the laser beam and the like can be carried out with the components in a stably held state. Moreover, the configuration on the laser system side can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a packing container according to an embodiment of the present technology, the optical probe containing box has a second surface which is opposed to the first surface and which is provided with the leading-out section at a position corresponding to the window section.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this configuration, the window section and the leading-out section are provided on the opposed surfaces and at the corresponding positions. Therefore, the optical probe can be contained in the packing container in such a manner that when the optical probe is contained in the packing container in a looped state, the optical probe is prevented from being crooked, and that when the packing container is mounted to the laser system, the first end section led out through the leading-out section does not interfere with the laser system.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a method of packing an optical probe according to an embodiment of the present technology, the optical probe is contained in a containing box which has an open side, a leading-out section, and a window section closed with a light-transmitting member permitting the laser beam to pass therethrough. In this instance, the optical probe having a first end section for incoming of a laser beam and a second end section for outgoing of the incoming laser beam is contained in the containing box in such a manner that the first end section is led out to the exterior through the leading-out section and that the second end section is opposed to the window section with a predetermined spacing therebetween. Next, the leading-out section is sealed with a sealing material, and the open side is closed with the film member.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this configuration, the laser beam let go out from the second end section is led out to the exterior through the window section closed with the light-transmitting member. Therefore, at the time of checking the output intensity of the laser beam, the second end section is prevented from being brought into proximity to or contact with the laser system or the like which constitutes a filthy region. Accordingly, there is no need for an interface member such as an applicator. Consequently, the output intensity of the laser beam can be checked while securing cleanliness in an assured manner and without worsening workability.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A laser system according to an embodiment of the present technology includes a casing, an optical power meter, a positioning engaging section, and a checking unit.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The optical power meter is mounted to the casing, and receives the laser beam coming therein from a beam outgoing section of an optical probe kept contained in a packing container.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The positioning engaging section is provided on the casing at a position corresponding to a container-side engaging section provided on the packing container, in such a manner as to engage with the container-side engaging section, and determines the positional relationship between the beam outgoing section and the optical power meter.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The checking unit checks the output intensity of the laser beam coming in through the optical power meter.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this configuration, when the container-side engaging section provided on the packing container is engaged with the positioning engaging section provided on the laser system, the beam outgoing section is positioned in a proper position in relation to the optical power meter. Therefore, the packing container can be fixed relative to the laser system as designed, independently of whether the operator is skilled or not. This ensures that checking of the output intensity of the laser beam can be carried out stably, independently of whether the operator is skilled or not.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a checking method according to an embodiment of the present technology, a container-side engaging section provided on a packing container is put into engagement with a positioning engaging section provided on a laser system. Next, a laser beam coming from a beam outgoing section of an optical probe contained in the packing container is let in through an optical power meter of the laser system, the optical power meter being determined in positional relationship with the beam outgoing section of the optical probe by the engagement. Then, the output intensity of the laser beam coming in through the optical power meter is checked.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">This ensures that the packing container can be fixed to the laser system as designed, independently of whether the operator is skilled or not. Consequently, the output intensity of the laser beam can be checked stably, independently of whether the operator is skilled or not.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the above-mentioned configurations, the laser beam let go out from the second end section through the window section closed with the light-transmitting member is led out to the exterior. Therefore, the checking of the output intensity of the laser beam can be carried out while securing cleanliness (sanitariness) in a reliable manner and without spoiling workability.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Embodiments of the present application will be described below in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref> illustrate the configuration of a packing container for an optical probe according to an embodiment of the present technology.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A packing container <b>1</b> shown in these figures includes a packing container body <b>10</b> and a light-transmitting member <b>30</b>. An optical probe <b>40</b> to be contained in the packing container <b>1</b> has an optical probe body <b>41</b> having an optical fiber. The optical probe body <b>41</b> is provided, respectively at both ends thereof, with a beam incoming section <b>42</b> through which a laser beam is let come in and a beam outgoing section <b>43</b> through which the laser beam let come in via the beam incoming section <b>42</b> is let go out.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The packing container body <b>10</b> includes an optical probe containing box <b>11</b> and a film member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The optical probe is, for example, an optical probe inserted in an endoscope or a catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The optical probe containing box <b>11</b> is formed, for example, from a material selected from among COC (cyclic olefin copolymer), PC (polycarbonate), (HD)PE ((high-density) polyethylene), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PS (polystyrene), etc., is, for example, rectangular in shape, and has an open side <b>13</b> on the upper side. The optical probe <b>40</b> is contained in the optical probe containing box <b>11</b> in the state of being looped in several turns. A first side surface <b>14</b> of the optical probe containing box <b>11</b> is provided with a leading-out section <b>15</b> through which the beam incoming section <b>42</b> of the optical probe <b>40</b> in a contained state is led out from the packing container <b>1</b> to the exterior, together with a part of the optical probe body <b>41</b>. The leading-out section <b>15</b> is composed, for example, of a U-shaped notch formed from the upper end of the first side surface <b>14</b>. The leading-out section <b>15</b> is provided at a position near one end of the first side surface <b>14</b>. It suffices for the size of the leading-out section <b>15</b> to be, for example, slightly greater than the diameter of the optical probe body <b>41</b>. After the beam incoming section <b>42</b> is led out from the packing container <b>1</b> to the exterior, the leading-out section <b>15</b> is sealed with a sealing material <b>16</b> composed, for example, of a UV-curing resin. The sealing may be conducted before or after the film member <b>12</b> is attached to the optical probe containing box <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A second side surface <b>17</b>, opposed to the first side surface <b>14</b>, of the optical probe containing box <b>11</b> is provided with a window section <b>18</b> and a positioning section <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The window section <b>18</b> is composed, for example, of a circular hole bored in the second side surface <b>17</b>. The window section <b>18</b> is provided at a position (a position near one end of the second side surface <b>17</b>) corresponding to the position of the leading-out section <b>15</b> provided in the first side surface <b>14</b>. It suffices for the window section <b>18</b> to be so sized to ensure at least that the laser beam going out from the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> of the optical probe <b>40</b> contained in the packing container <b>1</b> can pass through the window section <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The positioning section <b>19</b> is for positioning in relation to an optical power meter (described later) of a laser system to which the packing container <b>1</b> is mounted. The positioning section <b>19</b> has recesses <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>b </i>provided respectively on both sides of the window section <b>18</b>. Thus, the window section <b>18</b> is provided in the same surface as that in which the positioning section <b>19</b> is provided. The recesses <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>b </i>are engaged with positioning projections (described later) provided in the laser system. When the recesses <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>b </i>are engaged with the projections, the window section <b>18</b> is positioned in a proper position in relation to the optical power meter of the laser system.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The film member <b>12</b>, for closing the open side <b>13</b>, is formed from (LD)PE ((low-density) polyethylene), PC (polycarbonate), PET (polyethylene terephthalate) or the like which is thin and substantially transparent. The film member <b>12</b> is attached to the optical probe containing box <b>11</b> by fusing or by use of an adhesive. It suffices that the closure of the open side <b>13</b> with the film member <b>12</b> and the sealing of the leading-out section <b>15</b> with the sealing material <b>16</b> offer air-tightness in such an extent that the cleanliness (sterility) of the optical probe <b>40</b> contained in the packing container <b>1</b> can be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The light-transmitting member <b>30</b>, for closing the window section <b>18</b>, has a member permitting the laser beam to be pass therethrough. The light-transmitting member <b>30</b> is a flat plate-shaped member which is formed, for example, of COC (cyclic olefin copolymer), PC (polycarbonate), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PS (polystyrene) or the like, and is adhered to the optical probe containing box <b>11</b> by use of an adhesive, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Incidentally, a protective film of ETFE (tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene copolymer) or the like may be provided on the outside surface of the light-transmitting member <b>30</b>, whereby marring of the light-transmitting member <b>30</b> due to friction with a secondary packing material (described later) can be prevented from occurring. Upon unsealing the secondary packing material, the ETFE film adhered to the window member is peeled off. For preventing the user from forgetting to peel off the ETFE film, it is recommendable that a part of the ETFE film adhered to the light-transmitting member <b>30</b> be bonded to the secondary packing material. In this case, simultaneously with unsealing of the secondary packing, the ETFE film is peeled off from the light-transmitting member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an enlarged plan view of the light-transmitting member <b>30</b> and the surroundings thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The beam outgoing section <b>43</b> of the optical probe <b>40</b> contained in the packing container <b>1</b> should be kept accurate in distance and angle in relation to the light-transmitting member <b>30</b> (the window section <b>18</b>) (parallelism between the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> and the light-transmitting member <b>30</b>). For ensuring this, therefore, for example, a floor surface <b>20</b> of the optical probe containing box <b>11</b> is provided with positioning grooves <b>21</b> and with a fixing section <b>22</b> for fixing that portion of the optical probe body <b>41</b> which is near the beam outgoing section <b>43</b>. The fixing section <b>22</b> has, for example, a pair of projected sections <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>projected from the floor surface <b>20</b>. The spacing between the projected sections <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>is so set that the optical probe body <b>41</b> can be clamped between the projected sections <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The operator in charge of the packing with the packing container <b>1</b> positions the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> while relying on the positioning grooves <b>21</b>, fixes the optical probe body <b>41</b> to the fixing section <b>22</b>, and, further, fix the portions of the optical probe body <b>41</b> which are near the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> to the floor surface <b>20</b> of the optical probe containing box <b>11</b> by use of tape <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an exemplary case, the diameter R<sub>1 </sub>of the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> is 100 to 800 &#x3bc;m, the diameter R<sub>2 </sub>of the window section <b>18</b> is 10 to 20 mm, the thickness t of the light-transmitting member <b>30</b> is 1 to 5 mm, and the distance L between the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> and the light-transmitting member <b>30</b> is 1 to 5 mm.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Method of Packing Optical Probe)</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Now, a method by which the optical probe <b>40</b> is packed in the packing container <b>1</b> configured as above will be described below, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">First, the operator subject the optical probe <b>40</b> to a predetermined sterilizing treatment (step S<b>71</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, the operator contains the optical probe <b>40</b> into the optical probe containing box <b>11</b> already equipped with the light-transmitting member <b>30</b> (step S<b>72</b>). In this instance, the operator leads out the beam incoming section <b>42</b> to the exterior through the leading-out section <b>15</b>. In addition, as above-mentioned, the operator positions the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> while relying on the positioning grooves <b>21</b>, then fixes the optical probe body <b>41</b> to the fixing section <b>22</b>, and fixes the portions near the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> of the optical probe body <b>41</b> to the floor surface <b>20</b> of the optical probe containing box <b>11</b> by the tape <b>23</b> (step S<b>73</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Subsequently, the operator closes the leading-out section <b>15</b> by coating it with the sealing material <b>16</b> composed of a UV-curing resin, and cures the sealing material <b>16</b> by irradiation with UV rays, thereby to seal the leading-out section <b>15</b> (step S<b>74</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, the operator covers the open side <b>13</b> with the film member <b>12</b>, and attaches the film member <b>12</b> to the optical probe containing box <b>11</b> by fusing, whereby the open side <b>13</b> is closed with the film member <b>12</b> (step S<b>75</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">By these operations, the optical probe <b>40</b> is contained and packed in the packing container <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Subsequently, the operator put the packing container <b>1</b> to secondary packing (step S<b>76</b>). This is a process in which, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the packing container <b>1</b> is put into a bag <b>51</b> formed from thin film-shaped sheets, and the bag <b>51</b> is sealed off by putting an unsealing portion by thermocompression bonding or the like, whereby secondary packing is completed. As a material for the bag <b>51</b> formed from thin film-shaped sheets, a multi-layer film having PET (polyethylene terephthalate) as a base material can be used. Incidentally, as a method of sterilization for shipment, radiation sterilization is mainly used. Therefore, it is desirable that both the primary and secondary packing materials be high in radiation resistance. From this point of view, use of PP (polypropylene) or PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is not much desirable, in consideration of generation of gas (chlorine).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A multiplicity of the packing containers <b>1</b> having undergone secondary packing in the above-mentioned manner are, for example, stackedly contained in a corrugated fiberboard box (step S<b>77</b>). The multiplicity of the packing containers <b>1</b> contained in the corrugated fiberboard box are subjected to radiation sterilization or electron-beam sterilizing treatment, whereby sterilization of the inside and the outside of the packing containers <b>1</b> and sterilization of the inside of the secondary packing (bag <b>51</b>) can be secured (step S<b>78</b>).</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Check of Output Intensity of Laser Beam)</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a state in which the packing container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> is mounted to the laser system.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the laser system <b>60</b> has a casing <b>61</b>. The casing <b>61</b> is provided with a beam output port <b>62</b>, an optical power meter <b>63</b>, a positioning section <b>64</b>, and a checking unit <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The beam output port <b>62</b> is for outputting a laser beam. The beam incoming section <b>42</b> which permits the laser beam to come in therethrough and which is led out from the packing container <b>1</b> is connected to the beam output port <b>62</b>. The laser beam outputted from the beam output port <b>62</b> comes into the beam incoming section <b>42</b>, and is transmitted through the optical probe body <b>41</b>, to be let go out via the beam outgoing section <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The laser beam left go out from the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> of the optical probe <b>40</b> contained in the packing container <b>1</b> and transmitted through the window section <b>18</b> comes into the optical power meter <b>63</b>. The optical power meter <b>63</b> measures the output intensity of the laser beam which comes thereinto.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The positioning section <b>64</b> is provided, at that position of the casing <b>61</b> which corresponds to the positioning section <b>19</b> provided in the packing container <b>1</b>, with projections <b>64</b><i>a </i>and <b>64</b><i>b </i>for engagement with the recesses <b>19</b><i>a </i>and <b>19</b><i>b </i>provided at the positioning section <b>19</b>. By the engagement of the recesses <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>b </i>with the projections <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>b</i>, the positional relationship between the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> of the optical probe <b>40</b> and the optical power meter <b>63</b> is determined. In other words, when the recesses <b>19</b><i>a </i>and <b>19</b><i>b </i>are engaged with these projections <b>64</b><i>a </i>and <b>64</b><i>b</i>, the window section <b>18</b> of the packing container <b>1</b> is positioned in a proper position in relation to the optical power meter <b>63</b> of the laser system <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The checking unit <b>65</b> checks the output intensity of the laser beam coming in through the optical power meter <b>63</b>. For example, when the output intensity of the laser beam is not within a predetermined range, the checking unit <b>65</b> informs the operator of this situation by a sound or a display (indication), and stops the output of the laser beam from the beam output port <b>62</b>. Or, alternatively, the checking unit <b>65</b> may calibrate the output of the laser beam from the beam output port <b>62</b> so that the output of the laser beam is within a predetermined range.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the laser system <b>60</b> configured as above, the output intensity of the laser beam is checked in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">First, the operator connects the beam incoming section <b>42</b>, led out from the packing container <b>1</b>, to the beam output port <b>62</b> of the laser system <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, the operator puts the recesses <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>b </i>provided in the packing container <b>1</b> into engagement with the projections <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>b </i>provided in the laser system <b>60</b>. As a result, the window section <b>18</b> of the packing container <b>1</b> is positioned in a proper position in relation to the optical power meter <b>63</b> of the laser system <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Subsequently, a laser beam is outputted from the beam output port <b>62</b>, whereon the laser beam going out from the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> of the optical probe <b>40</b> contained in the packing container <b>1</b> comes into the optical power meter <b>63</b> of the laser system <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Then, the output intensity of the laser beam thus coming in via the optical power meter <b>63</b> is checked by the checking unit <b>65</b>. For example, when the output intensity of the laser beam is not within a predetermined range, the laser system <b>60</b> informs the operator of this situation by a sound or a display (indication).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(Operation and Effect of Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to the present embodiment, with the optical probe <b>40</b> kept contained in the packing container <b>1</b>, the laser beam from the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> can be let come into the optical power meter <b>63</b> of the laser system <b>60</b> through the window section <b>18</b> of the packing container <b>1</b>. In other words, owing to the presence of the window section <b>18</b> provided in the packing container <b>1</b>, checking of the output intensity of the laser beam can be conducted while keeping the sterility of the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> (while keeping the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> protected by the packing container <b>1</b>); thus, cleanliness (hygiene) can be secured in a reliable manner. In addition, the need for an interface member such as an applicator is eliminated, so that checking of the output intensity of the laser beam can be carried out without spoiling workability. Besides, since a tip portion of the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> is held in the packing container <b>1</b>, the tip portion can be prevented from being damaged during transportation.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to the present embodiment, when the recesses <b>19</b><i>a </i>and <b>19</b><i>b </i>of the packing container <b>1</b> are engaged with the projections <b>64</b><i>a </i>and <b>64</b><i>b </i>of the laser system <b>60</b>, the window section <b>18</b> is positioned in a proper position in relation to the optical power meter <b>63</b> of the laser system <b>60</b>; therefore, the packing container <b>1</b> can be fixed relative to the laser system <b>60</b> as designed, independently of whether the operator is skilled or not. Specifically, since the tip portion of the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> is held in the packing container <b>1</b>, when the packing container <b>1</b> is fixed onto the laser system <b>60</b> as above-mentioned, the packing container <b>1</b> can be disposed in the position as designed, so that checking of the output intensity of the laser beam can be carried out in a stable manner, independently of whether the operator is skilled or not.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a perspective view showing the configuration of a packing container according to a second embodiment of the present technology.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the packing container <b>100</b> according to the second embodiment differs from the packing container <b>1</b> of the first embodiment in that a window section <b>118</b> is provided at a tip face part of a projected section <b>122</b> projected from a second side surface <b>117</b>. Incidentally, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the other components are denoted by the reference symbols used for those (same components) in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the packing container <b>100</b> in the second embodiment, the window section <b>118</b> is provided at the tip face part of the projected section <b>122</b>, whereby the optical power meter of the laser system can be provided at a bottom part of a recessed section. This ensures that protection of the optical power meter and positioning between the window section and the optical power meter can be carried out more accurately.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the packing container <b>200</b> according to the third embodiment differs from the packing container <b>1</b> in the first embodiment in that a window section <b>218</b> is provided at a tip face part of a projected section <b>222</b> projected to the exterior from a floor surface <b>220</b>. In addition, the packing container <b>200</b> differs from the packing container <b>1</b> also in that the floor surface <b>220</b> is provided with a recessed section <b>219</b> (<b>219</b><i>a</i>, <b>219</b><i>b</i>). Incidentally, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the other components are denoted by the reference symbols used for those (same components) in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the packing container <b>200</b> in the third embodiment, the window section <b>218</b> is provided at the tip face part of the projected section <b>222</b> projected to the exterior from the floor surface <b>220</b>, whereby the packing container <b>200</b> can be made substantially smaller in projection area than the packing container <b>100</b> according to the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Incidentally, the present technology is not restricted to the above-described embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, as a light-transmitting member <b>330</b>, there may be used a convex lens by which the laser beam outputted to the exterior can be made to be parallel beam. When such a convex lens is used, the area of a light receiving surface of, for example, a photodetector on the optical power meter side can be reduced. In addition, the allowable range for misalignment between the window section and the optical power meter can be broadened.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Besides, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a wall <b>401</b> by which the region between an end face of the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> of the optical probe <b>40</b> and the window section <b>18</b> (the light-transmitting member <b>30</b>) is partitioned from the other region may be provided, and the region partitioned by the wall <b>401</b> may be filled with, for example, physiological saline <b>402</b>. With the physiological saline <b>402</b> intermediately provided between the end face of the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> of the optical probe <b>40</b> and the window section <b>18</b> (the light-transmitting member <b>30</b>), the end face of the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> of the optical probe <b>40</b> and the light-transmitting member <b>30</b> can be cooled. This makes it possible to reduce the loss of the laser beam at the end face of the beam outgoing section <b>43</b> of the optical probe <b>40</b> and the light-transmitting member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.</p>
